The plaintiff alleges that the negligence of Dr. Danny Chin and Massachusetts General Hospital caused him to become a quadriplegic. The jury, in answer to special questions, found the defendants negligent, and found the plaintiff thirteen per cent comparatively negligent. A judgment for $6,660,720, not including prejudgment interest, was entered against both defendants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendants argue that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of either negligence or causation, that improper arguments of plaintiff\u2019s counsel necessitated a new trial, that the judge erred in his application of the medical malpractice statute, G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60G (1988 ed.), and that the judge made other erroneous rulings. The plaintiff cross appeals, claiming that the evidence is insufficient to support a finding of thirteen per cent comparative negligence. We granted the defendants \u2019 application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">We conclude that the record contains sufficient evidence to support the jury award, and that the plaintiff\u2019s closing arguments, although improper, do not necessitate a new trial. We remand to the Superior Court, however, to enter a judgment against Massachusetts General Hospital limited by the statutory cap of $20,000, pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85K (1988 ed.), and to determine whether certain prejudgment benefits received by the plaintiff should be deducted from the award against Dr. Chin.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>In the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the jury could have found the following facts. On February 11, 1982, the plaintiff slipped and fell while working on an oil truck. He hit the back of his neck and his head on the seat. The plaintiff felt a sharp pain in his left leg, the back of his neck, and his trapezius area, and a sharp pain from his left shoulder down to his left hand. He felt tingling in the fingertips of his right hand. The pain did not go away by itself. On February 15, 1982, the plaintiff sought medical care at Chelsea Memorial Health Care Center, a unit of Massachusetts General Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">After speaking to a receptionist and a triage nurse, the plaintiff was examined by Dr. Chin. The plaintiff told Dr. Chin that he had hit the back of his neck, and that he was experiencing pain down his neck and upper back, and down his arm and into his hand, and that he felt tingling in the fingertips of his right hand. Dr. Chin spent from two to five minutes examining the plaintiff. Dr. Chin felt the back of the plaintiff\u2019s neck and tapped his elbows and kneecaps. The medical history Dr. Chin recorded during the examination consisted of \u201c[cjomplaints of pain, left trapezius, increased by turning head or lifting, exam.\u201d His examination was recorded as \u201c[ljeft trapezius tender and in spasm, left shoulder full range of motion, no tenderness, deep tendon reflexes, bi[c]eps equal to two plus bilaterally.\u201d Dr. Chin diagnosed the plaintiff as having a muscle spasm. Dr. Chin recommended no heavy lifting. He told the plaintiff to apply heat and take aspirin and Flexeril, a muscle relaxant that he prescribed. Dr. Chin failed to tell the plaintiff to return if the pain stayed the same or got worse.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">The plaintiff took the Flexeril for the next ten days. He stayed home from work for eighteen days because of the pain. On March 5, 1982, the pain became worse and entered the plaintiff\u2019s right leg for the first time. The plaintiff returned to the hospital and collapsed while getting onto an examination table. He was rushed to Massachusetts General Hospital, where it was determined that he had a herniated cervical disc at the C-4, C-5 level. The plaintiff underwent surgery, which was unsuccessful. The plaintiff is now quadriplegic and will be so for life.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>1. <em>Negligence. </em>\u201cTo entitle the plaintiff to go to the jury there must be sufficient evidence to warrant a finding (1) of negligence on the defendant\u2019s part, and (2) of a causal relationship between the negligence and the plaintiff\u2019s injuries.\u201d <em>Civitarese </em>v. <em>Gorney, </em>358 Mass. 652, 655 (1971). The defendants claim that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support a verdict either that the defendants were negligent, or that the actions of the defendants proximately caused the plaintiff\u2019s injuries. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">The test for determining whether the jury could have found that the defendants were negligent is whether the evidence, construed most favorably to the plaintiff, could not support a verdict for the plaintiff. <em>Poirier </em>v. <em>Plymouth, </em>374 Mass. 206, 212 (1978). We must determine whether anywhere in the evidence, from whatever source derived, can be found any combination of circumstances in favor of the plaintiff. <em>Raunela </em>v. <em>Hertz Corp., </em>361 Mass. 341, 343 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">The jury could have believed from the expert testimony that Dr. Chin, during his meeting with the plaintiff, deviated from good medical practice in the following ways. When faced with a patient complaining of the plaintiff\u2019s symptoms, Dr. Chin should have taken a more detailed medical history, inquiring about visual problems, sensory motor deficits, numbness, tingling, and whether the pain radiated. Dr. Chin should have conducted a more extensive neurological examination, beyond the rudimentary examination that he performed. Most importantly, Dr. Chin should have told the plaintiff to return in two to three days if the pain continued.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, the record supports <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>the finding that Dr. Chin was negligent in his examination of the plaintiff, in his failure to explore other possible diagnoses, and in his failure to give the plaintiff warnings and explanations adequate for follow-up care.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">2. <em>Causation. </em>A plaintiff in a medical malpractice action has the burden of proving that the physician\u2019s negligence, was the proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries. <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Conway, </em>360 Mass. 746, 749 (1972). <em>Semerjian </em>v. <em>Stetson, </em>284 Mass. 510, 512 (1933). This causal link generally m\u00fast be established by expert testimony that the injury was more probably than not a result of the physician\u2019s negligence. See <em>Berardi </em>v. <em>Menicks, </em>340 Mass. 396, 402 (1960). The question of causation is generally a question of fact for the jury. <em>Mullins </em>v. <em>Pine Manor College, </em>389 Mass. 47, 58 (1983). <em>Zezuski </em>v. <em>Jenny Mfg. Co., </em>363 Mass. 324, 327 (1973). \u201cTo withstand a motion for a directed verdict on the issue of proximate causation, the plaintiff need only demonstrate that there was a greater likelihood that the harm of which the plaintiff complains was due to causes for which the defendant was responsible.\u201d <em>Colter </em>v. <em>Barber-Greene Co., </em>403 Mass. 50, 54-55 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">The plaintiff argues that if Dr. Chin had not acted negligently, but instead had told the plaintiff about other possible diagnoses and had told the plaintiff to return if the pain continued, the plaintiff would have had an excellent chance of avoiding his quadriplegia. The defendants assert that the evidence on causation was insufficient and the plaintiff\u2019s case therefore should not have gone to the jury. We conclude that there was sufficient evidence on the issue of causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">The plaintiff has met the burden of proving that the defendants\u2019 negligence caused the harm he actually suffered. As we concluded above, the plaintiff met his burden of proving negligence by showing that the defendants failed to exercise due care in rendering medical care, a service which was necessary for the plaintiff\u2019s protection. See <em>Mullins </em>v. <em>Pine Manor College, supra </em>at 53. The plaintiff\u2019s expert stated at trial that Dr. Chin should have told the plaintiff to return within three days if the pain continued. The law permits an inference that a warning, once given, would have been followed. <em>Wolfe </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number><em>Ford Motor Co., </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 346, 352 (1978). Thus, the jury could conclude that the plaintiff would have returned to the emergency room within three days.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">One of the plaintiff\u2019s experts further stated that once the plaintiff returned to the emergency room, proper medical procedure would have required that medical practitioners treat the plaintiff with the following care.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The medical practitioners would have the plaintiff undergo X-rays, which they would then read immediately. No fracture, dislocation or tumor having been found, they would have the plaintiff undergo a CAT scan. In light of the plaintiff\u2019s symptoms at the time, the CAT scan would have been positive, showing a bulge or herniated disc. They would have immobilized and observed the plaintiff, and barring any change, would have operated on him earlier. Early surgical intervention would probably have been successful in preventing quadriplegia.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">3. <em>Closing arguments. </em>Both the plaintiff and defendants raise numerous objections to the closing arguments of the opposing side. The defendants argue that the improprieties in plaintiff\u2019s counsel\u2019s argument make a new trial necessary. We agree that the argument by plaintiff\u2019s counsel was egregious and \u201cimproper under long established, and well understood, principles.\u201d <em>Leone </em>v. <em>Doran, </em>363 Mass. 1, 18 (1973). We conclude, however, that the strong, corrective action taken by the judge in response to counsel\u2019s improper argument eliminates the need for a new trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>In his argument, plaintiff\u2019s counsel referred by way of analogy to the verdict in the <em>Texaco </em>case <em>(Texaco, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pennzoil, Co., </em>729 S.W.2d 768 [Tex. Civ. App.] [1987], cert. dismissed, 485 U.S. 994 [1988]), the \u201ctwo or three hundred thousand dollars\u201d for one minute of advertising time during the Superbowl, the \u201ca million four\u201d for baseball players\u2019 salaries, the \u201cten million dollars, or twenty-five million dollars\u201d for a crashed airplane, and the \u201cfive million dollars\u201d for paintings by Renoir and Monet. An argument concerning money damages indulging in significant references to numerical amounts that have no basis in the record is improper. See <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>State Taxi, Inc., </em>336 Mass. 28, 30 (1957). Repeated, substantive discussions of hypothetical damages in other circumstances, and especially references to verdicts in other cases, are not proper. See <em>Dotson </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>157 Ill. App. 3d 1036 (1987); <em>Reetz </em>v. <em>Kinsman Marine Transit Co., </em>416 Mich. 97, 105-106 (1982). See also S.J.C. Rule 3:07, DR7-106 (1), 382 Mass. 784 (1981). Such arguments are especially overreaching in a case in which the plaintiff is a quadriplegic for life.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">In response to the objections, the judge extensively discussed with counsel for both sides the substance of a proper curative instruction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The judge informed counsel that he thought an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>instruction on the nature and status of closing arguments, in addition to his previous instructions that the words of counsel were not evidence, would be sufficient to take care of any impropriety. Soon afterward, the judge said, \u201cOkay. I\u2019m going to tell the jury that the closing arguments are not evidence. I\u2019ve told them over and over again. I\u2019ll try to cure it as best I can.\u201d At that point, counsel for the defendants answered, \u201cThank you, Your Honor.\u201d Defense counsel went on to tell the judge that \u201cthe only other thing\u201d that he requested was specific instructions on the impropriety of first person statements by counsel<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and instructions on the impropriety of reading from a transcript.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, the judge adopted the suggestions of defense counsel relating to those two issues. The defendants also asked the judge to admonish plaintiff\u2019s counsel before the jury and instruct the jurors as to the impropriety of the argument. Defense counsel recognized that the remedy was a matter within the judge\u2019s discretion because he left it to the judge \u201cwhether [he] wantfed] to do that or not.\u201d The judge cautioned the jury that the argument was not evidence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The judge in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>structed the jurors on damages comprehensively and correctly. The defendants did not object to the instructions on damages.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The trial judge did not abuse his discretion in the manner in which he handled the alleged improper statements and arguments. See <em>Fialkow </em>v. <em>DeVoe Motors, Inc., </em>359 Mass. 569, 572 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">We again comment that if a judge fails to cure an alleged error, the judge is \u201centitled at the end of the charge to have errors and omissions claimed to exist therein brought to, his attention, and if an exception was desired because of such omission or error to have the exception taken for such reason or reasons.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cabot, </em>241 Mass. 131, 151 (1922). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gouveia, </em>371 Mass. 566, 572 (1976); Mass. R. Civ. P. 51 (b), 365 Mass. 816 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">4. <em>Comparative negligence. </em>The plaintiff asserts that defense counsel\u2019s improper remarks are the basis for the jury\u2019s determination of thirteen per cent negligence by the plaintiff. He therefore asks that we reinstate the thirteen per cent to the verdict. For the reasons stated below, we decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">In the light most favorable to the defendants, the jury could have found that Dr. Chin informed the plaintiff to return to the emergency room if the pain got worse.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The plaintiff claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>that the record contains no evidence that the plaintiff\u2019s pain got worse from February 11, 1982, the day of his examination by Dr. Chin, until March 5, 1982, the day he returned to the hospital. Thus, the plaintiff argues that the record contains no evidence that he disobeyed the doctor\u2019s orders, and he therefore cannot be found negligent. The plaintiff argues that it was defense counsel\u2019s improper arguments which misled the jury. The issue is close. We turn to the record.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">On cross-examination, the following colloquy took place between the plaintiff and defense counsel:</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Q.: \u201cIt\u2019s your testimony today that [the pain] never went away, and got worse and worse until you finally went back on March 5th? Is that correct?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">A.: \u201cThat\u2019s right. The pain never left.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>The plaintiff argues that the question was a compound question, and that his answer referred only to the question about whether the pain ever left. But a reasonable jury could interpret the statement another way and conclude that the plaintiff agreed the pain got worse.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Because the jury could have found that Dr. Chin warned the plaintiff to return to the emergency room if his pain got worse, and the plaintiff did not return even though his pain intensified, the verdict of thirteen per cent comparative negligence is based on sufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">5. <em>Reductions pursuant to the medical malpractice statute. </em>The defendants call upon us to interpret a new provision of the medical malpractice statute, G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60G, for the first time. This section allows the trial judge to deduct from the damage award the amount received by the plaintiff from collateral sources.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The provision in question became effective while the jury in this case was deliberating. The plaintiff does not argue that the statute does not apply to cases on trial at the time the statute became effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>In response to postjudgment interrogatories propounded by the defendants, the plaintiff listed the following collateral sources as those which compensated him for damages which he had alleged in his complaint: Medicare ($7,304.35); United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (no amount specified); Medicaid ($159,225.35); Boston Center for Independent Living, a Medicaid-funded program ($50,547); and Social Security Disability and Supplemental Social Security ($473 per month, no period specified).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">On January 16,1987, the judge ruled that the new provisions of the statute do \u201cnot require the reduction of the verdict by the amount Mr. Harlow has received from the state and federal governments.\u201d The judge erred and failed to apply the statute properly. Because the defendants may be entitled under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60G, to some deduction from the jury award, we remand to the trial court for proceedings adhering to the guidelines we now discuss.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">To ensure proper application of the statute, we must examine separately each benefit enumerated by the plaintiff in his answer to the defendant\u2019s interrogatories. We must determine whether the benefits are governed by G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60G, or whether they are exempted from its provisions because they entail a right of subrogation with a \u201cbasis in any Federal law.\u201d G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60G (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-10\">The statute applies to the amount of prejudgment damages which were \u201creplaced, compensated, or indemnified pursuant to the United States Social Security Act, any state or federal income disability or worker\u2019s compensation act... or any other collateral source of benefits whatsoever, except for gratuitous payments or gifts.\u201d G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60G (a). In those cases where these benefits duplicate the damages awarded, the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>shall reduce the award by the amount of the benefits, less the amount the plaintiff paid to secure such benefits, through premiums and the like. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60G <em>(b).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">The provision is designed to prevent double recovery by a plaintiff through litigation. It also protects the plaintiff from double loss of benefits by cancelling the rights of subrogation and perfections of lien previously held by the entities which provided these collateral benefits. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60G (c). Thus, when the judge deducts the benefits from the damage. award, the entity which provided the benefit cannot collect that amount from the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">There is an exception, however, for benefits provided by an entity \u201cwhose right of subrogation is based in any federal law.\u201d In those cases, the right of subrogation survives, and the court may not deduct those amounts from the damage award. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">The defendants admit that the plaintiff\u2019s Medicare benefits are not subject to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60G, because the Federal statute establishing the Medicare benefits also establishes a Federal right of subrogation. 42U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(b)(l) (1982).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">A more difficult issue is presented with regard to Medicaid benefits. The Federal government reimburses the'pommonwealth a percentage of the cost of the Medicaid program. A Federal statute requires that States receiving Federal (unds must pursue recovery of the funds from legally liable, (bird parties. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(25) (1982).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> A Federal regulation requires the State to reimburse the Federal government a pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>portion of such recovery.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> A State statute duly provides for recovery from third parties and subrogation of the plaintiff\u2019s claim. G. L. c. 18, \u00a7 5G.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">The defendants argue with regard to Medicaid benefits that there is no right of subrogation \u201cbased in any federal law\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60G (c). We disagree. The Federal statute implementing partial reimbursement of State Medicaid programs mandates that any State receiving these funds must pursue reimbursement from legally liable third parties. The fact that technically a State statute provides for the subrogation is irrelevant. Because the Commonwealth\u2019s pursuit of reimbursement is required by Federal law, the right of subrogation is \u201cbased in\u201d Federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">The choice of language contained in G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60G (c), and the objective of this exception, support our reading. The Legislature chose to use the expansive term \u201cbased in any federal law\u201d rather than the more stringent \u201crequired by federal law\u201d or \u201cprovided for by federal law.\u201d A provision that a State receiving Federal money must pursue reimbursement suffices to make the consequent right of subrogation \u201cbased in\u201d Federal law. The objective of the exception is to prevent conflicts between G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60G, and any Federal law, which of course must be supreme. U.S. Const, art. VI, \u00a7 2. The Legislature clearly attempted to avoid conflicts with Federal- law, and we also read the statute to avoid any conflict with Federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">The defendants further argue that if Medicaid payments are excepted from the rule of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60G, only the per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>centage which is ultimately reimbursed to the Federal government should be excepted. Again, we disagree. The statute mandating that the States pursue reimbursement of Medicaid funds makes no distinction between pursuit of funds which will ultimately be reimbursed and those which the State will retain. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(25). If the Commonwealth was allowed to recover from a third party only the percentage of Medicaid funds reimbursable to the Federal government, and have its rights to the other percentage cancelled by G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60G, the incentives to recover, as provided by Federal law, also would lessen significantly. The right of subrogation as to all Medicaid benefits survives G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60G, and thus Medicaid benefits are not deductible from the jury award.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">The benefits received from Social Security, however, may be subject to the provisions of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60G. Neither party has pointed to a Federal right of subrogation in relation to the grant of Social Security benefits, and we have not been able to discern one. If the judge determines that there is no Federal right of subrogation with respect to such benefits, and that the Social Security benefits received by the plaintiff duplicate part of the jury verdict, he shall reduce the jury verdict by that amount. To allow for this determination, and for the determination of the amount of prejudgment Social Security benefits received by the plaintiff, we remand the case to the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">6. <em>Other issues. </em>The defendants make a number of other arguments on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">a. <em>Jury instructions. </em>The defendants complain that the trial judge committed reversible error when he gave his jury instruction on warnings and negligence.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> They complain that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>instruction essentially mandated a jury finding that Dr. Chin breached a duty in not warning the plaintiff at the examination about possible dangers.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">There was no error. The judge simply informed the jury that, in establishing the causal chain, the plaintiff is entitled to the presumption that, had he been given a warning, he would have returned. That is a correct statement of the law. <em>Glicklich </em>v. <em>Spievack, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 488, 493 (1983). <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 346, 352 (1978). The language of the judge\u2019s instruction in no way mandates a finding that Dr. Chin needed to issue a warning to the plaintiff. In any event, prior to the instruction at issue, the judge instructed the jury that the question whether any warning should have been given was for them to decide.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">b. <em>Life expectancy. </em>The medical malpractice statute, G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60F (1988 ed.), requires a jury to specify the amount of time over which an award for future medical expense and future pain and suffering is meant to compensate the plaintiff. The jury specified thirty-one and one-half years of compensation. At trial, the plaintiff\u2019s expert opined that, according to mortality tables, a white male of Harlow\u2019s age has a future life expectancy of thirty-one and one-half years. On cross-examination, the expert admitted that a quadriplegic\u2019s life expectancy generally is shorter than that of an average man.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">The defendants argue that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of thirty-one and one-half years, because the plaintiff\u2019s expert admitted that generally the life expectancy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>of a quadriplegic was shorter. We do not agree with the defendant\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Expert testimony based on mortality tables is admissible to prove the probable duration of a person\u2019s life. <em>Turcotte </em>v. <em>DeWitt, </em>332 Mass. 160, 162-164 (1955). Mortality tables, though not conclusive proof of life expectancy, help furnish a basis for the jury\u2019s estimation. The tables themselves are admissible regardless of the poor health or extra-hazardous occupation of the person whose life expectancy is being estimated. <em>Levar </em>v. <em>Elkins, </em>604 P.2d 602, 604 (Alaska 1980). <em>Bell Aerospace Corp. </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>478 S.W.2d 191 (Tex. Civ. App. 1972). When the opposing side believes that the person in question, because of poor health, has a lower life expectancy than that reflected in the mortality tables, the usual remedy is to offer evidence to that effect and argue the point to the jury. <em>Nolop </em>v. <em>Skemp, </em>7 Wis. 2d 462, 465 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">The jury had the full benefit of the defendants\u2019 cross-examination of the plaintiff\u2019s expert concerning the shorter life expectancy of quadriplegics. The jury was able to consider not only the expert testimony based on the mortality tables, but all the evidence in this case, including testimony concerning the plaintiff\u2019s excellent physical condition before the accident. The jurors themselves were able to observe the plaintiff when he testified. We cannot say that the jury\u2019s award was based on insufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">c. <em>Expert testimony. </em>The defendants argue that the judge erred in allowing Dr. Harold Goldstein, the plaintiff\u2019s expert on medical economics, to testify as to future medical expenses. \u201c[Ejxpert testimony on matters within the witness\u2019s field of expertise is admissible whenever it will aid the jury in reaching a decision.\u201d <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Solomon, </em>385 Mass. 91, 105 (1982). Dr. Goldstein was qualified at trial without objection as an expert in the field of medical economics, which concerns costs of medical care and efficient allocation of medical resources. Dr. Goldstein has prepared \u201cperhaps a hundred\u201d reports dealing with medical economics issues concerning patients with quadriplegia and paraplegia. He has prepared a computerized program to determine costs necessitated by those conditions. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>is no merit to the defendants\u2019 argument that Dr. Goldstein was outside his area of expertise in testifying about the plaintiff\u2019s future medical costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">There is similarly no merit to the contention that Dr. Gold-stein impermissibly commented about the testimony of another one of the plaintiff\u2019s experts, Dr. Murray Freed, when he compared his figures with Dr. Freed\u2019s. Dr. Goldstein was merely testifying in his area of expertise, and not invading the province of the jury with respect to Dr. Freed\u2019s testimony. Cf. <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Solomon, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">d. <em>Charitable immunity. </em>The hospital argues that any judgment entered against it should be limited to twenty thousand dollars, pursuant to the charitable organization statute, G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85K (1988 ed.).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> See note 2, <em>supra. </em>In order to enjoy the statutory cap, a hospital must prove both that it is a charitable organization, and that the tort complained of \u201cwas committed in the course of any activity carried on to accomplish directly the charitable purposes of such corporation.\u201d G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85K (1988 ed.). If a hospital\u2019s objective in treating a patient, however, is merely to generate revenue, the hospital\u2019s activity must be analyzed as \u201ccommercial\u201d rather than \u201ccharitable.\u201d See <em>Grueninger </em>v. <em>President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College, </em>343 Mass. 338, 340 (1961). In its answer to the plaintiff\u2019s complaint, the hospital pleaded charitable immunity under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85K, as an affirmative defense. The hospital also admitted the allegation in the plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint that the hospital \u201cis a charitable institution and a health care provider.\u201d The hospital was incorporated by St. 1810, c. 94, \u201cto provide a general hospital for sick and insane persons.\u201d <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Massachusetts General Hosp., </em>120 Mass. 432, 434 (1876).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">Thus, the hospital is clearly a charitable organization. Further, there was ample evidence from which the judge should have concluded that, in treating the plaintiff, the hospital\u2019s clinic was acting to accomplish directly the charitable purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>for which the hospital was created. The clinic ran an emergency room that was open to the public. The clinic provided medical services to the plaintiff, as evidenced by his medical record. The hospital charged the plaintiff only $26. The judge, however, did not make a specific ruling concerning the applicability of the statutory cap to the case before him.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">Although the hospital should have brought the matter to the judge\u2019s attention, we conclude that the plaintiff\u2019s counsel brought the issue before the judge.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> This, in addition to the pleadings, and the evidence concerning the clinic, should have put the judge on notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">The hospital met its burden of showing that the tort was committed in the course of its charitable purpose. The plaintiff produced no other evidence tending to show that the hospital was acting outside of its charitable purpose, except the fact that he was charged a fee of $26. The fact that a fee was charged, however, is not sufficient to take the hospital out of the protection of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85K. In the absence of any further evidence tending to show that the hospital was acting outside its charitable purpose, and in light of the plaintiff\u2019s acknowledgment at trial of the applicability of the statutory cap, see note 21, <em>supra, </em>we conclude that the judge should have entered judgment against the hospital limited by the statutory cap.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">We affirm the Superior Court judge\u2019s denial of the defendants\u2019 motion for a directed verdict, judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and for a new trial. We also affirm the judge\u2019s denial of the plaintiff\u2019s motions to reinstate thirteen per cent to the jury\u2019s award. We remand the case to the Superior Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>for entry of a judgment against the hospital limited to the statutory cap of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85K, and to subtract from the award against Dr. Chin any prejudgment Social Security benefits which are required to be deducted pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60G.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b713-6\"> After judgment entered, it became clear that the jury mistakenly included $388,930.92 in the award. That amount by all accounts had not been proved by the plaintiff as past medical expenses. The judge ordered a remittitur in the amount of $388,930.92. A new judgment of $6,322,350.10, reflecting the remittitur, was entered on March 25, 1987. Apparently because of a clerical error, the judgment was entered only against Dr. Chin, and not against Massachusetts General Hospital. At that time, the defendant Massachusetts General Hospital contended that any judgment against it must be limited to $20,000. It secured an order from a single justice of the Appeals Court denying entry of a judgment against the hospital and ordering that the parties brief, as part of the appeal, issues going to the amount of the judgment against the hospital, and whether the amount should be limited to the amount of charity immunity pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85K (1988 ed.). See <em>infra </em>at 715-716.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b715-7\"> The defendants argue that the plaintiff\u2019s claim of malpractice in fact is a claim that Dr. Chin failed to comply with his obligations under the informed consent doctrine. The informed consent doctrine, however, is inapplicable to the case at hand. That doctrine concerns the failure of a physician \u201cto divulge in a reasonable manner to a competent adult patient sufficient information to enable the patient to make an informed judgment whether to give or withhold consent to a medical or surgical procedure. . . <em>.\u2019\u2019Harnish v. Children\u2019s Hosp. Medical Center, </em>387 Mass. 152, 154-155 (1982).

See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cabot, </em>241 Mass. 131, 151 (1922). The defendants did not make any objections to the judge\u2019s curative instructions in connection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>with damages. Nevertheless, we think the defendants preserved their objections. The defendants\u2019 objections to the arguments on damages came at the end of their long list of objections. Almost immediately afterward, defense counsel said, \u201cI\u2019ve never heard an argument like that, and I hope I never hear one like it.\u201d As we read the record, the juxtaposition of this statement with the objection on the arguments concerning damages, in addition to the seriousness of the improprieties inherent in these arguments, put the judge on notice that vigorous action was required. We conclude that the judge took such action.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Although the defendants could have and should have requested specific curative action from the judge regarding the plaintiff\u2019s counsel\u2019s improper arguments because the judge deliberated with counsel at length about the proper curative instruction he ought to make, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cabot, </em>241 Mass. 131, 151 (1922); see also <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Baron, </em>392 Mass. 565, 568 n.3 (1984), we conclude that counsel\u2019s statement in these circumstances was sufficient.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b718-7\"> Defense counsel also is accused on appeal of improprieties in his closing arguments. The plaintiff complains that defense counsel argued improperly in the following ways: defense counsel referred to the plaintiff\u2019s drinking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>a few beers as a possible cause of the injury, although defense counsel admitted that the drinking did not have anything to do with the case; defense counsel misrepresented the plaintiff\u2019s testimony by stating that the plaintiff said his pain went away after the initial accident but before the onset of quadriplegia; defense counsel improperly referred to Dr. Chin\u2019s repudiated testimony, arguing to the jury that Dr. Chin had warned the defendant to come back if he did not feel better. See note 11, <em>infra. </em>Finally, defense counsel referred to a second cervical collar other than the one put on Harlow on March 5, implying that Harlow might have seen another health care provider. There was no evidence of a second cervical collar and no evidence that Harlow had seen a second health care provider. These arguments are not grounded in the evidence and also were improper.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b719-11\"> The judge instructed the jurors that any \u201cfirst person comments of counsel are to be regarded as their own opinions and not as evidence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b719-12\"> The judge told the jurors that reading from the transcript represented \u201cinformation which purportedly comes from some of the oral evidence in the case.

Apart from the dissenting opinion of Justice O\u2019Connor, with which I agree, I would remand the case to the Superior Court for a new trial because of the improper argument of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel. At the outset, I point out that the plaintiff\u2019s improper remarks were not limited to the issue of damages. In addition to alluding to numerous significant monetary amounts without any basis in the record, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel made the following remarks: \u201c[M]uch of the evidence that [defendants\u2019 counsel] said was in this case is not, and I think he knows it.\u201d He then accused defendants \u2019 counsel of intentionally making arguments to \u201cstink the case up\u201d because the defendants \u201cdon\u2019t have a defense.\u201d He went on to characterize the defendants\u2019 arguments as \u201cridiculous,\u201d \u201cincredible,\u201d and \u201ca bunch of baloney.\u201d He accused the defendants of \u201cfilling in memories that didn\u2019t exist\u201d and \u201cwinging it\u201d with respect to their defense. He announced that Chin\u2019s predictable prevarication required a trial strategy of laying \u201ca few traps\u201d for him and \u201cswinging them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-11\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel then portrayed himself as the plaintiff\u2019s hardworking advocate who had been \u201cworking on this case for four years\u201d and \u201cput a lot of work into this case.\u201d He also asserted that he had refrained from introducing evidence that might embarrass the plaintiff; he made representations to the contents of a trial transcript, not in evidence, and asserted that defense counsel had misrepresented the testimony contained therein; he described a trust fund not in evidence as the repository of any damages to be awarded to his client; he made assertions as to the plaintiff\u2019s potential marriageability; and he suggested that a finding of liability would vindicate the rights of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>the residents of Chelsea to receive the same medical care as the residents of Boston.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">During the course of the argument the defendants made two objections and received rather innocuous responses from the judge. That is, the judge gave the jury an instruction but did not warn or admonish counsel or otherwise direct that the improper remarks should cease. At the close of the argument defense counsel registered an additional twenty-six specific objections. During the course of these objections, the judge\u2019s comments were more or less favorable or, again, innocuous. The defendants\u2019 counsel requested curative action. The judge responded: \u201cI think that the instructions the Court has already given and will also give to the jury about the nature and status of closing arguments and summations will be sufficient to take care of the problem, I hope. I\u2019ll say no more than that.\u201d This falls far short of \u201cstrong corrective action\u201d that the court concedes was required in the face of egregious and improper argument of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel. <em>Ante </em>at 703. Defense counsel then asked that the jury be told that any first-person comments by opposing counsel not only should be disregarded, but also were improper. The judge responded by saying that he would tell the jury that closing arguments are not evidence. Defense counsel then pressed the judge further for an instruction that the argument was improper. That request was again refused. Finally defense counsel requested that opposing counsel be admonished for making personal, first-person opinions and observations and for reading from a transcript, not in evidence, and saying that there was nothing in it. The ensuing discussion and the abrupt adjournment for lunch fairly demonstrate the judge\u2019s refusal to grant the request to admonish the plaintiff\u2019s counsel and to inform the jury that the argument was improper. While the judge informed defense counsel that \u2014 \u201ceven if you do object\u201d \u2014 he would instruct the jury that first-person comments in argument are not \u201cproper comment on the evidence,\u201d he expressly and repeatedly refused either to instruct that it was <em>improper </em>for counsel so to argue, or to admonish the plaintiff\u2019s counsel on the record and before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>After the judge\u2019s charge to the jury there was an extended bench conference concerning specific requests for instruction filed by both parties. None of this discussion concerns the defendants\u2019 objections to the plaintiff\u2019s argument, and I submit that, in the face of the precharge conference during which the judge clearly indicated he was unwilling to admonish the plaintiff for improper argument, no additional request or objection was required. See <em>Heina </em>v. <em>Broadway Fruit Mkt, </em>Inc., 304 Mass. 608, 611 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">I do not accept the court\u2019s view that the judge adopted the suggestions of defense counsel regarding curative instructions. In the context of the colloquy discussed above, defense counsel\u2019s comments cannot be regarded as assent or agreement. This is so for two reasons: First because the only \u201cstrong corrective action\u201d open to the judge, admonishment of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel in the presence of the jury, which was clearly requested by the defendants\u2019 attorney, was just as clearly refused by the judge. Second, I suggest that sufficient precedent exists in cases where this court was dealing with the problem of improper argument to send the case back even where the judge\u2019s instructions were accepted without objection. See <em>Goldstein </em>v. <em>Gontarz, </em>364 Mass. 800, 811-812 (1974) (\u201c[n]or do we think the defendants were required to apply for a corrective instruction after the judge had twice ruled flatly against them\u201d), and cases cited. Here we have a situation where it is opposing counsel\u2019s conduct which is the subject of the objection, conduct that occurs in front of the jury, in a context where it is difficult to object, and where limited opportunities for corrective action exist. I would submit in such situations, where the only feasible corrective action has been plainly and persistently requested and denied by the trial judge, there has been no acquiescence by defense counsel and no further objection is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">Failure to object at the close of the charge is not fatal in these circumstances. <em>London </em>v. <em>Bay State St. Ry., </em>231 Mass. 480, 486 (1919). In <em>Leone </em>v. <em>Doran, </em>363 Mass. 1 (1973), the court commented on trial tactics intended to impress on the jury facts that were not warranted by the evidence. A new trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>was ordered where the argument was improper and where the judge declined to take rigorous and emphatic corrective action. Although the conduct of counsel in this case was not as egregious as counsel\u2019s conduct in <em>Leone, </em>I think it is nevertheless true that counsel\u2019s \u201ctactics do a disservice to the court, the public, and the litigants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19. In a similar situation, but under the much more restrictive rules of practice in use at the time, the court ruled that, once the trial judge had made a final ruling on an objection to an opponent\u2019s final argument, that ended the incident as far as objecting counsel was concerned. \u201cThe circumstance that at the close of the charge no further exception was taken did not deprive the defendants of whatever value there was in the exception previously taken to a definitive ruling.\u201d <em>Doherty </em>v. <em>Levine, </em>278 Mass. 418, 420 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">I therefore believe that, to require counsel in this case to do more is contrary to precedent and unfair, rewards egregious behavior, and does a disservice to the court, the public, and litigants.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b732-5\"> One of the jurors was from Chelsea.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b734-5\">O\u2019Connor, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AV6\">(dissenting, with whom Nolan and Lynch, JJ., join). I agree that the jury would have been warranted in finding that Dr. Chin failed to advise Harlow to return to Chelsea Memorial Health Care Center in seventy-two hours if his pain persisted and that that failure constituted negligence. I do not agree, however, despite the sympathetic appeal of the plaintiff\u2019s situation, that the jury were warranted in finding that that negligence caused Harlow\u2019s quadriplegia.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Harlow had the burden of proving causation. The jury reasonably could have found that, had Harlow been properly advised, he would have returned to the health care center in seventy-two hours. The critical question on appeal bearing on causation is whether there was evidence to support a finding within the realm of probability that, had Harlow returned in seventy-two hours, his condition would have been diagnosed and treated and quadriplegia prevented.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">The court says, <em>ante </em>at 703, that \u201c[o]ne of the plaintiff\u2019s experts . . . stated that once the plaintiff returned to the emer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>gency room, proper medical procedure would have required that medical practitioners treat the plaintiff\u201d by, among other things, subjecting him to a CAT scan, which would have shown \u201ca bulge or herniated disc,\u201d which, in turn, would have led to early and successful surgery. In his argument on appeal, Harlow relies exclusively on the testimony of Dr. Gary Korenman, a New York City neurologist, as to the causation issue. That Harlow would have been subjected to a CAT scan is critical to his case because there is no evidence that, in the absence of a CAT scan, the seriousness of Harlow\u2019s condition would have been recognized or that surgery would have been performed. Only Dr. Korenman testified about a CAT scan. Therefore, if the court is to be true to its responsibility to decide whether the plaintiff produced sufficient evidence, and to explain its decision, mere characterization of the critical testimony or paraphrasing of it is not enough. Close scrutiny of the relevant questions and answers as they appear in the record is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">The relevant questions put to Dr. Korenman and his answers are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">Q.: \u201cDoctor, do you have an opinion based on reasonable medical certainty as to what medical care would have been required for Mr. Harlow if he had returned within seventy-two hours of having been discharged from Chelsea Memorial Health Care Clinic consistent with the Door Sheet, Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit No. 1, on 2-15-82?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">A.: \u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">Q.: \u201cWhat is that opinion, Doctor?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">A.: \u201cThe appropriate medical care at that point, seventy-two hours subsequent to 2-15 -82, with the persistence of symptoms, would have been a re-taking of the history, a thorough neurologic and general physical examination, and ordering cervical spine X-rays, with a wet reading \u2014 that is, wet reading means that the X-rays are read immediately, or as an emergent procedure. Depending upon what the results of those X-rays were at that point, assuming that there was no fracture, no dislocation, no tumor, that the X-rays were within normal limits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>with his symptoms persisting, I would have ordered a CAT scan at that point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">There was no evidence that, in the circumstances of this case, it was routine procedure at Chelsea Memorial Health Care Center to order or perform a CAT scan. I would agree, though, that had evidence been introduced that physicians of average competence would have ordered a CAT scan in the circumstances of this case, such evidence would have been adequate to support a finding that a CAT scan would have been ordered upon Harlow\u2019s prompt return to the center. See <em>Brune </em>v. <em>Belinkoff, </em>354 Mass. 102, 109 (1968). But, no such evidence was introduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Harlow\u2019s counsel asked Dr. Korenman his opinion \u201cas to what medical care would have been required for Mr. Harlow if he had returned within seventy-two hours of having been discharged from Chelsea Memorial Health Care Clinic?\u201d The witness answered that \u201cappropriate medical care\u201d would have involved certain specified procedures following which he, Dr. Korenman, would have ordered a CAT scan. The court asserts, <em>ante </em>at 703 n.4, that, when the witness said, \u201cI would have ordered a CAT scan,\u201d he was really saying that appropriate medical care required a CAT scan. I do not agree that the court can now know, or that the jury could have known, that that is what the witness meant. Nevertheless, for purposes of discussion, let us assume that the jury properly could have understood Dr. Korenman\u2019s testimony about what he would have done as meaning that \u201cappropriate medical care\u201d would have required a CAT scan. Even so, that testimony was not enough to permit a finding of causation unless the jury also would have been warranted in concluding that the term, \u201cappropriate medical care,\u201d as used by the witness, referred to the care to be expected of physicians of average competence.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Nowhere in the evidence is there any indication that Dr. Korenman understood and used the expression \u201cappropriate medical care,\u201d to mean the care or treatment that averagely competent physicians would render in the circumstances. For all that appears, Dr. Korenman\u2019s concept of \u201cappropriate medical care,\u201d undefined throughout his testimony, and his concept <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>of the level of care to be expected of physicians of average competence are two very different matters. Indeed, the doctor\u2019s statement, \u201cI would have ordered a CAT scan,\u201d in response to a question about the requirement of appropriate medical care strongly suggests that the doctor understood appropriate medical care to be the treatment that he, as distinguished from an averagely competent physician, would have rendered. There is certainly nothing in the evidence to suggest that Dr. Korenman considered himself averagely competent. Surely, also, it cannot fairly be said that, by common usage of lay people, the term \u201cappropriate medical care\" has come to mean the care that would be given by physicians of average competence. For all that appears in the evidence, the expression, \u201cappropriate medical care,\u201d as the witness understood and used it, referred not to a standard set by physicians of average competence but to a much higher standard. There is no basis in the evidence for the jury reasonably to have understood the evidence differently. Therefore, there was absolutely no justification in the evidence for the jury to conclude that, had Harlow returned to Chelsea Memorial Health Care Center in timely fashion, a CAT scan leading to successful surgery would have been performed. Viewed as favorably to the plaintiff as can be justified, the evidence does not support a finding of causation. Therefore, I would reverse the judgment for the plaintiff. I would order judgment for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">Because I conclude that the defendants are entitled to a judgment in their favor, I need not reach the \u201cegregious argument\u201d issue discussed by Justice Lynch in his dissenting opinion. Were I to do so, I would agree with Justice Lynch, for the reasons he gives, that a new trial should be required.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
