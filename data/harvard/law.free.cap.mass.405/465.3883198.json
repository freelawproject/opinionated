L. c. 39, \u00a7\u00a7 23A-23C (1988 ed.), by interviewing and evaluating applicants for the position of school superintendent while in an \u201cexecutive session\u201d closed to the public. The district attorney for the northern district filed a separate complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief against the defendants in which he alleged the same and other open meeting law violations. The two actions were consolidated, and the individual plaintiffs and the district attorney (plaintiffs) filed a motion for summary judgment. The defendants opposed those motions and themselves moved for summary judgment. A judge concluded that there was no substantial question of material fact requiring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>resolution by a trial. He denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment and allowed the defendants\u2019 motion. The plaintiffs appealed, and we granted the defendants\u2019 application for direct appellate review.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The parties stipulated to the following facts: The school committee, a \u201cgovernmental body\u201d within the meaning of the open meeting law, established the screening committee in November, 1987, \u201cfor the purpose of conducting a preliminary screening of candidates for the position of Superintendent of Weston Schools and to recommend candidates to be interviewed by the School Committee.\u201d The screening committee also was a \u201cgovernmental body\u201d within the meaning of the open meeting law. In response to advertisements, the committee received eighty-nine letters of inquiry and r\u00e9sum\u00e9s from applicants for the position. Fourteen other individuals were referred to the screening committee from other sources. The screening committee conducted open meetings on December 8, 15, and 22, 1987, and on January 5, 1988. A quorum of the committee attended each meeting and deliberated on the eighty-nine letters of inquiry and r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. During the course of those meetings, the screening committee decided to invite twenty-seven of the candidates who had submitted r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, as well as the fourteen individuals who had been referred from other sources, to complete an application, answer a questionnaire, and submit a writing sample. The minutes of those meetings identify the candidates by code number rather than by name.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The screening committee convened open meetings on January 19 and 26, and February 5,1988. A quorum of the screening committee attended those meetings and deliberated on the applications, on the completed questionnaires and on the writing samples which the invited candidates had submitted. As a result of, and during the course of, those meetings, the committee decided to interview thirteen candidates. The committee also decided that candidates\u2019 concerns about confidentiality were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>important, and that its chairperson should question the candidates to determine if any of them opposed open session interviews. After the chairperson spoke to one candidate who stated that she would withdraw from consideration if interviews were held in open session, the screening committee determined that conducting open interviews of any of the candidates would be detrimental to obtaining qualified applicants. The search committee convened open session meetings on February 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, and 27, 1988. During each of those meetings, the committee convened a closed session and interviewed one or more of the thirteen candidates previously selected for interviews. During the interviews, the members asked the candidates identical prepared questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">During the second of two meetings held on February 27, the screening committee reconvened in open session and deliberated . on the merits of the candidates who had been interviewed. During the course of that meeting, the committee recommended that eight individuals be interviewed by the school committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The school committee met on March 16,1988, in open session and accepted the recommendations of the screening committee. The school committee interviewed the eight candidates in several open session meetings held during March. On March 31, during an open session meeting, the school committee selected three of the eight remaining candidates as finalists. All subsequent deliberations about the three candidates were conducted in open session as was the vote to offer the position to one of the three.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">General Laws c. 39, \u00a7 23B, requires that \u201c[a]ll meetings of a governmental body shall be open to the public and any person shall be permitted to attend any meeting except as otherwise provided\u201d by that section. Section 23B also provides that executive sessions may be held only for eight specified purposes. The eighth enumerated purpose is \u201c[t]o consider and interview applicants for employment by a preliminary screening committee or a subcommittee appointed by a governmental body if an open meeting will have a detrimental effect in obtaining qualified applicants; provided, however, that this clause shall not apply to any meeting, including meetings of a preliminary screening committee or a subcommittee appointed by a governmental body, to consider and interview applicants who have passed a prior preliminary screening.\u201d G. L. c. 39, \u00a7 23B (8), as amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>through St. 1986, c. 694. Section 23A defines the term \u201c[executive session\u201d as meaning \u201cany meeting of a governmental body which is closed to certain persons for deliberation on certain matters.\u201d The term \u201c[deliberation\u201d is defined in the same section as \u201ca verbal exchange between a quorum of members of a governmental body attempting to arrive at a decision on any public business within its jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The plaintiffs argue that \u00a7 23B (8) did not apply for two reasons: (1) the statement of one of thirteen candidates interviewed that she would withdraw her candidacy if she had to be interviewed in public was an insufficient basis for the screening committee\u2019s conclusion that \u201can open meeting will have a detrimental effect in obtaining qualified applicants\u201d for the position of superintendent. (2) The thirteen applicants who were interviewed in executive session had already \u201cpassed a prior preliminary screening\u201d which, by the express terms of clause (8), makes clause (8) inapplicable. The judge rejected those arguments. He noted that \u201c[t]he Screening Committee\u2019s minutes indicate that at least one candidate had requested confidentiality. . . . The Screening Committee risked losing qualified applicants if the interviews were held in open session. Under the circumstances, it was reasonable for the Screening Committee to find that an open meeting would have a detrimental effect.\u201d The judge also concluded that the screening committee\u2019s review of applications and applicants\u2019 r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and writing samples did not constitute a \u201cprior preliminary screening\u201d which would preclude the thirteen interviews being conducted in executive session.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Before addressing the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments, we briefly discuss a threshold argument made by the defendants in the Superior Court and again here that the interviews in question are not within the purview of the open meeting law. The defendants point out that the interviews consisted simply of prepared questions put by committee members to candidates and the candidates\u2019 answers. The members, the defendants say, did not engage in a \u201cverbal exchange\u201d with one another in an attempt to arrive at a decision. Therefore, the interviewing sessions did not constitute meetings for the purpose of \u201cdelib<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>eration\u201d within the statutory definition of that word, and therefore they did not constitute \u201cexecutive sessions.\u201d Thus, goes the argument, the meetings at which the interviews took place were not governed by G. L. c. 39, \u00a7 23B. We are not persuaded by that argument. The interviews were means by which the screening committee gathered information to aid it in arriving at a decision about which candidates to recommend to the school committee. The questions asked by the committee members, supplemented by the candidates\u2019 answers, conveyed information about the candidates to the committee members present. That was enough to constitute a \u201cverbal exchange\u201d between the committee members within the meaning of the statute. The fact that the Legislature provided an exception to the open meeting law for certain job interviews conducted by a screening committee implies that it considered such interviews otherwise subject to that law. See G. L. c. 39, \u00a7 23B (8). We conclude that the screening committee was bound to comply with the open meeting law in conducting interviews for the position of superintendent of schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">We turn to the plaintiffs\u2019 first contention that the statement of one candidate chosen for an interview, that she would withdraw if the interview were to be conducted in public, was inadequate support for concluding that interviews at an open meeting would \u201chave a detrimental effect in obtaining qualified applicants.\u201d We reject the argument. Surely, the loss of even one candidate out of thirteen chosen for interviews, by limiting the pool available to the committee, is \u201cdetrimental\u201d to the committee\u2019s task. It cannot be persuasively argued that there is no detriment until at least two or some other number of candidates have declined to participate in public interviews.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 second argument is that the clause (8) exception to the open meeting law did not apply to the thirteen interviews because those candidates had already \u201cpassed a prior preliminary screening\u201d within the meaning of that language in clause (8)\u2019s proviso. We think the judge was right in concluding that the interviewed candidates had not \u201cpassed a prior preliminary screening\u201d when they were interviewed. According to the parties\u2019 stipulation, the screening committee\u2019s assignment was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>to screen and to recommend candidates to be interviewed by the school committee. Implicit in the charge to the committee was that the committee would recommend only candidates who had been found worthy of recommendation after the committee\u2019s full review, that is, after the candidate had \u201cpassed\u201d the committee\u2019s \u201cpreliminary screening\u201d prior to the school committee\u2019s involvement. The manner in which that screening would be accomplished was left to the committee. The committee chose first to review letters of inquiry and r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, then to invite some of those candidates, plus fourteen other individuals who had been referred to the committee, to submit applications, answers to questionnaires, and writing samples, and finally to interview thirteen candidates. That preliminary screening process led to the screening committee\u2019s recommendation of eight candidates for consideration by the school committee. Only those eight candidates can be said to have \u201cpassed a preliminary screening.\u201d We reject the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that all the individuals whose candidacy survived the committee\u2019s consideration of their written materials \u201cpassed a preliminary screening\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 23B (8).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">Section 23B specifically authorizes a preliminary screening committee to \u201cconsider and interview applicants for employment,\u201d and to do so in executive session in circumstances properly found to have existed in this case unless the applicants \u201chave passed a prior preliminary screening.\u201d An interpretation of the proviso in clause (8) that would effectively prevent a screening committee from both considering and, in aid thereof, interviewing candidates in closed session would defeat the clear language and purpose of clause (8). Nothing in the statute suggests that \u201ca prior preliminary screening\u201d is limited to a one-time only review of an applicant\u2019s credentials. Indeed, as the judge recognized, if a screening committee\u2019s review of r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and writing samples were to preclude the committee from subsequently conducting executive session interviews despite the detrimental effect public interviews might have on the committee\u2019s task, the committee would be faced with the choice either to live with the detrimental effect or to interview every applicant regardless of qualification. It is apparent that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>the Legislature intended to prevent such detrimental effect, and nothing in the statute suggests that the Legislature intended to impose on municipalities the impractical, if not impossible, burden of conducting meaningless and perhaps overwhelmingly numerous interviews. See <em>Ghiglione </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Southbridge, </em>376 Mass. 70, 72 (1978). We construe clause (8)\u2019s proviso that clause (8) shall not apply to a meeting of a preliminary screening committee to \u201cconsider and interview applicants who have passed a prior preliminary screening\u201d to mean that, once such a committee has completed its screening, which may include more than one step and may or may not include interviews, and has voted to recommend a candidate, the process may not be repeated in executive session. Based on the statutory language, and in view of the impracticality of the statutory construction urged on us by the plaintiffs, we are satisfied that the construction we adopt fairly reflects the Legislature\u2019s determination of the appropriate balance between the public\u2019s right to be informed about public policy decision making and the necessity of not unduly hampering public officials\u2019 performance of their duties. See <em>Ghiglione </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Southbridge, supra </em>at 72-73. If, as the plaintiffs argue, the statute as we have construed it is susceptible to manipulation by government bodies in order to evade the requirements of the open meeting law, we are unwilling to assume that such manipulation will occur. In any event, we leave to legislative judgment the question whether statutory revision is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">In addition to the matters discussed above, the plaintiffs assert that the screening committee committed other open meeting law violations \u2014 violations of a procedural nature. They say that the committee violated G. L. c. 39, \u00a7 23B, third par., by convening in executive session on several occasions without first announcing whether the committee would reconvene in open session. We agree with the judge that, in the context of this case, that violation was de minimis. <em>Ghiglione </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Southbridge, supra </em>at 74. The purpose of the announcement requirement, that is, that the public receive notice of the anticipated continuation of an interrupted open meeting, was not subverted in this case as the committee did not in fact reconvene in open session on any of those occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>The plaintiffs also argue that the committee failed to include in its minutes the time and place of its meetings. The record shows that the minutes in question were subsequently amended to cure the omission. Also, the plaintiffs say the minutes of the committee meetings held on January 19 and 26, and February 5 and 27, 1988, were deficient because, although they reflect that the members \u201crated and discussed\u201d candidates, those minutes do not record how the members voted, as required by G. L. c. 39, \u00a7 23B, seventh par., and G. L. c. 65, \u00a7 5A (1988 ed.). No violation has been shown since nothing in the record suggests that the \u201crating and discussing\u201d of candidates involved voting or that any votes were taken at those meetings.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">Finally, the plaintiffs point to the fact that none of the screening committee\u2019s minutes identifies the applicants considered or discussed by that committee even though there had been no showing that the privacy concerns of any of the applicants were in issue. The plaintiffs refer the court to <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Northampton, </em>375 Mass. 127, 130 n.2 (1978). In that case, we held that a school committee had violated the open meeting law by failing to disclose the names of candidates for the position of superintendent of schools who had been considered by that committee in open session. The case was decided before \u00a7 23B (8) was enacted. The school committee of Northampton relied on G. L. c. 39, \u00a7 24, as amended by St. 1970, c. 78, \u00a7 2, stating that the provisions of G. L. c. 39 \u201cshall be in force only so far as they are not inconsistent with the express provisions of any general or special law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 129. The school committee pointed to G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 IB, inserted by St. 1974, c. 193, \u00a7 1, which provides that \u201c[a] person shall have a right against unreasonable, substantial or serious interference with his privacy,\u201d as a law requiring the committee to withhold the names. In footnote 2, to which the present plaintiffs refer, we said: \u201cMuch the same considerations would have applied if the school committee had voted to go into executive session under the authority of G. L. c. 39, \u00a7 23B (7), as appearing in St. 1976, c. 397, \u00a7 6, which permits executive sessions \u2018[t]o comply with the provisions of any general or special law.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>Our conclusion in <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Northampton, supra </em>at 130, that the school committee had violated the open meeting law was grounded on the committee\u2019s failure to show \u201cas to any of the sixteen candidates considered at the open meeting that disclosure of his name would have been an unreasonable, substantial, or serious interference with his privacy.\u201d We reasoned that the judge had concluded \u201cboth that an applicant who reached that level of consideration would expect open and public consideration of his professional competence and that the reasons for protecting the identity of such candidates were less substantial than the reasons for protecting the identity of applicants who had not reached that level of consideration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We said that \u201c[t]he school committee\u2019s argument that forced disclosure in such circumstances will discourage certain potential future applications for such positions has merit as a policy consideration for the Legislature, but it alone cannot justify barring disclosure where the record does not show that disclosure would impinge on any candidate\u2019s statutory right of privacy\u201d (footnote omitted). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">The present case, unlike <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Northampton, supra, </em>does not involve a school committee\u2019s withholding of names of candidates considered by the school committee. Rather, this case raises the question whether the screening committee violated the open meeting law by withholding the names of individuals it considered during the preliminary screening process. We suggested in <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Northampton, supra </em>at 130, that there are substantial reasons for protecting the identity of individuals who were candidates only early in the process. Furthermore, the addition of clause (8) to G. L. c. 39, \u00a7 23B, as amended through St. 1986, c. 694, demonstrates the Legislature\u2019s endorsement of such confidentiality. Consequently, even though the screening committee\u2019s meetings through February 5, 1988, were open meetings, we decline to order the disclosure of the identities of those candidates who were considered only by the screening committee and not by the school committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b481-7\"> We acknowledge the brief of amicus curiae Massachusetts Newspaper Publishers Association.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
