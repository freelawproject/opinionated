(Global) appeals from an order dismissing its amended complaint against Northeast Petroleum (Northeast) for nuisance, negligence, interference with contractual and beneficial relations, and invasion of a private right arising from a public nuisance. According to the facts alleged in its complaint, Global claimed damages resulting from the collapse on November 3, 1986, of Northeast\u2019s retaining wall along the Chelsea River, which allowed dirt, granite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>blocks, and other debris to spill into the river, blocking navigation of the channel for four days and restricting navigation on the Chelsea River until late December, 1986. Both Global and Northeast operate terminal facilities on the Chelsea River for the purchase, transport and sale of petroleum products. Global asserts that as a result of the navigation restrictions \u2014 imposed by the United States Coast Guard \u2014 vessels were prohibited transit to and from Global\u2019s terminal, upstream of the collapsed retaining wall, and Global therefore incurred additional expenses for tug charges, lightering charges, and demurrage and delay claims. After the Superior Court judge allowed Northeast\u2019s motion to dismiss, filed pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (6), 365 Mass. 755 (1974), Global filed a motion for reconsideration, which was denied. We transferred Global\u2019s appeal to this court on our own motion, and now affirm the dismissal of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-19\">We first consider the threshold issue whether admiralty law or State common law governs Global\u2019s claims. Global asserts that (1) each count of its complaint states a claim for relief under Massachusetts law; (2) the dismissal of its complaint was in error because its cause of action was based on the fact that Global is a riparian landowner asserting its right of access to its tend and water; and (3) the Superior Court judge erred as a matter of tew in relying on Federal admiralty cases in deciding to dismiss the complaint based on general principles of maritime tew. When the facts pleaded are viewed in the light most favorable to Global, however, it is clear that the injuries complained of are interference with navigation on a navigable waterway, and the deprivation of access by vessels to and from Global\u2019s terminal. Such a claim is cognizable in admiralty because the injury \u2014 restriction of navigation \u2014 clearly occurred on or in navigable waters, and bears a significant relationship to maritime navigation and commerce. See <em>Executive Jet Aviation, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cleveland, </em>409 U.S. 249, 255-256, 268 (1972); <em>Oppen </em>v. <em>Aetna Ins. Co., </em>485 F.2d 252, 256-257 (9th Cir. 1973). See also <em>Thorneal </em>v. <em>Cape Pond Ice Co., </em>321 Mass. 528, 532 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>We note that in <em>Stop &amp; Shop Cos. </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>387 Mass. 889 (1983), relied on by Global to support its argument that its State law claims should be permitted, we expressly declined to decide whether Federal maritime law applied. <em>Id. </em>at 899. In a separate proceeding in Federal District Court for Massachusetts, where Stop &amp; Shop asserted its State law nuisance claims, the United States District Court determined that \u201csince federal law is controlling and . . . bars these claims,\u201d it did not matter that State law might permit recovery for nuisance under other circumstances. <em>In the Matter of the Petition of J.D. Irving Ltd., </em>No. 83-1654 Mc, slip op. at 4(D. Mass. Sept. 30, 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Since this is a maritime claim, the Superior Court has concurrent jurisdiction of the claim under the \u201csaving to suitors\u201d clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333 (1982), but must apply the law which would be applied by a Federal court sitting in admiralty. <em>Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>202 F.2d 893, 896-897 (1st Cir. 1953). See <em>Palumbo </em>v. <em>Boston Tow Boat Co., 21 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 414, 415 (1986). Despite Global\u2019s effort to characterize its claims as ones for land-based injuries founded on State law causes of action, the maritime nature of the tort requires that we apply Federal admiralty law. Since Global complains of business losses arising from interference with navigation, but has suffered no physical injury to person or property, recovery is barred under well-established principles prohibiting recovery for purely economic loss. See <em>Robins Dry Dock &amp; Repair Co. </em>v. <em>Flint, </em>275 U.S. 303 (1927); <em>Barber Lines A/S </em>v. <em>M/V Donau Maru, </em>764 F.2d 50, 51 (1st Cir. 1985). Cf. <em>Bay State-Spray &amp; Provincetown S.S., Inc. </em>v. <em>Caterpillar Tractor Co., </em>404 Mass. 103, 105 (1989). Global\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>Palumbo </em>v. <em>Boston Tow Boat, supra, </em>as applying only to claims coming under the Admiralty Extension Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 740 (1982) (extending admiralty jurisdiction to ship-to-shore injuries), is without merit. Irrespective of whether a case is governed by admiralty law because of the Admiralty Extension Act, or because of the tests set forth in <em>Executive Jet, supra, </em>since general maritime law governs, recovery is precluded in the absence of physical injury to person or property. Global cannot avoid this principle by presenting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>its claims as ones based strictly on State law theories. See <em>Louisiana ex rel. Guste </em>v. <em>M/V Testbank, </em>752 F.2d 1019 (5th Cir. 1985), cert. denied sub nom. <em>White </em>v. <em>M/V Testbank, 477 </em>U.S. 903 (1986); <em>Dick Myers Towing Serv., Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>577 F.2d 1023, 1025 n.4 (5th Cir. 1978). We therefore affirm the dismissal of Global\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
