The complaint alleged that the defendants\u2019 actions in indefinitely suspending the plaintiff violated42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983, 1985 (1982), and G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 111 (1986 ed.), and sought declaratory and injunctive relief, back pay and damages.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AqP\">In November, 1986, a judge of the Superior Court denied the union\u2019s motion for summary judgment ruling that exhaustion of grievance procedures outlined in G. L. c. 161A, \u00a7 19, was not a prerequisite to an action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and that material facts remained in dispute. In February, 1988, the plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment against the MBTA. The MBTA filed a cross motion for summary judgment arguing that (1) it did not have an obligation to provide its employees with an agency fee option or to ensure that the union complied with constitutional provisions governing the payment of agency service fees, and (2) the plaintiff had failed to exhaust her statutory remedies under G. L. c. 161A. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>union filed a memorandum in opposition to the plaintiff\u2019s motion, asserting that material facts remained in dispute. A second judge, without making any rulings and without declaring the rights of the parties, granted the MBTA\u2019s motion, denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion, and dismissed the complaint against the union and its officials.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff appealed, and we granted her application for direct appellate review. We reverse the judgment against the plaintiff and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">On appeal, the plaintiff challenges the entry of summary judgment against her, and argues that the defendants\u2019 actions in indefinitely suspending her violated her rights secured by both the Federal and State Constitutions. Specifically, the plaintiff argues that (1) the defendants cannot constitutionally require her to become a formal member of the union and (2) the defendants violated her constitutional rights by suspending her for not joining the union without putting in place constitutionally mandated procedures for protecting the rights of nonunion employees.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">From the plaintiff\u2019s deposition and the parties\u2019 affidavits, the following facts appear. In June, 1983, the plaintiff went to work for the MBTA as a part-time surface operator, a position within the collective bargaining unit represented by the union. The collective bargaining agreement required all members of the collective bargaining unit to \u201cbecome and remain members of the [union],\u201d and \u201c[a]ny employee who fails to maintain membership in the [union] to the extent of paying regular membership dues and assessments shall not be retained in the employ of the Authority . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AF0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>When the plaintiff began her employment at the MBTA, she believed that the union was hostile to part-time employees.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At the end of her probationary period, the union notified the plaintiff of her obligation to join the union and requested that she pay the initiation fee and dues. In response to her questions regarding that notice and the union\u2019s membership requirement, an employee of the MBTA\u2019s labor relations office directed the plaintiff to discuss the matter with the union.</p>\n<p id=\"ANN\">The plaintiff then went to the union office and was told that she must become a member of the union. She received negative responses to her questions regarding whether, as an alternative to membership, she could pay union fees to a charity or start her own union for part-time employees.</p>\n<p id=\"Ap2\">While at the union office, the plaintiff requested a copy of the collective bargaining agreement. She was told that she \u201cwould not be allowed to even read the contract . . . unless [she] signed a union card.\u201d While at the union office the plaintiff tendered a check for $100, one-third of the initiation fee required for union membership, and signed (1) a dues deduction authorization form, (2) a voluntary deduction form for political contributions, and (3) a pledge to pay dues and abide by union rules.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> She signed these forms only to receive a copy of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>collective bargaining agreement and understood that she would not become a formal member until she paid the full initiation fee. The plaintiff never became a formal union member.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">In April, 1984, the union notified the plaintiff that she was in violation of the agreement\u2019s membership requirement and that her name had been sent to the MBTA for discharge. In May she sent a letter to the union\u2019s president objecting to becoming a formal union member; to paying the same fees as union members; and to the union\u2019s use of members\u2019 dues for political and ideological activities unrelated to collective bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">In June, 1984, the MBTA informed the plaintiff that, if she did not become a member of the union, she would be discharged. At an interview pursuant to MBTA procedures, the plaintiff told an MBTA supervisor that there were \u201ca lot of reasons [why she did not] want to join the union,\u201d one of which was the inadequacy of the union\u2019s representation of part-time employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">It is undisputed that prior to her discharge the MBTA had received a letter from the plaintiff\u2019s counsel stating that she objected to being a formal union member. It is also undisputed that the MBTA forwarded a copy of this letter and a copy of the plaintiff\u2019s prior letter to the union president, asking for the union\u2019s position regarding the plaintiff\u2019s objection to formal union membership.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In July, 1984, before receiving the union\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>response, the MBTA indefinitely suspended the plaintiff. The plaintiff has yet to be discharged, but remains indefinitely suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"ABt\">While the union president disputes that he ever received the plaintiff\u2019s letter which voiced her objections to formal union membership, the union does not dispute that it ultimately received notice of the plaintiff\u2019s objections via the MBTA inquiry. However, the union argues that this notice, which came after the plaintiff had been suspended, was too late to be effective. The union and the MBTA also argue that, since the plaintiff\u2019s deposition reveals that her only objection to becoming a member of the union was that she believed the union was hostile to part-time employees, her objection was not a constitutionally protected objection which would entitle the plaintiff to forgo formal membership and only pay a fair share or agency fee alternative.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aom\">1. <em>Standard for summary judgment. </em>When presented with a motion for summary judgment, the judge must consider \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any\u201d to determine whether summary judgment is appropriate. Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). Summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue of any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>In ruling on the motion the judge should consider the evidence \u201cwith an indulgence in the [opposing party\u2019s] <em>favor.\u201d Anthony\u2019s Pier Four, Inc. </em>v. <em>Crandall Dry Dock Eng\u2019rs, Inc., </em>396 Mass. 818, 822 (1986), quoting <em>National Ass\u2019n of Gov\u2019t </em>Employees, <em>Inc. </em>v. <em>Central Broadcasting Corp., </em>379 Mass. 220, 231 (1979), cert, denied, 446 U.S. 935 (1980). Also, rule 56 allows summary judgment to be entered against the moving party in appropriate circumstances. Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"A11\">a. <em>Summary judgment in favor of the union. </em>Circumstances can exist that would warrant the granting of summary judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>on reconsideration by one judge after summary judgment had been denied by another. See <em>King </em>v. <em>Globe Newspaper Co., </em>400 Mass. 705, 707-708 (1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 940 and 962 (1988). However, it was not appropriate in this case where reconsideration had not been requested, the issues had not been reargued and no notice had been given that the union\u2019s motion for summary judgment was being reconsidered. This is especially so where there were no rulings, and where the party benefiting from summary judgment conceded that a dispute of material fact existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">In addition, material facts remain in dispute. The disputed matters include (1) whether the union ever received the plaintiff\u2019s May 17, 1984, letter in which she objected to joining the union, and (2) the content of the conversation that occurred at the union office. The union alleges that, during her visit to the union office, the plaintiff signed union documents because she wanted to become a union member and did not voice any objection to formal membership. At her deposition the plaintiff testified that she signed the union documents only because she understood it to be the only way to obtain a copy of the collecfive bargaining agreement, and also that she questioned the union official regarding alternatives to union membership. In these circumstances, where material facts are clearly in dispute and the parties\u2019 intentions are crucial to a determination of liability, summary judgment is inappropriate.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Quincy Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Abernathy, </em>393 Mass. 81, 86 (1984). On the record before us, therefore, it was error to grant summary judgment in favor of the union.</p>\n<p id=\"Ad3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>b. <em>Summary judgment in favor of the MBTA. </em>The MBTA does not dispute, on appeal, that it knew that the plaintiff objected to becoming a member of the union because of her belief that the union was hostile to part-time employees. Both defendants argue, however, that the plaintiff\u2019s objection is not a \u201cpolitical\u201d or \u201cideological\u201d objection which prohibits them from enforcing the collective bargaining agreement\u2019s membership requirement.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Only if this argument is correct, and no factual dispute exists as to its premise, would summary judgment for the MBTA have been proper. Neither essential underpinning existed.</p>\n<p id=\"AED\">It is a well-established principle that formal union membership, which necessarily includes supporting, and being associated with, a union\u2019s institutional, political, and ideological activities, cannot be required as a condition of employment. See <em>Abood </em>v. <em>Detroit Bd. of Educ., </em>431 U.S. 209, 233-237 (1977). See also <em>Chicago Teachers Union, Local No. 1 </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>475 U.S. 292, 301-302 (1986); <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Brotherhood of Ry., Airline &amp; S.S. Clerks, Freight Handlers, Express &amp; Station Employees, </em>466 U.S. 435, 455 (1984). Cf. <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>373 U.S. 734, 742-743 (1963). In a related context, this court recognized the constitutional limitations that the <em>Abood </em>case placed on employers and unions who wish to require an employee\u2019s financial support of the collective bargaining agent as a condition of employment. See <em>School Comm. of Greenfield </em>v. <em>Greenfield Educ. Ass\u2019n., </em>385 Mass. 70, 78 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>In the <em>Abood </em>case, the Supreme Court delineated the scope of protection enjoyed by both public and private sector employees under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. There, the Court stated: \u201cIt is no doubt true that a central purpose of the First Amendment \u2018 \u201cwas to protect the free discussion of governmental affairs.\u201d \u2019 . . . But our cases have never suggested that expression about philosophical, social, artistic, economic, literary, or ethical matters \u2014 to take a nonexhaustive list of labels \u2014 is not entitled to full First Amendment protection. Union members in both the public and private sectors may find that a variety of union activities conflict with their beliefs. . . . Nothing in the First Amendment or our cases discussing its meaning makes the question whether the adjective \u2018political\u2019 can properly be attached to those beliefs the critical constitutional inquiry.\u201d (Citations omitted; footnotes omitted.) <em>Abood, supra </em>at 231-232. Thus, considering Abood\u2019\u2019s \u201cnonexhaustive list of labels,\u201d the plaintiff\u2019s objection to the union\u2019s position towards part-time employees is sufficient to trigger her constitutionally based right not to associate with the union. The <em>Abood </em>case indicates that the plaintiff may decide for a wide variety of reasons that she does not want to associate with the union to any degree more than can be constitutionally required (i.e. paying her pro rata share of a union\u2019s over-all costs of collective bargaining, contract administration, and grievance adjustment).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">The argument, made by both the MBTA and the union, that the plaintiff\u2019s objection is not constitutionally protected implies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>that there is a discernible ideological litmus test that could be used by employers and unions to determine those individuals who have a \u201cgenuine\u201d First Amendment opposition to associating with a particular union. In <em>Abood, </em>the Supreme Court not only recognized the broad scope of an employee\u2019s First Amendment protection, <em>Abood, supra </em>at 231-232, but also recognized that an objecting employee need only make a generalized objection because \u201c[t]o require greater specificity would confront an individual employee with the dilemma of relinquishing either his right to withhold his support of ideological causes to which he objects or his freedom to maintain his own beliefs without public disclosure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 241 &amp; n. 42. Thus, we decline to fashion a rule which would allow a union or an employer to require an objecting employee to articulate his or her ideological objection to union membership and then to determine whether the employee\u2019s objection is \u201cideological\u201d or \u201cpolitical\u201d enough to be constitutionally protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">In view of these requirements, an employer cannot ignore an employee\u2019s assertion of a constitutionally protected right which is valid on its face. See <em>Chicago Teachers Local No. 1 </em>v. <em>Hudson, supra </em>at 307 n. 20 (\u201cSince the agency shop itself is\u2018a significant impingement on First Amendment rights,\u2019. . . the <em>government and union </em>have a responsibility to provide procedures that minimize that impingement and that facilitate a nonunion employee\u2019s ability to protect his rights\u201d [emphasis added; citations omitted]). See also <em>Tierney </em>v. <em>Toledo, </em>824 F.2d 1497, 1504 (6th Cir. 1987) (\u201c[N]o <em>union or employer </em>may take any action to enforce a non-union member\u2019s duty to pay any dues . . . until a plan with procedures meeting the commands of <em>Abood </em>and <em>Hudson </em>is established and operating\u201d [emphasis added]). <em>Dixon </em>v. <em>Chicago, </em>669 F. Supp. 851, 852-853 (N.D. Ill. 1987) (ruling the express language of <em>Hudson </em>an \u201cexpress declaration of governmental [employer] responsibility\u201d). In order to dispose of the issue of summary judgment in favor of the MBTA, it is not necessary or appropriate that we say more.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">c. <em>Summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff. </em>The plaintiff also appeals from the denial of her motion for summary judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>ment on liability only against the MBTA. The plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleges that the MBTA\u2019s actions violated 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985. However, because liability under \u00a7 1985 requires proof of a conspiracy between two or more persons, <em>Francis-Sobel </em>v. <em>University of Me., </em>597 F.2d 15, 17 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 949 (1979), and at least because material facts remain in dispute regarding the union\u2019s actions, the plaintiff is not entitled to summary judgment against the MBTA. Therefore, the judge did not err in refusing to grant summary judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-13\">2. <em>Conclusion. </em>Accordingly, we reverse the summary judgment entered against the plaintiff and, because material facts remain in dispute, summary judgment in her favor is inappropriate. The case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-18\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b183-30\"> The complaint also sought to hold the MBTA and various officials liable for breach of contract and wrongful discharge, and to hold the union and its officials liable for intentionally interfering with the business relationship between the plaintiff and the MBTA and for breaching its duty of fair representation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b184-8\"> There is no explanation in the record why the second judge redetermined an issue that had been heard and decided by another judge in the absence of a request by the union for rehearing or reargument, and without notice to the plaintiff that he would reconsider the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b184-9\"> The plaintiff\u2019s brief does not address the dismissal of her breach of contract and wrongful discharge claims against the MBTA, and therefore these claims are considered waived. See Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975); <em>Anthony's Pier Four, Inc. </em>v. <em>Crandall Dry Dock Eng'rs, Inc., </em>396 Mass. 818, 821 n.4 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"Axd7\"> The plaintiff\u2019s belief was based in part on our decision in <em>Local 589, Amalgamated Transit Union </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp.

I will keep myself in good standing by paying all dues, fines and assessments required. I will work to promote the best interests of this Association and encourage my fellow workers to become members of the same.

This was based in part on the union\u2019s belief that \u201cfair share\u201d or \u201cagency fee\u201d alternatives and relevant court decisions \u201care not applicable in a situation in which the contract requires union membership as distinguished from an agency fee arrangement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"Ault\"> In her deposition the plaintiff admits that she did not object to the union\u2019s ideological or political positions. Thus, the defendants argue that the plaintiff\u2019s suspension was lawful because her objection was not \u201cideologically\u201d or \u201cpolitically\u201d based.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b188-24\"> The union argues that notice of an employee\u2019s objection after the employee has been suspended is too late to be effective. Because a factual determination in the plaintiff\u2019s favor that the union was on notice of her objection to joining the union prior to her suspension would obviate the need for a decision on the sufficiency of postsuspension notice, we decline to address the issue. We note, however, that there is some support for the position the later notice was sufficient. Cf. <em>Brotherhood of Ry. &amp; S.S. Clerks, Freight Handlers, Express &amp; Station Employees </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>373 U.S. 113, 119 n.6 (1963) (\u201cRespondents first made known their objection to the petitioners\u2019 political expenditures in their complaint filed in this action; however, this was early enough\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"AY-\"> Both defendants argue that the collective bargaining agreement does not require formal union membership, because the agreement provides that only those employees who fail to maintain membership \u201cto the extent of paying regular membership dues and assessments\u201d may be terminated. In fact, the MBTA\u2019s brief argues that \u201cthe union security clause at issue in this case is the \u2018practical equivalent\u2019 of an agency shop.\u201d Such an argument, however, is contrary to the position that the defendants took below. In its memorandum in support of its motion for summary judgment, the MBTA argued that it was not obligated to provide an agency service fee to its employees. In requesting the MBTA to suspend and discharge the plaintiff, the union took a similar position, see note 7, <em>supra. </em>In any case, the meaning of the collective bargaining agreement\u2019s security clause is not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b190-6\"> We also note that this case does not present for our decision any of the procedural concerns raised by <em>Chicago Teachers Local No. 1 </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>475 U.S. 292 (1986). See <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Soc\u2019y of Professors/ Faculty Staff Union/MTA/NEA, ante </em>56 (1989). In the <em>Hudson </em>case, the Supreme Court held that those employees who chose not to join the union, and chose not to support a union\u2019s ideological or political activity, and yet are asked to pay their pro rata share of the costs of collective bargaining, contract administration, and grievance adjustment are entitled to procedural protections to ensure that their fees are not used by the unions for impermissible purposes. The issue presented in this case is not the sufficiency of the union\u2019s agency fee demand nor how the collected fees are used, but rather whether the plaintiff\u2019s basis for not joining the union is sufficient to entitle her to a fair share or agency service fee alternative.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
