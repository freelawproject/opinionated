L. c. 271, \u00a7 5A (count 1) (possession or use of a gambling device) and \u00a7 7 (count 3) (setting up and promoting a lottery). We reverse his conviction under \u00a7 5A and affirm his conviction under \u00a7 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>The defendant developed a machine which he called \u201cCompupic\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and installed it at the American Legion post on Tremont Street in the Roxbury section of Boston. It resembled somewhat a slot machine. A player would insert a coin, lights would flash and numbers would be electronically generated. Sometimes coins would be disgorged as prizes.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">1. <em>Gambling device. </em>The Legislature has made it a criminal offense to manufacture, transport, sell, offer for sale, store, display, repair, recondition, possess or use \u201cany gambling device.\u201d G. L. c. 271, \u00a7 5A. The same statute defines a \u201cgambling device\u201d as \u201cany so called \u2018slot machine\u2019 or any other machine or mechanical device an essential part of which is a drum or reel with insignia thereon, and which, when operated, may deal, as a result of the application of an element of chance, any money or property; or by the operation of which a person may become entitled to receive, as a result of the application of an element of chance, any money or property.\u201d Mindful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>that a criminal statute must be construed strictly against the Commonwealth <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>391 Mass. 808, 813 [1984]), we conclude that the defendant\u2019s machine does not meet this definition because the machine had no \u201creel or drum\u201d and, therefore it was error to deny his motion for a required finding of not guilty as to count 1. Without a \u201creel or drum,\u201d it is not a \u201cgambling device\u201d within G. L. c. 271, \u00a7 5A.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">2. <em>Cross-examination of Mr. Hanlon. </em>The defendant presented Attorney Leonard Hanlon as a witness. Mr. Hanlon testified as to the advice he had given the defendant regarding the design and construction of his machine to avoid criminal liability. On cross-examination, subject to the defendant\u2019s objection, the judge permitted the prosecutor to interrogate Mr. Hanlon as to whether he had represented other manufacturers or owners of slot machines and whether he or other clients had tried to persuade clubs and halls to permit these machines to be operated on the premises. There was no error. Among other reasons, such evidence was relevant on the issue of Mr. Hanlon\u2019s bias and interest in the outcome of this case. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Graziano, </em>368 Mass. 325, 330 (1975), <em>S.C., </em>371 Mass. 596 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-11\">3. <em>Jury instructions. </em>The defendant requested the following instruction: \u201cThat if the jury finds that the Defendant did not require any consideration for the chance to win the incentive jackpot then they must find him not guilty of Count 3.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-13\">We examine the charge to the jury to determine its impression as a whole. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>359 Mass. 77, 92 (1971). A judge is not required to render an instruction in the exact words of the request. <em>Id. </em>Here, the judge at least four times instructed that the payment of consideration or price was an element which the Commonwealth had to prove. The defendant can ask for no more.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-16\">4. <em>Setting up or promoting a lottery. </em>As to G. L. c. 271, \u00a7 7, the Commonwealth was required to demonstrate the elements of a lottery. These elements are \u201cthe payment of a price and the possibility of winning a prize, depending upon hazard or chance.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivers, </em>323 Mass. 379, 381 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>(1948). There was \u201cenough evidence that could have satisfied a rational trier of fact of each such element beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677-678 (1979). The price was one quarter, and the prize was possibly a number of quarters. Clearly, the prize was dependent on chance. Therefore, it was not error to deny the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty as to count 3 alleging a violation of \u00a7 7. Accordingly, judgment is affirmed as to the count 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">The judgment under G. L. c. 271, \u00a7 5A, is reversed and the verdict is set aside. Judgment on that count is to be entered for the defendant. The judgment under G. L. c. 271, \u00a7 7, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b67-6\"> A notice on the machine provided as follows: \u201cNo purchase necessary.
