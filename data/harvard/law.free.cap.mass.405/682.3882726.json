In the first round of appellate litigation,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the court approved the application of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>certain methods of damage assessment among other issues which are no longer material.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">In the present appeal, we are asked to direct our attention to the awarding of postjudgment interest on the judgment for damages. More particularly, we are presented the following two issues for resolution: (1) Did the trial judge err in using two accrual dates because of a statutory amendment? and (2) Did the judge have any discretion to deny postjudgment interest? For reasons which follow, we affirm the order of the trial judge which, in material part, awarded postjudgment interest at the rate of 6% from January 30, 1984, the date of entry of the judgment, to March 19, 1984, the effective date of a statutory amendment increasing the rate to 12%, and further ordered that interest at the rate of 12% be added from March 19, 1984, until the judgment after rescript is satisfied in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">1. <em>Statutory amendment. </em>Prior to March 19, 1984, the effective date of St. 1983, c. 652, \u00a7 2, G. L. c. 235, \u00a7 8, was silent as to the rate of interest to be awarded after the entry of judgment. It was necessary to refer to G. L. c. 107, \u00a7 3,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which governed the rate of interest, \u201c[ijf there is no agreement or provision of law for a different rate,\u201d and provided for interest at the rate of 6%.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">General Laws c. 235, \u00a7 8, as appearing in St. 1983, c. 652, \u00a7 2,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> provides in material part for the payment of postjudgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>interest at the same rate as prejudgment interest. Prejudgment interest has been at the rate of 12% for all periods material to this case. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6B (1988 ed.).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The trial judge ordered the payment of interest at the rate of 6% from the day after the date of the judgment, January 31, 1984, until the effective date of the amendment to \u00a7 8, March 19, 1984, at which time, the rate escalated to 12%.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">The defendant argues that it was error to give effect to the amendment, relying on <em>Peak </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 726 (1985), but that reliance is misplaced because <em>Peak </em>dealt, in the main, with a time period and not a rate of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">Interest is paid as compensation for delay. <em>Murphy\u2019s Case, </em>352 Mass. 233, 234-235 (1967). It accrues daily; it is not fixed for all time on the day of the judgment as the defendant argues. As we said in <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Clerk of the Superior Court, </em>368 Mass. 116, 118 (1975): \u201cThus, the point in the proceedings to which the statutory interest rate applies is passed each day, and the rate applicable on each day is that in effect at the time.\u201d Our result also comports entirely with considerations of fairness. See <em>City Council of Waltham </em>v. <em>Vinciullo, </em>364 Mass. 624, 629 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">2. <em>Continuation of postjudgment interest after rescript. </em>The defendant argues that the judge erred in his conclusion that he was bound to order postjudgment interest after rescript. The defendant cites <em>Stokosa </em>v. <em>Waltuch, </em>378 Mass. 617, 620 (1979), where the court said that \u201c[n]one of the rules or statutes presently governing civil practice requires a clerk to compute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>interest to the date of execution or requires a judge ... to order such a computation to be performed . . . .\u201d However, since the decision in <em>Stokosa, </em>a new paragraph has been inserted in Rule 54 of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure. Mass. R. Civ. P. 54 (f), 382 Mass. 822 (1980). Rule 54 (f) provides in part: \u201cEvery judgment for the payment of money shall bear interest up to the date of payment of said judgment.\u201d The trial judge merely followed the mandate of the rule and hence, there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">\n<em>Order affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b696-15\"><em> Trinity Church in the City of Boston </em>v. <em>John Hancock Mut.
