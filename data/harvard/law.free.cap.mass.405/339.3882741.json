The defendant was sentenced to a term of from six to eight years on each conviction, all to be served concurrently. The defendant appealed, and we transferred the matter here on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>In challenging his convictions, the defendant argues that a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice was created when a police officer, who was also a prosecution witness, sat at counsel table with the prosecutor throughout the trial. The defendant also argues that it was error for the judge to deny his motion for a mistrial based upon a witness\u2019s reference to a black and white photograph of the defendant as a \u201cmug shot.\u201d We reject each of the defendant\u2019s arguments and affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The following is as much of the facts and evidence as is necessary to understand the defendant\u2019s claims. On two occasions in April, 1986, the defendant sold cocaine to Shirley Garrity (Garrity), an undercover State trooper who was participating in an ongoing investigation of suspected drug dealers in the Chelsea area. Before making the undercover narcotics buys from the defendant, Garrity met with John R. Phillips (Phillips), a Chelsea police officer, to discuss the investigation. Part of this discussion included Phillips showing Garrity photographs of suspected drug dealers, including the defendant. After each undercover narcotics buy Garrity met with Phillips and identified the defendant from a photographic array as the person from whom she purchased the cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">On July 18, 1986, the police executed a search warrant at the defendant\u2019s apartment, but found no contraband. However, while the police were conducting their search, Officer Phillips who supervised the undercover narcotics buys, saw the defendant approach the building carrying a small paper bag. Before entering the building the defendant spoke to an elderly woman who was sitting on the front steps and then went into a basement area underneath the front stairs. The defendant emerged without the bag. Phillips then arrested the defendant and, upon searching beneath the stairs, found a paper bag which contained twenty-five packets of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">At trial Garrity testified regarding her purchases of cocaine from the defendant and her identification of the defendant from the photographs shown to her by Phillips. Phillips corroborated the trooper\u2019s testimony regarding her identification of the defendant after each undercover narcotics buy. Phillips also tes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>tilled regarding his role in the execution of the search warrant at the defendant\u2019s apartment, including the seizure of the cocaine from the stairwell area.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">The prosecutor questioned both Garrity and Phillips about the occasions when the officer showed the trooper the defendant\u2019s photograph and about Garrity\u2019s subsequent selection of the defendant\u2019s photograph as a photograph of the person who sold her the cocaine. During cross-examination, the defendant questioned Garrity regarding the number of photographs of the defendant she had seen. When she testified that she had seen \u201c[t]wo \u2014 the same picture, the side and the front,\u201d the defendant moved for a mistrial, arguing that Garrity\u2019s description indicated that the photographs were mug shots. The judge denied the motion, ruling that Garrity\u2019s description of the photographs was not prejudicial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> During his cross-examination of Phillips, the defendant also posed questions about the photographs shown to Garrity. In response to the defendant\u2019s question whether the photographs were black and white, the officer answered, \u201cI believe one was a mug shot; yes.\u201d It is the denial of the defendant\u2019s second motion for a mistrial that is raised in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The defendant testified in his own defense. He denied ever selling cocaine to Garrity and testified that when he approached the apartment building, he was not carrying a bag, but rather a bottle of rum and a flashlight. He also testified that Officer Phillips arrested him before he had an opportunity to go into the stairwell area.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Prior to trial, the judge granted the defendant\u2019s motion to sequester all witnesses. The judge exempted from this order, \u201cone police officer in behalf of the Commonwealth.\u201d Therefore, throughout the trial Officer Phillips sat with the prosecutor at counsel table. The defendant objected to the officer\u2019s presence solely on the ground that it violated the sequestration order. During the impanelment, the judge also questioned the prospective jurors: \u201c[Wjould you be more likely to believe a police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>officer simply because they <em>[sic] </em>were a police officer and for no other reason, or would you be willing to just give them the same degree of credibility you would any other person after you listened to the testimony that was provided?\u201d The record reflects that no member of the venire responded that a witness\u2019s status as a police officer would affect his or her opinion as to credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">1. <em>The presence of a police witness at the prosecutor\u2019s table. </em>The defendant argues that since credibility was a key issue in the case,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the presence of Officer Phillips at the prosecutor\u2019s table throughout the trial created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The underlying premise of the defendant\u2019s argument is that the prosecutor, by having Officer Phillips sit at counsel table throughout the trial, tacitly endorsed the officer\u2019s credibility. We conclude that no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice was created by the officer\u2019s presence at counsel table.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Officer Phillips\u2019s presence in the courtroom during the course of trial was permitted by the sequestration order, which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>within the judge\u2019s discretion. We have recognized the essential role that investigating officers play in assisting with the prosecution of a particular case. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Therrien, </em>359 Mass. 500, 508 (1971) (\u201cThere is no error in such an exception from sequestration if the prospective witness, as the judge impliedly found, is essential to the management of the case\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pacheco, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 109, 122 (1981); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Washburn, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 195, 197-198 (1977); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 481, 485-486 (1975). In addition, through her questioning of prospective jurors, the judge sought to ensure that those members of the venire ultimately impaneled would not be influenced in their assessment of credibility by the mere fact that some of the witnesses would be police officers. Such an inquiry, while not constitutionally required, is certainly the more prudent approach when the case involves a \u201cclash of credibility.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sheline, </em>391 Mass. 279, 291 (1984). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Szczuka, </em>391 Mass. 666, 671-672 (1984). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nickerson, </em>388 Mass. 246, 248-249 (1983). The judge also charged the jury that it was their job to determine the credibility of the witnesses, and that they \u201cshould make this determination without sympathy, without prejudice, without fear or favor for or against either side in this case. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">Thus, considering the voir dire question, the judge\u2019s charge to the jury concerning the issue of credibility, and the implicit finding in the judge\u2019s exemption to the sequestration order, the officer\u2019s presence at counsel table did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice even in light of the clash between Officer Phillips\u2019s testimony and the defendant\u2019s testimony. The defendant cannot rest upon a bare allegation that this police officer had a \u201ccloak of credibility\u201d which was accentuated by his presence at counsel table as a sufficient basis to overturn his convictions. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v. Sheline, supra </em>at 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">The defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>United States </em>v. <em>Anagnos, </em>853 F.2d 1 (1st Cir. 1988), is misplaced.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the <em>Anagnos </em>case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>the court found that the judge\u2019s denial of a requested voir dire on the issue whether jurors would give extra credibility to witnesses simply because they were police officers was compounded by allowing the key prosecution witness to sit at counsel table. <em>Id. </em>at 4. The court did not reach the question whether such a seating arrangement by itself was error, but nevertheless stated that \u201cwe would not regard it as plain error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5. Although that court noted the general undesirability of such a practice (a view with which we concur), it recognized that the decision whether to allow such a seating arrangement must be within the trial judge\u2019s discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">2. <em>The \u201cmug shot\u201d response. </em>The defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial was based upon a reference by Officer Phillips to a \u201cmug shot\u201d photograph during cross-examination. The defendant did not move to strike the answer or request a curative instruction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Because of the potential prejudicial effect we have stated that prosecutors should avoid \u201creferences in testimony to the files from which [the photographs] were obtained.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gerald, </em>356 Mass. 386, 388 (1969). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>386 Mass. 649, 652 (1982). If the defendant had elicited the potentially prejudicial response, \u201che cannot now complain of its prejudicial effect.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Elder, </em>389 Mass. 743, 754 (1983), and cases cited. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>379 Mass. 600, 606 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gouveia, </em>371 Mass. 566, 570 (1976). Although the objectionable reference to \u201cmug shots\u201d was not particularly responsive, when considering the context of the questioning and the type of questions being posed \u201cit should have been apparent that continued interrogation . . . risked eliciting the very sort of answer the [officer] gave.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number><em>Hollyer, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 428, 431 (1979). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cain, </em>544 F.2d 1113, 1117 (1st Cir. 1976). In these circumstances, the judge did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Underwood, </em>358 Mass. 506, 513-514 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b355-7\"> The discussion regarding the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial occurred at side bar. There is no claim of error in the judge\u2019s denial of this motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b356-7\"> In her closing argument, the prosecutor stated that \u201c[t]he most important issue in this case from the Commonwealth\u2019s point of view is credibility.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b356-8\"> At trial, the defendant objected to Officer Phillips\u2019s presence at the prosecutor\u2019s table solely on the ground that it violated the judge\u2019s sequestration order. On appeal, the defendant claims that the officer\u2019s presence was a \u201ctacit endorsement\u201d of his credibility. Since the defendant based his objection below on a ground different from that raised here our review is limited, as the defendant concedes, to whether the officer\u2019s presence at counsel table created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeWolfe, </em>389 Mass. 120, 123-124 (1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>371 Mass. 862, 867 (1977); <em>Commonwealth v. Freeman, </em>352 Mass. 556, 563-564 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b356-9\"> We note, however, that an assertion of personal opinion as to the credibility of a witness is prohibited by S.J.C. Rule 3:07, DR 7-106 (c) (4), as amended, 382 Mass. 787 (1981). <em>Commonwealth v. Smith, </em>387 Mass. 900, 906 (1983). Such an assertion \u201cis peculiarly unfortunate\u201d when it has official backing. <em>Id, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth v. DeChristoforo, </em>360 Mass. 531, 547 (1971). We do not suggest that investigative officers, such as Officer Phillips in this case, must be excluded from the courtroom, or that a prosecutor cannot confer with such a witness. However, prosecutors should be mindful of the undesirability of endorsing a witness\u2019s credibility when deciding to have an essential witness sit at counsel table.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b357-6\"> We note that on August 15, 1988, the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, pursuant to rehearing en banc following recall of mandate, dismissed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>the appeal as moot. The court\u2019s judgment stated that, since the panel opinion has been vacated, it is \u201centirely without effect.\u201d Nevertheless, the reasoning of the panel opinion does not change our view. See <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b358-10\"> This failure may be because during the discussion concerning Gamty\u2019s description of the photographs as \u201cthe same picture, the side and the front\u201d the judge indicated that to call the jury\u2019s attention to the answer through a curative instruction would give the response undue emphasis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b358-11\"> Earlier, when Garrity described the defendant\u2019s photographs as being both a front and side view, the defendant raised his concern about the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>witness using the phrase \u201cmug shot.\u201d The prosecutor specifically cautioned Garrity not to refer to the photographs as mug shots in any of her responses. During the side bar discussion the prosecutor also noted that the defendant\u2019s questions risked eliciting such an answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">Although Phillips was in the courtroom when the side bar discussion occurred, he was not privy to the conversation. Nor did the defendant attempt to prevent an objectionable response during his cross-examination of Phillips by requesting that the witness be cautioned privately about referring to the photographs as mug shots. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cain, </em>544 F.2d 1113, 1117 (1st Cir. 1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b359-13\"> We note that \u201c[t]he decision whether to declare a mistrial is within the judge\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maldonado, </em>389 Mass. 626, 629 (1983). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Early, </em>349 Mass. 636, 637 (1965). Thus, our review is limited to whether it was an abuse of discretion for the judge to deny such a motion. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maldonado, supra. Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hoffer, </em>375 Mass. 369, 373 (1978). Considering the fact that Phillips\u2019s remark was brief and isolated and given the substantial evidence of guilt presented by the Commonwealth, the judge did not abuse her discretion in denying the motion for a mistrial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keevan, </em>400 Mass. 557, 571 (1987) (\u201cThe trial judge was in the best position to evaluate the prejudicial impact of the indirectly inculpatory statement . . . and he was not required to declare a mistrial\u201d [citations omitted]).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
