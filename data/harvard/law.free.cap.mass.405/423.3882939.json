The jury returned verdicts in favor of the physicians, who were originally defendants, but against the hospital, and assessed damages in the amount of $350,000. In response to the hospital\u2019s motion, the trial judge reduced the award to $20,000 pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85K (1986 ed.). On appeal, the plaintiffs challenge the reduction of the verdict as violating the equal protection and due process clauses of the Massachusetts and United States Constitutions and the trial by jury guarantee of art. 15 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution. We transferred the case to this court on our own initiative.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b438-11\">This court adopted the doctrine of charitable immunity in 1876. In <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Gen. Hosp., </em>120 Mass. 432, 436 (1876), we held that Massachusetts General Hospital, a public charity, would not be liable to one injured by the negligence of agents of the hospital. The court reasoned that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>hospital held its funds in trust for the benefit of the public, and that it would be an unlawful diversion of those funds to apply them to the satisfaction of a judgment based on the negligence of hospital agents. <em>Id. </em>at 435-436. See <em>Roosen </em>v. <em>Peter Bent Brigham Hosp., </em>235 Mass. 66, 69 (1920). Following our decision in <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Gen. Hosp., supra, </em>we consistently applied the charitable immunity doctrine to hospitals and other charitable organizations until G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85K, became effective on September 16, 1971. St. 1971, c. 785. See, e.g., <em>Ricker </em>v. <em>Northeastern Univ., </em>361 Mass. 169, 172 (1972) (private university); <em>Boxer </em>v. <em>Boston Symphony Orchestra, Inc., </em>342 Mass. 537, 538-541 (1961) (symphony orchestra); <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Young Men\u2019s Christian Ass\u2019n, </em>324 Mass. 365, 369 (1949) (association promoting moral, mental, and physical welfare of young men); <em>Reavy </em>v. <em>Guild of St. Agnes, </em>284 Mass. 300, 302 (1933) (temporary shelter provided to needy women and children).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">In <em>Simpson </em>v. <em>Truesdale Hosp., Inc., </em>338 Mass. 787, 787-788 (1958), the plaintiff urged us to overrule <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Gen. Hosp., supra. </em>We declined, noting that \u201c[wjhile as an original proposition the doctrine might not commend itself to us today, it has been firmly imbedded in our law for over three quarters of a century and we think that its \u2018termination should be at legislative, rather than at judicial, hands\u2019 (citations omitted).\u201d Later, in <em>Colby </em>v. <em>Carney Hosp., </em>356 Mass. 527, 528 (1969), we again observed that any renunciation of the charitable immunity doctrine would be best accomplished by legislative action. However, on the assumption that legislative action would be unlikely in the near future, we announced our intention to abolish the doctrine \u201cthe next time we [were to be] squarely confronted by a legal question respecting [it].\u201d <em>Id. </em>In 1971, after our decision in <em>Colby, </em>the Legislature enacted G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85K. Section 85K abolishes the doctrine of charitable immunity, and limits the liability of charitable institutions to $20,000 if the tort was committed in the course of an activity carried on to accomplish the purpose of the charitable organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>In <em>Colby, supra, </em>the defendant in its answer had advanced charitable immunity as a defense. The plaintiff demurred, contending that the doctrine violated the Federal and Massachusetts Constitutions. We affirmed the judge\u2019s overruling of the demurrer, saying that \u201c[njothing ha[d] been brought to our attention suggesting that the doctrine of charitable immunity is repugnant to any provision of the Constitutions of the United States and the Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 528. The plaintiffs now challenge the constitutionality of the $20,000 statutory cap. Consistently with our statement in <em>Colby, </em>which at least suggested that the doctrine of charitable immunity is constitutional , we hold today that the statutory cap also is constitutional. We are not without misgivings about the paltriness of the $20,000 cap, especially in light of the decline in the value of the dollar since 1971, but we cannot correctly declare the statute to be unconstitutional. A change in the amount of the cap may be appropriate but that is a legislative decision.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">The plaintiffs challenge \u00a7 85K as violating their right to a jury trial guaranteed by art. 15. It does not. The right to a jury trial does not grant to a party the right to put to a jury any question he or she wishes. Rather, the right to a jury trial means that, with respect to those questions of fact that the substantive law makes material, the party has the right to have the determination made by a jury. See <em>Karlowski </em>v. <em>Kissock, </em>275 Mass. 180, 182 (1931); <em>Bothwell </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Ry., </em>215 Mass. 467 (1913). No question material to the plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action was withdrawn from the jury. Under the substantive law of torts of this Commonwealth, charitable organizations are not liable for personal injuries in excess of $20,000, and therefore the plaintiffs had no right to a jury determination of damages in excess of that amount. <em>Pinnick </em>v. <em>Cleary, </em>360 Mass. 1 (1971), is on point. In <em>Pinnick, </em>we held that, although the no-fault automobile insurance statute, St. 1970, c. 670, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>eliminated an individual\u2019s right to damages for pain and suffering unless his or her medical expenses were at least $500,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or the injuries were of a particular kind, the statute did not violate the jury trial guarantee of art. 15. <em>Id. </em>at 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">The case of <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>St. Vincent Hospital, </em>Inc., 273 Ind. 374 (1980), like the present case, raised the question whether the imposition of a cap on damages violates a right to jury trial provided by a State constitution. Although the cap in that case was $500,000, the principle involved is the same. In rejecting the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the limitation on damages violated their jury trial rights, the Supreme Court of Indiana reasoned that \u201c[t]he Legislature may terminate an entire valid and provable claim through a statute of limitation. It may validly cause the loss of the right to trial by jury through failure to comply with the requirement to assert the right by procedural rule. It is the policy of this Act that recoveries be limited to $500,000, and to this extent the right to have the jury assess damages is available. No more is required by Art. I, \u00a7 20, of the Indiana Constitution in this context.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 401. Similarly, art. 15 guaranteed the plaintiffs\u2019 right to have the jury assess damages up to $20,000, but nothing more. Thus, there was no infringement of the plaintiffs\u2019 right to jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">We turn our attention to the plaintiffs\u2019 other contentions, namely, that \u00a7 85K violates their rights to equal protection and substantive due process by impermissibly infringing on \u201cthe personal, substantive right of a tort victim to recover damages. \u201d We have repeatedly said that those who challenge the constitutionality of a statute that does not burden a suspect group or a fundamental interest \u201ccarry a heavy burden in seeking to overcome the statute\u2019s presumption of constitutionality.\u201d <em>Blue Hills Cemetery, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Embalming &amp; Funeral Directing, </em>379 Mass. 368, 371 (1979), quoting <em>American Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>374 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>Mass. 181, 190 (1978). <em>Klein </em>v. <em>Catalano, </em>386 Mass. 701, 706-707 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">The statute at issue does not burden a suspect group, and \u201cthe personal, substantive right of a tort victim to recover damages\u201d is not a \u201cfundamental interest.\u201d For purposes of equal protection analysis under the Federal and State Constitutions, our opinions declare that, \u201c[a]bsent a showing that a statute burdens a suspect group or fundamental interest, it will be upheld as long as it is rationally related to the furtherance of a legitimate State interest.\u201d <em>Dickerson </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>396 Mass. 740, 743 (1986). <em>Klein </em>v. <em>Catalano, supra </em>at 715. The statute \u201conly need[s] be supported by a conceivable, rational basis.\u201d <em>Fine </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>401 Mass. 639, 641 (1988). Nonetheless, the plaintiffs urge us to employ a third, intermediate level of scrutiny, one that is less strict than is appropriate to determine the constitutionality of a statute that burdens a suspect class or fundamental interest but stricter than the \u201crational basis\u201d test. See <em>Paro </em>v. <em>Longwood Hosp., </em>373 Mass. 645, 649 n.6 (1977). Under such a third level of review, the plaintiffs tell us, quoting <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>404 U.S. 71, 76 (1971), the court must determine whether the classifications created by the statute are \u201creasonable, not arbitrary\u201d and \u201crest upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation, so that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike.\u201d Quoting <em>Massachusetts Bd. of Retirement </em>v. <em>Murgia, </em>427 U.S. 307, 320 (1970) (Marshall, J., dissenting), the plaintiffs say that the court should make its determination \u201conly after a reasonably probing look at the legislative goals and means, and at the significance of the personal rights and interests invaded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">We agree with the plaintiffs that equal protection analysis requires the court to look carefully at the purpose to be served by the statute in question and at the degree of harm to the affected class. We have observed that characterizing the tests to be applied to determine the constitutional validity of legislation as \u201creasonable relation\u201d and \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d is a \u201cshorthand for referring to the opposite ends of a continuum of consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>tutional vulnerability determined at every point by the competing values involved.\u201d <em>Marcoux </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>375 Mass. 63, 65 n.4 (1978). However, our acceptance of that method of analysis does not require us to adopt a third level of review. The rational basis test \u201cincludes a requirement that an impartial lawmaker could logically believe that the classification would serve a legitimate public purpose that transcends the harm to the members of the disadvantaged class.\u201d <em>Cleburne </em>v. <em>Cleburne Living Center, Inc., </em>473 U.S. 432, 452 (1985) (Stevens, J., concurring). In connection with such an analysis, the significance of a limitation of $20,000 on recovery against charities for personal injuries is a relevant factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 equal protection attack is twofold. They argue that (1) \u00a7 85K has no legitimate purpose, and (2) even if \u00a7 85K has a legitimate purpose, the means chosen by the Legislature to accomplish the objective bear no rational relation to it. The objective of \u00a7 85K clearly is to protect the funds of charitable institutions so they may be devoted to charitable purposes. That objective is just as clearly legitimate. If a charity\u2019s property were \u201cdepleted by the payment of damages its usefulness might be either impaired or wholly destroyed, the object of the founder or donors defeated, and charitable, gifts discouraged.\u201d <em>St. Clair </em>v. <em>Trustees of Boston Univ., 25 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 662, 666 (1988), quoting <em>Farrigan </em>v. <em>Pevear, </em>193 Mass. 147, 149 (1906). The plaintiffs argue that the protection of charitable organizations\u2019 property against judgments in personal injury actions is not a legitimate objective because the availability of insurance, the \u201cUniversal Health Care Bill,\u201d the institution of malpractice tribunals pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B (1986 ed.), modification of the collateral source rule pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7\u00a7 60F, 60G, and 60H (1986 ed.), and the Statewide uncompensated care pool to reimburse hospitals for services rendered to nonpaying emergency room patients pursuant to G. L. c. 6A, \u00a7 75 (1986 ed.), make statutory protection, at least as to hospitals, unnecessary. However, the availability of these sources of protection of charitable funds is not inconsistent with a legislative purpose to provide still further protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>The plaintiffs also argue that the discrimination between the victims of charitable tortfeasors and other victims, between the seriously injured victims of charitable tortfeasors and those with minor injuries, between \u201cwealthy\u201d charities and impoverished ones, and between charities and noncharities, wrought by \u00a7 85K, cannot be viewed as a rational means of accomplishing the legislative objective, even if the objective is considered legitimate, of protecting charitable funds. The plaintiffs emphasize the low amount of the statutory cap, arguing that frequently the expenses involved in litigating a serious personal injury negligence case against a hospital may far exceed the allowable recovery. Nevertheless, while we acknowledge the validity of the plaintiffs\u2019 assertion, it is not the court\u2019s prerogative to determine whether a more equitable distribution of the burden of negligently inflicted personal injuries could be devised. We cannot say that there is no rational relationship between \u00a7 85K\u2019s cap on damages and the statute\u2019s legitimate objective of preserving charitable assets. <em>See. Hearn </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>389 Mass. 404, 406 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 final argument is that \u00a7 85K offends their substantive due process rights by failing to provide an adequate substitute for the common law right to recover full compensation for negligently inflicted personal injuries. In cases such as this, where the right infringed on is not a \u201cfundamental\u201d right, we have stated that the question under the due process clause of the Federal Constitution is \u201cwhether the statute bears a reasonable relation to a permissible legislative objective,\u201d <em>Pinnick </em>v. <em>Cleary, supra </em>at 14, and, under the analogous provisions of the State Constitution as whether the statute \u201cbears real and substantial relation to public health, safety, morals, or some other phase of the general welfare.\u201d <em>Blue Hills Cemetery, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Embalming &amp; Funeral Directing, supra </em>at 373, quoting <em>Sperry &amp; Hutchinson Co. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of the Necessaries of Life, </em>307 Mass. 408, 418 (1940). Citing <em>Decker </em>v. <em>Black &amp; Decker Mfg. Co., </em>389 Mass. 35, 43 (1983), and <em>Klein </em>v. <em>Catalano, </em>386 Mass. 701 (1982), the plaintiffs argue that \u201c[i]f no substitute remedy is supplied, then the abrogation [of the common law right] must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>be rationally related to a permissible legislative objective.\u201d In addressing the plaintiffs\u2019 equal protection argument, we determined that \u00a7 85K is rationally related to a permissible legislative objective. Further discussion is not required. We conclude that \u00a7 85K\"does not offend the plaintiffs\u2019 due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b438-12\"> We acknowledge the filing of amicus curiae briefs on behalf of the following organizations: Independent School Association of Massachusetts; Massachusetts Association of Nonprofit Schools and Colleges; Massachusetts Council of Human Services Providers, Inc.; Massachusetts Hospital Association, Inc.; Association of Trial Lawyers of America; The Beth Israel Hospital Association; Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, Inc.; The Children\u2019s Hospital; Dana Farber Cancer Institute; Massachusetts General Hospital; Mount Auburn Hospital; and New England Deaconess Hospital.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b440-5\"> According to the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers U.S. City Average All Item Index published by the United States Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics, the purchasing power of $1 in 1971 was the same as the purchasing power of $3.04 in April, 1989.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b441-7\"> But see St. 1988, c. 273, \u00a7 55 (now $2,000).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">We note that St. 1988, c. 273, \u00a7 15, amended the definition of the term, \u201cPersonal injury protection,\u201d in G.
