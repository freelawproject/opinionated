See G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>c. 152, \u00a7 15 (1986 ed.).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The injured claimant, Thomas L. Daly, agreed to pay his attorney, Mr. James N. Esdaile, Jr., a contingent legal fee of one-third of any third-party recovery. Travelers Insurance Company (Travelers), which insured Daly\u2019s employer, was fully reimbursed out of the third-party settlement for the compensation it paid Daly. The settlement apportioned Esdaile\u2019s fee between Daly and Travelers. Travelers appealed the DIA\u2019s decision, asserting that it cannot be held liable to pay Esdaile a fee out of its share of the settlement because it has not retained Esdaile to represent it, nor agreed to pay Esdaile a contingency fee; and because Esdaile\u2019s representation of both Travelers\u2019 and Daly\u2019s interests in the third-party action would constitute a conflict of interest in violation of S.J.C. Rule 3:07, Canon 5, DR 5-105, as appearing in 382 Mass. 781 (1981). We transferred the case to this court on our own motion. We must determine if the DIA erred as a matter of law in apportioning Esdaile\u2019s fee between Travelers and Daly. See <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>390 Mass. 208, 228-229 (1983). See also G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12 (2); G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7). We conclude there was no error. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Daly was injured July 2, 1983, in the course of his employment when a tractor-trailer he was driving skidded off the highway in Troy, New Hampshire, and fell down an eighty-foot embankment. Travelers eventually paid Daly a total of $92,000 in workers\u2019 compensation. Daly meanwhile retained Esdaile to represent him in a third-party action against the highway construction company which allegedly was responsible for the slippery condition of the road on which Daly was injured. That action was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire in December, 1983. Esdaile conducted extensive discovery, including approximately twelve depositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>In January, 1984, Esdaile wrote to a Joseph Leary at Travelers, stating Esdaile\u2019s position that Travelers\u2019 \u201cretention of additional counsel [in the third-party action would] be at the expense of Travelers and [would] not alter or amend [Esdaile\u2019s firm\u2019s] right to [its] one-third fee to be proportionately divided between the insurer and the recipient of the workers\u2019 compensation.\u201d Leary replied on April 4, 1984, stating that Travelers disagreed with Esdaile\u2019s interpretation of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15, and that it intended to retain its own counsel. Leary\u2019s letter continued: \u201cNor do we feel bound by any fee arrangement which you may have made with the plaintiff, and wish to make it plain that any legal fees payable by the insurer under [G. L. c. 152, \u00a7] 15 on this case, will be paid to counsel of our choice and not to your firm, whom we have never retained and with whom we have in fact no agreement whatsoever. While it is in the interest of both the employee and the insurer to cooperate in order to obtain a recovery from the [t]hird-party, circumstances may arise and indeed have with other counsel, especially in a negotiation of a settlement, where there could be a real conflict of interest on the part of your office in representing both parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">Travelers\u2019 attorney, Mr. Peter D. Cole, filed an appearance in the pending third-party action on April 3, 1984, purportedly appearing on behalf of Daly, although he had no agreement with Daly to do so. On April 5, 1984, Esdaile wrote to Cole, reiterating the position he had taken with Leary. Esdaile also noted the weaknesses he perceived in his client\u2019s third-party action and expressed his concern that Travelers disputed its liability for its proportionate share of the contingent fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">In May, 1986, and then again in October, 1986, Esdaile wrote to Cole outlining the settlement negotiations he had had with the third-party defendants and requesting that Travelers consider reducing its claim for reimbursement. Travelers refused to reduce its claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">On October 7, 1986, Daly signed a release settling the third-party action for $225,000. Cole and Esdaile continued to correspond concerning their disagreement over Travelers\u2019 liability for Esdaile\u2019s fee. On October 15, 1986, Esdaile advised Cole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>that Travelers\u2019 \u201cunwillingness ... to comply with the provisions of [G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15,] constitutes an unfair claims settlement practice under the provisions of [G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3 (9)], and in particular subsections 3(9)f and 3(9)g. As you know, a violation of the unfair claims practices act constitutes an unfair trade practice under the provisions of [G. L. c.] 93A.\u201d Esdaile expressed his intention to bring an action against Travelers if it did not \u201ccease and desist [its] efforts to shift the legal fees incurred directly by the Travelers . . . to . . . Daly\u201d and \u201cto obstruct the third-party settlement now available to . . . Daly.\u201d Travelers thereafter agreed to let the settlement proceed, with the amount assertedly due Esdaile out of Travelers\u2019 portion (i.e., one-third of $92,000) to be held in escrow pending resolution of that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">The DIA approved the third-party settlement in February, 1987. In May, 1987, the DIA ordered that the escrowed sum be paid to Esdaile. The DIA noted that Travelers \u201c[did] not claim to be dissatisfied with the terms of the settlement, nor [did] it contend that its counsel performed any services in the tort action.\u201d The DIA concluded that Travelers\u2019 obligation to pay Esdaile out of its share of the settlement arose by statute and could not be disavowed unilaterally.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Travelers argues that the language of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15, does not anticipate cases in which two attorneys are necessary in the third-party action to represent the divergent interests of the employee and the insurer. In such circumstances, Travelers argues, if the insurer were required to pay part of the employee\u2019s attorney\u2019s fee, the insurer would in effect be forced into an attorney-client relationship with an attorney not of the insurer\u2019s choosing, and with an attorney who represents an interest in conflict with the insurer\u2019s own. Alternatively, Travelers argues that, if it is liable to Esdaile at all, it cannot be held to the one-third contingency rate agreed to between Daly and Esdaile, in as much as Travelers was not a party to that agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 15 (1986 ed.), mandates reimbursement of an insurer out of a third-party recovery. We have said it would be unfair to permit the employee to recover twice for the same injury. <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Midwest Coast Transp., Inc., </em>400 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Mass. 779, 783 (1987), citing <em>Richard </em>v. <em>Arsenault, </em>349 Mass. 521, 524 (1965). In <em>Hunter, </em>we also said that there is no \u201cunfairness to an insurer in a system that reimburses the insurer for benefits paid . . . but requires it to pay the legal freight for the benefits it realizes.\u201d <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Midwest Coast Transp., Inc., supra </em>at 785.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>Hunter, </em>the insurer was required to pay one-third of each future claim for compensation as it arose until the entire excess was exhausted. These payments would represent the insurer\u2019s share of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney\u2019s fee \u201cfor that part of a third-party recovery which ultimately redound[ed] to the benefit of the insurer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although the instant case concerns the insurer\u2019s liability for the plaintiff\u2019s attorney\u2019s fee on a settlement that reimburses the insurer for payments already made, the reasoning of <em>Hunter </em>is determinative.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">We reject Travelers\u2019 argument that Daly \u201cforced\u201d it to enter an attorney-client relationship with Esdaile. Esdaile represents Daly only. Travelers is a beneficiary of the third-party action by virtue of the provisions of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15. Further, Travelers had the opportunity to be heard before the DIA on the merits of the settlement, and to raise any other objections it might have. Where, as here, the third-party recovery is equal to or greater than the insurer\u2019s claim, the insurer is benefited. Cf. <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Atlantic Research Corp., </em>358 Mass. 764, 767 (1971).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>Travelers argues as a matter of policy that the employee\u2019s attorney should only be able to collect a fee based on the amount realized for the employee, that is, after the insurer\u2019s portion is deducted. Travelers also argues that the employee\u2019s attorney should receive a lower fee on a quantum meruit basis on the insurer\u2019s portion. Travelers argues that, if an insurer must pay the employee\u2019s attorney the full contingency fee rate on its portion of the third-party recovery, the attorney\u2019s incentive to negotiate a reduced claim for reimbursement is undermined. Travelers concludes that such an interpretation of the statute thus is contrary to the employee\u2019s best interest, which is \u201cparamount\u201d under the statute.* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">\u201cIn the absence of evidence to the contrary we must assume that counsel. . . will conduct themselves according to acceptable professional standards . . . and that they will exercise good faith and due diligence in the discharge of their duties.\u201d <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Atlantic Research </em>Corp., <em>supra </em>at 767. In cases under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15, limiting the attorney\u2019s fee to the excess recovery beyond the amount of the insurer\u2019s claim could make it more difficult for employees to find attorneys to represent them where the third-party recovery is likely to be modest because of the amount of the insurer\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">Travelers concedes that under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15, Daly had the right to control the litigation. Travelers asserts that part of the legislative purpose behind the statute is to ensure that the insurer does not get free legal advice. Travelers argues that because it was not permitted to participate in the litigation and in fact repeatedly disclaimed \u201cfree legal advice\u201d (in the form of Esdaile\u2019s services), it should not be held liable to pay him a fee. Travelers is, of course, free to retain its own attorney to protect its perceived interests. Travelers\u2019 attorney made no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>contribution to the prosecution of the case and conferred no benefit either on the employee or on the employee\u2019s attorney, however. There is, therefore, no reason to shift the cost of Travelers\u2019 attorney either to the employee or to the employee\u2019s attorney. Under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15, Travelers\u2019 duty to contribute to the cost of the third-party litigation, from which it benefits, does not depend on whether it hires its own attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">The provision in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15, for repayment of compensation is entwined with the provision for apportionment of attorney\u2019s fees. Travelers cannot have the benefit of the former without sharing the burden of the latter. \u201cMassachusetts law requires the insurer ... to pay its share of attorney\u2019s fees and cost[s] . . . .\u201d <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Midwest Coast Transp., Inc., supra </em>at 780-781.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">A majority of courts in other jurisdictions with similar workers\u2019 compensation statutes have reached the same result that the DIA reached. See, e.g., <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Lincolnshire Group, Ltd., </em>167 Ill. App. 3d 978 (1988); <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Dillinger, </em>117 Ill. App. 3d 213 (1983); <em>Kimpling </em>v. <em>Canty, </em>13 Ill. App. 3d 919 (1973); <em>Reno </em>v. <em>Maryland Casualty Co., </em>27 Ill. 2d 245 (1963); <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>National Carriers, Inc., </em>240 Kan. 101 (1986); <em>Potter </em>v. <em>Vector, </em>355 Mich. 328 (1959); <em>Courtney </em>v. <em>Babel, </em>293 Minn. 328 (1972); <em>Teller </em>v. <em>Major Sales, Inc., </em>64 N.J. 143 (1974); <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Lumber Mut. Casualty Ins. Co., </em>20 N.J. Super. 265 (1952); <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>State Ins. Fund, </em>60 N.Y.2d 131 (1983); <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>123 Misc.2d 812 (N.Y. Super. Ct. 1984); <em>Greenough </em>v. <em>Deblinger, </em>84 Misc.2d 463 (N.Y. Super. Ct. 1975); <em>Reese </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Bd., 95 </em>Pa. Commw. 325 (1986); <em>Long </em>v. <em>Marino Masse, Inc., </em>205 Pa. Super. 344 (1965). See generally Annot., 74 A.L.R.3d 854, 880 \u00a7 7 (1976 &amp; Supp. 1987). Even in the absence of a statute apportioning costs between the employee and the insurer, other courts have required the insurer to contribute to the cost of the third-party litigation. See <em>Moody </em>v. <em>Arabie, </em>498 So.2d 1081 (La. 1986); <em>Quinn </em>v. <em>State, </em>15 Cal.3d 162 (1975). Generally, courts reaching the opposite result reflect differences in the individual State\u2019s statutory scheme. See Annot., 74 A.L.R.3d 854, 875, \u00a7 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number><em>Costs of the appeal.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Daly claims attorney\u2019s fees and costs of this appeal, pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12A (as amended through St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 27).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Travelers argues that \u00a7 12A cannot apply to the instant case because it is \u201csubstantive\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 2A, and hence can only apply to cases in which the injury occurred on or after the effective date of the act. Travelers also argues that the Legislature could not have intended to award attorney\u2019s fees to an attorney seeking his own fee, where the employee-client has no real interest in the outcome of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 2A, defines as \u201csubstantive,\u201d and hence prospective, those amendments to G. L. c. 152 which \u201cincrease[ ] the amount ... of compensation payable to an injured employee . . . .\u201d Those amendments to G. L. p. 152 which are not \u201csubstantive\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2A are \u201cdeemed to be procedural or remedial only, in character, and shall have application to personal injuries irrespective of the date of their occurrence . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 2A. Nothing in the act that amended \u00a7 12A specified whether it was to be considered \u201csubstantive\u201d or \u201cprocedural or remedial.\u201d See St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7\u00a7 27, 65, and 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">The provision in \u00a7 12A for award of counsel fees to the employee who prevails on appeal does not increase the compensation payable to the employee. The provision is thus procedural and not substantive. We stated in another context that the word \u201ccompensation . . . was intended ... to comprehend all proceedings available under the statute to obtain monetary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>awards <em>for an injury </em>to an employee\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Thayer\u2019s Case, </em>345 Mass. 36, 43 (1962) (word \u201ccompensation\u201d in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 41, applies to claim for double compensation under \u00a7 28). Attorney\u2019s fees, in contrast, are \u201cordinary costs . . . incidental to the procedural machinery established for the ascertainment of the amount due to an injured employee.\u201d <em>Ahmed\u2019s Case, </em>278 Mass. 180, 185-186 (1932).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As a \u201cprocedural or remedial\u201d provision, St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 27, would apply irrespective of the date of injury. See <em>Murphy\u2019s Case, </em>352 Mass. 233, 234-235 (1967). Cf. <em>Beausoleil's Case, </em>321 Mass. 344, 346-347 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">The provision awarding attorney\u2019s fees is \u201can incentive to vindicate . . . protected rights.\u201d <em>Stratos </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>387 Mass. 312, 317 (1982) (remanding for award of costs and fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988). \u201cOne aim of the workers\u2019] compensation act is that there be speedy ascertainment and payment of the amount due to an injured employee. ... [A provision for fees and costs] enlarges to a comparatively small extent the beneficent design of the workers\u2019] compensation act.... So far as the imposition of these costs may tend to discourage improvident claims for review by insurers, it promotes that design. \u201d <em>Ahmed\u2019s Case, supra at </em>187. <em>See Stratos </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, supra </em>at 325 (\u201c[T]ime spent .in establishing and defending a fee . . . should be included in the final calculation of the award. Exclusion of such services would dilute the value of the award, and so frustrate the purpose of the act authorizing fees\u201d). We note that the 1985 amendment \u2022to \u00a7 12A broadens the section\u2019s formerly restrictive terms. See <em>Rival\u2019s Case, </em>383 Mass. 172 (1981) (under former \u00a7 12A, attorney\u2019s fees denied to employee who was awarded compensation only after prosecuting appeal). Because the entire fee, in fact, is from the employee, Travelers\u2019 assertion that Daly himself has no interest in the outcome of this appeal is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>supported by the record. See note 3, <em>supra. </em>See also <em>Torres </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>391 Mass. 1, 14-16 (1984) (under G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 3B, court may award attorney\u2019s fees even when plaintiff has no obligation to pay legal services organization).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">We therefore hold that G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12A, applies and that Daly has \u201cprevailed\u201d within the meaning of that section. The statute provides that the court \u201cshall allow\u201d fees and costs of the appeal when the employee prevails. \u201cCommonly [the] word [\u2018shall\u2019] in a statute imports a mandatory direction and not a precatory suggestion.\u201d <em>Ahmed\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 185. Costs for attorney\u2019s fees, briefs, and necessary expenses for this appeal shall be determined by the single justice. The decision of the DIA is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b48-6\"> The relevant portion of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15 (1986 ed.), provides: \u201cThe expense of any attorney\u2019s fees shall be divided between the insurer and the employee in proportion to the amounts received by them respectively under this section.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b51-6\"> The settlement disbursement approved by the DIA showed Daly and Travelers each paying Esdaile one-third of the share attributable to each. As a matter of bookkeeping, the same result is reached if Daly pays Esdaile one-third of the gross settlement amount and Travelers remits one-third of its share to Daly. The latter formulation has the advantage of showing that the burden of attorney\u2019s fees falls primarily on Daly. See <em>Hunter, supra </em>at 783-784 (assumes that attorney\u2019s fee remains same, based on gross third-party recovery, regardless whether insurer required to contribute to fee). Thus, contrary to Travelers\u2019 assertion, its refusal to remit part of its share of the settlement does have the effect of shifting the burden either to Daly or Esdaile. Further, its remittance of a portion of its share in the settlement either to Daly or to Esdaile does not constitute a violation of DR 5-107 (A) (1) (prohibiting an attorney from accepting compensation from anyone other titan the client, except with the client\u2019s consent). The entire fee is from the employee, pursuant to his or her agreement with the attorney.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b51-7\"> Contrary to Travelers\u2019 assertion, there was no conflict of interest for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>Esdaile in seeking to reduce Travelers\u2019 claim; it was completely consistent with his vigorous representation of his only client, Daly. As for Travelers, it may reject any effort to reduce its claim and, in fact, did so. The insurer\u2019s interest therefore is not in conflict with the employee\u2019s.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b52-11\"> The record does not support Travelers\u2019 assumption. Esdaile, in fact, did attempt to negotiate a reduced claim. As noted earlier, Travelers declined to reduce its claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b54-6\"> Daly sought costs of this appeal in his brief. Travelers filed a reply brief addressed to that issue. Daly filed a motion to strike Travelers\u2019 reply brief. Travelers filed an opposition to that motion and a motion for leave to file a reply brief. We deny Daly\u2019s motion and decide the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b54-7\"> The first sentence of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12A, states: \u201cIf on appeal to the appeals court or the supreme judicial court pursuant to section twelve the claimant prevails, the court shall allow the claimant, in addition to the award in the judgment, an amount equal to the reasonable cost of his attorney\u2019s fees, briefs and other necessary expenses that result from the appeal.\u201d The instant appeal is pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12 (2). Daly makes no claim that Travelers\u2019 appeal is frivolous. See G.
