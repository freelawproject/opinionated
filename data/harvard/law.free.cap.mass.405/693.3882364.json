Mercedes (defendant) for relief under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3 (1988 ed.). The two issues posed are: (1) Was the evidence of guilt sufficient as matter of law, and (2) do double jeopardy principles bar the retrial of the defendant?</p>\n<p id=\"b707-14\">1. <em>Sufficiency of evidence. </em>At the trial of the defendant on an indictment charging possession of cocaine with intent to distribute (G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A [1988 ed.]), there was evidence of a supply of cocaine in a store, the keys to which the defendant had in his possession, and a balance scale in the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>apartment. The defendant acknowledged that the cocaine was his and that he had placed it under a stair in the store\u2019s cellar where it was seized. He had in his possession a substantial amount of money when apprehended. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, a \u201crational trier of fact could have found the essential elements\u2019\u2019 of the crime of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>393 Mass. 793, 794 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">2. <em>Double jeopardy. </em>After the defense rested, the Commonwealth recalled a rebuttal witness, a State trooper who had testified during the presentation of the Commonwealth\u2019s casein-chief. The purpose of the recall was to elicit evidence contradicting the direct testimony of a witness on the issue of the defendant\u2019s residence in the apartment where the scale was seized. The trooper testified that the witness had told him on the day of the search that the defendant had been living at the apartment for about one month.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On cross-examination defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>counsel drew from the trooper that he had previously stopped the defendant because of his driving behavior, and then the following colloquy ensued: Q.: \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that you never stopped and talked to Mr. Jesus Mercedes pursuant to any type of drug investigation whatsoever; that\u2019s the truth, right?\u201d A.: \u201cNo, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>The defendant then moved for a mistrial which the judge allowed. The defendant argues that double jeopardy bars retrial after a mistrial has been declared. Under both Federal and Massachusetts law, the protection against double jeopardy bars a retrial after a mistrial is declared on a defendant\u2019s motion if \u201cthe prosecutor intended to provoke a mistrial or otherwise engaged in \u2018overreaching\u2019 or \u2018harassment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>404 Mass. 1, 4 (1989). In this instance, there was no such misconduct. In fact, it was the defendant who was responsible for the State trooper\u2019s statement which resulted in the mistrial. There is no bar to a retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">The order of the single justice denying relief is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b708-6\"> The transcript yields the following relevant colloquy:</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">The prosecutor: \u201cAnd were you ever part of the Great Brook Valley Task Force?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">The witness: \u201cWhen the Great Brook Valley Task Force was initiated by the District Attorney, I was one of the first members assigned. I had an active investigation almost on a daily basis in the Great Brook Valley section of Worcester for approximately one and a half years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">The judge: \u201cCounsel, can I just see you for a moment?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-10\">(Bench Conference:</p>\n<p id=\"b708-11\">The judge: \u201cWhat is this all about?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-12\">The prosecutor: \u201cThe young girl testified as to his residing at Chino Avenue every six months for three weeks. I want to ask the witness whether or not he saw him \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-13\">The judge: \u201cYou want to establish that he was down there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-14\">The prosecutor: \u201cThat he was down there, and that he lived there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-15\">The judge: \u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-16\">Defense counsel: \u201cJudge, it\u2019s being introduced by way of this trooper testifying that he is a member of the Great Brook Valley Task Force with all kinds of innuendo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-17\">The judge: \u201cMaybe I can do something in the instruction to cure that, but I think you do have a valid point in terms of rebuttal, so keep it to that subject matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-18\">End of Bench Conference)</p>\n<p id=\"b708-19\">The prosecutor: \u201cWhile you were down in the Great Brook Valley area, did you ever see the defendant down there?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>The witness: \u201cOn numerous times I have.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">The prosecutor: \u201cAnd approximately how many times?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">The witness: \u201cPerhaps in excess of fifty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">The prosecutor: \u201cAnd did you know where he was living at that time?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AUd\">The witness: \u201cYes, ma\u2019am, I do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">The prosecutor: \u201cAnd where was that?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-10\">The witness: \u201cAt the titne dating back approximately three years from today\u2019s testimony until approximately the last year and a half, I\u2019ve known him to often park his vehicle and reside at 81 Chino Ave. On several occasions I have stopped and spoke with [the defendant]. He \u2014\"</p>\n<p id=\"AGf\">Defense counsel: \u201cObjection, your Honor. Can I have a side bar?\u201d (Bench Conference:</p>\n<p id=\"b709-11\">Defense counsel: \u201cMotion for a mistrial, your Honor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-12\">The judge: \u201cCan this be cured with respect to anything? If he was asked by [defense counsel] for example, to try and deal with this, the reason he stopped this reiiow. What reason? In other words, it\u2019s not in his official function.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-13\">The prosecutor: \u201cWell, police officers talk to everybody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-14\">The judge: \u201cRight. In other words it should be made clear. That\u2019s why I called you over the first time, just to make sure that [defense counsel] can establish on cross that it was contact with him strictly like a police officer would have with any other citizen on the block, not because he\u2019s involved in a drug investigation. If that\u2019s the situation, I\u2019ll grant a mistrial. If it isn\u2019t \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-15\">Defense counsel: \u201cJudge, I think that\u2019s definitely the situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-16\">The judge: \u201cIs that the situation?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-17\">Defense counsel: \u201cThis case is gone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-18\">The prosecutor: \u201cI don\u2019t believe so. He\u2019s just going to testify that he saw him. At least that\u2019s what he told me yesterday.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-19\">Defense counsel: \u201cHe testified that he stopped him on several occasions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-20\">The judge: \u201cWhat I\u2019m going to do is this: I\u2019m going to let you try your case, both of you, and the chips will fall wherever they may. All I\u2019m saying is if it comes out that his knowledge of his being there has more to do with his being around the area and saying hello and so forth, I think it\u2019s still a live issue for the jury, and there\u2019s no prejudice. But if it comes out to the effect that he was investigating him at the Valley, of course I\u2019ll grant a mistrial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"APp\">The prosecutor: \u201cCan we take a minute recess so I can talk to the trooper and tell him not to?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-21\">The judge: \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>Defense counsel: \u201cI would object to that, Judge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">End of Bench Conference)</p>\n<p id=\"b710-9\">The prosecutor: \u201cDid you also see him at the store at any time?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-10\">The witness: \u201cWhich store is that, ma\u2019am?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-11\">The prosecutor: \u201cThe one at 711 Main Street.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-12\">The witness: \u201cOn several occasions prior to the date of the execution of the warrant,T would say approximately only twice, two to three times, I\u2019m not sure which, at that store, within the one week preceding Trooper Ford\u2019s execution of the search warrant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-13\">The prosecutor: \u201cI have no further questions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-14\">The judge: \u201cYou may inquire, [defense counsel].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-15\">Further Recross-Examination</p>\n<p id=\"b710-16\">Defense counsel: \u201cNow you testified that you\u2019d seen Jesus Mercedes in the Great Brook Valley area, is that correct?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-17\">The witness: \u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-18\">Defense counsel: \u201cAnd you testified that you stopped him and talked to him on a couple of occasions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-19\">The witness: \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-20\">Defense counsel: \u201cAnd that had absolutely nothing to do with the investigation of any drug cases, isn\u2019t that right?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-21\">The witness: \u201cOn the last occasion it was because of his driving behavior. At which time he produced an expired license.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-22\">The judge: \u201cOfficer, could you just answer the question that [defense counsel] \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-23\">The witness: \u201cI\u2019m trying to recall the reasons for the stop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-24\">The judge: \u201cTake your time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-25\">Defense counsel: \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that you never stopped and talked to [the defendant] pursuant to any type of drug investigation whatsoever; that\u2019s the truth, right?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-26\">The witness: \u201cNo, sir.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
