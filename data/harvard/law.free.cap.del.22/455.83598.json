Purnell. Said Purnell testified that he thought it was his corn, although he would not swear to it. The wife of the prisoner testified that she had gone to Purnell\u2019s house with her husband, who said to her that he wanted her to go up and engage Purnell in conversation while he (Bailey) went down to the pig pen and got the bag of com which the colored boy had put out for him. The above testimony, together with Purnell\u2019s statement that he had missed com from his crib about this time, was the State\u2019s case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>When the State rested, Lynch, for defendant, moved that the jury be instructed by the Court to return a verdict of not guilty, on the ground that the State had failed to connect the prisoner with the larceny of the said bag of com.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-4\"><em>Charles S.
