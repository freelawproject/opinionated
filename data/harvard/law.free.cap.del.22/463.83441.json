D. 1907, before me, the subscriber, one of the Justices of the Peace in and for the County aforesaid, Hester A. Marshall and Burton B.

Marshall.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">(The above affidavit was duly attested by the Justice of the Peace.)</p>\n<p id=\"b473-11\"><em>Harrington, </em>for petitioners, moved to dismiss the exceptions, on the ground that said exceptions were not signed by the exceptants, but only by their counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-12\">The Court held that where the exceptions were based wholly or in part upon facts which were supported by affidavit of the persons who were exceptants, it was sufficient if the said exceptions were signed by their counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-13\"><em>Harrington, </em>for petitioners, then moved that the exceptions be dismissed upon the further ground that Burton B. Deputy appeared in the body of the exceptions as one of the exceptants, while the affidavit accompanying the same was signed by <em>Benjamin B. Deputy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number><em>Marshall, </em>for exceptants, thereupon filed a supplementary-affidavit, signed by himself, setting forth that Burton B. Deputy, named as exceptant in the body of the exceptions and in the body of the affidavit, and <em>Benjamin B. Deputy, </em>whose signatura appeared to the affidavit, was one and the same person.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\"><em>Harrington, </em>for petitioners, objected to the supplementary affidavit on the ground that the affidavit was made by counsel, who could not testify either by affidavit or otherwise in the case, under the well-established practice of the Courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">The Court held that the supplementary affidavit was sufficient and that counsel could testify to prove identity or service; that the confidential relation between counsel and client was not thereby violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">As to the first and seventh exceptions above set forth the Court held that service upon the person who held the legal title to the lands, though another had a life interest therein, was sufficient; and that notice need not be served upon the latter, or tenant in posession.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">The Court further held that the description of said proposed road in said petition and report or return corresponded with reasonable exactness to the notice of the intended application, and therefore held that the fifth and sixth exceptions raising said point were insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">The fourth exception was not passed upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">Upon the third exception' the Court remanded the return to the commissioners for amendment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
