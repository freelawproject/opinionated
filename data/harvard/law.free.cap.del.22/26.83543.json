It is alleged that the chattels were under lien of a chattel mortgage; were afterwards moved on Kyle\u2019s farm by mortgagor, the tenant; were subsequently taken by Kyle in distress for rent and were sold by the constable under said distraint. The complaint is that constable applied the proceeds of said sale to the rent instead of to the chattel mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-20\">In <em>Ford vs. Clewell, </em>9 <em>Houst., </em>179, it was decided that when chattels under lien of chattel mortgage were subsequently moved on demised premises and then while still on said premises, sold on execution process following <em>scire facias </em>on said chattel mort<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>gage, the lien of the landlord for rent was superior to the lien of the chattel mortgage. The landlord was given one year\u2019s rent out of the proceeds of sale, under <em>Section </em>60, <em>Chapter </em>120, <em>Laws of Delaware (.Revised </em>Code, 874). The case at bar is much stronger in that the chattels were sold by the landlord in distraint for rent under circumstances which made them liable for rent, even if the mortgagee had owned the chattels absolutely instead of merely holding a mortgage lien upon them. The doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>should control the case at bar, since the above cited case in 9 <em>Houston </em>has stood for many years for the guidance of constables.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-4\">In <em>Shuster vs. Robinson, </em>3 <em>Harrington, </em>50, it was decided that when goods are moved on the premises after execution delivered to the sheriff, but before actual levy they are subject to rent in preference to the execution. An execution is a lien on goods and chattels from the moment it is delivered to the sheriff for execution, but it is not a prior lien to rent if the goods and chattels are moved upon the demised premises before they are taken in actual execution. The lien of a chattel mortgage is not superior to the lien of an execution in the sheriff\u2019s hands before levy thereunder. If <em>scire facias </em>has been sued out on chattel mortgage, judgment obtained and the goods seized under process thereunder before they are moved on demised premises then the lien might come ahead of rent; but not otherwise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-5\">It is contended that a consideration of the following sections of Chapter 120, Laws of Delaware, to wit, Sections 22, 39, 40, 41 and 60 <em>(Revised Code, </em>869, 871, 872 and 874) will show that the proceeds of the constable\u2019s sale in the case at bar were properly applicable to the rent, and that therefore the demurrer should be sustained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-6\"><em>Walter J.
