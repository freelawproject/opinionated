In an action against the city of Wilmington for personal injuries, a citizen is not incompetent to serve as a juror because he is a citizen of the municipality and therefore interested as a taxpayer in any verdict that might be rendered against the city.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b493-7\">2. In the trial a physician having testified that he examined the plaintiff and found him suffering from erysipelas, although he did not know what caused the injury, he may be asked whether the erysipelas could have been caused by the injury complained of.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b493-8\">3. A physician called for the plaintiff having testified that he made a thorough examination of the plaintiff, after getting a history of the case, and found his right shoulder injured, may be asked whether in his opinion the plaintiff\u2019s arm will ever be in its normal condition again, notwithstanding there is no allegation of permanent injury in the narr.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b493-9\">4. If a hole in the street of a city is dangerous to public travel and had so existed for a time before the accident reasonably sufficient for the city to have known of its existence and condition, the law presumes or implies that the city had received knowledge of it, and its failure in a reasonable time after such notice or knowledge to fill or repair the same, or to place about it proper safeguards, would be negligence. The city is not bound for injuries occasioned by holes in the streets resulting from sudden storms or wash-outs, until it has a reasonable time to fill or repair the same, or place proper guards about them.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b493-10\">5.

Its liability to persons injured by reason of a defect in the street, must be based upon its negligence. That is, upon its failure to exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence in the performance of its duty to keep the street in a safe condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">It is not claimed by the plaintiff that the said hole was made by the defendant or any of its agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">In order to render the defendant liable, it must appear from the evidence to your satisfaction that the defendant had notice or knowledge of the hole for such time as would have been reasonably sufficient to fill or repair the same or warn the public of the danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">This notice or knowledge need not have been actual or express notice or knowledge; it is sufficient if there was implied or constructive notice or knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">If the hole was dangerous to public travel, and had so existed for a time before the accident reasonably sufficient for the defendant to have known of its existence and condition, the law presumes or implies that the defendant had notice or knowledge of it, and its failure in a reasonable time after such notice or knowledge to fill or repair the same, or to place about it the proper safe-guards to warn persons traveling along said street, would be negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">The defendant is not bound for injuries occasioned by holes in the streets resulting from sudden storms or wash-outs, until it has had a reasonable time to fill or repair the same, or place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>proper guards about the same, but if after notice actual or con- . structive, it neglects in a reasonable time to make the needed repairs or place guards to warn the public, it is guilty of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The defendant denies that the injuries complained of were caused by its negligence, and insists that they were caused by the negligence of the plaintiff, in carelessly driving into the hole which he could have seen and avoided by the exercise of reasonable care.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">If the traveler, exercising due care, does not see or know that the street is in a dangerous condition, he has the right to assume that it is in a reasonably safe condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">Even if the defendant was negligent in not filling or guarding the hole, the plaintiff was required to exercise reasonable care and diligence to avoid falling into it and if he failed to do so, he was guilty of negligence and cannot recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">Where the injury complained of was the result of the negligence of both parties, the plaintiff is held to be guilty of contributory negligence and cannot recover, as the law will not in such case undertake to measure and balance the degree of responsibility attributable to each of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">Negligence, whether of the plaintiff or defendant, is not presumed, and the burden of proving it is upon the party by whom it is alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">If you should be satisfied from the evidence that the plaintiff at the time of the accident was intoxicated, this is a proper subject for your consideration in determining whether, at the time of the accident, he exercised such reasonable care as a sober prudent and reasonably careful person would have exercised under similar circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">Where the testimony, as in this case, is conflicting, the jury should reconcile it if they can; but if .they cannot do so, they should give credence to that part of it which in their opinion is entitled to belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>The verdict should be for that party in whose favor is the preponderance or greater weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">If your verdict should be for the plaintiff, it should be for such a sum of money as will reasonably compensate him for the injuries to his horse and to himself, including therein a reasonable compensation for the plaintiff\u2019s pain and suffering, his loss of time and his expenses incurred in endeavoring to be cured of his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">The jury disagreed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
