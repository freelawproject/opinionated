Davis, J. P.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-8\">The following exceptions were filed to the record:</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-9\"><em>\u201cFirst: </em>That it is error for the Justice to have given judgment for the plaintiff below defendant in error when it appears by the record that the plaintiff below defendant in error was not present nor represented by anyone for it at the trial below and that the Justice had no evidence before him upon which to render judgment for the plaintiff below defendant in error, affidavits, other papers and letters not being proper evidence upon which to render a judgment for the said plaintiff below.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-10\"><em>\u201cSecond: </em>That it is error in that the record of the said Justice fails to show that the defendant below plaintiff in error claimed nonsuit at the time of the trial of the case for the reason that the plaintiff nor anyone for it appeared.\u201d</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b79-11\">Spruance, J.;\u2014</author>\n<p id=\"A2s\">As to the first exception, it depends on what those papers referred to in the record were. They may have been written acknowledgments of the defendant. The record says \u201cAfter hearing and examining all the allegations of the parties and their proofs\u201d etc. We do not see that the affidavit was of any account at all, but there were other papers and letters. He had the defendant there and apparently went into a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-12\"><em>Mr. </em>Kenney;\u2014We have an affidavit that sets forth the fact that the defendant claimed a nonsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>Spruance, J.:\u2014If there may be circumstances in which the Court will allow anything to be offered to supplement the record, they are not present in this case. You could have alleged diminution, if the Justice did not put down all that the record should show. But this comes up before us now simply upon exceptions to the record. We think the judgment below should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Judgment below affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
