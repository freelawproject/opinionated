In an indictment for larceny, the property alleged to have been stolen was stated to be the property of,\u2018 \u2018Joseph Bancroft Sons\u2019 Company\u201d At the trial it appeared from theStates evidence that it was the property of \u201cJoseph Bancroft and Sons\u2019 Company\u201d. The State permitted to enter a <em>nolle prosequi.</em></syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b406-8\">2. At a subsequent trial upon an indictment which charged that the property alleged to have been stolen was the property of Joseph Bancroft and Sons' Company\u201d, the defendant contended that he could not be convicted because he had been put in jeopardy for the same offence in the former case: <em>Held </em>that the defendant was not in jeopardy under the original indictment within the contemplation of the Constitution of this State.</syllabus>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b406-9\"><em>(May </em>18, 1906.)</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b406-10\">Lore, C.

The State then proved by the docket of certificates of corporations from the office of the Recorder of Deeds that the name of said corporation was \u201cJoseph Bancroft and Sons\u2019 Company\u201d.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-17\">Biggs, for defendant, thereupon asked the Court to instruct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>the jury to render a verdict of not guilty, on the ground of a fatal variance between the proof and the allegations in the indictment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-4\"><em>Hastings, </em>Deputy Attorney-General, asked that a juror be withdrawn and the defendant held until he could be re-indicted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-5\"><em>Mr. Biggs </em>opposed this application as contrary to the general practice of the Courts in criminal cases, contending that the defendant had been put on trial, and as he could not be convicted under a defective indictment, he should be discharged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-6\"><em>Mr. Hastings </em>contended that the mere swearing of the jury was not a trial, and that as the first question asked of the first witness disclosed that the indictment was faulty in respect to the allegation of the name of the company whose property was alleged to have been stolen by the defendant, it was no hardship upon the defendant at this time before any evidence going to the merits of the case had been given to the jury, to pass upon the fact whether or not the defendant was guilty, to withdraw a juror and ask that the defendant be held until re-indicted.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b407-7\">Lore, C. J.:</author>\n<p id=\"AyM\">Is your application to have a <em>nolle prosequi </em>entered?</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\"><em>Mr. </em>Hastings:\u2014Yes sir; I enter a <em>nolle prosequi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">Lore, C. J.:\u2014We think you are entitled to enter a <em>nolle prosequi </em>in this case\u2014The better practice is generally to order the jury to return a verdict of not guilty. Let a <em>,nolle prosequi </em>be entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">Thereupon the Deputy Attorney-General framed a new indictment against the defendant, charging therein that the stolen articles were the goods and chattels of the \u201cJoseph Bancroft and Sons\u2019 Company\u201d; which indictment was returned \u201ctrue bill\u201d by the grand jury. And on the twenty-first of the same month Biggs, for the defendant, before the same Court as above, moved to quash thfe indictment on the ground that the defendant was put in jeopardy for the same offense in the case of the <em>State vs. himself, </em>being No. 38 to the May Term, 1906, citing:</p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\"><em>Heard\u2019s Criminal Pleading </em>281; 1 <em>Bishop on Criminal Procedure </em>960; <em>U.

J.:\u2014A majority of the Court, consisting of Judges Grubb and Pennewill, are of the opinion that the defendant Dougherty, was not in jeopardy under the original indictment within the contemplation of the Constitution of this State.</p>\n<p id=\"AbN\">I do not agree with that view, but it is the view of the majority of the Court, and therefore the motion to quash is refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
