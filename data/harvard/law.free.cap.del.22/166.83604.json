That Frank W. Donovan\u2014who was admitted by defendants\u2019 counsel to be the local agent of the defendants for the purpose of soliciting insurance\u2014first learned of the fire and went out and notified the plaintiff of th efact; that the plaintiff inquired as to what was necessary for him to do under the policy in order to secure his insurance and that Mr. Donovan told him there was nothing for him to do but that he (Donovan) would give notice to the company and that they would come down and adjust the loss and pay the amount of the policy. That several times during the period of sixty days <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>next ensuing the plaintiff called upon Donovan and asked him when the adjuster was coming down and was informed by Donovan that he had written to the adjuster and had heard from the latter, who was then sick, but who would come down as soon as he was able to do so. That within a few days after sixty days had elapsed the adjuster having failed to come down and adjust the loss, the plaintiff placed the matter in the hands of his attorney and suit was entered.

That after the machines were destroyed by fire, plaintiff paid to the company the balance due upon the same. The plaintiff further stated that there was no chattel mortgage on the machines in question, but admitted that the factory during the insured period and preceding the fire had been shut down as long as ten consecutive days on account of the severity of the weather.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-6\">Motion for Nonsuit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-7\">When the plaintiff rested, counsel for defendant moved for a nonsuit upon the following grounds:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-8\"><em>First. </em>That from the plaintiff\u2019s evidence it appears that the interest of the insured in part of the property insured was other than unconditional and sole ownership, which makes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>entire policy on which he sues void under the conditions thereof as provided in lines 16 and 17.
