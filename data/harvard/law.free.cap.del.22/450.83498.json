While the better practice would be for the Justice to sign his record, yet it is not essential to the validity of a judgment rendered by him that he should sign it, in the absence of a statutory provision requiring his signature.

Every certiorari goes to the validity of the judgment. Therefore the question arising on the motion to dismiss is not whether the judgment below is invalid for want of the Justice\u2019s signature, or for any other cause, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>rather whether the record sent up shows that a final judgment was rendered below.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-4\">He distinguished the case of <em>Vaughn vs. Marshall, </em>cited by the defendant in error, from the case at bar; stating that in the former case a <em>scire facias </em>had been issued to revive a judgment more than three years old, and proceedings thereon were still pending and no final judgment rendered at the time of taking the writ of error. While in the case at bar judgment had been rendered and entered, though not signed. The record here shows that the Justice, after rendering his judgment, undertook to put it in force, requiring the defendant below to enter into a recognizance with approved surety to keep the peace and not trespass for a year.. This recognizance the record shows was signed by the Justice, Thomas Bratton. It is a part of the whole record now before the Court, and, we insist, it harks back to the judgment upon which it is based. It would require a wide stretch of imagination indeed for a Court to hold that there is no record of any sort of a judgment whatever, when, at the same time, the record presented discloses a judgment rendered in open Court upon which a subsequent order was issued by the Justice in the matter of the recognizance which he signed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-5\"><em>Cal.

I find no cases to the contrary, except where the statute made it mandatory that the Judge should sign; and even then, the Courts have held that a mandamus will lie to compel the performance of the duty where omitted or neglected.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b461-14\">Lore, C. J.:</author>\n<p id=\"Aj5F\">When this matter was first presented and argued before the Court, we were inclined to grant the motion made by Mr. Brockson. We must bear in mind that this was a judgment rendered by a Justice of the Peace in open Court. Within his statutory jurisdiction his authority is just as complete, for all purposes of hearing such cases, determining or deciding them, and making up his record, as is the authority of this Court. While we think the better practice would be for a Justice to sign his record, as that would be one way of testing its completion, yet the authorities seem to be decidedly the other way\u2014that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>it is not essential to the validity of a judgment rendered by a Justice of the Peace that he should sign it, in the absence of a statutory provision, requiring his signature. We find a great many states have statutes governing the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Again, you will notice that our statute sets out just what is essential to constitute a valid docket entry, and it is absolutely silent upon the matter of signing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">After a full consideration of the whole question, we think the signature of the Justice to the judgment is not absolutely essential, and is not a ground for the dismissal of the certiorari. We therefore decline to dismiss the certiorari. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">(The Court thereupon heard argument upon the exceptions filed which went to the point, that the record did not show that the defendant below was charged with having <em>wilfully </em>committed a <em>trespass\u2014Rev. Code, </em>939. Counsel for exceptants cited <em>Vandever vs. State, </em>1 <em>Marv. </em>209).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Lore, C. J.:\u2014The exception is fatal, and the judgment below is reversed on the authority of <em>Vandever vs. State, </em>1 <em>Marv. </em>209.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">Judgment below reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
