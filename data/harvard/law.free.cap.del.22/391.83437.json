D. 1907, the petition of Joseph Crossgrove having been presented and read to the Court, and the same having been discussed by Robert H. Richards, Attorney for the petitioner, and Sylvester D. Townsend, Attorney for the Levy Court of New Castle County, and the Court having maturely considered the same, it is ordered and adjudged by the Court that there is no authority in law permitting the Sheriff to demand or receive, as an item of cost collectible through his office, dollarage to the extent of two per centum of the amount derived from the sale of real estate by such Sheriff, or any other commission or dollarage upon the amount derived from the sale of real estate by such sheriff; and it is therefore further ordered by the Court that the sum of Twenty-four dollars, unlawfully collected from Joseph Crossgrove by Henry Stafford, Sheriff of New Castle County, as dollarage upon the amount derived from the sale of certain real estate and subsequently paid into this Court by said Sheriff, be paid out of this Court, by an appropriate cheque drawn to the order of said Joseph Crossgrove or of Robert H.
