The defendant, under indictment for practicing medicine without a license, relied on the defence that he treated his patients personally by hypnotism and massage, without prescribing any remedies, and that such treatment was not in violation of the statute. <em>Held </em>that to \u201cprescribe\u201d remedies is to write or to give medical directions, to indicate remedies.

The persons classed by the statute as physicians are designated as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">\u201cEvery person (except apothecaries) whose business it is for fee and reward to prescribe remedies or perform surgical operations for the cure of any bodily disease or ailing, shall be deemed a physician or dentist as the case may be, within the meaning of this act.\u201d <em>(Rev.. Code, </em>58.)</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">The defendant does not contend that he had a license to practice medicine, but relies on the defense that he treated his patients personally by hypnotism and massage, without prescribing any remedies, and that such treatment is not in violation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Your inquiry then is, did the defendant for fee or reward <em>prescribe remedies </em>or perform surgical operations, for the cure of any bodily disease or ailing in this County within two years next before the finding of this indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">It is the duty of the Court to instruct you as to the meaning of the word <em>prescribe </em>remedies used in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">In medicine to \u201cprescribe\u201d remedies is defined to be \u201cto write or to give medical directions; to indicate remedies.\u201d It is not necessary that such prescription should be in writing. It may be given or indicated verbally. Any direction given to the patient for drugs, medicines, or other remedies, for the cure of bodily diseases, directing how they are to be applied to or used by the patient, is a prescription within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">It would make no difference whether the direction was given by the defendant himself or by another person, even though such other person be a licensed physician engaged by and acting under the control and direction of the defendant in that particular in the conduct of his business.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number><em>State vs. Paul, </em>56 <em>Neb. </em>369 (76 <em>N.

On the other hand if he is guilty it is your duty to convict him. The laws of our State are designed to protect the community and especially that portion of it which by reason nf sickness and disease is peculiarly subject to imposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Verdict, guilty.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
