White </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b611-6\"><em>John C. Cooper, III, Assistant Attorney General, </em>with whom were <em>Thomas B. Finan, Attorney General, Charles F. Moylan, Jr. </em>and <em>Fdward Angeletti, State\u2019s Attorney </em>and <em>Assistant State\u2019s Attorney, </em>respectively, <em>for Baltimore City, </em>on the brief, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b611-7\">Hammond, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Auo\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">The appellant Mauldin was convicted by a jury of manslaughter by automobile after he drove his car at terrific speed\u2014well over eighty miles an hour\u2014on the Jones Falls Expressway into the rear of another car and caused the death of a woman passenger in the car that was struck. He makes only one contention of error, a claim that he did not freely and voluntarily consent to take the \u201cchemical test for intoxication\u201d provided for by Code (1964 Supp.), Art. 35, Sec. 100, because he was so intoxicated as to be incapable of giving consent and that, therefore, the results of the test which showed him to be intoxicated improperly were admitted against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">Officer Gray, who took Mauldin into custody at the scene, said he was swaying, his speech was slurred and the odor of alcohol on his breath was noticeable. While he was taking Maul-din to the chemical laboratory at the Central Police Station to undergo the test of his blood, Officer Gray followed the direction of paragraph g of Sec. 100 of Art. 35 of the Code to an arresting officer, \u201cto advise the person so charged [with the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor] that he may, but need not, submit to a chemical analysis * * telling Mauldin \u201cthat he could take the test or refuse it, and that it could be used for him or against him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">Officer Brennan, who conducted the test (in which the suspect breathes into a machine which translates the alcohol detectable in the breath into the amount in the blood stream), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>testified that he went through an elaborate explanation to Maul-din of the purposes and effects of the test, of the fact that a refusal to take the test is permissible and will not be used in any way against the suspect, that the results can be used in court for or against the suspect, and that Mauldin said he understood fully and signed a form which incorporated all the explanation of Officer Brennan and Mauldin\u2019s replies and which Mauldin signed to indicate his agreement to take the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">This testimony of Officer Brennan and the form signed by Mauldin came into evidence without objection, as did the results of the test (which was taken about an hour and a half after the accident) which showed a concentration of alcohol in Mauldin\u2019s blood of .20%\u2014paragraph (a) 3 of Sec. 100 of Art. 35 of the Code provides that a concentration of .15% or more \u201cshall be prima facie evidence that the defendant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor\u201d\u2014and as did Officer Brennan\u2019s opinion as an expert that the concentration of alcohol in the blood was greater at the time of the accident than at the time of the test. Only after all the testimony as to the test and its results as applicable to Mauldin had come into evidence for consideration by the jury did appellant seek to keep it out by a motion to strike. The motion was refused by Judge Prendergast because there had not been compliance with Maryland Rule 522 d 2, which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-6\">\u201cEvery'.objection to the admissibility of evidence shall be made at the time when such evidence is offered, or as soon thereafter as the objection to its admissibility shall have become apparent, otherwise the objection shall be treated as waived.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">We think Judge Prendergast did not err in denying the motion to strike the evidence. <em>Martin v. State, </em>203 Md. 66; <em>Martelly v. State, </em>230 Md. 341, 348; <em>Gatewood v. State, </em>207 Md. 374, 378.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">There is no reason in this case why the waiver provision of Rule 522 d 2 should not apply. Statutes may constitutionally go further than does the Maryland statute. Fundamentally, no constitutional or other basic right of one accused of alcoholic intoxication in connection with or as part of a crime is affronted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>or infringed if chemical tests showing the degree of intoxication are made of him without his consent, before trial, even if he is unconscious. <em>Breithaupt v. Abram, </em>352 U. S. 432, 435, 1 L. Ed. 2d 448. There the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-5\">\u201cTo be sure, the driver here was unconscious when the blood was taken, but the absence of conscious consent, without more, does not necessarily render the taking a violation of a constitutional right; and certainly the test as administered here would not be considered offensive by even the most delicate [referring to <em>Rochin v. California, </em>342 U. S. 165, 96 L. Ed. 183, wherein the stomach of the accused was pumped out].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">See also <em>Dyson v. State, </em>238 Md. 398, 404, as to the things to which a suspect may constitutionally be required to do before trial in aid of identification of the person or his connection with the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">The applicable statute, Sec. 100 of Art. 35 of the Code, makes it plain that affirmative consent to the taking of the test is not a prerequisite to its validity or to the admissibility of its results. Paragraph c provides under the sub-title \u201cRefusal to Submit to Test\u201d that \u201cno person shall be compelled to submit himself * * * for the purpose of a chemical analysis * * * and no inference * * * concerning either his guilt or innocence arises by reason of his refusal to submit * * *.\u201d There is no claim here that Mauldin attempted to refuse to submit to the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">Most courts hold that if there is an absence of refusal to submit to the test the failure to affirmatively or validly agree to its taking does not bar the presentation of its results into evidence. It has been held that the State may constitutionally require the taking of such a test as a prerequisite to the privilege of using the roads. <em>Walton v. City of Roanoke </em>(Va.), 133 S.
