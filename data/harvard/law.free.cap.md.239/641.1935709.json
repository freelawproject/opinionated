He was sentenced to two concurrent fifteen year terms in the penitentiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>The appellant\u2019s first two contentions on this appeal are that he was entrapped by the federal narcotics officer who testified appellant sold him heroin twice, and that he was merely the agent of the officer so that his sale, possession and control of the drug were those of the officer. The officer\u2019s testimony was that appellant approached him and asked whether he wanted to buy some heroin, saying it was \u201call right\u201d to do business with him. The officer gave him $30.00 for heroin, but he left and did not return. The officer saw appellant some weeks later, and, after an excuse concerning the $30.00, appellant asked whether the officer wanted to buy any heroin at that time. After receiving an affirmative reply, appellant procured a quantity of heroin and handed it to the officer, who paid him $20.00. Three days later, under similar circumstances, appellant again sold heroin to the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Testifying in his own behalf, appellant admitted that he had received $30.00 from the officer on the first occasion and that he had promised, but failed, to deliver heroin. He contended that the officer had approached him. He said that when he met the officer on the second occasion the latter asked him about the money and stated that \u201che would jump on my chest if I didn\u2019t return his $30.00.\u201d The officer then handed him $20.00 and told him to get him \u201ctwo decks\u201d. Appellant said he kept this money also and never delivered any heroin to the officer. He denied that he met with the officer on the third occasion. He admitted that he had previously been convicted of narcotics law violations in 1951 and 1955, and that he was a user of heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Appellant bases his defense of entrapment upon the claim that there was \u201crepeated and persistent solicitation\u201d by the federal officer (the latter\u2019s testimony was that each illegal transaction originated with appellant) ; upon the assertion that between the first and second contacts the officer \u201copenly searched\u201d for him and that this amounted to harassment (the officer testified that the only effort he made to find appellant was to ask several persons where he lived); and upon the claim that at the second meeting the officer threatened him (obviously not believed by the trial judge). The alleged entrapment relied on here is little different from that unsuccessfully asserted in <em>Cross v. </em>State, 235 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>Md. <em>377, </em>201 A. 2d <em>767 </em>(1964), <em>Snead v. State, </em>234 Md. 63, 65-66, 197 A. 2d 920 (1964), and <em>Stewart v. State, </em>232 Md. 318, 321-322, 193 A. 2d 40 (1963). As to whether appellant was merely the agent of the officer, we think the latter's testimony, if believed, that appellant approached him and asked on each occasion whether he wished to buy heroin, warranted the trial court in finding that appellant was the seller and not an agent. The circumstances as testified to by the officer are quite similar to the facts in <em>Snead v. State, supra </em>(at p. 66 of 234 Md.), and we find that case controlling. See also <em>State v. Brown, </em>235 Md. 401, 201 A. 2d 852 (1964) ; <em>Stewart v. State, supra </em>(at p. 322 of 232 Md.). We cannot say the trial court was clearly wrong in resolving the conflicts in the testimony adversely to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">It is also urged that the evidence was insufficient to support the convictions, but, without repeating it, we think the evidence produced by the State, coupled with the admissions of appellant, was ample for that purpose. <em>Brewer v. State, </em>229 Md. 251, 182 A. 2d 883 (1962). On this issue appellant advanced certain contentions, but we find them immaterial and therefore shall not detail them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Finally, appellant maintains that he was improperly sentenced as a third offender because his two prior convictions were misdemeanors under Code (1957), Art. 27, sec. 300, before that section was amended by Ch. 772 of the Acts of 1963 and Ch. 55 of the Acts of 1964 to make such offenses felonies. This contention is devoid of merit since Code (1964 Cum. Supp.), Art. 27, sec. 300(a), in referring to the penalty for third offenders, makes no distinction between prior misdemeanor and felony convictions. <em>Murray v. State, 236 </em>Md. 375, 380-381, 203 A. 2d 908 (1964); <em>Gans v. Warden, </em>233 Md. 626, 628, 196 A. 2d 632 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
