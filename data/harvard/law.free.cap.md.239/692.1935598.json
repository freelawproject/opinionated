At the preliminary hearing, the attendant, although unsure that the other boy was involved, was sure that the appellant had participated in the robbery, and, at the trial, positively identified him as one of the robbers. On the other hand, the appellant, although admitting that he had run through the service station premises to avoid a group of white boys who were chasing him at or about the time of the holdup and that he had stayed away from home for three days after being told that the police were looking for him, categorically denied that he was implicated in the crime, and told the police that he was \u201cgoing to stick to\u201d his story.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">The credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence was for the trier of fact to determine, and we cannot say that the trial judge was clearly wrong in choosing to believe the victim. <em>Wilson v. State, 237 </em>Md. 634. Even if the victim was somewhat hesitant at first as to the identity of the appellant, his testimony on the whole was not so uncertain as to require a reversal. Cf. <em>Tucker v. State, 237 </em>Md. 422, with <em>Kucharczyk v. State, </em>235 Md. 334. There is no merit to the contention of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
