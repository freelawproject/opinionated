It is opposite the Palisades Interstate Parkway and just north of the George Washington Bridge approach. The apartment buildings are brick-faced with metal casement windows, have steel fire escapes on each side, and flat roofs. The structures are heated by five hot-water boilers, two each in buildings A and C and one in building B. The boilers are oil-fired. All six levels of the buildings are serviced by 2,000-lb. Westinghouse electrically operated elevators. There are five elevators, two each in the buildings designated as A and C and one in building B. The buildings were completed in 1954 and contain a total of 224 rentable units, including four basement apartments. The units consist of 25 efficiency apartments, 100 one-bedroom apartments and 99 two-b\u00e9droom apartments. Each apartment is equipped with a 10 or 12-cubic-foot refrigerator, a free-standing gas range, a small complement of wall and base cabinets, and one three-fixture bath.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">For the year 1976 the borough assessed the property at:</p>\n<p id=\"ACc\">Land $ 851,000</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Improvements 1,890,200</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Total $ 2,741,200</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">These assessments were sustained by the Bergen County Board of Taxation (county board). Hudson appealed therefrom to the Division. In 1977 the borough put into effect a complete revaluation of the assessed properties in the municipality and, pursuant thereto, assessed the subject property at:</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">Land $ 1,470,600</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">Improvements 3,451,000</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">Total $ 4,921,600</p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">The county board sustained the new land assessment but reduced the assessment for improvements to $1,893,825, resulting in a total assessment for the year 1977 of $3,364,425. Both the borough and Hudson appealed to the Division, challenging the county board\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>The state agency hearings on the appeals were held before Judge Savino of the Division. In regard to the subject improvements, he made findings of true value based upon an income capitalization approach using a capitalization rate comprised of \u201c8% interest, 2% depreciation and the effective tax rate\u201d for the year 1976, and 8% interest, 2% depreciation and the actual tax rate for the year 1977. He determined that the average ratio of 58.56% promulgated by the Director of the Division of Taxation for the year 1976 (the only year regarding which the taxpayer claimed entitlement to discrimination relief) would apply to his finding of true value for that year. His recommended findings and conclusions were adopted by the Division and resulted in the entry of the following Division judgments in the matter:</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">1976 1977</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Land $ 851,000 $ 1,470,600</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">Improvements 1,029,759 1,812,240</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Total $ 1,880,759 $ 3,282,840</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">The borough contends that (1) the Division judge erred in denying its motion to compel the taxpayer (Hudson) and the partners thereof to produce, for the borough\u2019s inspection, certified copies of its federal and state income tax returns for the tax years involved; (2) the Division judgments \u201cadopt an unconstitutional, non-uniform approach to assessments in the Borough\u201d; (3) the Division judge erred \u201cin computing the true value\u201d of the subject improvements, and (4) the Division judge erred in applying to his finding of true value for 1976, the pertinent average ratio promulgated for that year by the Director of the Division of Taxation. In regard to the Division\u2019s application of the Director\u2019s average ratio, the borough argues that (a) the taxpayer\u2019s proofs were inadequate to sustain a finding of discrimination, and (b) the incorporation in the record of \u201cproofs from previously tried and unrelated tax appeals constitutes reversible error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b251-11\">We find no merit in the borough\u2019s claim that it was error to deny it access to the income tax returns of the taxpayer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>Hudson Terrace Associates, for the tax years involved. The fact that some investors in income-producing real estate, such as the apartment buildings here involved, actually consider the income tax benefits to be derived by them personally in deciding whether to purchase such property, or do receive such benefits, has no place or relevance in the proper determination of the true value of the property by any of the conventional approaches to value. Accordingly, no purpose would have been served by allowing the borough to inspect the income tax returns sought by its motion. It is obvious that whatever income tax benefits a taxpayer may derive from his ownership of real estate will depend upon facts peculiar to him, such as his income tax bracket for the particular year, the method of depreciation used and the current and unpredictable future provisions of the Federal income tax laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">Affording consideration or weight to the income tax benefits which may flow to the taxpayer by reason of his particular ownership of the property, would violate the requirements of Article VIII, \u00a7 I, par. 1 of the State Constitution of 1947, as well as <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-23, which require adherence to objective standards for determining true value. Thus, the focus must be on the value of the property in the market place, without regard to the particular or peculiar circumstances of the owner. Were this not so, adjacent parcels of land improved with identical structures might be valued differently to the extent that their respective owners\u2019 personal situations differed, even though in the open market each parcel would sell for the same price at a fair and bona fide sale by private contract \u2014 /. e., a transaction between a buyer willing but not obliged to buy and a seller willing but not obliged to sell. <em>See Hackensack Water Co. v.

Lasser for the borough and Leo T. Souza for Hudson, as well as the Division judge, utilized the economic (income capitalization) approach. Lasser also used the reproduction cost less depreciation approach. Here, as in <em>Parkview Village Ass\u2019n v. Collingswood, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>21 (1972), \u201cthe income approach should be of preponderant influence\u201d in the case. <em>Id. </em>at 23. <em>See, also, American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers, The Appraisal of Real Estate </em>(7 ed. 1978), 315 <em>et seq. </em>It is \u201c[t]he preferred valuation method for apartment buildings since investors purchase apartment buildings as income-producing properties.\u201d <em>Helmsley v.

He estimated the land value at $5,000 for each apartment unit, or a total of $1,120,000, \u201cbased on the 224 units in the project.\u201d In the process of estimating the true value of the improvements, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>he started with an annual gross rental of $615,495, which he arrived at by multiplying by 12 the average of the October 1, 1975 and October 1, 1976 rent rolls \u201cif fully occupied including both apartments and garages.\u201d From this he deducted \u201ca 3% vacancy<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and credit loss,\u201d resulting in \u201can effective gross apartment and garage rent of $597,030.\u201d He \u201cthen added actual average receipts from laundry and vending machines plus miscellaneous income,\u201d resulting in \u201ca total effective gross income of $607,986.\u201d He then deducted \u201c[stabilized expenses totalling $234,859 . . . leaving a net income before taxes and recapture of $373,127.\u201d From this he deducted $127,568 \u201cas the requirement to satisfy the land value of $1,120,000,\u201d <em>i. </em>e., $1,120,-000 X 11.39%. The resulting figure, <em>viz., </em>$245,559 was then capitalized at 14.39% using an interest rate of 9%, plus an average tax factor of 2.39 ($3.97 tax rate X 58.56% [Director\u2019s average] ratio = $2.32 for 1976 and the actual $2.45 for 1977) and a 3% recapture. By this computation he arrived at a rounded-out appraised true value of the improvements for each of the tax years 1976 and 1977, of $1,706,500. In sum, his estimate of true value for each of the two tax years was:</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Land $ 1,120,000</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Improvements 1,706,500</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">Total $ 2,826,500 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">John Lasser, the borough\u2019s expert, arrived at separate estimates of fair market value for each of the two tax years involved. In regard to the land, his estimated true value figures were: for 1976 \u2014 $851,000 and for 1977 \u2014 $1,470,600. In each case, the estimate was the same as the local assessment. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>estimating the value of the improvements for 1976 he started with an annual gross rental, based on 100% occupancy for the year 1975, of $598,658. He reduced this by a 2% \u201cvacancies &amp; rent losses\u201d factor, resulting in a \u201cnet effective rent of $586,-685.\u201d To this he added other income, including vending machine income and washing machine income, of $9,564, resulting in \u201ceffective gross income\u201d of $596,249. He then deducted \u201cexpenses\u201d of $202,305, leaving a net income of $393,944. He reduced this by a \u201creturn to land\u201d of 12%<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of $851,000, or $102,120, leaving a \u201cnet to building\u201d of $291,824. He capitalized this at 14% (8% interest, 2% depreciation and a rounded 4% real estate tax), resulting in a rounded true value estimate for the improvements of $2,084,500.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In valuing the improvements for 1977 he started with an annual gross rental based on 100% occupancy for the year 1976 of $621,309. This was reduced by a 2% \u201cvacancies and rent losses\u201d factor, resulting in \u201cnet effective rents\u201d of $608,883. To this he added \u201cother income\u201d of $9,376, resulting in \u201ceffective gross income\u201d of $618,259. He then deducted \u201cexpenses\u201d of $222,946, leaving a net income of $395,-313. He reduced this by a \u201creturn to land\u201d of 10.5%<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of $1,470,600, or $154,413, leaving a \u201cnet to building\u201d of $240,900. He capitalized this at 12.5% (8% interest, 2% depreciation and a rounded 2.5% real estate tax), resulting in a true value estimate for the improvements of $1,927,200. In sum, his estimates of true value for the tax years 1976 and 1977 were:</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">For 1976 For 1977</p>\n<p id=\"AO\">Land $ 851,000 $ 1,470,600</p>\n<p id=\"AL\">Improvements 2,084,500 1,927,200</p>\n<p id=\"A9W\">Total $ 2,935,500 $ 3,397,800</p>\n<p id=\"b256-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>The Division judge arrived at a \u201cnet income\u201d figure of $379,-301<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> for each of the tax years involved. For 1976, he reduced this by a \u201creturn to land\u201d of 10.34%<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of $851,000, or $87,993, leaving a \u201cnet to building\u201d of $291,308. He capitalized this at 12.34% (8% interest, 2% depreciation and \u201cthe effective tax rate\u201d), resulting in a true value finding for the improvements of $2,360,680. For 1977 he reduced the \u201cnet income\u201d of $379,301 by a \u201creturn to land\u201d of 10.45%<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of $1,470,600, or $153,677, leaving a \u201cnet to building\u201d of $225,624. He capitalized this at 12.45% (8% interest, 2% depreciation and 2.45% for real estate tax), resulting in a true value finding for the improvements of $1,812,240. In sum, the Division\u2019s findings of true value for the tax years 1976 and 1977 were:</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">For 1976 For 1977</p>\n<p id=\"ATW\">Land $ .851,000 $ 1,470,600</p>\n<p id=\"AcO\">Improvements 2,360,680 1,812,240</p>\n<p id=\"Ag\">Total $ 3,211,680 $ 3,282,840</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">We note here that the borough\u2019s expert made further appraisals of the property for the two tax years involved \u201con the basis of a tax shelter consideration,\u201d using an interest rate of 6%%. He explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-5\">The average tax shelter benefit is approximately 3%. In order to reflect that, I\u2019ve chosen to reduce the interest from 8% to 614% which would reflect a 114% percent decrease in interest rate. That would mean that the purchaser would accept a lower return on a net income because he knows he has a tax shelter benefit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">The borough complains that the Division judge \u201cutterly ignored\u201d Lasser\u2019s \u201ctax shelter analysis.\u201d It notes that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aay\">Mr. Lasser explained that this type of property should be analyzed according to what the willing investor in the marketplace would pay for such property. Based upon this approach, the federal income tax benefits of ownership of residential real property must be taken into account.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>And, it points to the 1.5% difference in the interest rate as \u201cthe stabilized amount which accrues on account of the tax shelter benefits.\u201d We find no merit in the borough\u2019s complaint. The Division judge properly rejected Lasser\u2019s \u201ctax shelter analysis.\u201d As we observed earlier in this opinion, the focus must be on the value of the subject property in the market place, without regard to the particular or peculiar circumstances of the owner. Beyond this, the borough expert\u2019s testimony that a lVfe% decrease in the interest rate should be made to reflect tax shelter benefits to the investor lacks supporting factual proofs which would justify such reduction. In the circumstances it is clear to us that the estimate of value of the property to \u201cthe willing investor in the marketplace,\u201d arrived at \u201con the basis of a tax shelter consideration,\u201d was not entitled to any consideration or weight in the Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">From our review of the record submitted on this appeal we conclude that there is substantial credible evidence in the proofs to support the Division judge\u2019s findings of true value for the year 1977, <em>i. </em>e., land $1,470,600, and improvements $1,812,-240, for a total of $3,282,840. We discern no sound basis for disturbing these findings. Accordingly, the judgment of the Division for the year 1977 under review, which incorporates these valuations, will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">In regard to the Division judgment for the year 1976, we have concluded that there is substantial evidence in the proofs to support, on the value aspect of the case, the Division judge\u2019s findings of true value of the subject land and improvements, provided that his determination as to discrimination was appropriate. If that discrimination determination was not appropriate, then the computation of the true value of the improvements for 1976 would have to be modified to reflect the actual tax rate for that year rather than \u201cthe effective tax rate\u201d which he used.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">The borough maintains that the proofs are insufficient to support a finding of discrimination for the year 1976. Specifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>cally, it claims that Hudson failed (1) \u201cto prove an absence of a common level\u201d of assessment in the borough, and (2) \u201cto demonstrate that its property\u2019s tax burden substantially exceeded the share allocated to other taxpayers.\u201d Judge Savino made no findings on the issue grounded on the evidence in the case. Rather, after referring to Leo Souza\u2019s testimony on the subject, he commented, \u201cThe Court recites the analysis of Mr. Souza on discrimination to complete the record in accordance with the demand of the taxpayer\u2019s attorney but also as further proof of the opinion on this issue already written by this Court.\u201d He was referring to the refusal of the attorney for the taxpayer \u201cto stipulate the acceptance of any testimony offered on [the] issues [of discrimination, the capitalization rate, the demand for income tax returns and tax shelter benefits] in prior cases,\u201d <em>i. </em>e., in \u201c1974 to 1977\u201d tax appeal matters involving a number of large apartment houses in Fort Lee. He was also referring to an opinion which he wrote in these prior cases on the issues of discrimination and capitalization rate, which he attached to his panel report in the case now before us as \u201cAddendum A.\u201d The borough maintains that since \u201c[n]one of the proofs in those [prior] tax appeals were offered [in this case] by either party and no one, other than Judge Savino, sought to incorporate them into this case,\u201d his [Judge Savino\u2019s] \u201creliance upon the former, proofs and opinion is an improper and impermissible application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel.\u201d Hudson says that it does not rely upon any evidence in any other case in support of its position in this case, and that \u201cthe inclusion of Addendum A in Judge Savino\u2019s opinion should be considered as mere surplusage.\u201d In the circumstances we discern no sound reason for Judge Savino\u2019s inclusion of that document as part of his panel report in this case. At least insofar as Hudson was concerned, his finding on the issue of discrimination in this case could not be made to rest upon evidence offered in the prior Fort Lee cases which Hudson, who was not a party thereto, \u201chad no opportunity to test for trustworthiness or to explain or rebut.\u201d <em>Brotherhood of R.R. Trainmen v. Palmer, </em>47 <em>N.J. </em>482, 487 (1966). Accordingly, the issue is to be determined solely on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>the record before us in this case without regard to \u201cAddendum A.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Hudson casts a critical eye on a recent unpublished opinion of this court<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> in which discrimination relief was denied for the years 1973, 1974, 1975 and 1976 in six consolidated appeals covering separate apartment house properties in Fort Lee. It suggests that it was error for the court in that matter to be guided in its determination by principles set forth in <em>Tri-Terminal Corp. v. Edgewater, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>405 (1975), <em>cert. </em>den. 425 <em>U.S. </em>958, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>1739, 48 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>203 (1976). It calls attention to the fact that the last revaluation in the municipality prior to 1977 was made in 1968; that it was put into effect for the 1970 tax year, and that the only year in which discrimination is questioned in this case, 1976, \u201cis to be studied in the light of the same 1970 revaluation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The following is the sum total of Judge Savino\u2019s \u201canalysis\u201d of Leo Souza\u2019s attempt to prove discrimination through three exhibits admitted in evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-7\">The first exhibit (P-2) was a list of 77 sales in Fort Lee from July 1, 1975 to June 31 [sic] of 1976. The assessed value of all properties that were sold amounted to $6,214,500. The total of the sales prices was $10,676,115. The next column gave the ratio between the sales price of each parcel and the assessment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This column totaled $4,582.05 [sic]. It was divided by 77 and the unweighted ratio or average of 59.51% was reached.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-8\">Mr. Leo Souza, the appraiser for the taxpayer, then explained how the coefficient of deviation is arrived at. In a fourth column he listed the deviation of each sale from the ratio of 59.51%. For example, the first sale was for $36,500, the assessment was $24,100, the resulting ratio was 66.03%. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>difference between 59.51% and 66.03% was 6.52%. This was done for each sale. The total of the deviations was [612.08]. This was divided by 77, resulting in a ratio of 7.95%. The unweighted ratio of 59.51 is then divided by 7.95 to reach the coefficient of deviation at 13.35%.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-4\">Mr. Souza then explained that this low coefficient of deviation indicated good assessing practice based on a common level of 59.51% and not on 100%.- In fact if the coefficiency was based on 100% then the deviation total would be $3,117.95 [s/c] which divided by 77 would result in 40.49%.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-5\">The second exhibit (P-3) was a chart showing that the 77 listed sales based on sales price against the assessments gave a 71.79% increase in value from 1970 to 1976. The subject property based on the expert\u2019s 1976-1977 value of $2,826,500 was an increase of only 3.11%. The chart was drawn using 1970 as the base year, that was the year of the last revaluation, and 1975- 76.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-6\">The third exhibit (P-4) was another chart showing taxes paid by 40 properties taken from the middle of the 77 sales that had a sales value of $2,823,750 and an assessed value of $1,679,000. Using the full tax rate of $3.97 total taxes paid were $66,656. The subject property assessed at $2,741,200 paid $108,825.64 in taxes. Another comparison showed that if the subject property was assessed at $1,655,200 ($2,826,500 X 58.56 ratio) its total taxes would be $65,711.38. This is almost identical to the actual taxes paid by the 40 properties taken from the sales list.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">The Division judge made no mention of the testimony on the issue by John Lasser, the borough\u2019s expert. Lasser had made a study of the assessment practices of the borough assessors from the 1968 revaluation, effective for 1970, through the next revaluation effective for the year 1977. He found that \u201c[i]t was the practice of assessors to carry forward all assessments from year to year, reflecting the 1968 base year,\u201d and that it was \u201cthe intention of the people making the assessments\u201d to maintain the common level of the 1968 revaluation. And, to support his conclusion that the sales used by the Director of Taxation and shown on exhibit P-2 show rising property values of Class 4C (apartment house) property \u201cthat either matches or exceeds the rising value of Class 2 properties and properties generally,\u201d Lasser drew attention to the four Class 4C sales listed on the exhibit. He observed that the assessed value-sales price ratios shown for these properties, <em>i. </em>e., 39.73%, 48.56%, 51.17% and 57.66%, are all \u201cbelow what appears to be the ratio of the combined properties\u201d in the community. Souza, the taxpayer\u2019s expert conceded that, given the assumption that the 1970 level of assessment in the borough was at 100% of true value and that the assessments on these four Class 4C apartment house proper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>ties remained unchanged from year to year, a conclusion that might be drawn from the above-mentioned ratios is that by the time of their sales in the last half of 1975 the four properties had increased in value \u201cat a faster level or rate than the overall rate of increase and particularly the Class 2 properties . .\u201d Beyond this, he had not appraised the subject property, using an income capitalization approach, for any of the tax years from 1970 up to 1976. Accordingly, he was not in a position to tell whether or not a rise in value would have been reflected had such approach been used throughout that period. We note here, however, that the estimates of value of the subject property which he had previously made in connection with appeals filed with the Bergen County Board of Taxation, see footnote \u201c2\u201d above, show a 5% rise in his total appraised true value for the one year period from 1976 to 1977. And, when he was asked on cross-examination at a Division hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-6\">To the extent that increase in the value [as indicated by the abovementioned four ratios] may be true generally of Class 4C properties, 4C sales, they show that these properties do not bear a greater burden of the \u2014 greater tax burden than the properties generally in Fort Lee; don\u2019t they?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">He answered \u201cThey don\u2019t,\u201d followed, without more, by his comment: \u201cBut the subject [property] does.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">Given the presumptively valid common level of assessment at 100% of true value for 1970 as applied in the tax year here involved, it was incumbent upon the taxpayer to show that its property was impervious to the general rising trend in value of property in the borough or that extraordinary economic forces and passage of time created a substantial disparity between the ratio of assessment to true value in its case and the level at which properties were generally being valued in order to be entitled to discrimination relief.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Hudson has failed to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>either showing. It has not met the <em>Kents\u2019 </em>criterion, <em>viz., </em>\u201cA taxpayer who seeks a reduction of an assessment below true value must prove that his share of the total tax burden substantially exceeds the share allocated to others generally.\u201d <em>In re Appeals of Kents 2124 Atlantic Ave., Inc., supra, </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>at 33. And see <em>Tri-Terminal, supra, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>at 412.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">From our review of the record in light of the above principles, we are satisfied that the required strong showing has not been made here;, that the determination of Judge Savino that the average ratio promulgated by the Director of the Division of Taxation for the year 1976 would apply to his (Judge Savino\u2019s) finding of true value for that year, could not reasonably have been reached on sufficient credible evidence in the record; and that that determination was \u201cclearly a mistaken one and so plainly unwarranted that the interests of justice demand intervention and correction.\u201d <em>Stat</em>e v. <em>Johnson, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>146, 162 (1964). We find from the entire record that the assessment practice in the borough was to.carry forward the assessments at 100% of true value from the 1970 revaluation to the later years, up to and including the year 1976 which is involved here. Clearly, a common level existed at 100% of true value in 1970 and this level remained presumptively effective when carried forward in these subsequent years, given the borough\u2019s practice of systematic periodic revaluations. The situation here is obviously distinguishable from that found in <em>Piscataway Assoc., Inc. </em>v. <em>Piscataway Tp., </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>546 (1977), relied upon heavily by Hudson.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">As indicated in Judge Savino\u2019s panel report, the borough\u2019s exhibit P-2 contained a list of 77 sales of properties in Fort Lee from July 1,1975 to June 30,1976. These 77 sales represented a miniscule fraction of a total of some 4,269 assessed parcels. \u201cIsolated sales may for any number of reasons produce unduly high or unduly low prices.\u201d <em>Tri-Terminal, supra, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>at 413. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>The ratios of the 77 individual sales reflect a general coefficient of deviation of 13.36%.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">In light of all of the above, we are satisfied that uniformity of assessment existed from the 1970 revaluation through the 1976 tax year here involved, and that resort to the Director\u2019s ratio was not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">The judgment of the Division of Tax Appeals for the year 1977 under review, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">The determination as to discrimination relief to the taxpayer for 1976, is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">The determination below with respect to true value of the subject land for the year 1976 is affirmed.
