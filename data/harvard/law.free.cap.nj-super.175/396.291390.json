A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">The juvenile appellant and his two juvenile companions were charged with armed robbery of a service station on Route 17 in Paramus. Thereafter, the State amended the complaint as it affects the appellant, to aiding and abetting robbery. The juvenile, who was 17 years of age, pleaded guilty on May 1, 1979 to the amended charge. At the subsequent dispositional hearing on July 2,1979, he was placed on probation for one year and on the motor vehicle prohibitory list for two years. There were other probationary conditions imposed which are not pertinent to this appeal. The court upon request of counsel stayed the entire disposition pending this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">The juvenile argues that the disposition is improper insofar as it includes a driver's license revocation as one of the conditions or probation. He also contends that in any event the two-year revocation period imposed exceeds the term of probation and is illegal and excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">At the time of the dispositional hearing, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:168-1<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> conferred a general grant of probationary power on the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court. This power was to be used only where \u201cthe best interests of the public as well as the person adjudged guilty of any offense . . . will be subserved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>.\u201d The following section, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A: 168-2, authorized the fixing of conditions of probation and enumerated many types of conditions, <em>\u201camong </em>others\u201d (emphasis added), which would be placed on one who is ordered to serve a period of probation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4-61e and <em>R. </em>5:9 -9(b)(2)(C), a closely parallel court rule, specifically outline the dispositional alternatives in delinquency cases, and both state that the court may place a juvenile on probation \u201cupon such written conditions as the court deems will aid in the rehabilitation of the juvenile.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Reading the above dispositional statute and court rule <em>in pari materia </em>with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:168-2, it is clear that a juvenile court judge could impose reasonable probationary conditions wherever consonant with the public interest and rehabilitative purpose sought to be attained with respect to the juvenile. <em>State in Interest of D. G. W., </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>488, 494, 361 A.2d 513 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">We disagree with the juvenile\u2019s contention that the judge\u2019s revocation order is discordant with this legislative plan. In the instant case we are concerned with a juvenile who pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting robbery. Seventeen years old at the time the crime was committed, the juvenile was given a disposition of probation for one year and placed on the motor vehicle prohibitory list. It is significant that the juvenile\u2019s automobile played a key part in the crime, without which the crime could not have been committed. Further, the actual driving of the automobile by the juvenile to and from the scene of the crime comprised the juvenile\u2019s total participation. The prohibition against driving was a reasonable measure, designed to emphasize to the juvenile that improper use of his automobile would result in a deprivation of it. The rehabilitative nature of this approach is self-evident.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>We note that in <em>Commonwealth v. Russman, </em>250 <em>Pa.Super. </em>74, 378 A.2d 459 (1977), a Pennsylvania appellate court interpreted a juvenile disposition statute worded somewhat like our own as allowing a court to prohibit, as a condition of probation, a juvenile from driving. As in the present case, the juvenile in <em>Russman </em>had driven a car in the commission of his offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">The juvenile\u2019s reliance on <em>State in Interest of M. L., </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>438 (1974), is misplaced. In that case the Supreme Court refused to interpret <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:168-2 <em>in pari materia </em>with the former juvenile disposition statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4-37(a), to authorize the imposition of a fine, and it indicated that the \u201csame result would appear to be called for\u201d under the juvenile disposition law now in effect. 64 <em>N.J. </em>at 444. The Court ruled that the general probation statute did not confer power upon a court to impose a fine-only the authority to require payment of a fine otherwise provided for by law. Since-the juvenile statutes did not provide the underlying power to impose the penalty, the court refused to approve it as a condition of probation. <em>Id. </em>at 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The Supreme Court clarified its holding in <em>M. L., supra, </em>two years later in <em>State in Interest of D. G. W., supra, </em>which authorized the imposition of restitution as a condition of juvenile probation. The court found fines to be essentially punitive in nature whereas it perceived the legislative policy with regard to juveniles to be to correct and rehabilitate. Having determined that restitution was not \u201cprimarily punitive,\u201d the court held that its use \u201cwould not fall within the interdiction\u201d of <em>M. L., supra. </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>at 497-501. In the present case we similarly view the driver\u2019s license revocation order as having a rehabilitative purpose, and as not being \u201cprimarily punitive\u201d in nature. Therefore, the holding of <em>M. L. </em>does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">We add that although probation assumes that the offender can be rehabilitated without serving a jail sentence,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-7\">. . . this is not to say that probation is meant to be painless. Probation has an inherent sting, and restrictions upon the freedom of the probationer are realistically punitive in quality. [In re <em>Buehrer, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>501, 509 (1967)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">The same is true of the driver\u2019s license revocation now imposed as a condition of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>The revocation order was, however, for a period of two years, and was therefore in contravention of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4-63 which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-5\">Any order of disposition entered in a case under this act shall terminate when the juvenile who is the subject of the order attains the age of 18, or 1 year from the date of the order whichever is later unless such order is pursuant to subsection h of section 20 or is sooner terminated by its terms or by order of the juvenile and domestic relations court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Since the juvenile was 18 years-old at the time of disposition, the order should not have been for a period longer than one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">We conclude that the revocation was a valid exercise of the judge\u2019s dispositional power, limited in this circumstance due to J.A.B.\u2019s age to a period of one year. As modified, we do not find the judge\u2019s disposition to be excessive. <em>State v. Whitaker, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>503 (1979).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b424-11\">This statute was repealed by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C-.98-2, effective September 1, 1979. However, there remains ample authority in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4-61 for the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court (J.D.R.Ct.) to grant probation. <em>State in Interest of D. G. W., </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>488, 499 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b425-7\">This statute was also repealed by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:98-2, effective September 1, 1979. As the portion quoted <em>infra </em>indicates, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4-61 c makes it clear that statutory authority still exists for a J.D.R.Ct. to impose conditions on a term of probation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
