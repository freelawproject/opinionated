On the afternoon of the 16th of September of that year, the plaintiff\u2019s son was in charge of the craft involved here, <em>Sachem, </em>and aided by a boy friend had taken the boat down the Sound on a pleasure sail. They returned at about 5:30 p. m. and picked up their mooring at Morris Cove. The wind was blow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>ing fresh from the southwest at this time, and as they reached <em>Sachem\u2019s </em>mooring and were preparing to make her secure, they observed that <em>Georgianna, </em>the defendants\u2019 yacht, a somewhat larger boat than <em>Sachem, </em>was anchored directly to windward of their own mooring, one hundred and fifty or two hundred feet away, and was dragging her anchor and drifting straight with the wind upon <em>Sachem. </em>Durham thereupon took his small boat and went aboard <em>Georgianna </em>where he \u201ctampered with the anchoring device.\u201d He then returned to <em>Sachem, </em>and almost at once the drifting of Georgianna. \u2014which had momentarily stopped as a result of Durham\u2019s attention to the anchor chain \u2014 began again with increased speed, and she bumped stern on into <em>Sachem, </em>lying head to the wind and unable to avoid the collision, and did material damage as described in the complaint.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-6\">Upon these facts the court found that the defendants were without negligence, and that the negligence of the plaintiff was responsible for the injury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-7\">The appeal complains, under various heads, of the alleged error of the trial court in reaching the conclusion that the plaintiff\u2019s negligence was responsible for the injury, and attempts to challenge the correctness of the court\u2019s conclusion upon certain material matters of fact essentially involved in that conclusion; but no effort has been made by motion or otherwise to correct the finding in any respect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-8\">Upon motion the evidence has been certified and made a part of the record as upon proceedings under General Statutes, \u00a7 5832.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b488-9\"><em>Frank Kenna, </em>for the appellant (plaintiff).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b488-10\"><em>Hadlai A.

The finding confessedly warrants the judgment, and nothing on the record gives us authority to meddle with it. Our practice has long been settled upon this point, and the course to be pursued, by one who seeks a correction of material facts upon which the judgment rests, has been clearly defined in our decisions. <em>Dennison </em>v. <em>Waterville Cutlery Co., </em>80 Conn. 596, 597, 69 Atl. 1022; <em>Boughton </em>v. <em>Boughton, </em>77 Conn. 7, 9, 58 Atl. 226. The plaintiff is without standing here, since he wholly ignores the vital initial step of asking a correction of the finding as a warrant for the ultimate correction of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">With the record before us, however, we are reluctant to leave this disposition of the case open to the inference that the appeal must have prevailed upon its merits but for the technical insufficiency of the steps taken to get it here. This is not so. The result must have been the same were we permitted to use the certified evidence for the conclusive purpose of its submission on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">The trial court could only have found upon the testimony that when the young men in charge of <em>Sachem </em>brought her to her moorings that afternoon, a stiff breeze was blowing straight out of the southwest; that while they were stowing sail, they saw <em>Georgianna, </em>anchored not more than two hundred feet dead to windward, drag at her anchorage and drift straight down upon them; that young Durham at once went aboard <em>Georgianna </em>in <em>Sachem\u2019s </em>small boat, and in an effort to stop the drifting, paid out some feet of <em>Georgianna\u2019s </em>anchor chain. When this slack had been taken up, the drifting for the moment stopped, and Durham at once returned to <em>Sachem, </em>when, while the work of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>making that yacht snug was proceeding, <em>Georgianna </em>again dragged her anchor, and bore down upon and collided with <em>Sachem, </em>\u2014 the latter by this time having been put in a position where prompt action on her part to escape collision was impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Quite apart, therefore, from any question of negligence on the part of the defendants \u2014 which may or may not present other considerations, \u2014 it is obvious that the court must have found, upon these facts, the plaintiff guilty of negligence essentially chargeable with the injury. Clearly neither <em>Sachem\u2019s </em>time of peril nor her need for' watchful caution to avert it, was limited to the actual interval that she lay helpless in the lee of the drifting <em>Georgianna. </em>It did not pass until there was the plainest ground for believing that the mere emergency measure of young Durham for checking the dragging of <em>Georgianna\u2019s </em>anchor was effective. The momentary check of the boat\u2019s drift when the paid-out slack of the chain had been taken up, was obviously not enough to settle that point, and the court\u2019s conclusion is obviously justified by the plain lack of care which this view of the facts exposes, in leaving <em>Sachem </em>helpless and unprotected against a peril of which they had been\u2019 amply warned, before they had ground for assuming that the peril had been overcome or removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
