There is no evidence of intolerable cruelty and none was offered before the committee.\u201d (2) \u201c8. That the committee erred as a matter of law in admitting over the defendant\u2019s objection, the testimony of Miss Atwood, for the reason that the question called for the fact of communication and for a statement in reality of the facts so communicated, and that the question as stated comes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>clearly within the rule against the admission of hearsay.\u201d The testimony is as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-6\">\u201cQ. Well, now, did Mrs. Jacobs communicate to you the fact that her husband was choking her from time to time? Judge Tuttle: I object to that. Mr. Clarke: What\u2019s the objection? Judge Tuttle: Pure hearsay. Mr. Clarke: I haven\u2019t asked her for anything Mrs. Jacobs said, I have asked her if she communicated the fact to her. Judge Tuttle: I object to it. Mr. Clarke: I claim it. Judge Tuttle: Certainly that\u2019s hearsay. It is equivalent to saying did Mrs. Jacobs tell you her husband had assaulted her. Of course it\u2019s inadmissible. This isn\u2019t an action for bastardy. Mr. Clarke: What she communicated wouldn\u2019t be admissible, I admit; but the fact that she did communicate is admissible. The Committee: I am inclined to think Mr. Clarke is right on that, Judge. Judge Tuttle: Will Your Honor note an exception?\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-7\">A demurrer to those portions of the remonstrance which had already been passed upon by the first demurrer, was sustained substantially because they \u201cask the court to revise the action of the committee on questions of pure fact.\u201d After a hearing upon the remaining matters, the court overruled the entire remonstrance and found as follows with regard to the matters involved in the hearing:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-8\">\u201c13. As to the allegation of said paragraph 3, that no evidence of intolerable cruelty existed in the case and none was offered by the plaintiff, the court after a perusal of a transcript of all the evidence in the hearing before the committee, finds that from the testimony of the plaintiff, corroborated by that of Mrs. Ida Huntley White, her mother, and of Mrs. Mary A. White, her grandmother, the committee, if he believed said testimony to be true, might properly have found that the defendant was guilty of intolerable cruelty toward his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>wife in that he seized her by the throat and tightening his grip thereon caused her great injury and suffering, being in effect the allegation of specification 1, of the plaintiff\u2019s more specific statement, as on file. 14. The court therefore finds that the finding of the committee in this regard was not made without proper evidence. 15. Upon the ground of remonstrance set up in paragraph 8 thereof, the court finds that the committee\u2019s admission of the testimony of the witness Atwood was open to the objection made by defendant\u2019s counsel, and was improperly admitted. 16. The court finds, however, that from the nature of the testimony and the manner in which it was treated and in effect disclaimed by plaintiff\u2019s counsel, that it did not harm the defendant in the estimation of the committee, and that the defendant is not entitled to have the report set aside by reason of the admission of this testimony.

Upon the first of them, we think the trial court correctly held that the finding of intolerable cruelty on the part of the defendant was warranted by the evidence before the committee. Cruelty includes any wilful act of a human being which inflicts unnecessary pain.- Webster\u2019s Diet., <em>Verb. </em>So persisted in as to become \u201cintolerable and to render a continuance of the (marriage) relation by the suffering victim impracticable,\u201d it grows into a ground for divorce. <em>Morehouse </em>v. <em>Morehouse, </em>70 Conn. 420, 427, 39 Atl. 516. The test of its unbearable character does not therefore necessarily depend upon any aggravated quality of the given act or acts of which it consists, but rather upon the persistent recurrence or continuance of conduct to which such acts give expression. An isolated act, though an inherently cruel one, may wholly fail, either in its nature or in the effect it is calculated to produce, to warrant characterization as intolerable, or beyond reasonable endurance; but if it is typical of conduct which forms the constant and daily habit of one in his association with and treatment of another, the cumulative effect upon -its victim may well become so, within any fair and humane construction of such terms. So too, even if its continuance be not literally and strictly an unbroken one, if the conduct is so persistently recurrent at irregular intervals that its victim is never free from reasonable dread of it, or sure of even temporary respite from its infliction, it may necessarily acquire the same intolerable character.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">From the evidence before him the committee might have found that the defendant on many occasions choked the plaintiff, \u2014 sometimes so violently as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>cause her much suffering, and to leave both a soreness of the throat and the humiliation of tell-tale marks upon the skin; that this conduct was accompanied by acts and language indicating his infatuation for other women, and an apparent desire to provoke his wife into leaving him because he was tired of her; that it was practically continuous or recurrent at short intervals for a long period before the final separation of the parties, and injuriously affected her health. This was quite enough to warrant the conclusion of the committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">The remaining ground of appeal deals with the question asked of Miss Atwood, and the trial court\u2019s treatment of the committee\u2019s admission of it as harmless error. Neither the question nor the mere \"yes\u201d which answered it and closed that line of examination, \u2014 as our inspection of the unprinted evidence discloses, \u2014 comes within any exception to the hearsay rule recognized in our practice, and the defendant\u2019s objection should have been sustained. A reference to the record clearly shows, however, that its admission cannot have harmed the defendant, and for these reasons: Another witness for the plaintiff, her mother, had already testified to having been told by her that the defendant choked her. This came in without objection, and in the course of the defendant\u2019s subsequent examination by his counsel his attention was called to the mother\u2019s statement and he was asked whether he had ever choked his wife. He said that \"in a playful way\u201d he had, \u2014 a sort of confession and avoidance that at once rendered harmless Miss Atwood\u2019s answer to the single inadmissible question that had been asked of her. Her testimony had been definitely limited by the committee to the simple fact of a communication by the plaintiff that chokings had occurred, \u2014 whether in outbursts of playfulness or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>otherwise, it did not appear, since Miss Atwood was in effect forbidden to say whether the plaintiff had enlightened her as to the quality of the husband\u2019s conduct attending the performances. The husband\u2019s answer, therefore, admitted the truth of everything which the committee, by his own expressed restriction, was warranted in gathering from Miss Atwood\u2019s testimony, and the trial court properly disregarded the error as one which did not harm the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Our conclusion necessarily disposes of the claim for a correction of the finding, which is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">\u2022 In this opinion Prentice, C. J., Beach and Gager, Js., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b75-9\">Wheeler, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1e\">(dissenting). The evidence of intolerable cruelty was confined to the period subsequent to the death of defendant\u2019s father, February 16th, 1918, and prior to the date when plaintiff left defendant\u2019s house, December 5th, 1918.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">Mrs. Jacobs testified as to the period prior to the father\u2019s death as follows: \u201cQ. During all that time, that two years and more, up to the time of the elder Jacobs\u2019 death, you and your husband got along pretty well? A. Yes. Q. And you had nothing to find fault with until this change after his father\u2019s death? A. Well, nothing serious to find fault with.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-11\">In March, 1918, defendant hired a cottage at the shore for his wife and purchased an automobile for her use. In April they took a pleasure trip to New York, and about July 1st, 1918, Mrs. Jacobs moved to the cottage at the shore and remained there up to sometime in the following September. The defendant twice remained over night at the cottage, otherwise he was not there. In June, 1918, the plaintiff brought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>this action for divorce. Mrs. Jacobs lived in the homes provided for her by her husband until she left his house, December 5th, 1918; the defendant occupied the homes with her except that he was at the shore cottage but twice. From the middle of April, 1918, they did not cohabit.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">The witnesses for the plaintiff as to acts of cruelty and conduct of intolerable cruelty were the plaintiff, her mother and her grandmother.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">This summary, fragmentary as it is, will indicate that the proof was not disinterested in character, or broad in its extent or in the period of time it covered. It was all flatly and fully contradicted. There are many features of this testimony, apart from the fact that 'it was generously contradicted, which leave the mind somewhat incredulous of its credibility, and longing for the word of some disinterested and impartial witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">One witness who was not related to the plaintiff was permitted to testify that Mrs. Jacobs, the wife, communicated to her the fact that her husband was choking her from time to time. The majority opinion concedes, without argument, the inadmissibility of this evidence as hearsay, but holds that its admission was harmless error. The trial court so held, and argued that it could not have influenced the committee because plaintiff\u2019s attorney observed to the witness as she was leaving the stand, \u201cYou apparently don\u2019t know much about the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">The majority opinion is unable to accept this reasoning, and adopted a theory new to the case, and that is that the defendant had admitted the choking and hence no harm was done if a statement of what Mrs. Jacobs had said about acts of choking were admitted. The theory of the court seems to be that since this was an admitted fact in the case, corroboration of it by inadmissible evidence was inconsequential in its effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>This certainly does a grievous injustice to the testimony of Mr. Jacobs. At all times he denied every act of physical cruelty, and his counsel, in the 425 pages of the transcript, furnished conclusive evidence that neither they nor their client admitted the charge upon which the action for divorce rested. But let Mr. Jacobs' own words settle the point. \u201cQ. Now, Mrs. White, on page 53, testified that Mrs. Jacobs told her that you had choked her, and that was before they went to the shore, and afterwards. Now, in the first place, did you ever choke Mrs. Jacobs? A. In a playful way I have acted the choking, but I have never in my life tried to choke Mrs. Jacobs, and I doubt very much if there was ever a time when I was playing that there was the least slight mark on her neck, in any way, shape or form. Q. You have never choked Mrs. Jacobs in a fit of passion and made scratches and marks upon her throat which caused her pain? A. No, sir. ... Q. Ever strike your wife in Mrs. White\u2019s presence? A. I never struck my wife. Q. Either in her mother\u2019s presence, or not in her mother\u2019s presence? A. Neither way. I have never \u2022 struck my wife.\u201d The defendant\u2019s denials were explicit and repeated.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">The further suggestion of the court that the communications to Miss Atwood may have related to instances of playful choking and hence were harmless, I fear, does not quite interpret Miss Atwood\u2019s testimony nor fully do justice to the purpose of plaintiff\u2019s counsel. They introduced the evidence in order to prove that the wife did communicate this fact to Miss Atwood. In my opinion this inadmissible testimony cannot be held to have been disregarded by the committee in forming his conclusion that the defendant had been guilty of acts of intolerable cruelty as alleged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
