So tested, the admission in the answer that the plaintiff\u2019s decedent \"died on the day he is said to have received his injuries, coupled with the testimony as to their nature and extent, would have warranted the inference that death resulted from the injuries, while the boy\u2019s age \u2014 six years \u2014 left it exclusively for the jury to say whether contributory negligence was attributable to him. <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>Shearer, </em>83 Conn. 73, 75 Atl. 88; <em>Rohloff </em>v. <em>Fair Haven &amp; W. R. Co., </em>76 Conn. 689, 58 Atl. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">Whether or not the defendant\u2019s conduct was negligent rested upon these facts: His automobile, \u201cgoing fast,\u201d was driven without warning signal of any kind and, with no slackening of its speed, toward the place where seven or eight young boys were playing on the edge of the traveled road, shouting, in motion, and noisily absorbed in and intent upon their game, and came into fatal collision with the plaintiff\u2019s decedent, who was one of the boys so engaged. We cannot say that in the situation so presented, and with the question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>of contributory negligence wholly eliminated by the age of the boy, the jury might not have found for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">There is error and a new trial is ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
