</em>verdict and judgment for the defendant, and appeal by the plaintiff.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"ACo\">\n<em>Error and new trial ordered.</em>\n</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-8\">The plaintiff offered evidence to prove the following facts: On May 19th, 1917, Mrs. Burkle accompanied by her daughter whom she held by the hand, and by her son William, aged five years and eight months who was riding a tricycle just in front of her, left her home on Congress Avenue, New Haven, and walked east along the north sidewalk a short distance when she turned south, and before descending from the curb to the traveled way she looked to the east and saw a trolley-car approaching coming toward her on the north track about six hundred feet distant and traveling at a speed of twenty miles an hour.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-9\">The double trolley-tracks of defendant were in the middle of the street. At this point the street was thirty-eight feet two inches from curb to curb, the distance from the north curb to the north rail of the north track was eleven feet eight inches; between rails four feet eight and one half inches, and between the tracks five feet, leaving the space from the south rail of the south track to the south curb twelve feet and one inch.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-10\">The neighborhood from Downes Street beyond the. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>place of accident was populous and occupied chiefly by dwelling-houses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-6\">The line of vision of Mrs. Burkle and William, while -on the sidewalk or in the traveled way, was unobstructed looking east and up the street as far as and beyond Downes Street. It was likewise unobstructed from any point in the street looking south from and beyond Downes Street, and the motorman, had he looked, could have seen Mrs. Burkle and her two children during all the time after she left her house and as they left the sidewalk and walked or rode across the street.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-7\">Mrs. Burkle stepped from the curb and had nearly walked across the street when she turned and saw William on his tricycle between the rails of the north track and the trolley-car ten feet from him and approaching at the speed of twenty miles an hour. This car was near the end of its run. The conductor was at the time of the accident in the middle of the car preparing for the return trip, while the motorman was bending over the chain and preparing the car for the return trip and keeping no lookout. Mrs. Burkle, on seeing William in peril, screamed, and the motorman hearing the scream straightened up and placed his left hand on the lever. He rang no gong and gave no warning to the child of the car\u2019s approach, and did not drop his fender. The car struck the child, threw him from his tricycle, and he died as a result of the collision.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-8\">When Mrs. Burkle stepped into the gutter to cross the street, William dismounted from his tricycle and put it in the gutter and the car was then five hundred feet distant. He then mounted and rode across the street and onto the north track where defendant\u2019s car hit him. The motorman had time and opportunity to have stopped his car and dropped the fender and given the child warning of the car\u2019s approach before hitting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>the child, but he failed to do these because he was not keeping a proper lookout and did not have his car under control. When the car was fifty feet or more away from William, the motorman knew that William was then at the curb and headed across the street. He could at this time have stopped his car before reaching the place of accident.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-6\">The defendant offered evidence to prove these facts: At all times prior to the accident the motorman was keeping a proper lookout, had the car under proper control and was operating it at proper speed, and was using due care to avoid striking persons who might be on the track. The motorman did not see Mrs. Burkle and daughter when they crossed the street, owing to the distance the car was away. He saw the boy William when he was getting from the curb to the street and the car was then fifty feet away in a direct line from the boy. He sounded his gong, and there was nothing to indicate that the boy would attempt to cross the track. As soon as the boy started from the curb toward the track the motorman sounded his gong and reversed his car and did all he could to stop the car. He did not drop the fender because there was not time. The motorman did all he could after he saw the boy was in peril, but it was impossible for him to have avoided striking the boy. The cause of the accident was the act of the boy William in riding onto the north track when the car was only a few feet away. There was nothing in the circumstances that would have warned the motorman, who was keeping a proper lookout, that the boy was in, or about to enter into, a position of peril, before the motorman acted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b535-7\"><em>Frank S.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ank\">The plaintiff claimed to have proved that the injuries to the decedent resulted from the failure of the motorman to keep a proper lookout, to have his car under proper control, to give warning of the approach of the car, and to drop his fender when danger of collision threatened.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">The decedent was a child of immature years. The court instructed the jury that it \u201cwas not his [the motorman\u2019s] duty in the absence of special circumstances, which do not appear in this case, to keep a more vigilant watch for children than for adults, since in the nature of things his lookout must be for all legitimate users of the street alike. It was only after the actual presence of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate in danger or about to go into danger was seen or ought to have been seen by him, that his duty to him, plaintiff\u2019s intestate, was greater than it would have been to adults.\u201d This was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">The special circumstances do appear: a congested and populous neighborhood, composed mainly along this street of dwelling-houses and a traveled way thirty-eight feet wide. It was the motorman\u2019s duty to keep in mind the populous character of the street, the residential character of the neighborhood, the likelihood of children being in the street and of their crossing from one side to the other, and to bear in mind the characteristics of young children in respect to their nonappreciation of danger; and therefore reasonable care by him at this place would mean the operation of his car with greater care to avoid injury to children than if they were adults able to better help themselves. <em>DiMaio </em>v. <em>Yolen Bottling Works, </em>93 Conn. 597, 107 Atl. 497. The motorman\u2019s duty was to operate his car in this locality in the expectancy of children being upon this street and upon the railroad track; his duty in this particular was to anticipate the danger. His <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>duty never varied. It did not rest dormant until he saw, or ought to have seen, a child in danger or about to go into danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">The verdict of the jury, taken in connection with the claims of the parties of evidence proved, would indicate that the question of contributory negligence was the decisive factor in the verdict. If this be so, the importance of the instruction upon the issue of the boy\u2019s own negligent conduct is great. A part of the instruction was this: \u201cAgain, the plaintiff\u2019s intestate if only five years and eight months old was bound to use such care as reasonably prudent boys of his age under similar circumstances would, have used. ... If . . . you do not find that he acted as a reasonably prudent boy of his age ordinarily would have acted in going upon the track when he did, and that his act in so doing was the material contributing cause of the accident, then your verdict should be for the defendant.\u201d This instruction differs from our rule of reasonable care for the immature child. We merely require him to use such judgment and experience as children of similar age, judgment and experience would use under the circumstances. \u201cOrdinary or reasonable care, as applied to a young child, means such care as may reasonably be expected of children of similar age, judgment and experience, under the circumstances.\u201d <em>DiMaio </em>v. <em>Yolen Bottling Works, </em>93 Conn. 597, 600, 107 Atl. 497; <em>Rohloff </em>v. <em>Fair Haven &amp; W. R. Co., </em>76 Conn. 689, 693, 58 Atl. 5; <em>Kishalaski </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>94 Conn. 196, 108 Atl. 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">The court was also in error in charging that \u201cif you believe from the evidence that plaintiff\u2019s intestate . . . knew that trolley-cars ran frequently through Congress Avenue, and knew that it was dangerous . . . and, notwithstanding, without looking or taking other prec\u00e1utions to see whether one might be coming, rode <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>out suddenly from the sidewalk upon the track immediately in front of a car so that he was instantly struck after reaching the track, and that such conduct was the proximate cause of his injury, your verdict should be then under such facts for the defendant.\u201d The court in this instruction makes the contributpry negligence of the boy determinable by the knowledge he then possessed. Knowledge of the child is one consideration in ascertaining whether he has been guilty of contributory negligence, but it is not the controlling element. The judgment of the boy \u2014 that is, his discretion to heed and his power of self-control \u2014 is the predominant element. <em>Brennan </em>v. <em>Fair Haven &amp; W. R. Co., </em>45 Conn. 284, 298; <em>Rohloff </em>v. <em>Fair Haven &amp; W. R. Co., </em>76 Conn. 689, 693, 58 Atl. 5; <em>Birge </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>19 Conn. 507, 512.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">The court further charged: \u201cI do hot think a motorman is under ordinary circumstances bound in the exercise of ordinary \u2022 caution and prudence to anticipate that a pedestrian, either adult or child, will suddenly attempt to cross in the middle of a block on a tricycle or velocipede, without at least giving some proper heed and caution to the possibility of being caught by an approaching trolley-car under such circumstances.\u201d This instruction, as well as the latter part of the preceding instruction as applied to a child of immature years, is erroneous. Such conduct cannot be said as matter of law to be negligent. \u201cSuch conduct may be evidence of contributory negligence in a child as described [age six], but not necessarily conclusive.\u201d <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Derby Street Ry. Co., </em>73 Conn. 249, 254, 47 Atl. 120. The instruction as given would relieve the motorman, in the situation which the plaintiff claimed this case presented, of the duty of keeping a lookout and of determining when he saw the boy taking his tricycle from the curb and placing it in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>gutter that he was probably about to follow his mother and cross the street. Yet this was the reasonable conclusion to draw if the facts were as the plaintiff claims them.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">The further instruction: \u201cAgain, if you find that the proximate cause of the accident was the act of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate in riding directly in front of the car, when he was so near that it was impossible for the motorman in the exercise of reasonable care to avoid striking him, the plaintiff cannot recover,\u201d \u2014 is another instance where the court is applying to the child the rule for the adult. The jury ought not to be asked to pass upon the question of the contributory negligence of the child, without having presented to them the rule to which we have referred, by which this is to be found; and because this question could only be decided by consideration of the age, maturity, intelligence, experience and judgment of the child in the light of the circumstances present, it was one for the jury. <em>Kishalaski </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>94 Conn. 196, 108 Atl. 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">The court instructed the jury that, \u201c in an emergency when the motorman has but a second or two to act, the reasonableness of his conduct is to be judged under the circumstances as they appear to him at the time.\u201d His conduct is not to be judged as the circumstances appeared to him, for he may not have acted as the reasonably prudent man in seeing, knowing and appreciating them, but as they ought to have appeared to him in the exercise of reasonable care.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">The instruction upon the element of speed is one of the strenuously urged claims of error. The court followed defendant\u2019s requests to charge, which, read as a whole, resolve themselves to this: \u2018 \u2018 What is a reasonable speed for a street-car depends upon all the surrounding circumstances. ... It is only when the speed is so great as to cause unreasonable and- un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>nec\u00e9ssary danger to other users of the highway who are themselves taking reasonable care, that it could be said to be negligence.\u201d This was correct, and sufficiently plain and definite to be capable of being understood and applied by the jury. The request of the defendant that \u201cmere evidence of high speed, and of high speed alone, is not evidence of negligence,\u201d should not have been given; not because it is a wrong theoretical statement, but because it is an impractical proposition to put before a jury. Speed is always associated with other circumstances, and it should be so presented to the jury when made the subject of discussion in a charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">The court charged in the language of defendant\u2019s request: \u201cIf you find that the car was being operated at a rate of speed excessive under the circumstances . . . , plaintiff cannot recover unless he proves by a fair preponderance of the evidence that this excessive speed, lack of lookout and lack of warning, was the proximate cause of accident.\u201d The \u201cand\u201d before \u201clack of warning\u201d was probably intended to be \u201cor.\u201d Other parts of the charge make this clear. The instruction is also open to the criticism made, that it excludes one of the elements of negligence relied upon by the plaintiff, the failure to drop the fender.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">Assignment of error for failure to charge on the subject of wantonness, in connection with the subject of contributory negligence, is not well taken. The case did not present the elements upon which to base such a claim, and the record does not show that such claim was made in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">It is significant that the only parts of the charge which are claimed to be erroneous, are eleven of the requests to charge which the court incorporated in its charge:</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">The five assignments of error in the rejection of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>evidence, which are pursued, are for the exclusion of alleged leading questions. It will rarely happen that prejudicial error will be found upon such assignments of error. Counsel can readily, and should, avoid the obj ection. The record indicates unnecessary obj ections, somewhat too stringent ruling in the exclusion of such questions, and an unwillingness on the part of counsel to change the form of his question in accordance with the ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
