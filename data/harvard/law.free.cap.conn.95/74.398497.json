J., Wheeler, Beach, Gager and Case, Js.</p>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b86-11\">Upon a trial for murder the State introduced evidence that the accused, after heated words with his victim accompanied with one or more blows, left the room, went into an adjoining bedroom, got a loaded revolver from a bureau, and then returned and shot the decedent. <em>Held </em>that this warranted the jury in finding that the killing, which was not disputed, was malicious.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b86-12\">Submitted on briefs May 7th</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AMt\">decided June 10th, 1920.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-13\">Indictment for murder in the first degree, brought to the Superior Court in New Haven County and tried to the jury before Keeler, <em>J.; </em>verdict and judgment of guilty of murder in the second degree, and appeal by the accused.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AFOi\">\n<em>No error.</em>\n</disposition>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b86-14\"><em>Francis P.

Upon the evidence the jury reasonably could have found that the killing, thus occasioned, was neither accidental, justifiable, nor without malice. It surely could not have found that it was accidental, and the fact, abundantly established by the testimony, that the accused, after a wordy altercation with his victim, in the course of which a blow or blows were struck, left the room in which that altercation occurred, went into an adjoining bedroom, obtained a loaded revolver from a bureau therein, and returned with it to the room which he had left, to open fire upon his victim, was too persuasive that the accused\u2019s conduct was actuated by malice to be overcome in the mind of a trier by the most unsatisfactory testimony which was presented to give a different color to his conduct. At least the jury reasonably could have refused to accept this testimony as giving such color, and find upon the evidence that, the admitted killing was with malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
