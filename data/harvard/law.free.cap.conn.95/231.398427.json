The street floor of its building included a large lobby, used for the reception of and as a lounging place for its guests and patrons, and floored with a hard thing having a more or less polished and slippery surface. Two elevators on the north side of this lobby are operated for the convenience of persons patronizing the hotel, and approached by a direct passage from the body of the lobby running between two large upright columns, nine feet apart and near the elevators\u2019 entrance. On May 1st, 1917, the portable furniture of the lobby included a number of large settees, so placed as to leave convenient passageways from various points,., including a side entrance from the lobby to the ShubertTheater,, to and from the elevators referred to, and at eight o\u2019clock on that evening these seats were occupied, and many guests were standing in the passageways described. On that day and for a long time before it, \u201cthe defendant maintained and permitted a soft, flexible and easily wrinkled stringer rug to lie\u201d on the floor of the lobby between the columns, and lengthwise of the passage to the elevators, \u201cwhich rug was somewhat worn and frayed on its edges, . . . and because of the constant travel upon it, was easily displaced, and was in fact frequently wrinkled and displaced, which condition was well known to the management of said hotel. Because of said condition there was a standing order in said hotel to straighten out and keep said rug, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>if possible, smooth and flat upon said floor, which orders were often carried out by the attendants in said hotel.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-6\">On the evening in question the plaintiff as one of several guests of people living in the hotel, had left her wraps in the apartment of her hosts on an upper floor, and proceeded at about eight o\u2019clock to the Shubert Theater. After reaching her seat, she felt the need of her wrap, and at once left the theater to return for it to the apartment where it had been left. When she arrived in the hotel lobby on her way to the elevator, she was conscious that the floor was slippery, and walked with caution, but at no time was she conscious that the rug referred to was lying on the floor ahead of her. She saw that both elevators were open for use, and she approached looking straight ahead at them and at their attendants who stood before them. She was hurrying a little, and was obliged to pass between and around other guests standing in the passageway. As she reached the spot where the rug lay, \u201cshe slipped the toe of her right foot under it,\u201d and stepping upon the rug with her left foot, was immediately pitched forward to the floor, landing upon her face and body and receiving severe and painful injuries.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-7\">The defendant claimed to have proved that the plaintiff, from frequent visits to friends at the hotel, well knew the condition and character of the lobby floor, and had often passed over the rug referred to\u2014 which was not badly worn or frayed on its edges; that she was accustomed to hardwood floors and rugs both at home and in the homes of her friends; that she was hurrying when she left the theater to secure her wrap, and as she approached the elevator through the hotel lobby, which was brightly lighted, she was proceeding \u201cin a half walk and half run\u201d with her eyes fixed upon the waiting elevator and looking at nothing else; that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>the rug lay flat and unwrinkled at the time, and the plaintiff\u2019s tripping upon it was due solely to her failure to obserye where she was going.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-6\">Upon motion of the plaintiff the jury viewed the hotel lobby with the rug placed where it lay at the time the plaintiff was injured.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-7\">Upon the trial of the case, the plaintiff offered as a witness the manager of a local insurance agency who, in the jury\u2019s absence, was asked whether as agent of an insurance company he had \u201cissued a policy guaranteeing a loss against damage to the New Haven Hotel Company covering thojr case now on trial.\u201d The question was claimed \u201cfor the purpose of showing and proving, or tending to prove, that the hotel management saw that danger which we are complaining of and anticipated it and insured against it.\u201d Upon objection it was excluded, and an exception was noted to the ruling.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-8\">The plaintiff offered two witnesses \u2014 Ex-Governor Woodruff and Mr. Walker, the injured woman\u2019s husband \u2014 who testified to an acquaintance with conditions existing in the hotel lobby prior to the night in question. Each was asked whether on any occasion before that night he had seen the rug referred to \u201c displaced and wrinkled\u201d or \u201ccorrugated at the edges.\u201d Mr. Woodruff was also asked: \u201cDid you ever, yourself, slip on that rug in that hotel, prior to May 1st, 1917?\u201d And this question was asked of the other: \u201cKnowing the quality and class of the rug, whether or not in your opinion, it would be wrinkled up if any one stepped on it a glancing step?\u201d Each of these questions was excluded upon objection, and exceptions were taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-9\">Each of the witnesses last mentioned was asked, from his acquaintance with the place in question, whether the maintenance of the rug there made a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>dangerous condition for persons using the passage where it lay. In each instance the court excluded the question upon objection, and the plaintiff duly excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-6\">The appeal assigns error upon these rulings in the rejection of testimony, and upon the court\u2019s charge to the jury in certain portions sufficiently referred to in the opinion. Error is also assigned upon the denial of the plaintiff\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict, and all the evidence is printed as a part of the record.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b247-7\"><em>Prentice W. Chase </em>and <em>Albert McC. Mathewson, </em>for the appellant (plaintiff).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b247-8\"><em>Edmund Zacher </em>and <em>William B. Ely, </em>for the appellee (defendant).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b247-9\">Case, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0l\">If given weight and effect quite within the jury\u2019s right to accord it as sole judges of the facts, there was evidence which warranted the verdict, and the trial court properly refused to set it aside. The question of negligence, as the case was presented to them, was one for the jury to determine without interference from the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">The rulings upon evidence disclose no error. Proof that the defendant was protected by insurance from pecuniary losses arising out of the conduct of its business, was wholly incompetent to establish any issue before the jury. The objection to such evidence in cases of this character is a fundamental one, and reaches deeper than its possibiliti\u00e9s for working prejudicial mischief with the jury. The mere fact of insurance neither implies an expectation of loss, nor confesses knowledge of a situation likely to produce one. Nor does it acquire force or weight as evidence of negligence on the part of the insured by the happening of some event necessarily unforeseen when the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>tract was made, but in its nature within the general guarantee of indemnity.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The question asked each of the witnesses, Wood-ruff and Walker, whether he had ever before seen the rug \u201cdisplaced and wrinkled,\u201d was clearly too broad for any proper purpose of the inquiry. No attempt was made to define the cause of any such displacement, or the conditions under which it came about, and without some such restriction to its scope, the question was inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Whether or not the witness Woodruff had ever slipped upon the rug was without pertinence to the case upon which the plaintiff relied. The cause of her mishap, as disclosed by the court\u2019s statement of her claims upon the evidence, was in tripping upon the rug by catching a foot under it in her progress across the floor. That someone else at some other time may have \u201cslipped\u201d upon the same rug, was very clearly of no bearing upon the case presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">Complaint is made because the court excluded the question asked of the two witnesses referred to, based upon their acquaintance with conditions at the place where the plaintiff was injured, and calling in each instance for an opinion whether the maintenance of the rug there was \u201ca dangerous thing.\u201d It is unnecessary to determine whether the-case was one which justified the introduction of nonexpert opinion evidence. If so, the court\u2019s rejection of it was harmless error, since the only basis for its admission as defined in <em>Sydleman </em>v. <em>Beckwith, </em>43 Conn. 9, 12, was wholly removed by the subsequent visit of the jury to the scene of the trouble and the reproduction there, for their enlightenment, of the precise conditions claimed to have existed on the evening in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">The chief criticism of the charge in the assignments of error is that it gave the jury no adequate definition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>of the terms \u201cproximate cause\u201d and \u201ccontributory negligence.\u201d There is no foundation for this complaint. After sufficiently defining negligence and cautioning the jury that to become actionable, it must be the proximate cause of the injury complained of, the court proceeds: \u201cThe proximate cause is the direct cause; that cause without which the injury would not have been suffered by the plaintiff. There must be, as you see, therefore, a direct causal connection between the negligence of the defendant and the injury of the plaintiff. Even then the plaintiff cannot recover of the defendant if she has not proved, in the maimer already explained, that is, by a fair preponderance of the evidence, that she was herself free from contributory negligence. That is, if you are not satisfied that the plaintiff was free from negligence on her own part which contributed in some degree to her own injury.' If she was guilty of such contributory negligence in any degree whatsoever, then she cannot recover and your verdict must be for the defendant.\u201d Later the court again reminded the jury that they \u201chave two questions to determine; one, as to whether this defendant was negligent, actionably negligente-that is, guilty of such negligence as contributed directly to and was a proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injury; and, second, the question whether this plaintiff was guilty, by her conduct, of contributing directly to her injury, that is, of contributory negligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">These instructions, read in connection with the fair summarized statement of the claims of the parties which the court gave the jury, were amply sufficient for their purpose. <em>Huber </em>v. <em>Douglas, Inc., </em>94 Conn. 167, 108 Atl. 727.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s objection to that portion of the charge quoted which instructs the jury that there can be no recovery \u201cif she was guilty of such contributory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>negligence in any degree whatsoever,\u201d seems based upon a mistaken idea that if the defendant\u2019s negligence was a proximate caus\u00e9 of the injury, her own could not be; in other words, that negligence brought home to one party, excludes in law any such thing as participating negligence by the'Other. It is apparently upon some such theory that the plaintiff\u2019s brief urges that \u201cthere are no degrees in the expression 'contributory negligence.\u2019 Negligence is contributory or it is not, depending upon whether or not it was the proximate cause of the injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">The court, in that portion of the charge under consideration, properly recognized that negligence of both plaintiff and defendant may concurrently exist and operate together as proximate causes of an injury, and that under such circumstances if that of the plaintiff essentially contributes in any measure or degree, there can be no recovery. The language used was .well adapted to express this meaning and was correct in law.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">There was no err\u00f3r in refusing the plaintiff\u2019s specific requests to charge, since the substance of them, so far as the plaintiff was entitled to it, was covered by the instructions as given.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">Other assignments of error are without merit and call for no independent consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
