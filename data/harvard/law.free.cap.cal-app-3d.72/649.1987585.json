The information was amended to plead two prior convictions and defendant admitted them. After a jury trial, he was found guilty as follows: (count I) guilty as charged; (count II) guilty of robbery in the first degree, done with great bodily injury within the meaning of section 213 of the Penal Code; (count III) guilty as charged; (count IV) guilty of attempted kidnaping.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was sentenced to state prison in the manner hereinafter discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">\n<em>Counts I, II and III</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">The three counts all encompass a single episode involving Janice Trent. Ms. Trent was an off-duty prostitute; according to her testimony, on the evening of March 12, 1976, defendant picked her up in his automobile, pointed \u201ca gun\u201d at her, drove her to a drive-in where he compelled her to have oral copulation with him. During the trip and during the drive-in incident, defendant hit Ms. Trent several times, tied her hands with a cord and burned her back with his cigarette. After leaving the drive-in, defendant drove to a drive-in restaurant where they had soft drinks. As they left the restaurant, defendant ordered Ms. Trent to give him $5 from her purse; she complied.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Although defendant produced alibi testimony as to the night in question, the jury accepted Ms. Trent\u2019s testimony, which was supported by corroboration of her descriptions of the defendant (including tattoos) and by the discovery by the police of the gun used. On this appeal, defendant does not attack the sufficiency of the evidence to support the verdicts on counts I and III; he attacks the degree of the robbery involved in count II and the finding as to section 213 of the Penal Code. He also alleges, with reference to all four counts on which he was convicted, prejudicial error by the prosecuting attorney and the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">\n<em>Counts IV and V</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">These two counts involve an incident on April 1, 1976. On that afternoon, Renae Staton, a prostitute, was picked up by defendant. According to her testimony, after driving a short distance, defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>produced a gun. She became frightened and jumped from the car. Defendant admitted the pick-up but claimed he had only offered her a ride, became disgusted when she solicited him for acts of prostitution and ordered her from the car. He denied threatening her with a gun. Defendant does not attack the sufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict on count IV; he does attack the sentence thereon imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">During his direct examination, defendant testified that he gave consent to the police to search his car and his house. The search disclosed, in his car, the gun allegedly used by defendant. Search of the house followed. Defendant testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-6\">\u201cQ. Now, at sometime did you tell the police to discontinue their search?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-7\">\u201cA. No, never, except when they\u2014before they began the search I told them, \u2018Maybe I should have a lawyer present.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-8\">\u201cAnd they said if I signed this I could call a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-9\">\u201cQ. All right. What happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-10\">\u201cA. They went on and on and on and on until about 10 o\u2019clock; and, you know, I finally told them, T would like to have,\u2019 you know, \u2018a lawyer present. I don\u2019t know what the heck is going on.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-11\">\u201cAnd at that time another detective had come, a Mr. Hodell, and they had a conference over in the corner. And then they decided to stop the search. And at that time I was put in the car and taken into town.\u201d On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked defendant several questions in an attempt to discover at what point the search of the house had stopped. After several questions along that line, and not too informative answers, defense counsel objected: \u201cJust a second. It has been asked and answered several times.\u201d The trial judge interjected, and the following colloquy resulted: \u201cThe Court: Let\u2019s get it straight one more time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-12\">\u201cThe Witness: I asked if I would be able to call an attorney if I agreed to sign this form. The officers told me, \u2018Yes.\u2019 I signed the form. I went along with the search of the car and the house and everything else. And it went on and on, and they had already recovered everything they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>wanted to recover, as far as I knew, Mr. Green. But I said, \u2018May I call an attorney?\u2019 And then we left.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-4\">\u201cQ. After you asked for an attorney the search was stopped; is that true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-5\">\u201cA. After the second time I asked, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-6\">\u201cQ. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-7\">\u201cThe Court: Tell us when you first asked to talk to a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-8\">\u201cThe Witness: When we were outside, Your Honor. When we were still outside and they took my keys and so forth, they asked me to sign this. They wrote it out. They said, \u2018Will you consent to a search?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-9\">\u201cI said\u2014when they told me what I was arrested for, I said, \u2018Certainly. I have nothing to hide.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-10\">\u201cSo they asked me to sign this. I said, \u2018I\u2019ll sign this, but I think I should have a lawyer present.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-11\">\u201cAnd they said, \u2018If you sign this, you can have one. We don\u2019t object to that.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-12\">\u201cThe Court: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-13\">\u201cThe Witness: So I signed that. Then they searched the car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-14\">\u201cThe Court: Wait a minute. You signed it. Did you then said, T want to call a lawyer now\u2019?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-15\">\u201cThe Witness: Yes, I did.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-16\">It is contended that the cross-examination, and the judge\u2019s questioning, improperly emphasized defendant\u2019s constitutional right to refuse a warrantless search. We do not, on the record before us, reach that issue. The only objection to the cross-examination was the one above quoted; there was no objection on the ground now urged, either to the prosecutor\u2019s questions or to those of the judge. No request to strike, or for an admonition, was ever made. Under those circumstances, there is no action of the trial court before us for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">The People\u2019s theory was that the \u201cgun\u201d found in defendant\u2019s car was the one used in both episodes. A police expert testified that that gun was an \u201cair gun.\u201d The trial court gave to the jury CALJIC No. 9.13.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is contended that giving that instruction, without more, in effect told the jury that the air gun was the kind of weapon envisaged by section 21 la of the Penal Code, as that section then read. We see no error. While an air gun is not a \u201cfirearm,\u201d since it uses no explosive to project a bullet, it is still an instrument used to shoot, but one using compressed air rather than explosive for the purpose of projection. As such, it is a \u201cgun\u201d within the meaning of the instruction given.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">The trial court imposed sentence on the four counts of which defendant was convicted as follows: \u201cSentences as to Counts 1 and 2 are ordered to run Consecutively. Sentences as <em>to </em>Counts 3 and 4 are ordered to run Concurrently with each other and Concurrently with sentences as to Counts 1 and 2.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Defendant contends that the sentence violated the provisions of section 654 prohibiting double punishment. The Attorney General agrees that it was error not to have stayed the sentence on count III pending the service of the sentence on count I, but argues that the sentences were otherwise proper. We agree. While all three counts regarding the Trent episode were part of the same series of events, the robbery involved in count II was, on the record before us, clearly an afterthought, not committed as part of the objective\u2014sexual intercourse \u2014involved in counts I and III. Count IV involved a different victim, in an episode totally unconnected with the Trent episode. We modify the judgment in accordance with the Attorney General\u2019s concession, and in the form approved in <em>In re Wright </em>(1967) 65 Cal.2d 650, 655, footnote 4 [56 Cal.Rptr. 110, 422 P.2d 998].</p>\n<p id=\"b622-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">Defendant contends that the sentence on count II (robbery) should not have been enhanced under section 213 of the Penal Code. That section provides that the sentence for robbery of the first degree shall be increased from \u201cnot less than five years\u201d to \u201cfrom 15 years to life\u201d in cases where \u201cthe defendant committed robbery, <em>and in the course of commission of the robbery, </em>with intent to inflict such injury, inflicted great bodily injury on the victim of the robbery.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is not here denied that Ms. Trent did suffer great bodily injury and that that injury was intentionally inflicted. The contention is that those injuries were inflicted in the course of the kidnaping and sexual assault; but that the robbery came after those offenses and the infliction of the injuries was, thus, not \u201cin the course of commission of the robbery.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Although Ms. Trent testified that she gave defendant the $5 in fear that he would repeat the earlier injuries, there is no evidence that he did inflict any injury in carrying out the robbery. We modify the judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">The judgment is modified in the following particulars: (1) strike from the judgment and from the nunc pro tunc order of October 29, 1976, all reference to the infliction of bodily injury to the victim in count II; (2) and modify the sentences imposed to read as follows: \u201c \u2018It Is Hereby Ordered, Adj\u00fcdged and Decreed that the said defendant be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for the term prescribed by law on said counts. Sentences as to Counts I and II are ordered to run consecutively. Sentence as to Count III is stayed [pending service of the sentence on Count I, and thereafter is permanently stayed]. The sentence as to Count IV is ordered to run concurrently with Counts I, II and III.\u2019 \u201d As so modified, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">Files, P. J., and Dunn, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">A petition for a rehearing was denied September 6, 1977, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied October 6, 1977.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b618-9\"> Count V was dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b621-8\"> CALJIC instruction No. 9.13 reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">\u201cA dangerous or deadly weapon means any weapon that is capable of being used to inflict great bodily injury or death.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">\u201cA weapon such as a gun, dirk or blackjack may be said as a matter of law to be a dangerous or deadly weapon.
