Dr. Detels has appealed; we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-12\">Dr. Detels is not a party to the action. His only connection with the case is that he was served with a subpoena duces tecum requiring him to attend a deposition hearing and to produce specified records. Only a party has a right of appeal. (6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Appeals, \u00a7 114, p. 4114.) Now that the trial court has overruled Dr. Detel\u2019s claim of privilege, he can either comply or subject himself to a contempt order. Such an order, if made, is reviewable in this court by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>habeas corpus or by writ of review. That is the only procedure by which a nonparty witness may secure relief from a discovery order.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Files, P. J., and Dunn, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied October 6, 1977.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
