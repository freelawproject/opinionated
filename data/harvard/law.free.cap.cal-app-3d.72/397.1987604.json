Code). The appellate department of the superior court reversed the judgment and ordered publication of its opinion. Subsequently, on this court\u2019s own motion, the cause was ordered transferred hereto for hearing and decision pursuant to rule 62(a), California Rules of Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>We have examined the original file of the appellate department of the superior court including the reporter\u2019s transcripts of all oral proceedings had in the municipal court and conclude that the opinion and judgment of the appellate department of the superior court correctly determine the legal issues involved, thus, we adopt the entirety of the opinion prepared by Judge Arthur L. Alarcon, and the judgment based thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">\u201cThe defendant has appealed from his conviction for using an opiate in violation of Health and Safety Code Section 11550. His pretrial motion to suppress the observations of the arresting officer was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">\u201cHe contends that he was the victim of an unreasonable search which renders his prosecution constitutionally impermissible. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">\u201cFactual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">\u201cOfficer Charles Heilman testified he was present at the El Patio Bar on October 29, 1975. At 11:40 p.m. he saw the defendant leave the restroom and pass him on the way to the bar. The defendant was holding a bottle of beer. Despite the poor lighting, he observed two small brown scab marks over a vein on the defendant\u2019s right hand. One scab was an inch long. He had seen such scabs many times before in connection with the illegal injection of heroin. Officer Heilman also noticed that the defendant\u2019s eyes were watery, his pupils were pinpointed and appeared dilated and he was sniffling and yawning. These symptoms indicated to Officer Heilman that the defendant was experiencing withdrawal symptoms from the illegal use of an opiate.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">\u201cOfficer Heilman told the defendant he was going to examine him for a narcotics violation and asked him to step outside. In the patio outside the bar, the defendant was requested to remove his coat. Officer Heilman observed nine puncture wounds on the defendant\u2019s left arm and eight or nine on his right arm. The freshest puncture wound was two days old. Officer Heilman used a magnifying glass to examine the puncture marks. The defendant was arrested after Officer Heilman examined the defendant\u2019s arms.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">\u201cAt the hearing on the motion to suppress, defense counsel argued that the detention was unlawful and that therefore the observations of the defendant\u2019s arms were the product of an unreasonable search.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>\u201cThe People argued successfully that the presence of tracks and marks on the defendant\u2019s hand gave the officer \u2018reasonable cause to believe that a misdemeanor is being committed, namely a 11550\u2019, in that \u2018the defendant was going through withdrawals.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">\u201cDiscussion</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">\u2019\u2019The observations made by Officer Heilman of the defendant\u2019s arm were made as the result of the request by the officer that the defendant remove his coat. These observations constituted a search. Since no emergency has been shown by the facts, in the absence of consent or a warrant, the only justification for this search would be on the basis that it was incident to a lawful arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">\u201cPenal Code section 836 provides in pertinent part: \u2018A peace officer may make an arrest . . . without a warrant . . .: 1. Whenever he has reasonable cause to believe that the person to be arrested has committed a public offense in his presence.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">\u201cThe prosecution proceeded on the theory that the arrest was lawful because the officer had reasonable cause to believe that a violation of section 11550 of the Health and Safety Code was being committed in his presence. Section 11550 provides in pertinent part as follows: \u2018No person shall use, or be under the influence of any controlled substance ... which is a narcotic drug....\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">\u201cThe arresting officer testified that he believed that the defendant was exhibiting withdrawal symptoms caused by the illegal use of an opiate.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">\u201cWe must decide the novel question as to whether the fact that a person is observed to be experiencing withdrawal symptoms establishes reasonable cause to believe a violation of Section 11550 is being committed in the presence of the observer. To answer this query we must analyze the nature of the separate crimes of \u2018use\u2019 and of being \u2018under the influence of a controlled substance or a narcotic.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">\u201cThe term \u2018use\u2019 of narcotics refers to the act of injecting or ingesting a controlled substance or narcotic (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Thompson </em>(1956) 144 Cal.App.2d Supp. 854, 856 [301 P.2d 313]).  \u2018The object of the statute is to proscribe a <em>use </em>of narcotics that is an activating part of the process of addiction whatever may be the stage of that process at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>time of their use.\u2019 (Emphasis added.) <em>(People </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(1966) 240 Cal.App.2d 496, 501 [49 Cal.Rptr. 663].)</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">\u201cAn officer may arrest for use under section 11550 of the Health and Safety Code when he has reasonable cause to believe that the person to be arrested has injected or ingested a controlled substance in the officer\u2019s presence,  Nothing in the facts presented to the trial court would support a finding that the search of the defendant was based on a reasonable belief that the defendant had used narcotics or a controlled substance in the officer\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">\u201cThe term \u2018under the influence\u2019 as used in section 11550 of the Health and Safety Code refers to the presence of physical symptoms of the unlawful use of narcotics or a controlled substance \u2018in any detectable manner.\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Davis </em>[1966] 240 Cal.App.2d 496, 501).  In the instant matter there was no evidence that the defendant was under the influence of a narcotic or a controlled substance at the time of the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">\u201cThe basis for the search was the opinion of the officer that the defendant was experiencing withdrawal symptoms.  Withdrawal from the use of narcotics is not a crime. It is in fact the direct result of discontinuing the crime of use. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Victor </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 280 [42 Cal.Rptr. 199, 398 P.2d 391], the Supreme Court discusses the various stages of the addiction process. In its discussion of withdrawal symptoms the Supreme Court stated: \u2018(5) temporary cessation (whether voluntary or not) of use of the drug, resulting in manifestation of <em>physical dependence </em>in the form of withdrawal symptoms\u2019 (at p. 302).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">\u201cIt is our view that persons who have ceased the use of narcotics and controlled substances, for whatever reason, should be encouraged and supported rather than subjected to unwarranted searches.  The search of the defendant cannot be justified as incident to a lawful arrest. Accordingly, the trial court erred in denying the motion to suppress the observations of the officer which resulted from the direction to the defendant to take off his coat. The evidence obtained following these observations, including the defendant\u2019s statement, was tainted and should have been suppressed (see <em>Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1963) 371 U.S. 471 [9 L.Ed.2d 441, 83 S.Ct. 407]; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1975) 422 U.S. 590, 598-599 [45 L.Ed.2d 416, 423-425, 95 S.Ct. 2254]).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>\u201cThe judgment is reversed. The trial court is directed to vacate its order denying the motion to suppress and to enter an order granting such motion consistent with this opinion.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b395-13\"> Before Lillie, Acting P.

that he (Officer Heilman) observed \u201csome injection sites on the backside of his right hand\u201d consisting of \u201ctwo small puncture wounds with brown scabs\u201d over the veins on the defendant\u2019s right hand, one of which was over an inch in length; that the scabs were the type which he (Officer Heilman) recognized as resulting from the injection of heroin; that defendant\u2019s pupils were dilated, he was sniffling and yawning, and his eyes were watery; that based upon his previous experience, he (Officer Heilman) formed the opinion that the defendant was exhibiting the symptoms of withdrawal from the use of an opiate; that he approached defendant who was sitting at the bar and requested that defendant accompany him to a patio area outside the bar; that when they arrived on the patio he requested defendant to remove his coat and observed, with the aid of a magnifying glass, numerous puncture wounds on defendant\u2019s arms and hands, all of which were over veins; that there were nine marks on the left hand and arm and eight or nine on the right hand and arm; that the color of the wounds varied from red to dark brown with the oldest wound appearing to be about two days old; that after defendant waived his rights, he (defendant) stated that he last used heroin a week ago; that defendant was placed under arrest and a urine test made at the police station did not indicate the presence of heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">During the trial, Police Officer Dale Gerald La Fleur, whose expertise in the field of narcotics is undisputed, in response to a hypothetical question posed by the prosecuting attorney containing Officer Heilman\u2019s observations of defendant testified as an expert that the person described (defendant) \u201cwas going through early withdrawls <em>[sic].\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Defendant Gutierrez\u2019 testimony at the motion to suppress pursuant to section 1538.5 substantially was: that he was in the El Patio Bar the night testified to by Officer Heilman; that he had arrived at the bar about four hours prior to his arrest and during that time he had seven or eight beers and was feeling kind of high; that he went to the restroom and returned to the bar and about a half hour later the police entered the bar and as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>soon as they entered Officer Heilman motioned with his finger for him to come outside; that he did not have a coat on but the police told him to roll up his shirt sleeves; that he did have track needle marks on his left hand but none on his right hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Defendant did not testify at the jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Defendant contends (1) that Officer Heilman lacked probable cause to temporarily detain the defendant for investigation; (2) that there was no probable cause for Officer Heilman to arrest defendant after completing his examination; (3) that the court erred as a matter of law in permitting arresting Officer Heilman to testify as an expert in the field of narcotics; and (4) that the evidence is insufficient to support the (jury verdict) judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">The resolution of the first two contentions listed above turns on the answer to a more basic question, namely: whether or not the exhibition of \u201cwithdrawal symptoms\u201d resulting, from the \u201cuse\u201d of an illegal opiate (heroin) constitutes \u201cprobable cause\u201d for an officer to believe that a violation of section 11550 (a misdemeanor) is being committed \u201cin his presence\u201d as required by Penal Code section 836 (hereinafter section 836).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-11\">\n<em>Section 11550</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b402-12\">Section 11550, in pertinent part, provides: \u201cNo person shall <em>use, </em>or <em>be under the influence </em>of any controlled substance . . . which is a narcotic drug____\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b402-13\">The case law and rules of statutory construction in conjunction with the clear and unambiguous language of section 11550 compels me to conclude that it was the legislative purpose to make it a misdemeanor for any person to either (a) make unlawful \u201cuse\u201d of a narcotic drug or (b) \u201cto be under the influence\u201d of such a drug. The object of section 11550 was to attack the entire addiction process. To accomplish that purpose it condemns, forbids, prohibits and outlaws the \u201cuse\u201d of narcotics that is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>activating part of the process of addiction and makes it illegal to be \u201cunder the influence\u201d of a narcotic drug during that process.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">In the case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Thompson </em>(1956) 144 Cal.App.2d Supp. 854 [301 P.2d 313], defendant was charged with and convicted of violation of Health and Safety Code section 11721 which provided that \u201cNo person shall unlawfully <em>use </em>or <em>be addicted </em>to the unlawful use of narcotics . . . .\u201d (Now section 11550, which does not make it illegal to be an addict but in lieu thereof makes it unlawful to be under the influence of a narcotic drug.) Paraphrasing <em>Thompson </em>at page 856: \u201cCertain conclusions appear to us to be inescapable. The Legislature [in section 11550] has effectively made it a misdemeanor for a person either (a) to make unlawful use of narcotics or (b) to be [under the influence of such a narcotic]. One is an act, the other is a [temporary] condition .... They are not identical. It is as though a statute made it a public offense either to take a drink or be drunk in a public place... ,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Moreover, it is a cardinal rule of statutory construction that \u201c[i]f possible, <em>significance should be given to every </em>word... in pursuance of the legislative purpose.

It is not unlawful to have \u201cwithdrawal symptoms\u201d as it is not unlawful to have a hangover following an alcoholic binge.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\"><em>However, </em>\u201cwithdrawal symptoms\u201d may constitute circumstantial evidence of recent \u201cuse\u201d of a narcotic drug or of being under the influence of such a drug. Here defendant was arrested for a violation of section 11550 and was prosecuted, convicted and sentenced for \u201cuse\u201d of a narcotic drug (heroin) in violation of that section and <em>not </em>for being \u201cunder the influence\u201d also prohibited by that section. As previously noted, the \u201cuse\u201d of a narcotic drug entails an act of availing oneself of, employing, and injecting such a drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">\n<em>Section 836</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">Section 836, in pertinent part, provides: \u201cA peace officer may . . . , without a warrant, arrest a person: [If] 1. Whenever he has reasonable cause to believe that the person to be arrested has committed a public offense <em>in his presence. </em>...\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">A literal construction of the \u201cin his presence\u201d clause of section 836 would, as a practical matter, render the \u201cuse\u201d prohibition of section 11550 meaningless since users of narcotics obviously inject in private places and do not normally inject \u201cin the presence\u201d of police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-11\">In an effort to effectuate the legislative purpose in section 11550 prohibiting the \u201cuse\u201d of a narcotic drug and the \u201cin the presence\u201d clause of section 836, case law, pertinent rules of statutory construction, the nature of the addiction process and the law of circumstantial evidence must be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>\n<em>Case Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Case law has liberally construed the term \u201cin his presence.\u201d \u201cPresence\u201d has been construed as not requiring mere physical proximity. It is determined by whether the offense is apparent to the officer\u2019s senses.

The officer\u2019s testimony and experience in this field reasonably caused him to believe that defendant had committed the offenses prohibited by section 11550.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">\n<em>Statutory Construction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">In construing section 11550 and section 836, rules of statutory construction require that both sections \u201c[sjhould be interpreted so as to produce a result that is reasonable. <em>(Ivens </em>v. <em>Simon </em>(1963) 212 Cal.App.2d 177, 181 [27 Cal.Rptr. 801].) If two constructions are possible, that which leads to the more reasonable result should be adopted. <em>(In re Kernan </em>(1966) 242 Cal.App.2d 488, 491 [51 Cal.Rptr. 515].)\u201d <em>(Alford </em>v. <em>Pierna </em>(1972) 27 Cal.App.3d 682, 688 [104 Cal.Rptr. 110].)</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">One \u201c[m]ust look to the context of the law, and where uncertainty exists, consideration should be given to the consequences that will flow from a particular interpretation, <em>(Ivens </em>v. <em>Simon, supra, </em>212 Cal.App.2d 177, 181) . . . [and] take into account matters such as context, the object in view, the evils to be remedied, the history of the times and of legislation upon the same subject, public policy, and contemporaneous construction. <em>(Estate of Jacobs </em>(1943) 61 Cal.App.2d 152, 155 [142 P.2d 454].)\u201d <em>(Alford </em>v. <em>Piemo, supra, </em>27 Cal.App.3d at p. 688; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Navarro </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 248, 273 [102 Cal.Rptr. 137, 497 P.2d 481].)</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">Moreover, such \u201cpurpose\u201d will not be sacrificed to a literal construction of any part of the act and consideration must be given \u201c \\ . . to the whole system of law of which [they are] a part so that all may be <em>harmonized </em>and have effect.\u2019 . . .\u201d <em>(Select Base Materials </em>v. <em>Board of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number><em>Equal., supra, </em>51 Cal.2d 640, 645, italics added; <em>People </em>v. <em>Taylor, supra, </em>46 Cal.App.3d 513, 531.)</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">\n<em>Nature of the Addiction Process</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">The Supreme Court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Victor </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 280 [42 Cal.Rptr. 199, 398 P.2d 391], in a unanimous opinion addressed the propriety of committing the defendant to a narcotics treatment facility. The court discussed in depth narcotic addiction and stated at page 301: \u201c[T]he Legislature has in effect recognized the fundamental medical fact that narcotics addiction is not so much an event as a process.\u201d The court went on to list \u201c[a]mong the identifiable stages in this process ... (5) temporary cessation (whether voluntary or not) of use of the drug, resulting in manifestation of <em>physical dependence </em>in the form of withdrawal symptoms;...\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 301-302, original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">The case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(1966) 240 Cal.App.2d 496 [49 Cal.Rptr. 663], hearing denied April 17,1966, involved a defendant who was arrested and convicted of \u201cbeing under the influence\u201d of a narcotic in violation of Health and Safety Code section 11721 (now \u00a7 11550). Although the <em>Davis </em>case did not involve a violation of the \u201cuse\u201d prohibition, it discussed the nature of the <em>addiction process, </em>held prohibition against one \u201cunder the influence\u201d applied to any person displaying that condition in <em>any detectable manner </em>and tangentially refers to \u201cthe unlawful use\u201d of narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">In the <em>Davis </em>case, the arresting officer testified that defendant\u2019s pupils \u201c \u2018were constricted, that he appeared to have a feeling or a being of indifference, of well-being, perhaps.\u2019 \u201d (240 Cal.App.2d at p. 498.) Needle marks were also observed on defendant\u2019s arms. The appellate court affirmed the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">In answering defendant\u2019s contention that the evidence was not sufficient to establish probable cause to arrest him for being \u201cunder the influence\u201d of a narcotic because there was no showing his behavior was irregular, the <em>Davis </em>court said at pages 500 and 501:</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">\u201c[T]his contention is predicated upon the legal premise that to be under the influence of narcotics within the proscription of the statute the person so affected must be guilty of some irregular behavior, and upon the factual premise that at the time of his arrest defendant\u2019s capabilities appeared to be normal, his judgment was not clouded, he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>perceptive, and was not sleepy. Arguments in support of the legal premise are that the statute should be construed consistently with the statute which proscribes driving an automobile while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, and that to construe it otherwise would prohibit a narcotics addict from maintaining his \u2018normal state\u2019, which would constitute punishment for addiction contrary to the holding in <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>California, </em>370 U.S. 660 [82 S.Ct. 1417; 8 L.Ed.2d 758].</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">\u201cThe statute, i.e., section 11721 of the Health and Safety Code, declares: \u2018No person shall use, or be under the influence of narcotics, excepting when administered by or under the direction of a person licensed by the State to prescribe and administer narcotics .. . .\u2019 Certain uses and resultant influence expressly are excepted from the proscription imposed. The fact that an addict, as well as other persons, is penalized for using narcotics other than as approved, does not constitute punishment for addiction. The statute is regulatory in nature; constitutes a valid exercise of the police power <em>(Minnesota </em>ex rel. <em>Whipple </em>v. <em>Martinson, </em>256 U.S. 41, 45 [41 S.Ct. 425, 426, 65 L.Ed. 819]); and has been upheld as constitutional. <em>(In re Becerra, </em>218 Cal.App.2d 746, 747 [32 Cal.Rptr. 910].)</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">\u201cNarcotics addiction is a process. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Victor, </em>62 Cal.2d 280, 301 [42 Cal.Rptr. 199, 398 P.2d 391].) At different stages the symptomatic effects of the process are different. (See <em>Ibid. </em>pp. 301-304.) The object of the statute is to proscribe a use of <em>narcotics that </em>is an activating part of the process of addiction whatever may be the stage of that process at the time of their use. The provision making it an offense to be under the influence of narcotics must be construed in light of this object. So construed, the statute applies to every person who, following the unlawful use of narcotics, is under the influence thereof in any detectable manner. The symptoms of influence are not confined to those commensurate with misbehavior, nor to demonstrable impairment of physical or mental ability. <em>(Morales </em>v. <em>United States, </em>344 F.2d 846, 850.) By making it an offense to be under the influence of narcotics the statute facilitates enforcement of the proscription against use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">\n<em>The Law of Circumstantial Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">In the instant case the trial court properly instructed the jury fully on the law as to both direct and <em>circumstantial </em>evidence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>Here, although Officer Heilman did not see defendant inject (use) heroin into his veins, the \u201cwithdrawal symptoms\u201d and tracks on defendant\u2019s hands and arms which the officer observed constituted reasonable cause for him to believe and for the juiy to logically and reasonably infer that defendant had recently injected (used) heroin in violation of section 11550.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Finally, as I construe the majority opinion it has the <em>net effect </em>of rewriting section 11550 to make it <em>only </em>unlawful to \u201cuse\u201d (inject into one\u2019s veins) heroin in the physical presence of police officers. A fortiori, there is no legal prohibition on the \u201cuse\u201d of heroin so long as one is careful not to inject it with a police officer watching. It is not reasonable to believe the Legislature intended such a restrictive construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Moreover, I am constrained to comment on the statement in the majority opinion that \u201c \u2018It is our view that persons who have ceased the use of narcotics and controlled substances, for whatever reason, should be encouraged and supported rather than subjected to unwarranted searches.\u2019 \u201d The foregoing statement appears to be a declaration of public policy intended to buttress the decision which restricts the \u201cuse\u201d prohibition of section 11550.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>Such a policy statement on the surface appears laudable. However, it is a piously shallow pronouncement in view of the nature of the addiction process with its disastrous effect on our society (see my dissent in <em>People </em>v. <em>Holly, supra, </em>62 Cal.App.3d 797) and it conflicts with the clear legislative policy behind section 11550 which is directed at stamping out the \u201cuse\u201d of controlled substances such as heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Accordingly, by reason of the nature of the addiction process and to <em>harmonize </em>and effectuate in a reasonable manner the legislative purpose of both section 11550 and section 836 as hereinbefore discussed, I would hold as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-6\">(1) That the \u201cwithdrawal symptoms\u201d exhibited by defendant in the bar and observed by Officer Heilman constituted reasonable cause for Officer Heilman to temporarily detain defendant for further investigation and to ask him to step out into the patio and to inspect his arms and hands.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-7\">(2) That the observations of Officer Heilman of defendant\u2019s \u201cwithdrawal symptoms\u201d coupled with the scabs on his arms and hands constituted circumstantial evidence of and reasonable cause for believing that defendant had violated section 11550.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-8\">(3) That defendant\u2019s exhibition of \u201cwithdrawal symptoms\u201d which were observed by Officer Heilman satisfies the \u201cin the presence\u201d clause of section 836.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Velasquez </em>(1976) 54 Cal.App.3d 695 [126 Cal.Rptr. 656], hearing denied March 18, 1976, defendant was convicted by a jury of offering to sell heroin (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11352) and with using heroin (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11550). The Court of Appeal affirmed the conviction for offering to sell heroin but reversed the conviction for using heroin, stating at pages 699 to 700:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-10\">\u201cHowever, we agree that the record does not support the verdict on count III (the \u2018use\u2019 count). The evidence to support that count, as relied on here by the People, is as follows: (1) defendant admittedly had been a user of heroin in the past; (2) examination of his arms, on his arrest, disclosed some old marks, and several more recent; the more recent ones were, on the testimony of the People\u2019s expert, from five to seven days old; (3) defendant falsely claimed not to have used heroin for several months. Admittedly, defendant, although intoxicated from liquor, was not under the influence of narcotics at the time of arrest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>\u201cThe \u2018use\u2019 proscribed by section 11550 of the Health and Safety Code is a current use, not a use in the past. Even though defendant lied in claiming to have been free of narcotics for several months, the People\u2019s own testimony supports no usage closer than the five- to seven-day period testified to by their own expert. We conclude that, while usage no more distant than that might support a finding of danger to become (again) addicted, it does not support a finding of a current addiction and use.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">The <em>Velasquez </em>case is clearly factually distinguishable from the case at bench. In <em>Velasquez </em>the only evidence to support the verdict was (1) that defendant had been a user of heroin in the past, (2) that the freshest marks on his arms were from five to seven days old, and (3) that the defendant claimed that he had not used heroin for several months.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Here, there was evidence of current, not past, use. Officer La Fleur testified as an expert that Officer Heilman\u2019s testimony as to the \u201cwithdrawal symptoms\u201d exhibited by defendant were early withdrawals and defendant had used within 12 to 24 hours.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Defendant in <em>Velasquez </em>testified that he had not used heroin for several months while in the instant case defendant Gutierrez elected not to testify at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">To the extent the <em>Velasquez </em>holding may be construed as in conflict with this opinion I disagree. An analysis of the legislative purpose of section 11550 in light of the nature of the addiction process, as discussed in <em>People </em>v. <em>Victor, supra, </em>62 Cal.2d 280, compels this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">I would further conclude that defendant\u2019s contention that the court erred in allowing Officer Heilman to testify as an expert witness is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">\u201cA person is \"qualified to testify as an expert if he has special knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education sufficient to qualify him as an expert on the subject to which his testimony relates.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 720, subd. (a).) \u201cThe trial court is given considerable latitude in determining the qualifications of an expert and its ruling will not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>disturbed on appeal unless a manifest abuse of discretion is shown. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kelly </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 24, 39 [130 Cal.Rptr. 144, 549 P.2d 1240].) \u201c \u2018Expertness is relative to the subject, and any person who has special knowledge, skill or experience in any occupation, trade or craft may be qualified as an expert in his field. [Citations.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>King </em>(1968) 266 Cal.App.2d 437, 443 [72 Cal.Rptr. 478].)</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">Here Officer Heilman testified that he had been employed by the police department for three years, had attended three college classes on narcotics, had had discussions regarding narcotics violators with five physicians and three police narcotic experts, had read various publications on narcotics, had personally made other arrests of \u201csixty heroin addicts,\u201d and had talked to addicts regarding the use of heroin. Given the qualifications as stated by the officer, I cannot conclude any \u201cmanifest abuse of discretion\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kelly, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d 24, 39) has been shown by the trial court in permitting this officer to testify as an expert in the field of narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">I also conclude that defendant\u2019s contention that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction for use of a narcotic in violation of section 11550 is also without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">\u201cThe test on appeal is whether there is substantial evidence to support the conclusion of the trier of fact.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Redmond </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 745, 755 [79 Cal.Rptr. 529, 457 P.2d 321].) In the case at bench the People expressly disclaimed any intention of proving that defendant was under the influence and instead proceeded as to \u201cuse\u201d only. The record contains ample circumstantial and expert evidence from which the trier of fact could have concluded that there had been a recent use of heroin. The fact that the urine test was negative must be considered in light of the further evidence that all the test established was that there was not a large amount of the narcotic in the system at the time of the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">Accordingly, by reason of the foregoing, I cannot say that the police who arrested the defendant, the prosecuting attorney who presented the case, the judge who presided over the trial, and the 12 jurors who convicted the defendant were in error. In my opinion the police conduct was lawful in all respects, the defendant was fairly tried and justly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>convicted by the jury of the \u201cuse\u201d of heroin within the meaning of section 11550.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">I would affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">A petition for a rehearing was denied August 24, 1977. Hanson, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted. Respondent\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied September 28, 1977.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b399-14\"> The reporter\u2019s transcript of the trial contains the following statements to the jury by the prosecuting attorney (following his opening statement) and the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>\u201c[Mr. Howell, prosecuting attorney]:....</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">\u201cSo, based upon that, the People\u2019s [sz'c] feel that they will clearly establish that he <em>used </em>heroin, not was under the influence of heroin, within the Pomona Judicial District.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">\u201cThank you.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right. It\u2019s clearly understood by the jury that this case has to do with the <em>use </em>of the controlled substance heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-13\">\u201cThe People are not going to attempt to prove that the defendant was under the influence at the time he was arrested; is that right?</p>\n<p id=\"b400-14\">\u201cMR. HOWELL: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-15\">\u201cTHE COURT: This is part of the events. Actually, there are two heads to it. Either one of them would be sufficient, but the prosecution is only going to attempt to prove <em>use </em>and that that use was within the Pomona Judicial District.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-16\">\u201cCall your first witness.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b400-17\">The court instructed the jury on CALJIC No. 16.060 modified to read as follows: \u201cUSE OF A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE\u2014DEFINED, Health and Safety Code, \u00a7 11550.

The reason for the difference in the language of legislation controlling alcoholic beverages from that controlling narcotic drugs is that in the former it is not unlawful to \u201cuse\u201d or \u201cconsume\u201d alcoholic beverages, except for minors under certain circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">It is only unlawful to be \u201cunder the influence of intoxicating liquor\u201d in certain circumstances.

The acts of \u201cuse\u201d (injecting) of narcotics and the \u201cbeating\u201d of a person\u2019s wife or children are against the announced public policy of the State of California as reflected in Penal Codes enacted by the Legislature which impose penalties, as a deterrent against and to prevent such actions occurring <em>in the first instance.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b410-10\"> See footnote 2, ante, page 405.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
