An AFDC grant constitutes welfare monies within the meaning of this subdivision. (See Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 10052.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>AFDC is administered in this state under a federally approved state plan which must contain, among other elements, a child support program. (See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 601, 602(a)(27), 654.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n                   Thus the partially quoted Civil Code subdivision is merely a part of a federal-state statutory procedure designed to insure that absent fathers whose children are being supported by AFDC reimburse the taxpayers for such support to the extent of their ability to do so.  Each recipient of AFDC, as a condition of eligibility for such aid, is required to assign to the state (in this state to the county)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> all her accrued rights to the support of any minor child on AFDC that is owed that child by the absent father (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a)(26)(A)), and in this state receipt of AFDC operates as an assignment of such accrued parental support rights by operation of law. (\u00a7 11477, subd. (a).) Furthermore, these assigned support rights constitute an obligation owed to the state by the absent father and the amount of such obligation is the amount specified in the court order covering such rights. (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 656(a)(1)(A).) In this state this obligation runs to the county and is in an amount equal to the court-ordered payments. (\u00a7 11350, subd. (a).) Child support payments collected from an absent father for the support of a minor child on AFDC may not be paid directly to the mother (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 654(5)), and in this state such payments, when collected by or paid through a public officer or agency, must be transmitted to the county department providing AFDC. (\u00a7 11457.)</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">From the foregoing it can be seen that under the applicable federal and state statutes Seaen\u2019s mother has assigned to the Los Angeles County all of her accrued rights to the support of Seaen by his father and that all of the court-ordered payments he makes in discharge of his obligation to the county have to be sent to its department of public social services. Under these circumstances she has nothing left to assign with respect to these payments,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the court ordering them likewise is without power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>to divert any part of them from the county department of public social services.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">There is nothing unconstitutional in requiring this special disposition of child support payments in AFDC and other welfare cases. The classification is a reasonable one and one made for a rational purpose. (Cf. <em>Dandridge </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1970) 397 U.S. 471, 485-486 [25 L.Ed.2d 491, 501-502, 90 S.Ct. 1153].) On the other hand, the rejected disposition might well constitute an unconstitutional gift of public funds. (See Cal. Const., art. XVI, \u00a7 6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The judgment under appeal is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Allport, Acting P. J., and Potter, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied September 28, 1977.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b225-9\"> More specifically, in this case the mother, who, at the time of the judgment below in August 1975, was receiving $212 a month AFDC for the support of herself and her only child Seaen, then only three years of age, asked that the court trustee be directed to divert $60 of the $75 monthly child support paid by the father to her through that trustee to the educational trust instead of paying the entire $75 to the Los Angeles County Department of Public Social Services. The AFDC constituted the only support of the mother and child.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b225-10\"> The judgment partially under appeal is dated August 25, 1975. Chapter 924 of the 1975 Statutes, effective September 20, 1975 (pp. 2030, 2041), contains most of the state law applicable to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b225-11\"> Hereafter all undesignated section references are to the Welfare and Institutions Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b226-5\"> All federal-state welfare programs are administered in this state pursuant to federal as well as to state law. (See \u00a7\u00a7 10000, 10600, 10604, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">The State Department of Benefit Payments is the administrator of the state child support program (\u00a7 11475). Each county district attorney has the responsibility for prompt and effective enforcement of the obligation of parents to support their children (\u00a7 11475.1).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Both the department and the District Attorney of Los Angeles County have filed amicus curiae briefs in this case. The respondent father has not filed a brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b226-8\"> A California county is a legal'subdivision of the state. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 23002.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b226-9\"> An attempt by her to assign Seaen\u2019s rights to future support by his father would be unavailing because Seaen\u2019s rights in this respect, when accrued, already pass each month to the county upon the receipt of AFDC by the mother. Compare <em>In re Marriage of Shore </em>(1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 290 [139 Cal.Rptr. 349], in which another division of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>statewide court held that the affected county obtains under the statutory scheme an irrevocable vested right to the collection of all support payments that have accrued while the custodial parent was receiving AFDC.
