Hernandez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>513 F.3d 1336, 1339 (11th Cir.2008). The BIA\u2019s factual findings are reviewed under the substantial evidence test. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283-84 (11th Cir.2001). We review only the BIA\u2019s decision, except to the extent the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion or reasoning. <em>Id. </em>at 1284. Here, the BIA did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s order, so we review the BIA\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-9\">As a preliminary matter, we note that Loredo does not challenge on appeal and, therefore, abandons, his claims for waiver under INA \u00a7 237 and cancellation of removal. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that a petitioner abandons an issue if he fails to offer argument on it).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-10\">I. Jurisdiction Pursuant to INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B)-(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a) (2) (B )-(D)</p>\n<p id=\"b912-12\">Loredo argues that we have jurisdiction under INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(D) because he raises constitutional claims and claims presenting questions of law. He explains that the issue of whether his due process rights were violated when his legal permanent resident (\u201cLPR\u201d) status was revoked is a constitutional question, and the question of whether he is eligible for relief under the former INA \u00a7 212(c) is a question of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-14\">When examining a petition for review, we \u201cmust first consider whether we have subject matter jurisdiction to hear the petition at all.\u201d <em>Resendiz-Alcaraz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>383 F.3d 1262, 1266 (11th Cir.2004). We review subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Sanchez Jimenez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>492 F.3d 1223, 1231 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-15\">INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(C) states that, \u201c[n]ot-withstanding any other provision of law ... no court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in section ... 1227(a) (2) (A) (iii)....\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). Section 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) declares deportable \u201c[a]ny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a) (2) (A) (iii). Alien smuggling is considered an aggravated felony. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(N); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-16\">Despite this limitation, with the passage of the REAL ID Act on May 11, 2005, Congress restored appellate jurisdiction to review constitutional questions and \u201cquestions of law\u201d that an alien raises in a petition for review. <em>Balogun v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>425 F.3d 1356, 1359 (11th Cir.2005). Specifically, the Act provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVd\">[njothing in [section 1252(a)(2)(C) ], or in any other provision of this chapter (other than this section) which limits or eliminates judicial review, shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b913-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>REAL ID Act, \u00a7 106(a)(l)(A)(ii), codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). Thus, notwithstanding the jurisdictional bar contained in INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(C), under \u00a7 242(a)(2)(D), we still retain jurisdiction to review (1) constitutional challenges to a removal order, and (2) \u201cquestions of law,\u201d but we lack jurisdiction to review discretionary or factual determinations when the bar in \u00a7 242(a)(2)(C) applies. <em>Martinez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1219, 1222 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">To the extent that Loredo\u2019s claims involve constitutional challenges or questions of law, we have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) to address his claims. Loredo\u2019s claim that the government violated his Fifth Amendment due process rights by failing to notify him that his LPR status was rescinded is, in essence, a disputed question of fact; therefore, under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), we have no jurisdiction to consider this issue. Loredo\u2019s challenge of the BIA\u2019s allocation of the burden of proof raises a question of law, thus, we have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) to consider this claim. We also have jurisdiction to consider Loredo\u2019s claim that the BIA erred in finding him ineligible' for relief from deportation under former INA \u00a7 212(c) because this raises a question of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">II. Rescission of Loredo\u2019s Lawful Permanent Resident Status</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">The government argues that we should not address Loredo\u2019s claim that he did not receive notice of the rescission of his LPR status because this claim can only be heard in rescission proceedings. It also notes that a rescission of LPR status does not constitute a final order of removal; therefore, we would have no jurisdiction to hear an appeal of such a denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">The validity of an order rescinding the adjustment of an alien\u2019s status may be reconsidered only \u201cby the officer who has the jurisdiction over the proceeding or who made the decision.\u201d <em>Matter of Volos, </em>12 I. &amp; N. Dec. 44, 46 (BIA 1967); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 103.5(a)(l)(i), (ii). Where there is no rescission proceeding pending, the BIA does not have jurisdiction to consider the validity of the rescission. <em>Matter of Volos, </em>12 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 46. Furthermore, we have acknowledged that rescission proceedings do not constitute \u201cfinal orders of deportation,\u201d so \u201cdirect review [of rescission orders] in the court of appeals is inappropriate.\u201d <em>Baehelier v. INS, </em>548 F.2d 1157, 1158 (5th Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-10\">Because the IJ who presided over Loredo\u2019s removal proceedings did not make the decision to rescind Loredo\u2019s LPR status, and because a rescission of LPR status is not, in any event, a final order of removal, we lack jurisdiction to consider the validity of the rescission and dismiss this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-11\">III. Waiver of Inadmissibility Under Former INA \u00a7 212(c)</p>\n<p id=\"b913-12\">Loredo argues that he was statutorily eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under INA \u00a7 212(c), because at the time he pled guilty to the aggravated felony of alien smuggling he had a settled expectation of \u00a7 212(c) relief as a Special Agricultural Worker (\u201cSAW\u201d) temporary resident and expected to become an LPR by operation of law in less than two months. He also contends that denial of \u00a7 212(c) relief is required only if the alien is neither an LPR nor a lawful temporary resident. According to Loredo, because the government never sought termination of his status as a temporary resident, he had been an LPR for roughly 16 years at the time he applied for \u00a7 212(c) relief. Finally, Loredo acknowledges that he was not yet an LPR when he was convicted of the aggravated felony, but argues that he was due to be granted this status through op<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>eration of law and therefore should be treated as if he had already received LPR status.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">Current immigration law provides that an alien who commits an aggravated felony is removable and ineligible for any relief from removal. INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). Alien smuggling is considered an aggravated felony. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(N); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(B). However, former INA \u00a7 212(c) provided that \u201c[a]liens lawfully admitted for permanent residence who temporarily proceeded abroad voluntarily and not under an order of deportation, and who are returning to a lawful unrelin-quished domicile of seven consecutive years, may be admitted in the discretion of the Attorney General.\u201d INA \u00a7 212(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) (repealed 1996). \u201cLawful domicile\u201d under former \u00a7 212(c) required \u201cat least the simultaneous existence of <em>lawful </em>physical presence in the United States and lawful intent to remain in the United States indefinitely.\u201d <em>Melian v. INS, </em>987 F.2d 1521, 1524 (11th Cir.1993) (emphasis added). Although \u00a7 212(c) referred specifically to waivers of exclusions, it also was extended through case law to provide relief from deportation orders. <em>See e.g., id. </em>at 1523.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, (\u201cIIRI-RA\u201d), repealed \u00a7 212(c), replacing it with cancellation of removal relief, for which individuals who had committed an aggravated felony were ineligible. <em>See INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 297, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 2277, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001). However, the Supreme Court held that \u00a7 212(c) relief remained available for aliens \u201cwhose convictions were obtained through plea agreements and who, notwithstanding those convictions, would have been eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief <em>at the time of their plea under the law then in effect.\u201d St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. at 326, 121 S.Ct. at 2293 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">Because Loredo was ineligible for \u00a7 212(e) waiver of inadmissibility at the time he pled guilty to alien smuggling, we conclude that he is not now eligible for such relief. Accordingly, Loredo\u2019s petition for review is dismissed in part and denied in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-8\">PETITION DISMISSED in PART, DENIED in PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
