At sentencing, the district court held Mervil accountable for 39.62 kilograms of cocaine base and 1.03 kilograms of cocaine powder, which was the equivalent of 773,440 kilograms of marijuana. This yielded a Guidelines base offense level of 38 and coupled with a criminal history category of I a sentence range calling for a term of imprisonment (on each count) of 235 to 293 months. The court sentenced Mervil to concurrent prison terms of 240 months. She did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-22\">After unsuccessfully moving the district court on three occasions to reduce her sentences pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), Mervil, in December 2007, once again invoked the statute in an effort to have her sentences reduced. This time she based her motion on Amendments 706 and 711 to the Sentencing Guidelines, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>which reduced her base offense level from 38 to 36, and argued that a reduction would be consistent with the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), and her post-sentencing rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may not reduce a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment unless that defendant has been sentenced pursuant to a Guidelines sentence range \u201cthat has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 245, 258-60, 125 S.Ct. at 756-67, 764-65 (rendering the Guidelines advisory), and <em>Kimbrough, </em>552 U.S. at -, 128 S.Ct. at 575 (clarifying that district courts possess the authority to deviate from the 100-to-l craek-to-powder cocaine ratio during sentencing), do not provide independent jurisdictional bases for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">In addressing a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, the district court must engage in a two-part analysis: (1) by recalculating the sentence based on the amendment, \u201cleavpng] all other guideline application decisions unaffected;\u201d and (2) by exercising its discretion, based on the factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a), to impose a new sentence or to retain the original sentence. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l); and <em>see United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 760 (11th Cir.1998). In analyzing these factors, the district court may also consider the post-sentencing conduct of the defendant. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n. l(B)(iii)). This requirement, however, \u201cis triggered only by an amendment ... that lowers the applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n.l (A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-11\">Amendment 706, retroactive as of March 3, 2008, provided for a two-level reduction in the base offense level for certain crack cocaine offenses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, Amends. 706, 713. It also altered Application Note 10(D) of the Commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 to change the method of calculating the offense level for offenses involving cocaine base and other types of drugs. <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 706. In particular, it instructed district courts to: (1) determine the base offense level for the other substance; (2) apply that base offense level to a \u201cmarijuana equivalency\u201d table and convert the cocaine base into marijuana; (3) convert the other substance into marijuana; and (4) add the marijuana quantities together to determine the combined base offense level. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b779-12\">Amendment 711 reversed Amendment 706 on this point, instructing courts to: (1) determine the base offense level for the amount of cocaine base involved; (2) apply that base offense level to a \u201cmarijuana equivalency\u201d table and convert the cocaine base into marijuana; (3) determine the marijuana equivalency for the other substance; and (4) add together all of the marijuana amounts and determine the combined base offense level. <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 711.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-13\">Finally, Amendment 715, which came into effect on May 1, 2008 \u2014 after Mervil filed her \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion but before the district court ruled on it \u2014 and which the district court relied on, undid Amendment 711, imposing the following method, instead: (1) determine the marijuana <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>equivalency for all of the drug amounts involved using the traditional conversion method; (2) subtract two levels from that amount; and (3) determine the base offense level for this altered amount of marijuana. U.S.S.G.App. C, Amendment 715. A two-level reduction would not apply, however, if \u201cthe offense involved 4.5 kilograms or more ... of cocaine base.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment. (n.lO(D)(ii)(I)).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">Here, the district court properly found that it lacked authority to reduce Mervil\u2019s sentences under the amended Guidelines. Based on the 1.03 kilograms of powder cocaine and 39.62 kilograms of cocaine base attributed to Mervil, her base offense level and adjusted offense levels would remain 38, her criminal history category would continue to be I, and her guideline range would remain at 235 to 293 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">In addition, because the retroactive Guidelines amendments provide Melvin no relief, her arguments under <em>Booker, Kim-brough, </em>and \u00a7 3553(a) necessarily fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b779-9\">. While Mervil filed her motion before Amendments 706 and 711 became retroactive, jurisdiction was proper in the district court because it ruled on the motion after March 3, 2008. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), and <em>pet. for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Feb. 2, 2009) (No. 08-8554).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
