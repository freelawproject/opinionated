Guzman argues that the IJ erred in finding that she had not suffered past persecution on account of her political opinion and that she had not sufficiently established a well-founded fear of future persecution. Guzman also contends that the IJ erred in finding her ineligible for protection under the CAT. After close consideration of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we are compelled to agree with the IJ and the BIA\u2019s ultimate conclusions regarding Guzman\u2019s application for withholding of removal. Because Guzman did not raise the issue of her protection under the CAT before the BIA, we do not have juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>diction to consider it. Accordingly, the petition is DENIED in part and DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Guzman is a native and citizen of Colombia. She entered the United States in October 1999 and, in 2003, was issued a notice to appear (\u201cNTA\u201d) by the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d), charging her with removability as an alien who remained in the United States for a time longer than permitted, pursuant to INA \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B). Administrative Record (\u201cAR\u201d) at 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">Guzman filed an application for asylum and for withholding of removal based on her political opinion in October 2003. <em>Id. </em>at 272-82; 276. In her application, Guzman described how the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (\u201cFARC\u201d) continuously attempted to coerce her into joining their organization and threatened to take reprisals against her and her family should she refuse. <em>Id. </em>at 276. She also expressed her fear of being killed by the FARC if returned to Columbia because of her refusal to join the group. <em>Id. </em>In her asylum application, Guzman also stated that as part of her job she often urged to villagers \u201cto resist the advances\u201d of the FARC and that the FARC threatened her, in part, for doing so.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">In support of her application, Guzman submitted the following documentation, among other things: 1) a personal narrative describing the events giving rise to her decision to flee Columbia; 2) several declarations partly corroborating her narrative; 3) a statement by the physician who treated her after her encounter with the FARC and one by her treating psychologist; 4) the U.S. State Department\u2019s Columbia Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2003 (\u201c2003 Human Rights Report\u201d); 5) a 2002 Response to Information Request from INS Resource Information Center (\u201c2002 INS Report\u201d); and 6) a 2003 Response to Information Request from the same center (\u201c2003 INS Report\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 157.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-13\">In her narrative, Guzman described how she was abducted and beaten by FARC guerillas on 3 August 1999 while driving back to Bogota from a rural village. Guzman claimed that she was intercepted by three men from the FARC en route. She was forced from her car and into an adjacent forest, stripped to her underwear, threatened, insulted, and beaten about the back with a stick. At some point, one of her tormentors cut her twice on the left side of her head with a knife. After about two hours, the men left, leaving her bound hand and foot, half-naked and bleeding from her wounds. She was found by peasants the next day and received medical treatment from Dr. Enrique Rojas, her family physician. She did not file a report with the police. <em>Id. </em>at 160-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-14\">Over the next three months, Guzman claimed to have received three threatening phone calls. The first was on 15 August 1999. The caller did not identify himself but did allude to her beating and threatened her and her daughter with further harm. Guzman received a second call on 2 September 1999 in which the caller threatened to burn down her ranch. Finally, on 1 October 1999, Guzman was called a third time and given an ultimatum declaring her a military target. <em>Id. </em>at 61. In response, Guzman and her daughter promptly moved to her aunt\u2019s house in another part of Bogota. <em>Id. </em>Guzman did not report any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>of the phone calls to the police and left for the United States shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">The declarations and statements provided by Guzman generally corroborated her narrative. Guzman\u2019s friend and neighbor Blanca Stella Herrera de Duran stated that Guzman and her daughter had received a few threats. <em>Id. </em>at 283. A declaration from Enrique Rojas Rosas stated that Guzman had received frequent threats because she refused to collaborate with \u201ca group criminal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 286. Mercedes Leonor Arbelaez Serna and Blanca Cecilia Hernandez vouched for Guzman\u2019s character as an honest and responsible person. <em>Id. </em>at 291, 297. Martha Rojas stated that Guzman had received threats due to her refusal to collaborate with and join the FARC and Ines Morales Quiroga declared that Guzman was persecuted by the FARC \u201cdue to belong and collaborate with them.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 293, 295.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Enrique Rojas treated Guzman after her ordeal with the FARC. In his statement, he recounted how he provided medical care to Guzman on 3 August 1999 for two wounds on the left side of her head and damage to her scalp, as well as pain throughout her body \u201coriginating from being hit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 245. Rojas stated that he applied two mid-size sutures to her head wounds, applied a mild sedative and recommended psychological help. <em>Id. </em>A letter from psychologist Sandra Cardenas stated that she began evaluation and psychotherapy with Guzman in October 1999 and found \u201cemotional alterations in her demeanor, ease to tears, sleep disorder, emotional alteration, state of anguish <em>&amp; </em>panic accompanied by paranoia, all generated by traumatic events suffered under a death threat, physical harm and severe lesions to the head and body as well as psychological torture at the hands of the [FARC].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">The 2003 Human Rights Report submitted by Guzman noted that \u201c[t]he FARC and ELN [National Liberation Army] terrorists were responsible for a large percentage of civilian deaths\u201d and that \u201c[e]arly in the year, during terrorist bombing campaigns, the number of abuses committed by FARC and ELN terrorists rose significantly; however, the rate of abuses declined over the year due to increased military pressure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 206. According to the report, the FARC and ELN \u201ckidnapped thousands of civilians and at least 25 members of the security forces to help finance subversion and put political pressure on the Government. Victims were held in deplorable conditions and were often tortured both physically and psychologically.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Additionally, the FARC engaged in widespread recruitment of minors. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">The 2002 INS Report described relocation prospects in Colombia. <em>Id. </em>at 199. It quoted various \u201ccountry experts,\u201d one of whom stated that \u201cthe FARC has a presence in virtually all of the nation\u2019s 32 departments and urban centers and has a country-wide capability to harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The same expert noted that the FARC targeted, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cpeasant activists or anyone else whom the guerrillas believe opposes the FARC\u2019s ... leftists politics or their use of armed tactics.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The report also noted that the FARC\u2019s presence had reached the city of Bogota, where residents were being forced to make payments to FARC members. <em>Id. </em>at 201. The 2003 INS Report chronicled a surge in violence in Colombia in 2002 and reported that \u201cthe conflict has intensified and civilians are bearing the brunt of increasing levels of political violence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">On 27 July 2004, Guzman appeared before the IJ represented by counsel and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>conceded removability. <em>Id. </em>at 80. At the removal hearing, Guzman testified that she first traveled to the United States in May 1999 for ten days to do a training course. <em>Id. </em>at 99. She stated that her two daughters, Ivonne and Ingrid, live in the United States. <em>Id. </em>at 99-100. Ivonne was attempting to obtain asylum and Ingrid already had legal status in the United States. <em>Id. </em>at 100. Ivonne came to the United States in May 1999 and Ingrid came with Guzman in October 1999. <em>Id. </em>at 101. Guzman also testified that her mother and sister continue to live in Columbia. <em>Id. </em>at 101-02. Guzman offered the following explanation for being threatened and tortured by the FARC on 3 August 1999:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqcF\">I was talking to the families that lived in proximity to the farm, that lived around the farm. These were agricultural families, workers. And I would talk to the mothers and tell them not to leave their children alone because they could be taken by the FARC. These were families of employees that worked for the farm. But I didn\u2019t have any link to any movement or union or syndicate or anything.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AF0\"><em>Id. </em>at 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">After recounting the particulars of her 3 August 1999 run-in with the FARC, Guzman reiterated her conviction that the FARC\u2019s objective was to forcibly enlist her into their organization. <em>Id. </em>at 108. She expressed her fear of returning to Columbia \u201c[b]eeause there are [FARC] cells that are spread throughout the entire country,\u201d and claimed that she \u201cwould feel sentenced to death by the guerilla groups\u201d if forced to return. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">On cross-examination, Guzman conceded that she lived unmolested by the FARC at her aunt\u2019s house for about twenty days before leaving for the United States. <em>Id. </em>at 109. Moreover, her only physical encounter with the FARC was on the day of her attack in 1999, although she had been working with the same company since 1995. <em>Id. </em>at 110. Guzman also acknowledged that despite her fear that the FARC would harm her family members, her mother and sister still lived in Colombia and had not had problems with the FARC. <em>Id. </em>at 111. Finally, Guzman again surmised that the FARC tortured her in an effort to forcibly recruit her to their cause. <em>Id. </em>at 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">The IJ found Guzman\u2019s testimony generally credible. <em>Id. </em>at 47. He concluded that based on Guzman\u2019s application, testimony, and supporting documents, the FARC forcibly tried to recruit her to join its organization by beating and torturing her. <em>Id. </em>at 47-49. However, the IJ found that Guzman\u2019s testimony regarding her efforts to warn the peasants against the dangers posed by the FARC was unconvincing and lacking in detail. <em>Id. </em>at 49-50. Moreover, the IJ determined that Guzman\u2019s torture by the FARC, while \u201cnot a pleasant experience,\u201d did not rise to the level of past persecution, even when considered in conjunction with the subsequent threatening phone calls. <em>Id. </em>at 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">The IJ was also impressed that Guzman was able to live safely with her aunt in the northern part of Bogota for several weeks after she left her apartment. <em>Id. </em>at 50-51. He concluded that because her interaction with the FARC stemmed from her employment, which had brought her into contact with the FARC in the countryside, and she was no longer working for that employer, she would no longer be of interest to the FARC. She also would not be required to journey into those countryside areas where the FARC had previously intercepted her. In addition, the IJ noted that Guzman\u2019s mother and sister still reside in Columbia unmolested by the FARC and so it was not unreasonable to require her to seek internal resettlement in Columbia. <em>Id. </em>at 51. The IJ ultimately con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>eluded that Guzman was ineligible for withholding of removal. <em>Id. </em>at 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">Turning to her CAT claim, the IJ determined that Guzman had not met her burden of proof because she failed to present any evidence of torture instigated by or acquiesced to by a Colombian government official. <em>Id. </em>The IJ also noted the fact that Guzman\u2019s older daughter traveled with Guzman to the United States in May 1999 and did not return to Columbia. The IJ surmised that such a fact could indicate that an ulterior motive of establishing residence in the United States existed before Guzman\u2019s fear of the FARC developed. <em>Id. </em>at 52-53. The IJ denied Guzman\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief, and ordered her removed to Colombia. <em>Id. </em>at 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Guzman filed a notice of appeal with the BIA and claimed, <em>inter alia, </em>that the IJ erred in determining that the harm suffered by Guzman did not amount to persecution. <em>Id. </em>at 23-24. Guzman also contended that she had a well-founded fear of persecution based on a protected ground because the FARC not only tried to recruit her, but also targeted her because of her \u201csociopolitical activities\u201d and because of an imputed political opinion. <em>Id. </em>at 24-25. In addition, she asserted that there was \u201cmore than a 50% chance\u201d that she would be persecuted on account of her political opinion and imputed political opinion if she returned to Colombia. <em>Id. </em>at 25. Finally, Guzman argued that in light of <em>Arboleda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 434 </em>F.3d 1220 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam), relocation within Colombia was not viable and the IJ erred when he found that she could relocate to a remote area of the country. AR at 25. Guzman did not assert that the IJ erred in rejecting her CAT claim. The BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision and dismissed Guzman\u2019s appeal, specifically noting that she had not met her burden for withholding of removal or for protection under the CAT. <em>Id. </em>at 2-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">\u201cWe review only the [BIA\u2019s] decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion. Insofar as the Board adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001) (citations omitted). In this case, the BIA issued its own opinion with analysis and also adopted the IJ\u2019s reasoning. AR at 2-3. Therefore, we review the decisions of both the IJ and the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">To the extent that the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s decisions were based on a legal determination, our review is <em>de novo. D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir.2004). Factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial-evidence test, \u201cwhich provides that the IJ\u2019s decision can be reversed only if the evidence compels a reasonable fact finder to find otherwise.\u201d <em>Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1231 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (quotation marks and citation omitted). We \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 818 (quotation marks omitted). Furthermore, we are required to \u201cview the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b676-10\">\u201cAn alien seeking withholding of removal under the INA must show that [her] life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 437 (11th Cir.2004) (per curiam) (quotation omitted). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>burden is on the alien to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that she would be persecuted or tortured if she returned to her home country. If she establishes past persecution based on a protected ground, then it is presumed that her life or freedom would be threatened upon return to her country unless DHS:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AvB\">shows by a preponderance of the evidence that, among other things, (1) the country\u2019s conditions have changed such that the applicant\u2019s life or freedom would no longer be threatened upon [her] removal; or (2) that the alien could avoid a future threat to [her] life or freedom by relocating to another part of the proposed country of removal, and it would be reasonable to expect [her] to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-5\"><em>Id. </em>An alien who cannot show past persecution \u201cmay still be entitled to withholding of removal if [she] can demonstrate a future threat to [her] life or freedom on a protected ground.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To establish a well-founded fear of future persecution, the applicant must prove a fear that is both \u201csubjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289. \u201cThe subjective component is generally satisfied by the applicant\u2019s credible testimony that he or she genuinely fears persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]he objective prong can be fulfilled either by establishing past persecution or that he or she has a good reason to fear future persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). An alien cannot demonstrate that it is more likely than not that she would be persecuted on account of a protected ground if the IJ finds that the alien could avoid a future threat by relocating to another part of her country. <em>Sanchez, </em>392 F.3d at 437. Additionally, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A) \u201cprotects against persecution not only by government forces but also by nongovernmental groups that the government cannot control.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">To prove persecution on account of political opinion, the petitioner must show \u201cpersecution on account of the <em>victim\u2019s </em>political opinion, not the persecutor\u2019s.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 437-38. To qualify for withholding of removal based on persecution by a guerilla group on account of political opinion, an alien \u201cmust establish that the guerillas persecuted her or will seek to persecute her in the future <em>because of </em>her actual or imputed political opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 438. An alien can prevail on a theory of \u201cimputed political opinion\u201d if she can show that her persecutors falsely attributed an opinion to her and then persecuted her because of that mistaken belief about her views. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d at 1289. \u201cIt is not enough to show that she was or will be persecuted or tortured due to her refusal to cooperate with the guerillas.\u201d <em>Sanchez, </em>392 F.3d at 438. Finally, it is well settled that \u201c[w]e lack jurisdiction to consider a claim raised in a petition for review unless the petitioner has exhausted [her] administrative remedies with respect thereto.\u201d <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). This is so even \u201cwhen an alien, without excuse or exception, fails to exhaust [a] claim, but the BIA nonetheless considers the underlying issue <em>sua sponte.\u201d Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">It is apparent from the record that Guzman suffered a harrowing ordeal at that hands of FARC guerillas in August 1999 and undoubtedly has a genuine subjective fear of future persecution if returned to Columbia. Horrific as her experiences were, however, we must concur with the IJ and BIA\u2019s findings regarding the lack of any nexus between Guzman\u2019s political opinion and the FARC\u2019s alleged persecution. The record before us and the deferential scope of our review require us to do so, notwithstanding where our sympathies may lie. Likewise, we agree with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>the IJ and BIA\u2019s conclusions regarding the objective prong of Guzman\u2019s fear of future persecution. The IJ\u2019s finding that Guzman\u2019s refusal to cooperate was the impetus for the FARC\u2019s transgressions is substantially supported by the bulk of the record. In addition, given the IJ\u2019s careful consideration of the record evidence, we are not at liberty to disturb his determination that relocation within Columbia would be both successful and reasonable for Guzman. <em>See </em>AR 51-53. Finally, heeding the dictates of our precedent, we conclude that we do not have jurisdiction to entertain Guzman\u2019s argument regarding protection under the CAT because that argument was not raised before the BIA. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1250.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Guzman seeks review of the BIA\u2019s decision affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of her application for withholding of removal and relief under the CAT. We conclude that the IJ and BIA\u2019s determinations regarding Guzman\u2019s application for withholding of removal are supported by substantial evidence. We do not have jurisdiction to consider her argument for protection under the CAT. Accordingly, we DENY the petition in part, and DISMISS it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Petition DENIED, in part, and DISMISSED, in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b673-10\">.
