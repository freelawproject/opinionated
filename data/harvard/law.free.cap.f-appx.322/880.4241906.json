Turner acknowledges that he was sentenced as a career offender but argues that he is nevertheless eligible for a reduction because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 should serve at the starting point for the reduction. He also appears to argue that the court should have granted a sentence below any amended range. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-13\">A jury convicted Turner of one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846, and two counts of possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine, in violation of \u00a7 841(a)(1). A probation officer determined that Turner qualified as a career offender and set his base offense level at 37 and criminal history category at VI, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Turner\u2019s guideline imprisonment range was 360 months to life. The district court imposed concurrent terms of 360 months\u2019 imprisonment. On March 4, 2008, Turner submitted the instant <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, asserting that Amendment 706 to the Guidelines altered his base offense level. The government responded that Turner was not eligible for a reduction because he was sentenced pursuant to \u00a7 4B1.1, rather than \u00a7 2D1.1. The district court denied the motion. Turner submitted a motion for reconsideration, which the district court also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-16\">We review <em>de novo </em>\u201cthe district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the [Guidelines].\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008), ce<em>rt. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009). Pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may reduce an already-incarcerated defendant\u2019s sentence if the sentence was determined using a guideline imprisonment range that retroactive amendments to the Guidelines have reduced, and if such a reduction would be consistent with the policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission, which are contained in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). The commentary to \u00a7 1B1.10 instructs that a defendant is not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction \u201cif the amendment [in question] does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision (e.g., a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment.)\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>ment. (n.l(A)). Recently, in <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1328, we applied this commentary and held that Amendment 706 does not alter the guideline imprisonment range of a defendant convicted of crack cocaine offenses if that defendant was sentenced as a career offender, pursuant to \u00a7 4B1.1. We reasoned that, in that case, the defendant\u2019s \u201cbase offense level[ ] under \u00a7 2D1.1 played no role in the calculation of [his guideline imprisonment range],\u201d such that Amendment 706\u2019s effect on the defendant\u2019s base offense level under \u00a7 2D 1.1 would not affect the guideline imprisonment range pursuant to which he was sentenced. <em>Id. </em>at 1327.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">HI.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">The district court did not err in denying Turner\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1326. Because Turner was sentenced according to the guideline imprisonment range calculated using \u00a7 4B1.1, rather than \u00a7 2D1.1, Amendment 706 did not affect his guideline imprisonment range. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327-28; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)). Because Turner, therefore, was not eligible for a reduction, whether or not the district court should have considered <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) at re-sentencing is irrelevant. <em>See also United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190 (11th Cir.2009) (holding that <em>Booker </em>is inapplicable at re-sentencing under \u00a7 3582(c)(2)), <em>pet. for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Feb. 10, 2009) (No. 08-8664). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
