He entered the United States on August 13, 2004, after traveling through Brazil and Paraguay for some period of time. As he exited the plane, he encountered two immigration officers who requested to see his documents. Barrios-Bermudez then presented a U.S. passport belonging to another person, Marcio Mejia-Rodamilans, and had no valid immigrant visa, reentry permit, border crossing identification card, or other valid entry document.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>On August 16, 2004, the Department of Homeland Security issued Barrios-Bermu-dez a Notice to Appear, charging him with removability under INA \u00a7\u00a7 212(a)(6)(C)(ii) and 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I). At a removal hearing before the IJ, Barrios-Bermudez conceded removability under \u00a7 212 (a) (7)(A) (i) (I), for being an applicant for admission not in possession of a valid entry document, but denied removability under \u00a7 212(a)(6)(C)(ii), as an alien who falsely represented himself to be a U.S. citizen for a purpose or benefit under the INA or other federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">Barrios-Bermudez also submitted an application for asylum and withholding of removal based on his political opinion, stating that he feared harm or mistreatment if he returned to Cuba. He asserted that the government would consider him a political dissident on account of his overstay in the United States and his application of asylum. He stated his belief that the government would imprison him upon his re-tram, whereupon he would experience torture, malnutrition, disease, and lack of medical care. He testified that he had never been charged, arrested, detained, interrogated, convicted, sentenced, or imprisoned in Cuba. He was a member of the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution (the \u201cCDR\u201d) from 1993 to 2004, but held no leadership position, and served in the military as a soldier from 1994 to 1996. Neither he nor his family continued to participate in these groups. His wife and three children remained in Cuba.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">The Department of State\u2019s Profile of Asylum Claims and Country Conditions in Cuba for 1997 that was submitted in support of the application stated that persons \u201csubjected to other disproportionately harsh or discriminatory treatment resulting from perceived or actual political ... beliefs or activities\u201d were at risk of persecution in Cuba. \u201cIt [was] against the law to leave Cuba without permission,\u201d and that \u201cillegal exit was considered a political offense until 1979, when the law was changed to make it only a criminal offense.\u201d Offenders can be sentenced between 18 months and 8 years\u2019 imprisonment. \u201cHowever, ... in recent years, the [government ha[d] adopted a <em>de facto </em>depenalization of this crime\u201d with offenders \u201creceiving punishments of fines or house arrest rather than imprisonment.\u201d Additionally, it was \u201cagainst Cuban law for citizens to apply for asylum,\u201d and \u201c[although the U.S. asylum process is confidential, it appeared] possible that in some cases the Cuban authorities could determine if a returnee had applied for asylum.\u201d The Cuban government \u201cmight ascribe dissident political motives to the application.\u201d Finally, Cuba considers those who prolong their stay beyond the authorized period to have abandoned their country and, if they return, they \u201cmay face criminal charges and up to [three] years\u2019 imprisonment, although ... in recent years, the [g]overnment ha[d] often imposed fines and/or house arrest rather than a prison term.\u201d The Department of State\u2019s Country Report on Human Rights Practices in Cuba for 2004 stated that conditions in prison were extreme and that prisoners might be subjected to torture and other mistreatment, including malnutrition and insufficient medical care.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">At a hearing on May 16, 2006, Barrios-Bermudez testified that he worked illegally as an independent baker in Cuba, but the government did not take any actions against him because he worked in isolation with his family. He had served in Cuba\u2019s military for two years as a soldier, and had never been arrested. He stated that he left Cuba on June 21, 2004, and traveled through Brazil before entering the United States on August 16, 2004. He left his wife and children in Cuba because he feared imprisonment. He sought asylum in the United States because he disagreed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>with the system in Cuba. He was a member of the CDR in Cuba, as required by the government. He was scolded on many occasions because of the way he spoke about the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">He testified that his wife had a university degree in education, but she was suspended from work after trying to leave Cuba illegally with then* children because she did not agree with the Cuban system. When his wife returned to Cuba, she was detained for two days and released. He stated that his daughter had suffered \u201ccomplete persecution\u201d in school, and his wife received unexpected visitors at the house, threatening to take their children if she tried to leave the country again.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">Barrios-Bermudez argued that he demonstrated eligibility for asylum because he had a well-founded fear on account of his political opinion. He asserted that there was a reasonable likelihood that the Cuban government would persecute him for filing an asylum claim in the United States. Further, he submitted that he demonstrated eligibility for withholding of removal because there was a clear probability that he would be persecuted upon returning to Cuba for an imputed political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">The IJ determined that Barrios-Bermu-dez faded to meet his burden of proof for asylum. First, it found that he did not make a claim of past persecution, as his allegation that the government scolded him did not rise to the level of persecution. His testimony also failed to demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution because he failed to provide any details regarding his political expression in the United States. Further, he failed to provide evidence that the government would discover that he applied for asylum in the United States. Because he failed to establish eligibility for asylum, the IJ also denied Barrios-Bermudez application for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">Barrios-Bermudez appealed to the BIA, contesting his removability under \u00a7 212(a)(6)(C)(ii). He did not, however, contest his removability under \u00a7 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I). He also appealed the IJ\u2019s determination that he was not eligible for asylum or withholding of removal. The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision, adopting in part the IJ\u2019s reasoning and in part issuing its own opinion. The BIA upheld the finding that he was removable under INA \u00a7 212(a)(6)(C)(ii) for the reasons stated in the IJ\u2019s decision, noting that the IJ\u2019s findings were not clearly erroneous. Additionally, the BIA determined that Barrios-Bermudez failed to establish eligibility for asylum for the reasons stated in the IJ\u2019s decision. The BIA noted that his wife was not subject to any harm rising to the level of persecution, and Barrios-Bermudez did not show that he suffered any past persecution or that he had a well-founded fear of future persecution. Because he failed to meet the burden of proof for asylum, he also failed to show that he was entitled to withholding of removal, and the BIA dismissed the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">This court reviews only the BIA\u2019s decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion. <em>Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Where, as here, the BIA adopts and affirms the IJ\u2019s decision but also adds its own analysis, we reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as supplemented by the BIA. <em>Savoury v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>449 F.3d 1307, 1312 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-10\">Factual determinations made by the IJ and BIA are reviewed under a \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard and the \u201cdecision can be reversed only if the evidence compels a reasonable fact-finder to find otherwise.\u201d <em>Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1230-31 (11th Cir.2006) (quotations omit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>ted). \u201cUnder this highly deferential test, we affirm the IJ\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation and alteration omitted). We review legal determinations <em>de novo. Hernandez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>513 F.3d 1336, 1339 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">On appeal, Barrios-Bermudez continues to argue that the BIA and IJ erroneously found that he was removable under INA \u00a7 212(a)(6)(C)(ii). Because Barrios-Bermudez conceded removability under \u00a7 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), however, the question of his removability under \u00a7 212(a)(6)(C)(ii) is moot. The doctrine of mootness derives directly from the case-or-controversy limitation on the jurisdiction of federal courts under Article III of the Constitution \u201cbecause an action that is moot cannot be characterized as an active case or controversy.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>273 F.3d 1330, 1335 (11th Cir.2001) (quotations omitted). \u201cA case is moot when the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1335-36 (quotations and alteration omitted). \u201c[P]ut another way, a case is moot when it no longer presents a live controversy with respect to which the court can give meaningful relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1336 (quotations omitted). Here, because Barrios-Bermudez has conceded that he is removable under one provision of the INA, it is a moot question whether he is also removable under a second provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">Barrios-Bermudez argues that he was eligible for asylum because the government scolded him \u201con many occasions\u201d for expressing views against the government, and his wife and children were threatened and harassed by the government after they attempted to leave Cuba. Specifically, he asserts that the government persecuted his family by physically detaining his wife for two days, terminating his wife\u2019s employment, and threatening to take their children away. He states that he fears that he will be subject to the same treatment and persecution if he returns to Cuba, particularly after having requested asylum in the U.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">Any alien who is physically present in the United States may apply for asylum. <em>Mejia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>498 F.3d 1253, 1256 (11th Cir.2007). The Attorney General may grant asylum if an alien is a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The INA defines \u201crefugee\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-9\">[A]ny person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b817-10\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The alien bears the burden to demonstrate \u201c(1) past persecution on account of a statutorily protected ground or (2) a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Mejia, </em>498 F.3d at 1256.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-11\">A well-founded fear of persecution requires \u201ca reasonable possibility of suffering such persecution if he or she were to return to that country.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis omitted). Proof of past persecution creates a presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>Id. </em>at 1257. An alien must show that his fear of future persecution is \u201csubjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number><em>Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1257 (11th Cir.2006). A well-founded fear of persecution can be established by \u201cspecific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he will be singled out for persecution\u201d on account of a protected ground. <em>Id. </em>at 1258. As an alternative to demonstrating that he would be \u201csingled out for persecution,\u201d an alien may show a pattern or practice in the subject country of persecuting members of a statutorily defined group of which the alien is a part. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b) (2) (iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">This court has described persecution as an \u201cextreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (quotations omitted). Severe physical injury is not required to establish past persecution. <em>Sanchez Jimenez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>492 F.3d 1223, 1233 (11th Cir.2007). Menacing threats, however, without more, do not rise to the level of past persecution. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">After a thorough review of the record, we discern no error. The record does not compel the conclusion that Barrios-Ber-mudez was subjected to past persecution; he was never harmed, arrested, detained, or even threatened in Cuba. Barrios-Ber-mudez testified that the government scolded him on more than one occasion for expressing views against the government. As stated above, however, verbal harassment alone does not rise to the level of persecution. <em>Id. </em>His wife\u2019s experiences also do not rise to the level of persecution. Being detained for two days and having her employment suspended do not constitute detention. <em>See Zheng v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>451 F.3d 1287, 1290-91 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that a brief detention and termination from employment do not rise to the level of persecution). Barrios-Ber-mudez failed to establish that he had experienced past persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-11\">An alien who has not shown past persecution may still be entitled to asylum if he can demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2). To prevail, the applicant\u2019s fear of persecution must be both \u201csubjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289. Because we agree with the BIA and the IJ that Barrios-Bermu-dez\u2019s fear that he will be persecuted for applying for asylum is not objectively reasonable, we hold that he failed to establish eligibility for asylum on account of a well-founded fear of future persecution. The record does not compel the conclusion that Barrios-Bermudez will be persecuted for this reason. His wife was punished for attempting to flee the country with their children, but the punishment she received did not rise to the level of persecution. Additionally, other than the State Department\u2019s note that it was possible that in some cases the Cuban government could determine if a returning citizen had applied for asylum, Barrios-Bermudez produced no compelling evidence showing that the Cuban government would learn of his asylum application or persecute him for having made the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-12\">Finally, Barrios-Bermudez fears he will be persecuted for violating Cuban law by overstaying his permission to leave the country; however, \u201c[pjrosecution for violating Cuba\u2019s travel laws is not persecution within the meaning of the Act.\u201d <em>Barreto-Claro v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>275 F.3d 1334, 1340 (11th Cir.2001). Also, the State Department\u2019s report notes that there has been an increasing \u201cdepenalization\u201d of this crime, and offenders tend to receive punishments of fines or house arrest rather than imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>As Barrios-Bermudez did not establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution, he did not satisfy his burden of proof to demonstrate eligibility for asylum. Having failed to establish a claim for asylum, he has necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard required to for withholding of removal. <em>See Rodriguez Morales v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 884, 891 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we DENY Barrios-Bermudez\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b814-15\">. Barrios-Bermudez initially sought relief under the U.N. Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), but failed to raise any arguments regarding CAT relief in his brief on appeal. Accordingly, he has abandoned this claim. <em>See Ruiz v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1257 n. 6 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
