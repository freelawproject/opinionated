Finding Hardy eligible for relief under Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, the district court reduced Hardy\u2019s sentence to the mid-point of his amended guideline range, but denied his request to reduce his sentence further. On appeal, Hardy argues that the district court abused its discretion by failing to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors when it modified his sentence pursuant to Amendment 706. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-22\">We review \u201ca district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on a subsequent change in the sentencing guidelines, for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003). Under \u00a7 3582, a district court may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed except where expressly permitted by statute or by Fed.R.Crim.P. 35. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B). One statutory exception to this general rule includes relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZx\">[I]n the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o), upon motion of the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>dant or the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or on its own motion, the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">On November 1, 2007, the Sentencing Commission promulgated Amendment 706, which amended the Drug Quantity Table in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 706 (2007). The effect of Amendment 706 is to provide a two-level reduction in base offense levels for certain crack-cocaine offenses. <em>See id. </em>The Commission made this amendment retroactively applicable, effective as of March 3, 2008. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G., App. C, Amend. 713 (Supp. May 1, 2008) (listing Amendment 706 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c) as a retroactively applicable amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">In determining whether to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence, the district court must engage in a two-part analysis. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). First, the district court must calculate the defendant\u2019s amended guideline range and determine what sentence it would have imposed under this amended range. <em>Id. </em>Second, the district court must decide, after analyzing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, whether to impose the amended sentence on the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 781. The district court need not \u201carticulate specifically the applicability \u2014 if any \u2014 of each of the section 3553(a) factors, as long as the record demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.1997). However, if the district court fails to \u201caddress the \u00a7 3553(a) factors,\u201d we must vacate and remand the case back to the district court. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1256-57 (11th Cir.2009). In <em>Williams, </em>we vacated and remanded a sentencing decision in which the district court summarily granted the defendant\u2019s motion for a sentencing reduction without discussing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and the record made it impossible to determine, on appeal, whether the district court actually had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">The record here shows that although the district court did not expressly discuss the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors in resentencing Hardy, there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the court considered them. As an initial matter, Hardy\u2019s motion for reduction of sentence listed all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors \u201cword for word\u201d and made two substantive arguments with regard to those factors: (1) an argument concerning the crack/cocaine sentencing disparity; and (2) his post-conviction rehabilitation. His motion therefore is somewhat similar to the defendant\u2019s motion in <em>Eggersdorf </em>which also provided all of the pertinent \u00a7 3553(a) factors. 126 F.3d at 1322. Moreover, as in <em>Eggersdotf, </em>the same district court presided over both Hardy\u2019s original sentencing and resentenc-ing. <em>See id. </em>Also noteworthy are the facts that the district court sentenced Hardy at the <em>midpoint </em>of his advisory guidelines range, and that the district court\u2019s form order expressly said that the court was making a ruling after having \u201cconsidered [Hardy\u2019s] motion\u201d \u2014 which, as discussed above, expressly included the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. On this record, we cannot say that there is no evidence to suggest that the district court actually considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as in <em>Williams, </em>557 F.3d at 1256-57. To the contrary, the district court\u2019s order said that it had reviewed Hardy\u2019s motion, which detailed the factors, and the district court presided over Hardy\u2019s original sentencing and re-sentencing, and resentenced Hardy in the middle of the guidelines range \u2014 all of which provide ample evidence for us to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>conclude that the district court considered the pertinent factors before resentencing Hardy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b802-19\">. We recognize that the government here had not responded to Hardy\u2019s motion, unlike in <em>Eggersdorf, </em>where the district court had \"specifically referenced\u201d the government's opposition, which had set out elements relevant to the inquiry under \u00a7 3553(a) that were supported by the record. <em>Id. </em>at 1323. However, because Hardy\u2019s motion included this discussion, there are sufficient \u201creasons\" on which we could assume it implicitly relied. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
