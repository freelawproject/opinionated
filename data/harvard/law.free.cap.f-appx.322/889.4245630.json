In their petition, Petitioners argue that the BIA erred in its interpretation of 8 C.F.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>\u00a7 1240.26(b)(3)\u00a9 and (c)(2) by finding that the regulations require Petitioners to have valid, unexpired passports regardless if the passports are in Petitioners\u2019 or the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (\u201cDHS\u201d) possession. Petitioners also argue that the Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) rationale for imposing a $50,000 voluntary departure bond was arbitrary and unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">We review our subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Gonzalez-Oropeza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1332 (11th Cir.2003). Section 1252 of Title 8 limits our jurisdiction over denials of discretionary relief in immigration proceedings. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B). Specifically, \u201c[njotwith-standing any other provision of law (statutory or nonstatutory) ..., no court shall have jurisdiction to review \u2014 -any judgment regarding the granting of relief under\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B)\u00a9; 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae. Notwithstanding this jurisdictional bar, we retain jurisdiction over \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law.\u201d INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(D); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). We review questions of law <em>de novo, </em>and defer to the BIA\u2019s \u201cinterpretation of its own regulations unless that interpretation is \u2018plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\u2019\u201d <em>Assa\u2019ad v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1326 (11th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Auer v. Robbins, </em>519 U.S. 452, 461, 117 S.Ct. 905, 911, 137 L.Ed.2d 79 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">Under \u00a7 1229c, the \u201cAttorney General may permit an alien voluntarily to depart the United States at the alien\u2019s own expense if, at the conclusion of a proceeding\u201d the IJ finds, <em>inter alia, </em>that an alien \u201chas established by clear and convincing evidence that the alien has the means to depart the United States and intends to do so.\u201d INA \u00a7 240B(b)(l)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(b)(l)(D). The corresponding regulation clarifies that \u201c[ejxcept as otherwise provided in [8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.26(b)(3) ], the clear and convincing evidence of the means to depart shall include in all cases presentation by the alien of a passport or other travel documentation sufficient to assure lawful entry into the country to which the alien is departing.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.26(c)(2). Section 1240.26(b)(3)\u00a9 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-8\">The alien shall be required to present to the Service, for inspection and photocopying, his or her passport or other travel documentation sufficient to assure lawful entry into the country to which the alien is departing, unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-9\">(A) A travel document is not necessary to return to his or her native country or to which country the alien is departing; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-10\">(B) The document is already in the possession of the Service. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.26(b)(3)\u00a9.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b916-11\">In this case, we hold that the BIA\u2019s interpretation that an alien must possess a valid, unexpired passport even if the passport is in the possession of the DHS, absent evidence that it is unnecessary in order to return to the country of removal, is consistent with the language of the regulation. Therefore, we defer to the BIA\u2019s interpretation. Moreover, we lack jurisdiction to consider Petitioners\u2019 bond argument. <em>See Mingkid v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>468 F.3d 763, 769 (11th Cir.2006) (reviewing the IJ\u2019s decision only to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning). Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-12\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
