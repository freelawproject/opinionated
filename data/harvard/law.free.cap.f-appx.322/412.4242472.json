Specifically, Green claims (1) that the consolidated deficiency notices were invalid as \u201csecond notices\u201d under the Tax Code; (2) the statute of limitations had run on the asserted deficiencies; (3) the inclusion of disability payments as taxable income in 1997 was erroneous; (4) collateral estoppel bars the Commissioner\u2019s claim that the disability payments were taxable; (5) his disability payments were non-taxable under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 104(a)(1); and (6) the tax court violated his due process rights by referring \u2014 in a since-deleted section \u2014 to the unrelated case of another individual named John O. Green. Finding no error, we AFFIRM the tax court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-17\">The facts underlying this case are well-summarized by the tax court. Green received disability-retirement payments for a kidney condition that he developed while he was a criminal investigator with the IRS. Because the disability payments were levied to satisfy unpaid income taxes, Green ceased providing annual income statements. This action, in turn, caused the administrator of his disability benefits \u2014 the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) \u2014 to suspend payment. After Green provided income information in interrogatories in a case before the bankruptcy court, OPM obtained the information, reinstated Green\u2019s retirement-disability payments, and authorized payment of $93,305 in benefits that had accrued from July 1, 1992 through October 31, 1997. The payment was authorized on December 16, 1997. Having received notiee of the authorization, Green informed OPM in writing on December 19, 1997 that his disability payment was subject to a child support order. He instructed OPM to make payments directly to his ex-wife. By letter dated December 24, 1997, OPM advised Green that it also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>had been served with an IRS levy against the annuity, and had made an initial deduction from Green\u2019s payment amount for the levy. The IRS and Green\u2019s ex-wife actually received the payments in 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">Green did not file a Form 1040 tax return for tax years 1997, 1999, and 2000, instead tendering homemade documents the parties have called \u201cdisclosure documents\u201d for each year which claimed exemption from income taxation due to his status as a Potawatomi Indian.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On July 11, 2003, the IRS mailed Green notices of deficiency for 1997, 1999, and 2000 to the wrong address. Green became aware of the deficiency notices and filed an untimely petition in the tax court on December 23, 2004. The Commissioner filed a motion to dismiss the petition in order to send the notices to the correct address and provide Green time to correctly challenge the deficiencies. On April 1, 2005, before the previous case filed by Green was dismissed by the tax court, the Commissioner mailed a consolidated deficiency notice, covering all three years at issue and assessing the same deficiencies as noticed in July 2003. Green timely petitioned the tax court, and that court affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s determination of deficiencies, additions to tax, and penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">We review the tax court\u2019s conclusions of law de novo, its findings of fact for clear error, and its discretionary rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>Bilski v. Comm\u2019r, </em>69 F.3d 64, 67 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Statute of Limitations</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">Green asserts, for the first time on appeal, that the consolidated deficiency notice upon which this action arose was invalid, because it constitutes a \u201csecond deficiency notice,\u201d in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6212(c). That statute explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-10\">If the Secretary has mailed to the taxpayer a notice of deficiency as provided in subsection (a), and the taxpayer files a petition with the Tax Court within the time prescribed in section 6213(a), the Secretary shall have no right to determine any additional deficiency of income tax for the same taxable year ... except in the case of fraud, and except as provided in section 6214(a) (relating to assertion of greater deficiencies before the Tax Court), in section 6213(b)(1) (relating to mathematical or clerical errors), in section 6851 or 6852 (relating to termination assessments), or in section 6861(c) (relating to the making of jeopardy assessments).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-11\">\u00a7 6212(c)(1); <em>see also Jones v. United States, </em>889 F.2d 1448, 1450 (5th Cir.1989). The very terms of this provision make clear that the consolidated deficiency notice here was not barred. The first deficiency notice was sent to the incorrect address on July 11, 2003, and Green filed a petition contesting the asserted deficiencies on December 23, 2004, well outside the ninety-day window provided by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6213(a). Green did not \u201cfile[ ] a petition with the Tax Court <em>within the time prescribed in section 6213(a).\u201d </em>\u00a7 6212(c) (emphasis added). In any case, Green admits that the Commissioner issued \u201ca second duplicate deficiency notice on 04/01/05, for the same amounts but with a different address.\u201d Again, the language of section 6212(c) shows that the bar on additional deficiency notices applies only to claims of \u201cadditional deficiency of income tax for the same taxable year.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That did not occur here. Thus, the consolidated deficiency notice was valid under sections 6212 and 6213.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>Green next claims that the assessment of deficiency was barred by the three year statute of limitations set forth in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6501. That provision states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9H\">Except as otherwise provided in this section, the amount of any tax imposed by this title shall be assessed within 3 years after the return was filed (whether or not such return was filed on or after the date prescribed) ... and no proceeding in court without assessment for the collection of such tax shall be begun after the expiration of such period. For purposes of this chapter, the term \u201creturn\u201d means the return required to be filed by the taxpayer (and does not include a return of any person from whom the taxpayer has received an item of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AS1\">\u00a7 6501(a). It is undisputed that the Commissioner issued the notice of deficiency on April 1, 2005, more than three years following the submission of Green\u2019s \u201cdisclosure documents\u201d for the 1997, 1999, and 2000 tax years. The sole question is whether the disclosures submitted by Green constitute \u201creturns\u201d sufficient to commence the start of the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">It is well-settled that, for purposes of the commencement of the statute of limitations, \u201c[pjerfect accuracy or completeness is not necessary to rescue a return from nullity, if it purports to be a return, is sworn to as such, and evinces an honest and genuine endeavor to satisfy the law.\u201d <em>Zellerbach Paper Co. v. Helvering, </em>293 U.S. 172, 180, 55 S.Ct. 127, 79 L.Ed. 264 (1934) (internal citation omitted); <em>see also Badaracco v. Comm\u2019r, </em>464 U.S. 386, 397, 104 S.Ct. 756, 78 L.Ed.2d 549 (1984) (\u201cthe original returns similarly purported to be returns, were sworn to as such, and appeared on then.- faces to constitute endeavors to satisfy the law. Although those returns, in fact, were not honest, the holding in <em>Zellerbach </em>does not render them nullities.\u201d) However, the submissions by a taxpayer must at least be a return, which 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103(b)(1) defines as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-7\">[A]ny tax or information return, declaration of estimated tax, or claim for refund required by, or provided for or permitted under, the provisions of this title which is filed with the Secretary by, on behalf of, or with respect to any person, and any amendment or supplement thereto, including supporting schedules, attachments, or lists which are supplemental to, or part of, the return so filed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AmQ\">\u00a7 6103(b)(1). The tax court\u2019s test to determine if a document qualifies as a tax return is set forth in <em>Beard v. Comm\u2019r, </em>82 T.C. 766, 777 (1984), <em>aff'd, </em>793 F.2d 139 (6th Cir.1986). It requires that a document purport to be a return, be executed under penalty of perjury, contain sufficient data to allow calculation of tax, and represent an honest and reasonable attempt to satisfy the requirements of law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">We have little difficulty concluding that Green\u2019s homemade \u201cdisclosure documents\u201d are not returns. They do not purport to be returns; in fact, they state that they are tendered to the IRS because \u201cno return of tax is required to be filed.\u201d Although they claim to be signed \u201cunder penalties of perjury,\u201d they do not include the jurat language found in standard IRS forms and typically required of a valid return. <em>See Williams v. Comm\u2019r, </em>114 T.C. 136, 142-43 (2000) (refusing to allow taxpayers to change or add to the language of the jurat). It is unclear what \u201csigned under penalties of perjury\u201d means without additional language attesting that the information contained in the document is true, correct, and complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">In addition, the information within Green\u2019s documents is insufficient to permit calculation of tax; indeed, the very purpose of the disclosures is to avoid the calculation and imposition of tax. Green simply provided a footnote \u2014 in minuscule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>font \u2014 asserting figures for net and gross business income, dividends, net short-term capital gain, and \u201cordinary partnership loss.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The disclosure contains no information regarding his marital status, exemptions, or deductions; all of which compels us to conclude that there is insufficient data to calculate tax liability. <em>See, e.g., Galuska v. Comm\u2019r, </em>98 T.C. 661, 670 (1992), <em>aff'd, </em>5 F.3d 195 (7th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Furthermore, the tax court did not clearly err in concluding that Green did not honestly and reasonably attempt to satisfy the tax law, especially given Green\u2019s training as an IRS criminal investigator and attorney, his history of avoiding income taxes, and the tax court\u2019s 1993 admonition that he was not exempt from federal income taxes due to his membership in the Potawatomi Citizens Band Tribe of Oklahoma. <em>See Green v. Comm\u2019r, </em>T.C. Memo 1993-152 (1993), <em>aff'd, </em>33 F.3d 1378 (5th Cir.1994) (unpublished opinion). Accordingly, the statute of limitations did not bar the tax assessments at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Disability Retirement Pay</p>\n<p id=\"APT\">Green next claims that the tax court erred in finding taxable for the 1997 tax year the $93,305 in disability payments that had been suspended when he ceased submitting income statements to OPM. First, he states that he did not receive the payment in 1997 and, accordingly, it was incorrectly assessed against him for that tax year.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The statute requires a cash-basis taxpayer such as Green to report income in the year he receives it, even if the money goes directly to pay off the taxpayer\u2019s debt to a third party. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 451(a); <em>Bank of Coushatta v. United States, </em>650 F.2d 75, 77 (5th Cir. Unit A 1981) (\u201cA taxpayer is considered in \u2018constructive receipt\u2019 of income if it is available to him without any substantial limitation or restriction as to the time or manner of payment or condition upon which payment is made, and the Commissioner will assess taxes on the basis of this income under [\u00a7 ] 61.\u201d) (citation omitted). The treasury regulations explain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-11\">Income although not actually reduced to a taxpayer\u2019s possession is constructively received by him in the taxable year during which it is credited to his account, set apart for him, or otherwise made available so that he may draw upon it at any time, or so that he could have drawn upon it during the taxable year if notice of intention to withdraw had been given. However, income is not constructively received if the taxpayer\u2019s control of its receipt is subject to substantial limitations or restrictions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-12\">26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.451-2(a). Here, the tax court found as fact that OPM approved a payment of $93,305 (reduced by deductions totaling $93,304) no later than December 16, 1997. A few days later, Green responded to OPM\u2019s notice by asserting that he owed child support debts to his ex-wife and instructing OPM to pay his ex-wife directly. The record evidence further establishes that on December 24, 1997, OPM sent Green a letter stating that money for an IRS levy was being deducted from his initial annuity payment. Indeed, Green stipulated all of these facts before the tax court. That the payment was not actually made to the IRS and Green\u2019s ex-wife until 1998 is not dispositive, since the income was set apart for Green in 1997. <em>See, e.g., Amos v. Comm\u2019r, </em>47 T.C. 65, 69 (1966). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>We find persuasive as evidence of constructive receipt that by December 19, 1997, the income was sufficiently available to Green that he had the authority to instruct OPM to pay his ex-wife directly. Accordingly, the tax court did not err in concluding that lump-sum payment was taxable in 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Green also asserts that the deficiency was based on a \u201cnaked assessment,\u201d and, therefore, was invalid. The Commissioner\u2019s determination of a deficiency is generally afforded a presumption of correctness. <em>Yoon v. Comm\u2019r, </em>135 F.3d 1007, 1012 (5th Cir.1998). However, the presumption of correctness does not apply where the government\u2019s assessment is without any foundation whatsoever; that is, when it is a naked assessment. <em>See Portillo v. Comm\u2019r, </em>932 F.2d 1128, 1133-34 (5th Cir.1991).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Here, Green suggests that his failure to file proper returns, which resulted in the Commissioner\u2019s reliance upon the OPM\u2019s Form 1099, makes the Commissioner\u2019s deficiency notice a naked assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Green\u2019s argument is much like the petitioner\u2019s unsuccessful argument in <em>Parker v. Comm\u2019r, </em>117 F.3d 785, 786-87 (5th Cir. 1997). There, like here, a petitioner who failed to file income tax returns claimed that the IRS\u2019s determinations were arbitrary because they were based wholly upon 1099 and W-2 forms submitted by third party payors. <em>Id. </em>at 786. Distinguishing <em>Portillo, </em>this Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-7\">In <em>Portillo, </em>the Commissioner\u2019s determination was arbitrary because the Commissioner offered no factual basis for accepting one sworn statement, the Form 1099, while rejecting another sworn statement, the taxpayer\u2019s Form 1040. <em>Portillo </em>did not hold that the IRS must conduct an independent investigation in all tax deficiency cases. In this case, the Commissioner has not <em>arbitrarily </em>found the third-party forms credible: the Parkers never filed a Form 1040 or any other document in which they swore that they did not receive the payments in question. The Commissioner has no duty to investigate a third-party payment report that is not disputed by the taxpayer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 787. As in <em>Parker, </em>Green claims as arbitrary the Commissioner\u2019s decision to rely upon OPM\u2019s 1099 form in the absence of any tax return or contrary evidence. However, Green does not argue that the information within the 1099 was without foundation, nor that OPM\u2019s submission was unreliable. Accordingly, the deficiency notice was not arbitrary, and does not require abandonment of the presumption of correctness.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-12\">Green also challenges the tax treatment of his disability-retirement payments, claiming that such taxation was inappropriate because (1) collateral estoppel bars it; and (2) the payments were excludable from his income under \u00a7 104(a)(1).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Commissioner correctly notes that issue preclusion does not apply here. We have explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-13\">Issue preclusion, or collateral estoppel ... promotes the interests of judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>economy by treating specific issues of fact or law that are validly and necessarily determined between two parties as final and conclusive. Issue preclusion is appropriate only if the following four conditions are met. First, the issue under consideration in a subsequent action must be identical to the issue litigated in a prior action. Second, the issue must have been fully and vigorously litigated in the prior action. Third, the issue must have been necessary to support the judgment in the prior case. Fourth, there must be no special circumstance that would render preclusion inappropriate or unfair. If these conditions are satisfied, issue preclusion prohibits a party from seeking another determination of the litigated issue in the subsequent action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-4\"><em>United States v. Shanbaum, </em>10 F.3d 305, 311 (5th Cir.1994) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Here, however, the taxability of Green\u2019s disability-retirement annuity was not litigated in his prior proceeding over a 1983 tax return \u2014 vigorously or otherwise. The Commissioner simply conceded the adjustment in the case about the 1983 return, and it was not necessary to a final judgment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Indeed, even if it was necessary to the judgment, this Court has explained, \u201c[wjhen one party to a tax case concedes or stipulates the issue upon which the court bases its judgment, the issue is not conclusively determined for purposes of collateral estoppel unless it is clear that the parties so intended.\u201d <em>Anderson, Clayton &amp; Co. v. United States, </em>562 F.2d 972, 992 (5th Cir.1977). <em>Anderson, Clayton &amp; Co. </em>relied upon the holding of <em>United States v. Int\u2019l Bldg. Co., </em>345 U.S. 502, 506, 73 S.Ct. 807, 97 L.Ed. 1182 (1953), where the Supreme Court held that tax judgments based on consent agreements between taxpayers and the government do not collaterally estop litigation on the same issue for later tax years. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court explained \u201cthat unless the prior judgment was \u2018an adjudication [of] the merits, the doctrine of estoppel by judgment would serve an unjust cause; it would become a device by which a decision not shown to be on the merits would forever foreclose inquiry into the merits.\u2019 \u201d <em>Anderson, Clayton &amp; Co., </em>562 F.2d at 992 (quoting <em>Int\u2019l Bldg. Co., </em>345 U.S. at 506, 73 S.Ct. 807). Accordingly, collateral estop-pel does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">Green argues that his disability-retirement pay should be excluded from his income under \u00a7 104(a)(1), urging that the payments were for personal injuries which are in the nature of workmen\u2019s compensation. Section 104(a)(1) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-9\">Except in the case of amounts attributable to (and not in excess of) deductions allowed under section 213 (relating to medical, etc., expenses) for any prior taxable year, gross income does not include ... amounts received under workmen\u2019s compensation acts as compensation for personal injuries or sickness[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>\u00a7 104(a)(1). The accompanying regulations allow exclusion if the taxpayer receives the pay \u201cunder a statute in the nature of a workmen\u2019s compensation act which provides compensation to employees for personal injuries or sickness incurred in the course of employment.\u201d 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.104-l(b). \u201cA taxpayer has the burden of proving entitlement to the \u00a7 104(a) exclusion.\u201d <em>Stanley v. United States, </em>140 F.3d 890, 891 (10th Cir.1998) (citing <em>Welch v. Helvering, </em>290 U.S. 111, 115, 54 S.Ct. 8, 78 L.Ed. 212 (1933)). <em>Take v. Comm\u2019r, </em>804 F.2d 553, 557 (9th Cir.1986), explains that section 104(a) applies only where a workmen\u2019s compensation statute requires that the injury be incurred in the course of employment. <em>Id. </em>\u201cStatutes that do not restrict the payment of benefits to cases of work-related injury or sickness are not considered to be \u2018workmen\u2019s compensation acts\u2019 under section 104.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Rutter v. Comm\u2019r, </em>760 F.2d 466, 468 (2d Cir.1985)); <em>see also Wallace v. United States, </em>139 F.3d 1165, 1167 (7th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Here, Green devotes significant attention to the tax court\u2019s apparently erroneous conclusion that his injury was congenital and, thus, not incurred during his employment with the IRS.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Whatever the basis of the disability payments, both Green and the Commissioner agree that they came from OPM\u2019s Retirement and Disability Fund (\u201cCSRA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8348.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See Merker v. Comm\u2019r, </em>T.C. Memo 1997-277 (1997) (\u201cThe relevant inquiry is into the nature of the statute pursuant to which the payment is made and not the source of the particular taxpayer\u2019s injury.\u201d) As the tax court noted, the CSRA allows disability retirement whether or not the injury occurred on the job. <em>See Haar v. Comm\u2019r, </em>78 T.C. 864, 868 (1982), <em>aff'd </em>709 F.2d 1206 (8th Cir.1983). Accordingly, section 104(a)(1) does not exempt this payment from taxable gross income.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">Due Process Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">Finally, Green argues that the tax court\u2019s erroneous reference to the case of another individual, also named John O. Green, was a due process violation. The tax court\u2019s incorrect reference to the other John O. Green was made in order to illustrate the petitioner\u2019s history of attempting to avoid income tax. A day after the release of the tax court\u2019s ruling, the court struck the incorrect language, and explained that the correction \u201cchanges neither the analysis nor the outcome of the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">It is clear from the tax court\u2019s references to Green\u2019s interactions with the criminal justice system and prior attempts at income tax avoidance that the incorrect information did not particularly prejudice the court; in fact, the tax court explicitly stated that the incorrect information had not impacted its analysis nor the outcome. We do not believe that this error \u2014 immediately corrected by the tax court \u2014 constitutes a due process violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>Accordingly, the ruling of the tax court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b439-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

Green states, in conclusory fashion, that \u201d[n]on-taxation in this case can also be found under other provisions of \u00a7 104 or \u00a7 105.\u201d However, he fails to argue for the applicability of any section other than 104(a)(1) in his opening brief. Accordingly, his claims of ex-cludability under sections 104(a)(2), 104(a)(3), 105(a), and 105(c), which were raised before the tax court, are waived. <em>See </em>Fed.

Green cleverly argues that he became disabled <em>during </em>his employment at the IRS; he never claims \u2014 and the record does not establish \u2014 that he became disabled due to a work-related injury. That the disability was not the result of a congenital defect and happened while he was employed by the IRS does not make it \"work-related.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b445-7\">. Green argued before the tax court that his benefits were approved pursuant to the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (\u201cFECA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8147. However, the tax court found that the benefits were received under the CSRA. Green does not particularly challenge this conclusion; instead, he appears to claim that he qualified under both the CSRA and the FECA, and his disability was paid under the CSRA because it provided a greater benefit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
