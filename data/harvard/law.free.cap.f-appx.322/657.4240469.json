Although his guidelines range was initially 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment, he faced a statutorily enhanced sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) due to his prior felony convictions, and his guidelines range became life imprisonment. After the court granted the government\u2019s U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, it sentenced Gary to 96 months\u2019 imprisonment. Gary subsequently filed a motion for reduction of sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c) based on Amendment 706. In denying the motion, the district court stated, \u201c[t]he defendant has already received an unusually large reduction in sentence: from Mandatory Life to 96 months. No further reduction is required or appropriate.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-15\">Gray argues that the district court\u2019s order denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is too ambiguous to allow for meaningful appellate review because it is unclear whether the court found that (1) it lacked discretion to reduce his sentence because Gray was unqualified, or alternatively, (2) it did have discretion to reduce his sentence, but chose not to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-16\">In the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) context, we review <em>\u201cde novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002). Once eligibility under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) has been established, however, we review \u201ca district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on a subsequent change in the sentencing guidelines, for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003). We may affirm the district court on any basis supported by the record. <em>Watkins v. Bowden, </em>105 F.3d 1344, 1353 n. 17 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-17\">In deciding whether to grant or deny a motion to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the preferred practice is for a district court to state the reasons for its rulings. <em>See United States v. Carter, </em>110 F.3d 759, 761 (11th Cir.1997); <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number><em>States v. Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.1997). When a district court fails to provide sufficient reasons for its denial of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce sentence, and as a result, we cannot engage in meaningful appellate review, we will vacate the sentence and remand for the district court to state sufficient reasons for its ruling. On the other hand, if meaningful appellate review is possible, remand is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court has discretion to reduce the term of imprisonment of an already incarcerated defendant if that defendant \u201chas been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o) \u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Amendment 706 was made retroactive effective March 3, 2008, by incorporation into \u00a7 1B1.10(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">In evaluating a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, the court must first determine the new base offense level under the guideline amendment, leaving intact all other original guideline application decisions, and then must decide whether it will exercise its discretion to impose the newly calculated sentence or retain the original sentence. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780-81 (11th Cir.2000). When, however, a defendant is not eligible for a sentencing reduction as a matter of law, a district court does not have to recalculate a defendant\u2019s amended guideline range or consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">This court recently addressed and rejected Gray\u2019s argument, holding that because \u201cthe statutorily required minimum sentence effectively displaces the shorter sentence and becomes the guideline sentence for the individual,\u201d Amendment 706 does not apply, as \u201cthe court\u2019s point of departure [for purposes of applying the \u00a7 5K1.1 downward departure] [does] not shift as a result of the amendment\u2019s lowering of the crack offense levels.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1340 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">Upon review, we conclude Gray is ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction because Amendment 706 does not effectively reduce his applicable guideline range, as his statutory minimum sentence remains life imprisonment. Although the district court\u2019s order is ambiguous as to why the court denied the reduction, the order does not preclude us from conducting meaningful review because, regardless of how the order is interpreted, Gray was ineligible for a sentence reduction as a matter of law. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Gray\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b684-12\">.
