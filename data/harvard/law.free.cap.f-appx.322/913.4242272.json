The district court determined that Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines did not lower McFadden\u2019s original guideline range, which was based on a statutory mandatory minimum. We agree with the district court and AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b940-9\">In 1993, the district court sentenced McFadden to 160 months of imprisonment for knowingly and intentionally distributing a quantity of crack cocaine (count one), and a concurrent 240 months of imprisonment for knowingly and intentionally distributing in excess of 50 grams of crack cocaine (count two), both in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). McFadden\u2019s twenty-year mandatory minimum sentence on count two was imposed as a result of his prior drug felony conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-10\">In February 2008, the district court <em>sua sponte </em>ordered the government, the probation office, and counsel for McFadden to assess the impact of Amendment 706 on McFadden\u2019s sentence. McFadden argued that the district court lacked jurisdiction to impose the 240-month mandatory sentence in 1993 because the government\u2019s notice of an enhanced penalty was deficient under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851. The district court determined this was an extraneous resentencing issue that could not be litigated in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. Accordingly, the court concluded that McFadden was not entitled to a two-level reduction under Amendment 706 because he was sentenced pursuant to a statutory mandatory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-12\">On appeal, McFadden repeats his argument that the government\u2019s faulty notice of an enhanced penalty deprived the district court of jurisdiction to impose a mandatory sentence of 240 months of imprisonment. As such, McFadden contends that he is eligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-13\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b940-14\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to reduce a sentence in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding for abuse of discretion; we review its interpretation of the law <em>de novo. See United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1338 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). A district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence under Amendment 706 if his sentence was based on the \u00a7 2D1.1 offense level for crack cocaine offenses. <em>See id. </em>at 1339. If the defendant\u2019s sentence was based on something other than the \u00a7 2D1.1 offense level, such as a statutory mandatory minimum, then Amendment 706 does not impact his sentence. <em>See id. </em>at 1342 (concluding that Williams\u2019 sentence \u201cwould not fall within the scope of Amendment 706\u201d because he was subject to a statutory mandatory minimum); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)) (2008) (prohibiting a sentence reduction where the \u201camendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision <em>(e.g., </em>a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>The district court correctly determined that McFadden\u2019s sentence was unaffected by Amendment 706 because he was sentenced pursuant to a statutory mandatory minimum. <em>See Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1342. Because McFadden\u2019s original guideline range was not based on his \u00a7 2D1.1 offense level, Amendment 706 did not change his guideline range. The district court also correctly determined that it lacked authority to evaluate the sufficiency of the government\u2019s notice of an enhanced penalty. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 782 (11th Cir.2000) (concluding that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u201cdoes not grant to the court jurisdiction to consider extraneous resentencing issues\u201d). In a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, the district court is required to leave intact <em>\u201call </em>original sentencing determinations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 781. Accordingly, the district court properly rejected McFadden\u2019s arguments and denied a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">For these reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
