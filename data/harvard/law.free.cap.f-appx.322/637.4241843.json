Santiago raises several issues on appeal, which we address in turn. After review, we affirm Santiago\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">Santiago first asserts the district court erred by allowing Agent Jay Mortenson, a special agent with the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), to offer expert testimony regarding methamphetamine manufacturing and operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-14\">Normally, evidentiary rulings are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Padron, </em>527 F.3d 1156, 1159 (11th Cir.2008). However,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-15\">[i]t is a cardinal rule of appellate review that a party may not challenge as error a ruling or other trial proceeding invited by that party. The doctrine of invited error is implicated when a party induces or invites the district court into making an error. Where invited error exists, it precludes a court from invoking the plain error rule and reversing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-16\"><em>United States v. Love, </em>449 F.3d 1154, 1157 (11th Cir.2006) (quotations and citations omitted). We have found invited error when a defendant challenged a jury instruction on appeal, but had indicated in the district court the instruction was acceptable to him. <em>United States v. Fulford, </em>267 F.3d 1241, 1247 (11th Cir.2001). Similarly, we applied the invited error doctrine to preclude appellate consideration of whether a district court erred by introducing a defendant\u2019s grand jury testimony, when the district court asked for an objection and defense counsel responded, \u201cI really don\u2019t object.\u201d <em>United States v. Thayer, </em>204 F.3d 1352, 1355 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-17\">Santiago informed the district court during the hearing on the motion <em>in limine </em>he had no objection to testimony concerning how the drug lab was set up and how the methamphetamine was manufactured. As Agent Mortenson was the only expert offered to testify on these matters, Santiago invited any error in allowing Agent Mortenson to testify. Further, the invited error doctrine bars Santiago\u2019s arguments on appeal challenging that testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>mony because, when asked at trial whether he objected to Agent Mortenson testifying as an expert in the subject matter of methamphetamine manufacturing and the operation of clandestine laboratories, Santiago stated he had no objection. <em>See Thayer, </em>204 F.3d at 1355 (holding invited error precluded review of admission of evidence when the court \u201caffirmatively asked counsel if the admission of the [evidence] was acceptable\u201d). Accordingly, we will not review whether the district court erred by allowing Agent Mortenson\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Santiago next contends the district court did not identify five participants in the conspiracy, and thus erred by imposing a four-level enhancement for an aggravating role pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) (2006).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">Because Santiago never objected in the district court based on the number of participants, we review this claim under a plain error standard. <em>See United States v. Straub, </em>508 F.3d 1003, 1008 (11th Cir.2007), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 40, 172 L.Ed.2d 20 (2008). Plain error \u201crequires the petitioner to establish (1) that there was error (2) that was plain; (3) that affected his substantial rights; and (4) that seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>An error is plain if it is clear or obvious. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b665-12\">Failure to object to the facts stated in a PSI or PSI Addendum constitutes an admission of those facts. <em>United States v. Bennett, </em>472 F.3d 825, 833-34 (11th Cir.2006); <em>see also United States v. Hedges, </em>175 F.3d 1312, 1315 (11th Cir.1999) (holding a district court is entitled to rely on statements in a PSI when they are not contested, even in the absence of supporting evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-15\">Here, in paragraph ten under offense conduct, the PSI stated the drug conspiracy involved Santiago, Valencia, Murillo, Oseguera, and others. Because Santiago did not object to the PSI\u2019s statement that the conspiracy included Santiago, Valencia, Murillo, Oseguera, and others, the court did not commit error, much less plain error, by finding the conspiracy involved at least five participants. <em>See Bennett, </em>472 F.3d at 833-34. Although Santiago\u2019s failure to object to paragraph ten of the PSI was sufficient to constitute an admission that five or more individuals participated, the district court did not err by making this finding at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-16\">At sentencing, the Government informed the court that five or more individuals participated in the offense: the four who were indicted and an individual with blonde or gold ham. Santiago did not contest this contention at sentencing, but argues on appeal the Government was required to exclude the possibility the individual with gold or blonde hair was one of the four indicted co-conspirators. Such an argument imposes a higher standard of proof than required to support a sentencing enhancement. <em>See United States v. Perez-Oliveros, </em>479 F.3d 779, 783 (11th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2964, 168 L.Ed.2d 284 (2007) (stating the factual findings to support a sentence enhancement must be established by a preponderance of the evidence). Further, under the plain error standard, any error must be plain and obvious. <em>See Straub, </em>508 F.3d at 1008. Because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>record supports the district court\u2019s finding by a preponderance of the evidence that the criminal activity involved five or more participants, the district court did not plainly err by imposing a four-level enhancement for an aggravating role pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Finally, Santiago argues the district court erred by imposing a three-level enhancement based on the court\u2019s finding the methamphetamine manufacturing offense posed a substantial risk of harm to human life. Specifically, Santiago contends the district court erred by failing to address on the record all four factors set out in Application Note 20 to \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(8)(B) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Because Santiago never objected to the district court\u2019s failure to discuss each factor on the record, we review this claim under a plain error standard. <em>Straub, </em>508 F.3d at 1008. An error is plain if it is clear or obvious. <em>Id. </em>It is \u201cthe law of this circuit that, at least where the explicit language of a statute or rule does not specifically resolve an issue, there can be no plain error where there is no precedent from the Supreme Court or this Court directly resolving it.\u201d <em>United States v. Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">The Guidelines provide for an increase by three levels \u201c[i]f the offense (i) involved the manufacture of ... methamphetamine; and (ii) created a substantial risk of harm to (I) human life other than [the life of a minor or an incompetent]; or (II) the environment....\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(8)(B) (2006). The Guidelines Application Note 20 states \u201cthe court shall include consideration of the following factors\u201d in determining whether the offense created a substantial risk of harm to human life or the environment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-8\">(i)The quantity of any chemicals or hazardous or toxic substances found at the laboratory, and the manner in which the chemicals or substances were stored.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-10\">(ii) The manner in which hazardous or toxic substances were disposed, and the likelihood of release into the environment of hazardous or toxic substances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-11\">(iii) The duration of the offense, and the extent of the manufacturing operation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-12\">(iv) The location of the laboratory (e.g., whether the laboratory is located in a residential neighborhood or a remote area) and the number of human lives placed at substantial risk of harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-13\"><em>Id., </em>cmt. n. 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-14\">Although there is a circuit split on the issue, this Court has not published a case addressing whether the district court is obligated to explicitly consider each factor enumerated in Application Note 20. Application Note 20 does state that, in deciding whether to impose an enhancement under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(8)(B), the court \u201cshall include consideration\u201d of the four factors set forth in the Note. <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, there is nothing in Application Note 20 that directs the court to do so on the record. <em>See generally id. </em>Because Application Note 20 does not provide the district court must consider on the record all four listed factors, and neither this Court nor the Supreme Court has held a district court is obligated to do so, the district court\u2019s failure to do so was not plain error. Further, the record in this case supports the imposition of a three-level enhancement, pursuant to \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(8)(D), for creating a substantial risk to human life or the environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-15\">After a thorough review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b664-11\">.
