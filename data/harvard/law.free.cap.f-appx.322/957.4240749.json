On appeal, Byerly argues the district court should have granted his motion for the following reasons: (1) he was acting within the scope of his discretionary authority, (2) the complaint does not establish a constitutional violation because Appellee Malissa Brown was arrested pursuant to a valid warrant, and (3) he did not violate a clearly established law. After <em>de novo </em>review, we conclude the district court did not err in denying Byerly\u2019s motion to dismiss based on the defense of qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
