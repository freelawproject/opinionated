Blanco contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence seized from him after law enforcement officers arrested him without a warrant. Blanco argues that the officers did not have probable cause for the war-rantless arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-11\">We review \u201ca district court\u2019s denial of a defendant\u2019s motion to suppress under a mixed standard of review, reviewing the district court\u2019s findings of fact under the clearly erroneous standard and the district court\u2019s application of law to those facts <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Desir, </em>257 F.3d 1233, 1235-36 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-16\">\u201cUnder the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, an arresting officer may, without a warrant, search a person validly arrested. In turn, the Constitution permits an officer to arrest a suspect without a warrant if there is probable cause to believe that the suspect has committed or is committing an offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Lyons, </em>403 F.3d 1248, 1253 (11th Cir.2005) (internal citations, quotation marks, and alteration omitted). \u201c \u2018Probable cause\u2019 to justify an arrest means facts and circumstances within the officer\u2019s knowledge that are sufficient to warrant a prudent person, or one of reasonable caution, in believing, in the circumstances shown, that the suspect has committed, is committing, or is about to commit an offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Mancini, </em>802 F.2d 1326, 1330 (11th Cir.1986) (internal quotation marks, citation, and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-17\">The officers had probable cause to arrest Blanco. The officers learned about Blanco from Alexandra Cannaday. Can-naday had been arrested earlier that day in possession of type of methamphetamine commonly known as crystal meth. Canna-day offered to cooperate with the officers by leading them her supplier, Blanco. She said that Blanco owed her an ounce of crystal meth. In the presence of the officers, Cannaday called Blanco and arranged to meet him that afternoon. The officers accompanied Cannaday to the arranged meeting place. Blanco was there. He approached Cannaday\u2019s car and got inside, at which point officers approached the car and arrested Blanco.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b943-18\">Cannaday had no reason to lie about Blanco under these circumstances and she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>had reasons to tell the truth. <em>See United States v. Foree, </em>43 F.3d 1572, 1576 (11th Cir.1995) (noting that a \u201ccontrolled surveillance operation\u201d is a situation in which the informant \u201cis unlikely to lie\u201d). Just as in <em>Foree, </em>if Cannaday had been lying about Blanco, her \u201clies would likely be discovered in short order and favors falsely curried would dissipate rapidly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Cannaday would only have gotten herself into deeper trouble by lying about Blanco. Under these circumstances, the officers had probable cause to arrest Blanco because it was reasonable to believe that he was in possession of crystal meth. <em>See Lyons, </em>403 F.3d at 1253.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">The fact that it turned out that Blanco did not have any crystal meth but instead was in possession of 49 pills of ecstasy does not matter. <em>See id. </em>at 1254. What matters is that the officers had probable cause to make the arrest. The search pursuant to that arrest was legal and the district court did not err in denying Blan-co\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b943-12\">. The officers decided not to wait until Blanco delivered the drugs. It is the department's policy, based on safety concerns, not to put an officer in a position where someone is sitting behind them.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
