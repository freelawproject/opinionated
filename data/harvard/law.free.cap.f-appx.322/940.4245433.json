After review, we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b967-4\">In 2005, Austin pled guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g) and 924(e). Austin had six prior felony convictions, which included aggravated battery, aggravated assault, sale of a substance in lieu of cocaine and three convictions for carrying a concealed weapon. At sentencing, the district court imposed sentencing enhancements because Austin qualified as an armed career criminal, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(a) and the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). The district court imposed the ACCA\u2019s mandatory minimum sentence of 180 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">Austin appealed his sentence to this Court. In his direct appeal, Austin argued that the district court erred in sentencing him as an armed career criminal because his prior convictions had not been alleged in the indictment or admitted in his guilty plea. This Court affirmed, concluding that, based on <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the district court was permitted to enhance his sentence based on uncharged prior convictions. <em>See U.S. v. Austin, </em>202 Fed.Appx. 445, 447 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">Two years later, on July 31, 2008, Austin filed the instant <em>pro se </em>motion in the district court, which he entitled \u201cpro se nunc pro tunc motion based on defendant\u2019s \u2018actual innocence\u2019 of the illegal sentence.\u201d Austin\u2019s motion argued that the district court had erred in sentencing him as an armed career criminal because (1) his prior convictions for carrying a concealed weapon no longer constitute \u201cviolent felonies\u201d after this Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347 (11th Cir.2008); (2) his conviction for sale of a substance in lieu of cocaine was not a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d; and (3) his aggravated assault conviction was not a \u201cviolent felony.\u201d Austin asked the district court to construe his motion under the appropriate statute that would afford him relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-10\">Two days later, on August 2, 2008,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the district court denied Austin\u2019s July 31, 2008 motion, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b967-11\">ENDORSED ORDER denying Defendant David Austin Jr.\u2019s motion to reduce his sentence. Defendant contends that some of the prior convictions which were relied upon to categorize him as an armed career criminal are not violent felonies as that term has been defined in <em>Bega[y] v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), and <em>United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347 (11th Cir.2008). These decisions, however, are not retroactive. Thus, unless defendant raised these issues on direct appeal, the court is without authority to grant relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b967-14\">Austin filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-15\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b967-16\">Austin\u2019s <em>pro se </em>motion did not identify the statute under which he was seeking relief and asked the district court to construe his motion under the appropriate statute. The district court denied Austin\u2019s motion without identifying the statute under which it was analyzing Austin\u2019s claims or some other source of its jurisdiction over Austin\u2019s claims. On appeal, the government identifies two possible statutory bases for Austin\u2019s <em>pro se </em>post-conviction motion: (1) 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c); or (2) 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The government argues that \u00a7 3582(c) does not authorize the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>trict court to grant relief and that the district court could not construe Austin\u2019s motion as a \u00a7 2255 motion because it did not give the notice and warnings required by <em>Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 382-83, 124 S.Ct. 786, 792, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">A district court may properly recharac-terize a <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s motion as a \u00a7 2255 motion; however, before doing so, the district court must notify the prisoner of its intention to do so, inform the prisoner of the consequences of that recharacterization and provide the prisoner with an opportunity to withdraw or amend his motion. <em>See Castro, </em>540 U.S. at 382-83, 124 S.Ct. at 792. Federal courts \u201chave an obligation to look behind the label of a motion filed by a <em>pro se </em>inmate and determine whether the motion is, in effect, cognizable under a different remedial statutory framework.\u201d <em>United States v. Jordan, </em>915 F.2d 622, 624-25 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">Additionally, an appeal from a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion is limited to the issues identified in a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) issued by the district court or this Court. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 335-36, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 1039, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c). Here, Austin filed a notice of appeal in the district court. If a <em>pro se </em>petitioner files a notice of appeal, the district court must treat it as an application for a COA and then either issue a COA or state why a COA should not issue. <em>See Edwards v. United States, </em>114 F.3d 1083, 1084 (11th Cir.1997); Fed. R.App. P. 22(b)(1). A district court is required to rule upon an application for a COA before we will consider a request for a COA. <em>Edwards, </em>114 F.3d at 1084.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">It is undisputed that, in ruling on Austin\u2019s <em>pro se </em>motion, the district court did not provide Austin with the <em>Castro </em>notice and warnings and did not issue a COA ruling in response to Austin\u2019s notice of appeal. Because the district court did not explain the basis for its jurisdiction or the statute under which it was construing Austin\u2019s <em>pro se </em>motion, we do not know whether the district court was construing Austin\u2019s motion under \u00a7 2255 or had some other source of jurisdiction. We therefore vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand to the district court for further proceedings. On remand, the district court should either: (1) state its intention to construe Austin\u2019s motion as a \u00a7 2255 motion, comply with the <em>Castro </em>requirements and construe any subsequent notice of appeal as an application for a COA; or (2) if it chooses not to proceed under \u00a7 2255, either explain the basis for its exercising of jurisdiction or indicate why jurisdiction is lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-8\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b967-7\">. The district court ruled two days after Austin filed his <em>pro se </em>motion. If the government had been given time to respond, it appears the government would have alerted the district court of the need to give notice under <em>Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 382-83, 124 S.Ct. 786, 792, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
