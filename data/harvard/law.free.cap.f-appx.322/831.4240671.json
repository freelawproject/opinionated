United States v. Campa, </em>529 F.3d 980, 992 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2790, - L.Ed.2d - (2009). \u201cWe review the terms of supervised release for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>See United States v. Dodge, </em>554 F.3d 1357, 1360 (11th Cir.2009). A remand is necessary when the record on appeal is insufficient to enable meaningful review. <em>See United States v. Campbell, </em>473 F.3d 1345, 1347 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-12\">A probation officer may \u201cuse all suitable methods, not inconsistent with the conditions specified by the court, to aid a probationer or a person on supervised release who is under his supervision, and to bring about improvements in his conduct and condition.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3603(3). However, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583, district courts retain the ultimate responsibility for ensuring that a defendant has complied with the conditions of her supervised release. <em>See Gozlon-Peretz v. United States, </em>498 U.S. 395, 400-01, 111 S.Ct. 840, 844-45, 112 L.Ed.2d 919 (1991) (noting that, with \u00a7 3583, Congress placed responsibility for overseeing a defendant\u2019s post-confinement monitoring with the sentencing court). Additionally, under \u00a7 3583, a district court may modify the conditions of supervised release, but, under Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.1(c), before modifying the conditions of supervised release, the court must hold a hearing, \u201cat which the person has the right to counsel and an opportunity to make a statement and present any information in mitigation.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.1(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-14\">In <em>United States v. Dempsey, </em>180 F.3d 1325, 1326 (11th Cir.1999), we held that district courts are exclusively authorized with imposing occupational restrictions as a condition of supervised release, and that probation officers lack such authority. In so holding, we further reasoned that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5F1.5, which implements 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d), \u201cauthorizes only a court to impose occupational restrictions and restricts its authority to do so to those instances where the <em>court </em>specifically finds (1) a reasonably direct relationship between the occupational restriction and the conduct relevant to the defendant\u2019s offense and (2) the restriction is reasonably necessary to protect the public from the possibility the defendant will continue to engage in unlawful conduct similar to that for which he was convicted.\u201d <em>Dempsey, </em>180 F.3d at 1326 (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5F1.5). Moreover, the Supreme Court has noted that associational conditions do not extend to casual or chance meetings, and an \u201coccupational association, standing alone,\u201d does not provide sufficient evidence of a violation of a supervised release restriction. <em>See Arciniega v. Freeman, </em>404 U.S. 4, 4, 92 S.Ct. 22, 22, 30 L.Ed.2d 126 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-15\">Lastly, courts sometimes may use categorical terms to outline the contours of supervised release conditions, and such categorical terms generally provide sufficient notice of prohibited conduct when there is a plain understanding of what activities those categories cover. <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number><em>States v. Taylor, </em>338 F.3d 1280, 1286 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">However, the committee notes to Fed. R.Crim.P. 32.1(b) state specifically that a defendant should have an opportunity to obtain clarification of a term or condition of supervised release so that the defendant may have an opportunity to comply with the court\u2019s order without first having to violate it, and caselaw supports the procedural right to seek clarification. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 32.1(b) advisory committee\u2019s note; <em>Dempsey, </em>180 F.3d at 1325-26 (considering a defendant\u2019s Rule 32.1(b) motion to have occupational restrictions imposed by probation officer modified or clarified).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">Here, the conditions of Guanipa\u2019s supervised release did not include any occupational restrictions, and the court effectively imposed such a restriction based on its broad application of a restriction that she not \u201cassociate\u201d with any persons engaged in criminal activity or convicted felons. The court\u2019s lack of explanation in denying Guanipa\u2019s motion does not provide an opportunity for meaningful appellate review. More importantly, because an \u201coccupational association, standing alone\u201d is insufficient evidence of a likely violation of the criminal association restriction, we vacate and remand for the purpose of allowing the district court to clarify the conditions of supervised release and reconcile those with Guanipa\u2019s requirement to work. If the court finds that an occupational restriction is necessary, it needs to elaborate, following a hearing, why such a restriction has a reasonable relationship to her convicted conduct and is reasonably necessary to protect the public. Accordingly, we vacate and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
