We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo; </em>and we view the evidence and all reasonable factual inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmov-ing party. <em>Maniccia v. Brown, </em>171 F.3d 1364, 1367 (11th Cir.1999). On appeal, Guzman \u2014 who assembled and installed kitchen cabinets in customers\u2019 homes and businesses for Irmadan \u2014 argues that he individually was engaged in interstate commerce because he purchased and transported building materials that had traveled in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">The FLSA requires an employer to pay an employee overtime compensation for any hours worked in excess of forty in a given workweek, if that employee establishes either individual or enterprise coverage.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For individual coverage to apply under the FLSA, Guzman had to show that he (1) engaged in commerce or (2) engaged in the production of goods for commerce. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(a)(1). Guzman relies on the \u201cengaged in commerce\u201d element.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">To receive overtime compensation, Guzman had to \u201cdirectly participate] in the actual movement of persons or things in interstate commerce.\u201d <em>Thorne v. All Restoration Servs., Inc., </em>448 F.3d 1264, 1266 (11th Cir.2006).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In his employment with Irmadan, Guzman would, on occasion, pick up materials for Irmadan from local hardware and retail stores. These materials\u2014 including plywood and liquid nails \u2014 had come from out of state and abroad and later were used in the construction of Ir-madan\u2019s cabinets. But the materials were removed from the flow of interstate commerce when they arrived at the retail stores. <em>See id. </em>at 1267 (\u201cWhen goods reach the customer for whom they were intended, the interstate journey ends ... \u201d); <em>see also </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(i). Guzman\u2019s later transport of the materials and installation of cabinets purchased by Irma-dan\u2019s customers purely was intrastate activity \u201cnot covered under the Act.\u201d <em>Thorne, </em>448 F.3d at 1267. Guzman\u2019s assertion that Irmadan\u2019s customers were the ultimate consumers of the materials is unavailing; the materials Guzman used and transported simply allowed Irmadan to conduct its cabinetry business. <em>See Dunlop v. Indus. Am. Corp., </em>516 F.2d 498, 499-502 (5th Cir.1975) (wholly intrastate garbage removal service was the ultimate consumer of the gasoline \u2014 which had moved in interstate commerce \u2014 used in operating company\u2019s trucks).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b671-8\">. Guzman originally argued for enterprise coverage but later conceded that it was not a viable theory because Defendant did not have at least $500,000 in gross revenues. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(s)(l)(A)(ii).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b671-9\">. In enacting the FLSA, Congress did not exercise the full scope of its commerce power. <em>Walling v. Jacksonville Paper Co., </em>317 U.S. 564, 63 S.Ct. 332, 336, 87 L.Ed. 460 (1943).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b671-13\">.In his brief, Guzman belies his own assertion that the customers were the ultimate consumers of the materials, noting that the materials he picked up were \"crucial and central to [Irmadan\u2019s] cabinetry business\" and that he transported the materials \"to be used in connection with [Irmadan\u2019s] business.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
