The charges stemmed from internet communications Jenkins had with, and webcam masturbation videos he sent to, a Canadian law enforcement officer in Ontario, Canada, who was posing as a 13-year-old girl.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-25\">On appeal, he argues his convictions were not supported by sufficient evidence at trial because evidence did not support an obscenity determination. Specifically, he argues: (1) no evidence was introduced at his Atlanta, Georgia, trial regarding the community standards in Canada; (2) Canadian law conclusively showed that the videos he sent were not obscene; and (3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>Canadian law was conclusive regarding community standards because it allowed adults to purchase and view masturbation videos.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Federal law prohibits the attempted transfer of obscene material, using means of interstate commerce, to an individual the transferor knows is under 16 years old. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1470. In <em>Miller v. California, </em>413 U.S. 15, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973), the Supreme Court held that, in order for material to be obscene, a trier of fact must find that: (1) \u201cthe average person, applying contemporary community standards would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest;\u201d (2) \u201cthe work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law;\u201d and (3) \u201cthe work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2615 (internal quotations and citations omitted). The <em>Miller </em>test applies to federal obscenity prosecutions. <em>United States v. Bagnell, </em>679 F.2d 826, 835 n. 9 (11th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">The Supreme Court has said that, in judging whether materials are obscene under the <em>Miller </em>test, the materials generally are \u201csufficient in themselves for the determination of the question.\u201d <em>Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, </em>413 U.S. 49, 93 S.Ct. 2628, 2635, 37 L.Ed.2d 446 (1973) (internal quotations omitted). The jury should be able to \u201capply first-hand knowledge to the Miller test, thus obviating the need for expert testimony.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">When allegedly-obseene material is transferred from one community to another, the relevant community standards are those of the receiving community. <em>Ashcroft v. ACLU, </em>535 U.S. 564, 122 S.Ct. 1700, 1712, 152 L.Ed.2d 771 (2002); <em>see also Hamling v. United States, </em>418 U.S. 87, 94 S.Ct. 2887, 2902, 41 L.Ed.2d 590 (1974). Although a particular community\u2019s laws regarding the regulation of obscene material, or lack thereof, may be relevant to the community standards analysis, they are \u201cnot conclusive as to the issues of [such] standards for appeal to the prurient interest and patent offensiveness.\u201d <em>Smith v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 291, 97 S.Ct. 1756, 1767-68, 52 L.Ed.2d 324 (1977). In fact, evidence of standards in a community outside the receiving community may be relevant to the obscenity determination, and the <em>Miller </em>test allows the jurors to draw on their knowledge of the community from which them came to decide \u201cwhat conclusion the average person, applying contemporary community standards would reach in a given case.\u201d <em>Bagnell, </em>679 F.2d at 836 (internal quotations omitted); <em>Hamling, </em>94 S.Ct. at 2902.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-12\">In this case, sufficient evidence supported Jenkins\u2019s conviction for attempted transfer of obscene material to a minor. The jury saw each of the six video recordings of Jenkins, which was evidence sufficient for the jury to make an obscenity determination. <em>See id. </em>Although the jury heard evidence regarding Canadian law, that evidence did not control either the jury\u2019s overall obscenity determination or its evaluation of the community standards. <em>See Smith, </em>97 S.Ct. at 1768. For these reasons, we affirm Jenkins\u2019s convictions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b743-8\">. Jenkins has abandoned any challenge to his sentences by failing to assert any error in that regard on appeal. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
