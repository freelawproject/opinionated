On August 25, 2008, the district court sentenced appellant on Counts 1 and 2 to concurrent prison terms of 60 and 96 months, respectively, and on Count 3 to a consecutive prison term of 84 months. Appellant now appeals his sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-11\">Appellant argues that the district court, in determining his sentence range under the Guidelines, improperly considered as \u201crelevant conduct\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3 three bank robberies he confessed that he previously committed but were never the subject of a formal charge. The court erred in doing this, he says, because those robberies were discrete, separate incidents that did not occur \u201cduring the commission of the offense of conviction\u201d and were not part of a \u201ccommon scheme or plan\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1B1.3. Appellant also argues that these uncharged robberies were not appropriate bases under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) for the court\u2019s imposition of a variance from the Guidelines sentence range because the \u201crelevant conduct\u201d limitation imposed by \u00a7 1B1.3 on robberies also limited the factors the court could consider in its \u00a7 3553(a) analysis. According to appellant, one of the core purposes of \u00a7 3553(a), avoiding unwarranted sentencing disparities, is served by excluding consideration of uncharged, non-relevant conduct. Finally, he argues that the \u201cmini trial\u201d the court held at sentencing on each of his prior, uncharged offenses violated his constitutional rights, because he was not afforded a jury trial and the court, rather than a jury, made the final decision of how much weight to afford his confession to the uncharged robberies.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-12\">We review <em>de novo </em>constitutional challenges to a sentence. <em>United States v. Cantellano, </em>430 F.3d 1142, 1144 (11th Cir.2005). We also review <em>de novo </em>\u201cwhether a factor considered by the district court in sentencing a defendant is impermissible.\u201d <em>United States v. Velasquez Velasquez, </em>524 F.3d 1248, 1252 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>After <em>Bookey</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em>, </em>we established a two-step process for district courts to use in sentencing: first, the district court must consult the Sentencing Guidelines and correctly calculate the sentencing range; second, the district court must consider the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) in arriving at a reasonable sentence. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(l)-(7). \u201c[A] sentence based on an improper factor fails to achieve the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a) and may be unreasonable!;] regardless of length.\u201d <em>United States v. Arevalo-Juarez, </em>464 F.3d 1246, 1249 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Regarding the factors that may be considered in fashioning a reasonable sentence, \u201c[n]o limitation shall be placed on the information concerning the background, character, and conduct of a person convicted of an offense which a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an appropriate sentence.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3661. After <em>Booker, </em>\u201ccourts may still consider relevant facts concerning a defendant\u2019s background, character, and conduct\u201d when imposing a reasonable sentence. <em>United States v. Faust, </em>456 F.3d 1342, 1348 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotation omitted) (holding that \u201c18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3661 ... remains intact post-<em>Booker\u201d). </em>With the foregoing principles in mind, we consider appellant\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">First, the record shows that, contrary to appellant\u2019s argument, the district court did not consider the uncharged robberies under \u00a7 1B1.3 to determine the Guidelines sentence range; rather, the court considered the robberies under \u00a7 3553(a) in deciding to impose an upward variance. Second, \u00a7 IB 1.3 did not limit the court\u2019s discretion to consider the robberies under \u00a7\u00a7 3661 and 3553(a). Finally, nothing in the Constitution or Supreme Court precedent precluded the court from conducting the sentencing hearing as it did and finding that appellant committed the uncharged robberies.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">Appellant\u2019s sentences are, accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b805-6\">. <em>United States v.
