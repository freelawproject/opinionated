(\u201cAirfreight\u201d), dismissing Plaintiffs\u2019 claims under the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201-216 (\u201cFLSA\u201d). No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">Plaintiffs seek liquidated damages for untimely payment of their wages under the FLSA. The crux of Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint is that Airfreight\u2019s policy of paying its employees seven to eight days after the pay-period ended \u2014 without justification for the delay \u2014 violates the FLSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">Section 206(b) of the FLSA provides that \u201c[e]very employer shall pay to each of his employees ... who in any work week is engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce ... not less than the minimum wage rate.... \u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(b). Although the FLSA specifies no time within which wages must be paid, liquidated damages may be available if the employer fails to pay wages or overtime on the regular payment date. <em>See Atlantic Co. v. Broughton, </em>146 F.2d 480, 482 (5th Cir.1945). And we will assume that a \u201cregular payment date\u201d may be so far distant from the pay period to which payment relates to state a violation of the FLSA minimum wage. But we are cited to no cases that have concluded that seven or eights days\u2019 payment in arrears\u2014 the time between the end of the pay period and Airfreight\u2019s regular payment date \u2014 is actionably unreasonable or untimely.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> No requirement exists that wages be paid simultaneously with the end of the pay period. We see no support in the FLSA or in case law for Plaintiffs\u2019 conflation of the end of the pay period and the regular pay date.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-12\">The district court committed no error in granting summary judgment to Airfreight: Plaintiffs failed to show that Airfreight\u2019s practice of paying wages seven to eight days after the wages accrued violates the FLSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b773-10\"> <em>Olson v. Superior Pontiac-GMC, Inc., </em>765 F.2d 1570 (11th Cir.1985), cited by Plaintiffs, is not on point. <em>Olson </em>addressed whether commissions paid to car salesmen could be carried forward. <em>Olson </em>concluded that the carry-forward-payment sequence was allowable only if the employee actually received the minimum wage for each pay period.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
