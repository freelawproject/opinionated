After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b982-7\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may modify the term of imprisonment of an already incarcerated defendant if the defendant\u2019s sentence is \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). However, \u201c[w]here a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). Thus, a reduction is not authorized if an applicable amendment does not lower a defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range \u201cbecause of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision (e.g., a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-11\">At Mack\u2019s 2004 sentencing, his initial guidelines range, based on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)\u2019s drug quantity table, was 292 to 365 months\u2019 imprisonment. However, because Mack was subject to a statutory mandatory minimum life sentence pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), his guidelines sentence became life imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b). The district court then granted a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 motion for a downward departure based on Mack\u2019s substantial assistance, resulting in a guidelines range of 168 to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court imposed a 180-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-14\">In 2008, Mack filed this \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which lowered most of the base offense levels in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) applicable to crack cocaine offenses. The district court denied the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, concluding that Mack\u2019s sentencing range of life imprisonment, which was set based on the statutory mandatory minimum, was not lowered by Amendment 706. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-15\">Mack\u2019s sentencing range was determined by the statutory mandatory minimum, not by the quantity of crack cocaine attributed to him under \u00a7 2Dl.l(e). Thus, even though Amendment 706 lowered the base offense level for Mack\u2019s crack cocaine offenses, it did not affect Mack\u2019s sentencing range of life imprisonment. The fact that Mack received a \u00a7 5K1.1 downward departure once his guidelines range was calculated does not alter this conclusion. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1339-42 (11th Cir.2008) (concluding that the district court did not have authority to grant defendant\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because Amendment 706 had no effect on his statutory mandatory minimum sentence, which had become his guidelines range, even though he received a \u00a7 5K1.1 downward departure). Because Amendment 706 had no effect on his sentencing range, Mack was ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>Mack\u2019s arguments regarding the applicability of <em>United States v.
