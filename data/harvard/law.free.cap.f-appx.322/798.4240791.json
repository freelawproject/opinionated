The district court denied Mackey\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because Amendment 706 did not have the effect of lowering his guideline range. His guidelines range was 360 months to life before the amendment and would have been 360 months to life after the amendment. Mackey argues that the district court erred by declining to reduce his sentence without first considering the sentencing factors identified in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-12\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) a sentence reduction must be consistent with the Commission\u2019s policy statement, which is found at U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10. In that policy statement the Commission has instructed us that a reduction is not consistent with the applicable policy statement if the amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B) (Nov. 2008). That limitation on the scope of Amendment 703 is not affected by the <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), decision. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192 (11th Cir.2009). Accordingly, there is ho basis for any requirement that a district court consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, which do not affect the actual guidelines range, before deciding whether it can reduce a sentence under Amendment 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
