Because Martinez did not object on this basis in the district court, this issue is reviewed for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Baker, </em>538 F.3d 324, 332 (5th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied,</em>\u2014U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 962, 173 L.Ed.2d 153 (2009). At Martinez\u2019s sentencing, a special agent of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement testified that Martinez\u2019s apartment contained, among other items used to create false identification documents, over 100 sheets of stock paper simulating green cards and social security cards. The district court did not commit plain error in applying the nine-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(2)(C). <em>See United States v. Salazar, </em>70 F.3d 351, 351-52 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-22\">Martinez also argues that the district court erred in finding that a factual basis existed to support his guilty plea as to aggravated identity theft under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A. Martinez contends that he never admitted knowing that the means of identification he was using belonged to another person. Martinez argues that such knowledge is an element of \u00a7 1028A. Because this argument is raised for the first time on appeal, plain error review applies. <em>See United States v. Palmer, </em>456 F.3d 484, 489 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-23\">Section 1028A imposes a consecutive two-year sentence on anyone who during particular enumerated offenses \u201cknowingly transfers, possesses, or uses, without lawful authority, a means of identification of another person.\u201d \u00a7 1028A(a)(l). Martinez argues that the word \u201cknowingly\u201d modifies not only the phrase \u201ctransfers, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>possesses, or uses\u201d but also the phrase \u201ca means of identification of another person,\u201d such that the Government was required to prove that a defendant knew that the means of identification belonged to another person. Martinez alternatively argues that \u00a7 1028A(a)(l) is ambiguous and that it should be interpreted in his favor pursuant to the rule of lenity.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">We have not considered this issue. The First, Ninth, and D.C. Circuits have held that the Government must prove under \u00a7 1028A that the defendant actually knew that the means of identification belonged to another person. <em>United States v. Godin, </em>534 F.3d 51, 61 (1st Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Miranda-Lopez, </em>532 F.3d 1034, 1040 (9th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Villa-nueva-Sotelo, </em>515 F.3d 1234, 1246 (D.C.Cir.2008), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Nov. 7, 2008) (No. 08-622). The Eighth, Eleventh, and Fourth Circuits have reached the opposite conclusion. <em>United States v. Mendoza-Gonzalez, </em>520 F.3d 912, 915 (8th Cir.2008), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 15, 2008) (No. 08-5316); <em>United States v. Hurtado, </em>508 F.3d 603, 609, 610 &amp; n. 8 (11th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied,</em>\u2014U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 2903, 171 L.Ed.2d 843 (2008); <em>United States v. Montejo, </em>442 F.3d 213, 216-17 (4th Cir.2006). The Supreme Court has granted certiorari on this issue in <em>Flores-Figueroa v. United States,</em>\u2014U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 457, 172 L.Ed.2d 326 (2008). \u201cAn error is considered plain, or obvious, only if the error is clear under existing law.\u201d <em>United States v. Salinas, </em>480 F.3d 750, 756 (5th Cir.2007). Because the law is not currently settled, any error by the district court was not clear or obvious. <em>See id. </em>at 759.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b411-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
