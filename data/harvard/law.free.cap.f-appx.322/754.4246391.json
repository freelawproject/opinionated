Jones appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for sentence reduction based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced the base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses. In 2003, Jones pled guilty to one count of possession with intent to distribute cocaine base (crack cocaine), in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Jones\u2019s Guidelines offense level was initially calculated at 32 based on the amount of cocaine base involved, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. Jones, however, qualified as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, and an offense level of 37 applied because the statutory maximum for the offense was life imprisonment. The district court denied the instant motion for sentence reduction, finding Amendment 706 did not affect Jones\u2019s sentencing range because it was ultimately calculated based on the career offender provision and not the crack cocaine guideline.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">We review for an abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence based on a subsequent change in the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003). We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions and questions of statutory interpretation in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009)</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">In <em>Moore, </em>this Court addressed whether a defendant sentenced pursuant to the career offender guideline is eligible for sentence reduction based on Amendment 706. <em>Id. </em>at 1327. There, the defendants\u2019 offense levels were initially calculated based on the amount of crack cocaine involved. <em>Id. </em>at 1325. The defendants, however, were ultimately sentenced as career offenders under \u00a7 4B1.1, which was not affected by Amendment 706. <em>Id. </em>We affirmed the denials of their motions for sentence modification, holding, \u201c[w]here a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1330; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A) (\u201c[A] reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2) and is not consistent with this policy statement if ... [a retroactive amendment] is applicable to the defendant but the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision[.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-9\">Here, as in <em>Moore, </em>Jones was sentenced based on a range that was determined by application of the career offender provision. The offense level that would have applied under \u00a7 2D1.1, based on the amount of crack cocaine involved, ultimately played no role in his sentence. Because Amendment 706 \u201cdoes not alter the sentencing range upon which his ... sentence was based,\u201d Jones is ineligible for sentence reduction. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330. Accordingly, we affirm the denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
