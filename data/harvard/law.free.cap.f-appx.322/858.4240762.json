Brooks, 55 </em>Fed.Appx. 903, PIN (11th Cir.2002), we affirmed appellant\u2019s prison sentence of 168 months<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on a plea of guilty to distribution of at least five grams of cocaine base (\u201ccrack cocaine\u201d), in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a). On March 6, 2006, appellant moved the district court to reduce his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c) based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced the base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine offenses. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>The court denied his motion on the ground that, having been sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, he was not eligible for relief under Amendment 706. He now appeals, arguing that he was eligible for relief because at his sentencing, the court departed downward from the Guidelines sentence range based on its finding that his criminal history category substantially overrepresented his criminal record; hence, he was not sentenced as a career offender. He also argues that the court had the authority to reduce his sentence in accordance with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">A district court may reduce the sentence \u201cof a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The applicable policy statements provide that \u201ca reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2) and is not consistent with this policy statement if ... [a retroactive amendment] is applicable to the defendant but the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">Here, although, at sentencing, the court departed downward in arriving at appellant\u2019s criminal history category, his offense level was calculated by application of the career offender provision. Accordingly, the applicable sentence range was not affected by Amendment 706, and he is ineligible for sentence reduction. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008), ce<em>rt. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009). <em>Booker </em>provides appellant no assistance because it does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. Therefore, the court was bound by the limitations imposed by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192 (11th Cir.2009) (holding that <em>Booker </em>does not \u201cprohibit the limitations on a judge\u2019s discretion in reducing a sentence imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statement by the Sentencing Commission\u201d), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Feb. 10, 2009) (No. 08-8664).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b884-18\">.
