Additionally, he argues that the district court erred in refusing to reduce his base offense level for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a), because he pled guilty and gave statements about the drug transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-20\">When reviewing the denial of safety-valve relief, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its application of the sentencing guidelines to those facts <em>de novo. United States v. Johnson, </em>375 F.3d 1300, 1301 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cCredibility determinations are typically the province of the fact finder because the fact finder personally observes the testimony and is thus in a better position than a reviewing court to assess the credibility of witnesses.\u201d <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number><em>Ramirez-Chilel, </em>289 F.3d 744, 749 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">The safety-valve provision of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 implements 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) and allows a court to sentence a defendant without regard to the statutory mandatory minimum sentence if the defendant meets five criteria. <em>United States v. Brownlee, </em>204 F.3d 1302, 1304 (11th Cir.2000). To be eligible for a safety-valve reduction, the defendant must show that: (1) he does not have more than one criminal history point; (2) he did not use violence or threats of violence or possess a firearm in connection with offense; (3) \u201cthe offense did not result in death or serious bodily injury;\u201d (4) he was not an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of the offense as determined under the sentencing guidelines and \u201cwas not engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise;\u201d and (5) not later than the time of the sentencing hearing, he \u201ctruthfully provided to the [government all information and evidence [he had] concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(l)-(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">Of the five criteria, the only issue on appeal is whether the Cunningham satisfied the fifth safety-valve requirement by truthfully providing the government with all information and evidence concerning the offense that was part of the same course of conduct. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(5); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(5). The burden is on the defendant to show that he has met all of the safety-valve factors. <em>United States v. Cruz, </em>106 F.3d 1553, 1557 (11th Cir.1997). \u201c[T]he defendant has an affirmative responsibility to truthfully disclose to the government all information and evidence that he has about the offense and all relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>375 F.3d at 1302 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Moreover, a defendant cannot qualify for safety-valve relief \u201cmerely by expressing a willingness to provide information,\u201d and there is no initial burden on the government to solicit information from the defendant. <em>United States v. Milkintas, </em>470 F.3d 1339, 1346 (11th Cir.2006) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-8\">Lies and omissions do not necessarily disqualify a defendant from relief as long as the defendant later makes a truthful and complete proffer prior to the sentencing hearing. <em>Brownlee, </em>204 F.3d at 1305. A district court cannot apply safety-valve relief if it determines that the defendant withheld or misrepresented information, even if the information would not have aided further investigation or prosecution if properly disclosed. <em>United States v. Figueroa, </em>199 F.3d 1281, 1282-83 (11th Cir.2000). In determining the honesty of a defendant, the district court must independently assess the facts and may not rely on the government\u2019s assertion of dishonesty. <em>United States v. Espinosa, </em>172 F.3d 795, 797 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-9\">The record here shows that Cunningham failed to provide a full and truthful proffer of all the information and evidence he had concerning the offense. In letters to the district court, Cunningham stated that this was a one-time drug transaction \u201ctotally inconsistent with [his] background and values\u201d and \u201ctotally inconsistent with the way [he had] lived [his] entire life.\u201d Law enforcement officers, however, testified that, while they were undercover, Cunningham told them he previously had been involved in the drug business and wanted to establish a relationship with the officers to make future drug transactions. Additionally, Cunningham stated that he intended to purchase a quantity of cocaine for $8,000, but he did not disclose that this was only partial payment for one kilogram of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">We review a district court\u2019s interpretation of the sentencing guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Masferrer, </em>514 F.3d 1158, 1164 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 996, 173 L.Ed.2d 291 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-7\">The Sentencing Guidelines provide for a two-level reduction when the defendant clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a). Although a guilty plea is significant evidence of acceptance of responsibility, \u201cthis evidence may be outweighed by conduct of the defendant that is inconsistent with such acceptance of responsibility.\u201d <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>115 F.3d 1531, 1537 (11th Cir.1997) (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.3)). \u201c[A] defendant who falsely denies, or frivolously contests, relevant conduct that the court determines to be true has acted in a manner inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility\u201d and may not receive an adjustment, even if he pleads guilty. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.l(a)). \u201cA defendant who enters a guilty plea is not entitled to an adjustment ... as a matter of right.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n. 3). The defendant bears the burden of proving his entitlement to the reduction, and the reviewing court gives great deference to the sentencing judge. <em>See Lewis, </em>115 F.3d at 1537; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n. 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-8\">We conclude from the record that the district court did not clearly err in refusing to give Cunningham a reduction for acceptance of responsibility because he made false statements in letters to the district court that were inconsistent with his acceptance of responsibility. Because the district court\u2019s decision is entitled to deference in granting such a reduction and Cunningham has failed to meet his burden and to demonstrate how the district court erred, we affirm his 63-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
