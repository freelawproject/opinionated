As for a well-founded fear of persecution, she notes the BIA\u2019s finding that conditions in Haiti have changed, but argues the past persecution shows \u201cthat eventually it would be her turn.\u201d We deny Louis\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-17\">\u201cThis court reviews administrative fact findings under the highly deferential substantial evidence test. Under the substantial evidence test, we view the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Djonda v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1168, 1173 (11th Cir.2008) (quotations omitted). \u201cWhen reviewing for substantial evidence, we do not ask whether the evidence presented by an applicant might support a claim for relief; instead, we ask whether the record compels us to reverse the finding to the contrary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1175.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-18\">When, as here, the BIA issues its own opinion without expressly adopting the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews only the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See Rodriguez Morales v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 884, 890 (11th Cir.2007). Because the BIA treated Louis\u2019s testimony as credible, her testimony must be accepted by this Court. <em>Niftaliev v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1211, 1216 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-19\">An alien may receive asylum, at the discretion of the Attorney General, if she can carry the burden of proving that she is a \u201crefugee,\u201d which is defined as \u201cany person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail ... herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>bership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1230 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A)). Accordingly, \u201cthe alien must, with credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of her political opinion or any other protected ground, or (2) a \u2018well-founded fear\u2019 that her political opinion or any other protected ground will cause future persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1230-31 (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a) and (b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">\u201cA showing of past persecution creates a presumption of a \u2018well-founded fear,\u2019 subject to rebuttal by the [government].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1231 (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(l)(i)). This presumption may be rebutted if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ArUS\">an asylum officer or immigration judge finds by a preponderance of the evidence:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b980-5\">(A) There has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant\u2019s life or freedom would not be threatened on account of any of the five grounds mentioned in this paragraph upon the applicant\u2019s removal to that country; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b980-6\">(B) The applicant could avoid a future threat to his or her life or freedom by relocating to another part of the proposed country of removal and, under all the circumstances, it would be reasonable to expect the applicant to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b980-7\">8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(l)(i); <em>see also Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (holding an alien that has shown a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of future persecution must establish that the persecution cannot be avoided by relocating within the country designated for removal).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-8\">Even assuming Louis\u2019s testimony was enough to establish past persecution based on her political opinion and created a re-buttable presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution, that presumption was rebutted because substantial evidence supported the BIA\u2019s conclusion there were fundamental changes in Haiti\u2019s political situation so that Louis\u2019s life or freedom would not be threatened. The BIA noted that President Aristide left Haiti in February 2004, and the Lavalas partisans implicated in abuses were behind bars. The 2006 Country Report and the articles attached to Louis\u2019s application supplement support these conclusions. Although the Lavalas candidate, Rene Pre-val, was elected president in 2006, the 2006 Country Report does not indicate a resurgence in politically motivated violence or disappearances. The 2006 Country Report did note the widespread kidnapping of citizens and the failure of the Haitian National Police (HNP) to prevent or respond to gang-related societal violence, but there was little indication that crime victims were targeted based on them political beliefs or that the HNP failed to enforce the law for political reasons. The 2006 Country Report mentions the provisional release, pending trial, of 28 Aristide officials and the continued detention of 4 others charged in the 2004 massacre of Aristide opponents. This indicates the Haitian government has taken steps to bring to justice Aristide supporters implicated in human rights abuses. The 2007 articles attached to Louis\u2019s brief before the BIA describe large demonstrations by Lavalas and the continued popularity of the party, but they do not mention any violence against Lavalas opponents. Additionally, two media reports attached to Louis\u2019s application supplement indicate that street gang violence is concentrated in the poorest urban areas, supporting the conclusion that Louis could avoid future threats by locating to a different part of the country. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(l)(i)(B). This conclusion is also supported by Louis\u2019s testimony that Lavalas members were less <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>active where her friend Tamara lived and that she was not bothered by Lavalas while she was there.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">Based on the foregoing, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion there were fundamental changes in Haiti\u2019s political situation so that Louis\u2019s life or freedom would not be threatened. Consequently, substantial evidence supported the BIA\u2019s finding that Louis is not eligible for asylum. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1230-31. Because Louis is not eligible for asylum, she is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal. <em>See Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1288 n. 4 (11th Cir.2005) (stating an applicant who fails qualify for asylum on the merits necessarily fails to qualify for withholding of removal). Accordingly, we deny Louis\u2019s petition for review.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b979-11\">. The BIA also denied Louis\u2019s application for relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT). Louis does not challenge the BIA\u2019s findings with regard to the CAT on appeal. Thus, any argument with regard to that finding is abandoned. <em>Djonda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1168, 1173-74 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b981-17\">. Louis argues for the first time on appeal that because she suffered severe past persecution, she should be granted asylum, implicitly arguing that asylum should be granted, despite improved country conditions, as permitted under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(l)(iii). Because Louis has failed to exhaust her administrative remedies with respect to this claim, however, this Court lacks jurisdiction to review it. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
