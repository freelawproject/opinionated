INA \u00a7 241(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b). The Board found that Zhuo\u2019s application for asylum was untimely and that Zhuo failed to prove that she suffered past persecution or a fear of future persecution. We deny Zhuo\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-28\">We review the decision of the Board to determine whether it is \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cTo reverse [those] fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003). We review the legal conclusions of the Board <em>de novo. Id. </em>at 1287 n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">Zhuo argues that she faces persecution because she criticized the local police department, but we lack jurisdiction to consider that argument. Zhuo did not present that argument to the Board. \u201c[AJbsent a cognizable excuse or exception, \u2018we lack jurisdiction to consider claims that have not been raised before the [Board].\u2019 \u201d <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Zhuo\u2019s remaining argument fails because substantial evidence supports the decision that Zhuo failed to prove a likelihood of persecution upon her return to China. \u201cTo establish a well-founded fear of future persecution, an applicant must \u2018present specific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that [she] ... will be singled out for persecution....\u2019\u201d <em>Mohammed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>547 F.3d 1340, 1345 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287). Zhuo failed to present any evidence that she will be persecuted when she returns to China other than her testimony about her subjective fears that she will be forcibly sterilized because she gave birth to three children in the United States. The record contains substantial evidence to the contrary. There is evidence that in Zhuo\u2019s home province there have been no forced sterilizations in the last ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">We DENY Zhuo\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
