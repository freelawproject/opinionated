For the reasons set forth below, we deny her petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-11\">In January 2005, immigration authorities served Saint-Clair with a notice to appear (\u201cNTA\u201d), alleging that she entered the United States on August 8, 2001, without being admitted or paroled. As a result, the NTA alleged that she was removable, pursuant to Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 212(a)(6)(A)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-13\">Saint-Clair then filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief that she had prepared back in April 2002. In her application, Saint-Clair stated that she had worked as a cosmetologist in a beauty salon in Port Au Prince, Haiti, until the time she left the country in August 2001. She also noted that one of her parents remained in Port Au Prince. She explained that she was seeking political asylum in the United States because supporters of the Lavalas political party tried to kill her on account of her political opinion. She explained the primary incident giving rise to her application as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKd\">I am seeking political asylum in the United States because I am scare[d] for my life, May 30th 2001 Those men came by night 3am kidnapped me, interrogated me, on my political opinion and about ... Convergence, my relation with U.S.A. I received all kind of bad treatment from them, they released me with pain continuously hard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-14\">She stated that she suffered continuous pain and that she feared that she would be tortured and killed if returned to Haiti.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-15\">At an initial hearing before an immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d), Saint-Clair admitted the allegations in the NTA and conceded to the charge of removal. Saint-Clair then filed an amended application. In this application, she added that she was married to a Haitian man who lived in Canada. She also gave the following description of the May 30, 2001, incident:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-16\">I am seeking Political Asylum because my life was in real danger in Haiti.... I used to speak with my clients in the Beauty Salon against the Government Lavalas and participated in demonstration as AntiLavalas. I have been reported by my own client since then, I received several phone calls threat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>en[ing] me because I am anti-Lavalas and th[at] I must be killed. On May 30, 2001 at 3:00 o\u2019clock in the morning; a group of Chimeres [Lavalas supporters] came at my house, they broke the entrance door, they beat me severely, I was kidnapped and transported away from my house I was interrogated regarding my political opinion, I was badly injured but after 35 minutes I have been released then in order to save my life, I left Haiti to come here on August 8, 2001.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">At the removal hearing, Saint-Clair testified on her own behalf as follows. She married a man in New York in January 2004, but she did not know his immigration status. In Haiti, she had worked as a hairdresser and beautician in a Port Au Prince \u201cstudio\u201d that had three other employees. She often used to express her political opinions to her clients in the studio and, because she expressed dissatisfaction with the governing Lavalas party, she was persecuted as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">Saint-Clair testified that she \u201cstarted receiving calls at [her] home because [of] the way [she] was talking.\u201d She testified that she \u201cdidn\u2019t know that they could become something serious\u201d at first and could not remember what month or year she received the calls. When asked how many calls she received, Saint-Clair testified that she \u201creceived a lot\u201d but could not \u201cremember exactly how many....\u201d Counsel then asked her to estimate whether she received more than 20 calls or more than 50 calls and, after the government objected that counsel was leading, Saint-Clair responded, \u201cYeah, I received more than 30 calls.\u201d She did not know whether it was the same person who called or whether there were different callers, she did not recognize the voices on the telephone, and she testified that they always said: \u201c[Y]ou talking, you badmouthing the president, we\u2019re going to come and get you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">With respect to the May 30, 2001 incident, Saint-Clair\u2019s entire testimony was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-8\">COUNSEL: Now other than the phone calls, what else did you mean by persecution?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-9\">SAINT-CLAIR: When I say that for instance in May, on May 30th, 2001, they came to my home. They entered my home and they came in at 3:00 in the morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-10\">COUNSEL: Okay, when you say they, who do you mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-11\">SAINT-CLAIR: Chimere Lavalas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-12\">COUNSEL: Okay, how many?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-13\">SAINT-CLAIR: I don\u2019t know exactly but they [broke in] and they came in, they [broke in]. They broke in the door.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-14\">COUNSEL: Okay, and ... how did they break the door?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-15\">SAINT-CLAIR: I don\u2019t know with what they did it, but they just came in, they broke in, they came in, they entered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-16\">COUNSEL: Now when you say they, I assume you mean more than one. How many did you see?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-17\">SAINT-CLAIR: No, they were, it was not just one, there were many. I don\u2019t know how many, but they were more than one. And when they broke in, they robbed me, they throw me on the floor, and they start beating me all over my body.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-18\">COUNSEL: Okay, what did they look like?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-19\">SAINT-CLAIR: They wore masks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-20\">COUNSEL: Masked with what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-21\">SAINT-CLAIR: You can, you could only see their eyes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-22\">COUNSEL: Okay, and what, what did the rest of them look like? What did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>the rest of their body look like? How were they clothed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-4\">SAINT-CLAIR: They were all wearing pants and shirts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-5\">COUNSEL: Okay, did they carry any weapons?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-6\">SAINT-CLAIR: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-7\">COUNSEL: Okay, what kind of weapons did they carry?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-8\">SAINT-CLAIR: I don\u2019t know anything about weapons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-9\">COUNSEL: Well, I\u2019m not asking you for the specifics of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-10\">SAINT-CLAIR: Different kind of weapons. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re talking about guns, if you\u2019re talking about machete[s].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-11\">COUNSEL: Yes, did you see any of those or all of them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-12\">SAINT-CLAIR: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-13\">COUNSEL: All right. Now you said that they threw you down and they did what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-14\">SAINT-CLAIR: And they start beating me when they throw me on the floor and they were saying that\u2019s the one who is badmouthing the president.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-15\">COUNSEL: All right, how many of them beat you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-16\">SAINT-CLAIR: How many of them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-17\">COUNSEL: How many of them, how many chimeres beat you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-18\">SAINT-CLAIR: There were many.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqbG\">Counsel then asked Saint-Clair how she knew that the men were Lavalas supporters, but before she was given the opportunity to answer the question, the IJ granted a five minute recess.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-19\">When the hearing reconvened, the IJ expressed concern over the fact that SainWClair did not know the immigration status of her husband. The IJ therefore questioned Saint-Clair about her marriage and, after learning that her husband might be a Canadian citizen, ultimately decided to continue the hearing so that the parties could explore that issue. The IJ clarified that he was not taking any action on the asylum application at that time. At a subsequent hearing, counsel for Saint-Clair informed the IJ that, regardless of however the Canadian issue was resolved, Saint-Clair wished to proceed on her asylum application.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-21\">At the next hearing, and after hearing legal argument from both parties, the IJ issued an oral decision denying Saint-Clair\u2019s application. After noting, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201cthere [wa]s little disagreement between the application for asylum and the respondent\u2019s testimony,\u201d the IJ concluded that Saint-Clair did not \u201cmeet those standards of proof necessary in order to make a case in which this Court may make a grant of asylum or any of its lesser remedies.... \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 48). First, the IJ found that she did not establish a nexus between any political activity and her alleged past persecution. The IJ next found that Saint-Clair did not have a well-founded fear of persecution, as she did not report her alleged persecution to the authorities in Haiti and, instead of attempting to relocate in Haiti, came directly to the United States. The IJ further found it evident that Saint-Clair did not demonstrate a countrywide fear of persecution, reiterated that she did not assert that she could not relocate to other cities in Haiti or even other neighborhoods in Port Au Prince, and highlighted that \u201cat least one family member ... remained in Port Au Prince.\u201d Returning to the previous issue of past persecution, the IJ found that he could not \u201cconclude that past persecution is present in this case in any respect,\u201d as the anonymous telephone threats and \u201ca single assault in [Saint-Clair\u2019s] home ... by nameless men who the applicant could not identify with any particular group\u201d did not rise to the level of persecution. Accordingly, the IJ denied Saint-Clair asy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>lum, withholding of removal, and relief under CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">The BIA dismissed Saint-Clair\u2019s appeal. The BIA \u201cagree[d] with the [IJ\u2019s] determination that respondent failed to establish a sufficient nexus between her attack in May 2001 and one of the protected grounds.\u201d Furthermore, the BIA also found that this \u201csingle incident\u201d did not rise to the level of persecution, as Saint-Clair was \u201cnot seriously harmed and did not seek out any medical treatment for her injuries.\u201d In addition, the BIA found that Saint-Clair \u201chas not demonstrated a well-founded fear that she will now be targeted throughout Haiti on account of a statutorily protected ground given the changed political climate in Haiti.\u201d Finally, with respect to her CAT claim, the BIA \u201caffirm[ed]\u201d the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Saint-Clair had not shown that it was \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that she would be tortured if returned to Haiti or that she would be harmed by, or with the acquiescence of, public officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cInsofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In this ease, because the BIA drew its own conclusions on the issue of past persecution and whether Saint-Clair had a well-founded fear of persecution, we review only the BIA\u2019s decision on those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">To the extent that the BIA\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, review is <em>de novo. Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247-48 (11th Cir.2001). Factual determinations, however, are reviewed under the \u201chighly deferential substantial evidence test,\u201d which requires this Court to \u201cview the record in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1026-27 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en banc). </em>We \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284 (quotation omitted). \u201cWe may not reweigh the evidence and may not reverse the BIA\u2019s findings of fact unless the record compels a contrary conclusion.\u201d <em>Arboleda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>434 F.3d 1220, 1222 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-10\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APd\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-11\">INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-13\">The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. \u201cTo establish asylum eligibility, the alien must, <em>ivith specific and credible evidence, </em>establish past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or a \u2018well-founded fear\u2019 that the statutorily listed factor will cause such future persecution.\u201d <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>1198, 1202 (11th Cir.2005) (emphasis added); see 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a)-(b). An applicant for asylum who has established past persecution on a protected ground is presumed to have a fear of future persecution on the basis of the original claim. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1). \u201cIf [s]he cannot show past persecution, then the petitioner must demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution that is both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1257 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Although the term is not defined by the INA, we have held that \u201cpersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and that mere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (quotations omitted). \u201cIn determining whether an alien has suffered past persecution, the IJ must consider the cumulative effects of the incidents.\u201d <em>Delgado v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 855, 861 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">In this case, the record does not compel the conclusion that SainNClair suffered past persecution because her descriptions of the threatening telephone calls and the May 30, 2001, incident lack the requisite detail and specificity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> With respect to the telephone calls, the description in her amended application provided only that the callers threatened to kill her because she was speaking out against the Lavalas party. In her testimony, Saint-Clair could not remember the month or even the year that she received the calls or whether there were multiple callers. In addition, she testified that she initially did not realize that the calls could develop into something serious. Finally, Saint-Clair vaguely testified that she received \u201ca lot\u201d of calls, and it was only after her attorney asked her a leading question \u2014 whether she received more than 20 or more than 50 calls \u2014 that she testified that she received more than 30 calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-11\">With respect to the May 30, 2001, incident, Saint-Clair stated in her original application only that unknown men kidnapped and interrogated her, she \u201creceived all kind[s] of bad treatment from them,\u201d and \u201cthey released [her] with pain continuously hard.\u201d In her amended application, Saint-Clair provided that Lava-las supporters broke into her house, \u201cbeat [her] severely,\u201d kidnapped and interrogated her, and \u201cbadly injured\u201d her. Saint-Clair\u2019s brief testimony about this incident was similarly lacking in detail. She was unable to estimate how many attackers there were, could not speculate on how they broke in to her house, did not offer any information on the duration of the beating or whether the men beat her with weapons or objects, did not elaborate on the alleged kidnaping and interrogation, and did not describe the extent of her injuries or whether she sought medical assistance. Although Saint-Clair testified that the men wore masks, when asked by counsel what clothing the men were wearing, she simply responded that they wore \u201cpants and shirts.\u201d And, although Saint-Clair ultimately testified that the men were armed with guns and machetes, she provided this testimony in response to leading questions by her attorney and after initially responding that she did not know anything about weapons. In sum, Saint-Clair\u2019s accounts of the threatening telephone calls and the May 30, 2001, inci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>dent are wholly lacking in the detail and specificity required to compel the conclusion that she suffered mistreatment rising to the level of persecution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Because Saint-Clair failed to establish that she suffered past persecution, it remained her burden to establish a well-founded fear of persecution if she were to return to Haiti. <em>Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1257. In her brief, Saint-Clair does not point to any evidence in the record on this point at all, let alone any evidence that would compel the conclusion that she had a well-founded fear of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">Instead, she quotes at length from our decision in Arboleda\u2022 and states in one sentence that \u201cthe Immigration Judge did not discuss whether relocation would be successful or reasonable\u201d under the factors in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(3). <em>See Arboleda, </em>434 F.3d at 1226-27 (reversing the BIA\u2019s conclusion that the government had met its burden to show that the petitioners could reasonably relocate because the BIA did not \u201cmention any of the other factors it should have considered [under the regulation] in making this determination\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">As an initial matter, Saint-Clair\u2019s argument fails because we are not reviewing the IJ\u2019s decision on this issue, since the BIA made its own, independent finding. In any event, this case is distinguishable from <em>Arboleda </em>because, unlike the petitioners in that case, Saint-Clair did not establish past persecution and, therefore, she had the burden to establish a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See Arboleda, </em>434 F.3d at 1224 (\u201cIn the instant case, as the government concedes, the BIA presumed past persecution and therefore the burden was on the government to show that internal relocation was reasonable.\u201d). Despite this burden, Saint-Clair does not even attempt to explain how consideration of the relocation factors would have demonstrated that she could not have reasonably relocated to Haiti. Thus, even if the agency failed to properly analyze the relocation factors, this error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-12\">In sum, Saint-Clair has not demonstrated that the record compels the conclusion that she suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of persecution. Thus, because Saint-Clair has failed to meet her burden of proof with respect to her claim for asylum, she has necessarily also failed to meet her burden of proof with respect to her claims for withholding of removal and relief under CAT. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1288 n. 4 (11th Cir.2005). Accordingly, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-13\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b790-7\">.
