Rivera-Barrera avers that he will be persecuted on account of his membership in social group consisting of young Guatemalan males targeted by gangs for recruitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-27\">We review the BIA\u2019s determination that an alien is not entitled to asylum or withholding of removal for substantial evidence and will not reverse the BIA\u2019s decision unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir.2006). To obtain asylum, an applicant must demonstrate \u201cpersecution or a well-founded fear of persecution\u201d on the basis of race, religion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 904 (5th Cir.2002) (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (2000)). The standard for obtaining withholding of removal is even higher, requiring a showing that it is more likely than not that the applicant\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened by persecution on one of those grounds. <em>Id. </em>at 906.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">The BIA did not err in determining that Rivera-Barrera failed to demonstrate that he was a member of a particular social group entitled to protection. His contention that as a young Guatemalan male, he is a member of a social group targeted by gangs for recruitment is overly broad and does not establish a meaningful basis for distinguishing him from other people. <em>See Perez-Molina v. Gonzales, </em>193 Fed.Appx. 313, 314 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Sanchez-Trujillo v. INS, </em>801 F.2d 1571, 1576-77 (9th Cir.1986). Accordingly, there is substantial evidence to support the BIA\u2019s denial of asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 339, 344 (5th Cir .2005)</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b401-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
