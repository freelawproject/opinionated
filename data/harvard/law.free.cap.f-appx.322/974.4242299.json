On appeal, Bur-ress, <em>pro se, </em>argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for a sentence reduction because it erroneously found that over 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine were attributed to him at sentencing, when, in fact, he only was held responsible for 1.5 kilograms. The government concedes this error and asserts that the case should be remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-15\">\u201cIn a proceeding to modify a sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), [this Court] reviewfs] <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment \u201cin the case of a defendant who [was] sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-16\">The parties agree, and the record demonstrates, that the district court erred in finding Burress ineligible for a sentence reduction because it erroneously determined that he was held responsible for over 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine, although the original sentencing transcript demonstrates that he was held responsible only for at least 1.5 kilograms of crack cocaine. Based on that amount of crack cocaine, Amendment 706 lowered his offense level from 38 to 36 and, correspondingly, lowered his guideline range, rendering him eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. Thus, we vacate the district court\u2019s denial order and remand this case for the district court to exercise its discretion in determining whether to grant Burress a sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-18\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
