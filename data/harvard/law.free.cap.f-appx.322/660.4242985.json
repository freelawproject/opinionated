Dr. Sharon Johnston was convicted for illegally dispensing: Oxyco-done (the generic name for Roxicodone) and Alprazolam (the generic name for Xa-nax) (Count 1); Oxycodone (Count 2); A-prazolam and Methadone (Count 3); and Oxycodone (Count 4) in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(C).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She was sentenced to 30 months\u2019 imprisonment on each count, to run concurrently. She now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">Johnston was an osteopathic physician, specializing in neurology, working in Naples, Florida. In 2007, a medical malpractice investigator with the State of Florida Department of Health received information that Johnston may have been unlawfully proscribing narcotics. She transmitted this information to Amber Baginski, a detective with the Naples Police Department that was assigned to the Drug Enforcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d) as a task force officer. The DEA instituted an investigation and sent three undercover detectives into Johnston\u2019s office posing as patients. They were all instructed not to bring any medical files, prescription bottles, or \u201cshow proof that they had had any kind of medical exam or had been given any prescriptions.\u201d On the basis of the evidence gained from these visits, Johnston was indicted and tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">The three undercover detectives testified at trial. The substance of their testimony was as follows: Mark Schaible, posing as Marcus Damm, visited Johnston\u2019s office on June 11, 2007.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Schaible complained of back pain, told Johnston that he was injured while exercising at the gym, and that he had pain radiating down his leg. Schaible told Johnston that he worked in Daytona, but when Johnston commented on the long distance her traveled to see her, Schaible stated that he was staying with his mother in nearby Fort Myers. Johnston told Schaible that he had a \u201cherniated disk back there that\u2019s causing all the pain\u201d and that \u201c[sjooner or later\u201d he would need an MRI, but she did not immediately recommend that he get one done. Schaible testified that certain statements that he made to Johnston were intended to act as \u201cred flags,\u201d including: (1) he was previously a patient of Dr. Pizarro, who was under indictment for soliciting sex in exchange for narcotics; and (2) he had been \u201cbumming\u201d medications from his friends. Johnston tested Schai-ble\u2019s reflexes, had him extend his arms and touch his fingertips, and checked his blood pressure. Johnston only looked at Schai-ble\u2019s back when discussing his tattoos. She did not otherwise touch his back, perform any other tests, or recommend an x-ray.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-12\">Schaible informed Johnston he was taking four to five Roxicodone tablets per day. Johnston replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know how much you\u2019re getting, or where you\u2019re getting it from. Which is fine.\u201d Schaible also told Johnston that he was taking two to three 1-milligram tablets of Xanax per day, which Johnston noted was a lot. Johnston commented that Schaible\u2019s blood pressure was low, attributing this to the fact that he was probably \u201cnice and mellow\u201d from the Roxicodone and Xanax. Schaible also commented, \u201cI always kind of wondered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>why you can go into a store and buy a gallon of vodka and a carton of cigarettes, you can have a good time, but you can\u2019t take a pain pill.\u201d Schaible paid cash for the cost of his visit and left Johnston\u2019s office with prescriptions for 150 15-milli-gram tablets of Roxicodone and 90 1-milli-gram tablets of Xanax.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Schaible had a follow-up appointment scheduled for July 9, but \u201cto throw up another red flag\u201d he called three weeks after his first appointment, claiming that he ran out of his medication, even though the prescription should have lasted longer. The appointment was moved to July 5. At this visit, Schaible complained that his pain was too high, that the Roxicodone was not working, and that he had been receiving 40-milligram Methadone wafers from his friend. Johnston acknowledged that Methadone is \u201cpretty powerful stuff\u2019 and \u201creal hard core,\u201d and that moving from 15 to 40-milligrams is \u201cquite a jump.\u201d Schai-ble explained that he took Methadone as often as six times per day, but that he only bought twenty pills off of his friend because \u201che needs to make some money too.\u201d Johnston did not examine Schaible at all during the visit and wrote him a prescription for 150 40-milligram Methadone wafers and refilled his Xanax prescription.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Amber Baginski, who posed as Amber Needles, was the second patient in the investigation. She testified that on June 27, 2007, she arrived at Johnston\u2019s office and noticed that several patients in the waiting room appeared to be high. Bagin-ski was taken to an examination room, where she met Johnston.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She told Johnston that she had been a patient of Dr. Pizarro and that, due to general back pain, she had been taking 15-milligram Roxico-done tablets.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Johnston asked whether Baginski had fallen or been in an accident, and when Baginski said no, Johnston responded that most patients tell her the pain resulted from one of these incidents. Johnston checked Baginski\u2019s reflexes, blood pressure, and had her touch her fingertips, but did not examine Baginski\u2019s back or perform any other tests. As Bag-inski held out her hands, Johnston asked, \u201cDoesn\u2019t the pain radiate down your legs?\u201d Baginski believed Johnston was \u201ctelling me what I needed to say in order to obtain the pain medication.\u201d When Baginski confirmed that the pain radiated, Johnston gave her a prescription for 90 15-milli-gram tablets of Roxicodone. According to Baginski, the entire examination lasted less than five minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">Donald McDougall, who posed as Donald Nieczticz, was the final patient in the investigation. On July 10, 2007, he visited Johnston\u2019s office, where he explained to Johnston that he had experienced pain in the past, but was not currently suffering any pain.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Johnston asked if McDougall had an MRI and he told her that although he had, it did not reveal anything. McDougall told Johnston that he had a doctor near his home in the Florida Keys and that he was currently taking 20-milli-gram Oxycontin tablets, to which Johnston replied, \u201cyou can\u2019t take that. You\u2019re overmedicated.\u201d Nonetheless, Johnston did not follow-up about the distance McDou-gall traveled to see her, the name of his regular physician, or when he last had his prescription filled. As with the other patients, Johnston tested McDougall\u2019s reflex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>es, checked his blood pressure, and had him hold out his arms and touch his fingertips, but did no further examinations. McDougall testified that most of the fifteen-minute examination was spent discussing fishing and real estate. At the close of the visit, Johnston prescribed 90 30-milligram tablets of Roxicodone, 90 100-milligram Neurontin, and 60 pills of Flexeril.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">Johnston\u2019s office manager testified that Johnston used pre-printed examination forms to save time; Johnston would then cross out whatever information was incorrect after she examined the patient. About 99 percent of Johnston\u2019s pain management patients received controlled substance prescriptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">The government called two expert witnesses: Dr. Richard Hood and Dr. Sherri Pinsley. Hood testified as to the high strength of the drugs prescribed by Johnston and their many potentially dangerous and deadly side effects, especially when taken together or with alcohol. He testified that a doctor should not increase from a low dose of Roxicodone to a high dose of Methadone based solely on a patients\u2019 claims that Methadone is more effective for him than Roxicodone. Instead, a doctor could confirm what drugs a patient was using by urinalysis, obtaining medical records, or obtaining past prescription bottles. Hood also explained that a patient illegally buying prescription drugs is a \u201cred flag ... [for] diversion and addiction.\u201d Finally, Hood testified that normally if a patient complains of back pain, a doctor should palpate the back to see if it elicits muscle spasms or tenderness.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Pinsley testified that in her pain management practice, an initial patient visit would include a head-to-toe examination, including range of motion exercises and palpating the vertebras of the spine. Pins-ley testified that she would only treat a patient after obtaining the patient\u2019s medical records and, if the patient had not undergone any tests, she would require an MRI or x-ray be conducted.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Pinsley said that controlled substances are always her last resort and, before prescribing controlled substances, she requires patients to take a toxicology test so that she can confirm whether they are taking any medication. She testified that Johnston\u2019s patient files were sparse, that her exams were limited, and that she was concerned that Johnston prompted patients to give certain answers about pain. She noted that she was troubled by the red flags raised by the undercover agents, including traveling a long distance to see Johnston, lack of previous medical records or tests, buying medications illegally, and requesting more medications too quickly. In her opinion, Johnston prescribed stronger medications than appropriate and acted outside the scope of professional practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-11\">Johnston\u2019s case included testimony by her own expert, Dr. Thomas Romano. Romano was of the opinion that Johnston\u2019s conduct was professional and consistent with standards of professional care in the United States. Romano explained that there is no objective test for pain and that a doctor has to listen to a patient\u2019s report of pain and rely on her own judgment in determining whether the patient is reliable. Romano acknowledged that some of the statements made by the detectives could be red flags, but noted that there could be legitimate explanations for each that would not have prevented a doctor from treating a patient. Romano opined that Johnston acted in good faith in pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>scribing the medications to the three patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">The jury ultimately convicted Johnston of all charges. Johnston appeals to this court, arguing that the district court erred by: (1) applying a national, rather than state-specific, standard of care; (2) admitting prejudicial \u201cred flags\u201d evidence and permitting the government\u2019s experts to testify to legal conclusions based on the red flags; and (3) denying Johnston\u2019s motion for acquittal on the ground that the government did not prove that Johnston acted with the requisite <em>mens rea.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">\n<em>A. National standard of care</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">A doctor may not be convicted under the CSA for issuing prescriptions to patients unless the doctor failed to act in good faith and for a legitimate medical purpose. <em>United States v. Merrill, </em>513 F.3d 1293, 1301-02 (11th Cir.2008). Johnston acknowledges this standard, but argues that the district court erred by instructing the jury that it should apply a national standard of care in determining whether Johnston failed to act in furtherance of a legitimate medical purpose. Specifically, Johnston takes issue with the district court\u2019s instruction that, \u201ca physician\u2019s mere subjective personal belief that she is meeting a person\u2019s medical needs by prescribing a controlled substance is not sufficient to show good faith if the physician acts outside the <em>accepted standard of medical practice in the United States </em>\u201d (emphasis added). Johnston argues that under <em>Gonzales v. Oregon, </em>546 U.S. 243, 126 S.Ct. 904, 163 L.Ed.2d 748 (2006), state medical standards should be used to determine whether a doctor acted in conformance with accepted medical standards for the purposes of the CSA. Johnston argues that by faffing to instruct the jury that Florida\u2019s standard of care governs, the district court committed reversible error. Moreover, Johnston argues that this error is jurisdictional and therefore should be review <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b691-13\">Where a party properly objects to the jury instructions, we review the legal correctness of a district court\u2019s jury instruction <em>de novo </em>and issues of phrasing for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Prather, </em>205 F.3d 1265, 1270 (11th Cir.2000). Ordinarily, if the complaining party fails to object, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Schlei, </em>122 F.3d 944, 973 (11th Cir.1997). A party waives the ability to contest the propriety of the instructions, however, if the party invites the error by requesting the substance of the instructions that she later seeks to challenge on appeal. <em>United States v. Stone, </em>139 F.3d 822, 838 (11th Cir.1998). \u201cWhere invited error exists, it precludes a court from invoking the plain error rule and reversing.\u201d <em>United States v. Silvestri, </em>409 F.3d 1311, 1327 (11th Cir.2005) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-14\">In this case, not only did Johnston fail to object to the district court\u2019s imposition of a national standard of care, but she invited the alleged error by requesting that the court charge the jury that in order to convict they must find that she \u201cacted outside the course/scope of professional practice, not in accordance with a standard of medical practice <em>generally recognized and acted in the United States </em>\u201d (emphasis added). Furthermore, Johnston\u2019s proposed jury instructions included charging the jury on the section of the Florida Administrative Code that addresses the state\u2019s standards for the use of controlled substances for the treatment of pain, but Johnston affirmatively withdrew this instruction at the charge conference.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>We are also unpersuaded by Johnston\u2019s argument that the alleged error in the jury instructions is jurisdictional. \u201cA jurisdictional defect is one that [strip[s] the court of its power to act and ma[kes] its judgment void.\u2019 \u201d <em>McCoy v. United States, </em>266 F.3d 1245, 1249 (11th Cir.2001) (citation omitted). An indictment suffers from a jurisdictional defect when it charges no crime at all, i.e. a non-offense. <em>United States v. Peter, </em>310 F.3d 709, 714-15 (11th Cir.2002) No such situation exists here because the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to a valid indictment charging Johnston with crimes under the CSA. Because the alleged error is not jurisdictional, we conclude that invited error doctrine precludes review of the jury instruction that applied a national standard of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">\n<em>B. Red flags evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Johnston argues that the district court erred by permitting the witnesses to testify about \u201cred flag\u201d profiling evidence and that admitting such evidence prejudiced the jury. Johnston alleges that \u201cred flags\u201d is a government-created standard for identifying drug abuse that has not been accepted by the medical community, and therefore is not relevant to the medical standard of care.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Additionally, Johnston contends that the testimony about red flags was inadmissible under Daubert<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and the Federal Rules of Evidence because the government failed to establish that the testimony was reliable or relevant. Finally, Johnston argues that the district court improperly permitted experts to use the red flag testimony to reach legal, rather than medical, conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">Johnston did not object to the admissibility of red flag testimony or the experts\u2019 conclusions that they reached based on the red flags. Where a party fails to raise an evidentiary objection, we review only for plain error. <em>United States v. Turner, </em>474 F.3d 1265, 1275 (11th Cir.2007). To demonstrate plain error, Johnston \u201cmust show that: (1) an error occurred; (2) the error was plain; (3) it affected [her] substantial rights; and (4) it seriously affected the fairness of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Gresham, </em>325 F.3d 1262, 1265 (11th Cir.2003). An error is not plain unless it is contrary to precedent directly resolving a legal issue. <em>United States v. Lejarde-Rada, </em>319 F.3d 1288, 1291 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">We conclude that Johnston has failed to show that the district court committed plain error by admitting the testimony. The Supreme Court has held that an officer does not have reasonable suspicion that someone is engaged in criminal conduct solely on the basis that he fits a profile. <em>Reid v. Georgia, </em>448 U.S. 438, 440, 100 S.Ct. 2752, 65 L.Ed.2d 890 (1980) (per curiam) (discussing \u201cthe so-called \u2018drug courier profile\u2019 \u201d). This court does not permit the admission of evidence indicating that a defendant fit a particular criminal profile because such evidence is \u201cinherently prejudicial because of the potential [it has] for including innocent citizens.\u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez-Cuartas, </em>717 F.2d 552, 555 (11th Cir.1983). The instant case, however, is distinguishable. First, the red flag statements were used to create a profile about the <em>patient, </em>not Johnston. These statements were intend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>ed to give Johnston reason to believe that Schaible was an addict or was selling his medications. The red flags were introduced to show that Johnston failed to meet the required standard of care in dealing with her patients; not to show that Johnston somehow fit a specific criminal profile. Second, unlike in <em>Reid, </em>Johnston was not identified as a suspect because she fit a certain criminal profile. Instead, she was already a suspect prior to Schaible\u2019s red flag statements. There was therefore no danger that an innocent person would be swept up in the investigation simply because she fit a certain profile.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">We further conclude that the experts\u2019 testimony about the red flags was properly admitted pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. (\u201cRule\u201d) 702. Under Rule 702, \u201c[i]f scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert ... may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 702. In <em>Daubert, </em>the Supreme Court established a two-part test under Rule 702 for the admissibility of expert testimony: a trial judge must determine \u201cwhether the expert is proposing to testify to (1) scientific knowledge that (2) will assist the trier of fact to understand or determine a fact in issue.\u201d 509 U.S. at 592, 113 S.Ct. 2786. Some factors that should be considered in exercising this gate-keeping function include \u201c(1) whether the expert\u2019s theory can be and has been tested; (2) whether the theory has been subjected to peer review and publication; (3) the known or potential rate of error of the particular scientific technique; and (4) whether the technique is generally accepted in the scientific community.\u201d <em>United States v. Douglas, </em>489 F.3d 1117, 1124-25 (11th Cir.2007). \u201cThe same criteria that are used to assess the reliability of a scientific opinion may be used to evaluate the reliability of nonscientific, experience-based testimony.\u201d <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>387 F.3d 1244, 1262 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en banc) </em>(quoting <em>Kumho Tire Co., Ltd. v. Carmichael, </em>526 U.S. 137, 152, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 143 L.Ed.2d 238 (1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-10\">Johnston does not challenge the qualifications of the experts, but rather argues that \u201cred flags\u201d are not generally accepted scientific evidence of drug-dealing and addiction. We note, however, that neither the government nor witnesses treated \u201cred flags\u201d as a term of art. The witnesses\u2019 testimony treated \u201cred flags\u201d as synonymous with \u201cwarning signs.\u201d The doctors testified that in light of the strange statements made by Johnston\u2019s patients, had they confronted similar statements in their own practices, they would have sought further information from the patients before prescribing narcotics. They did not treat \u201cred flags\u201d as a medical standard and therefore Johnston\u2019s argument that this evidence is inadmissible under <em>Daubert </em>fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-11\">We also reject Johnston\u2019s argument that the experts improperly testified to legal conclusions. Although experts may not testify to legal conclusions, \u201ctestimony in the form of an opinion or inference otherwise admissible is not objectionable because it embraces an ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of \u2019fact.\u201d Fed. R.Evid. 704(a). Pinsley testified as to the appropriate standard of care in the medical field and gave her opinion that the prescriptions \u201cwere written without any legitimate medical purpose.\u201d Criminal knowledge and intent are issues of fact, not law. <em>See United States v. Greenfield, </em>554 F.2d 179, 183 (5th Cir.1977)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (\u201c[D]e-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>fendant strenuously asserted that the prescriptions ... were for a legitimate medical purpose and within the course of his professional practice. Necessarily, the issue of criminal intent or guilty knowledge was a factual issue for the jury to resolve.\u201d)\u2022 Pinsley\u2019s testimony was therefore appropriate. In fact, Johnston questioned her own expert about whether he believed Johnston \u201cacted in good faith in prescribing the substances\u201d and \u201centered into ... a legitimate therapeutic physician/patient relationship\u201d with each undercover officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">We therefore conclude that the district court did not plainly err by admitting the red flag evidence and permitting the experts to give opinions based in part on such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">\n<em>C. Mens rea</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Johnston finally argues that the government did not establish that she acted with bad intent. She contends that the government\u2019s only evidence of <em>mens rea </em>came from her failure to react to the detectives\u2019 red flags.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">We review the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal based on sufficiency of the evidence <em>de novo, </em>drawing all inferences in the government\u2019s favor. <em>United States v. Bowman, </em>302 F.3d 1228, 1237 (11th Cir.2002).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> To convict under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841, the government must prove that the physician knowingly or intentionally dispensed controlled substances and that she did so other than for a legitimate medical purpose and in the usual course of her professional practice. <em>United States v. Rosen, </em>582 F.2d 1032, 1033 (5th Cir.1978). Knowledge can be proven through \u201cinfer-enees based upon surrounding circumstances.\u201d <em>United States v. Vera, </em>701 F.2d 1349, 1358 (11th Cir.1983); <em>see also United States v. Woodard, </em>531 F.3d 1352, 1360 (11th Cir.2008) (explaining that the elements can be shown by direct or circumstantial evidence). The credibility of a witness is for the jury to determine. <em>United States v. Parrado, </em>911 F.2d 1567, 1571 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-10\">We conclude that there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could adduce that Johnston dispensed the medication for reasons other than legitimate medical purposes. The jury heard several suspicious statements that Schaible made to Johnston, including that he was illegally purchasing medication off of friends, that he ran out of medication earlier than he should have, and insinuations that he might also be selling his medication. The jury also heard Baginski\u2019s testimony that she believed that Johnston was prompting her with what to say in order to obtain pain medication. The government\u2019s experts testified that Johnston\u2019s notes were very sparse, that her examinations were unreasonably brief, that she should have physically examined patients, conducted medical tests, and obtained medical records, and that she gave unreasonably strong prescriptions to the patients. Pins-ley expressed her opinion that the prescriptions were written outside the scope of medical practice and for no legitimate medical purpose. The jury also heard Johnston\u2019s expert\u2019s contrary opinion, but was free to choose among reasonable constructions of the evidence. <em>See United States v. Alvarez-Sanchez, </em>774 F.2d 1036, 1039 (11th Cir.1985). The district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>therefore did not err in denying the motion for a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">III.

Pinsley testified that she would sometimes give prescriptions that were of limited quantity and dosage until she could obtain the records or get tests done.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b691-9\">. At trial, Johnston's attorney also questioned Romano about his opinion as to whether Johnston's treatment \"was consistent with accepted professional standards of care in the United Stales.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b692-6\">. Johnston did not raise this argument before the district court and submits it for the first time in her brief.

The government argues that Johnston did not preserve this issue for appeal. We disagree. Johnston moved for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the government's case and at the close of the evidence, arguing that \"the evidence is insufficient as a matter of law.\u201d Although general motions such as this are typically disfavored, we nonetheless conclude that because intent is an essential element of the crime, the issue of <em>mens rea </em>was adequately preserved for appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
