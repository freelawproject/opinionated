(\u201cRule\u201d) 35(b) sentence reduction. The district court rejected Morales\u2019s argument that the government breached the plea agreement and concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to review the government\u2019s decision not to file a Rule 35(b) motion. After a thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">I.BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">Morales pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. The written plea agreement contained the following provision regarding Morales\u2019s cooperation with the government:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-7\">If in the sole and unreviewable judgment of this Office the defendant\u2019s cooperation is of such a quality and significance to the investigation or prosecution of other criminal matters as to warrant the court\u2019s downward departure ... this Office may at or before sentencing make a motion consistent with the intent of Section 5K1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines prior to sentencing, or Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure subsequent to sentencing, reflecting that the defendant has provided substantial assistance and recommending that the defendant\u2019s sentence be reduced. The defendant acknowledges and agrees, however, that nothing in this Agreement may be construed to require this Office to file any such motions and that this Office\u2019s assessment of the nature, value, truthfulness, completeness, and accuracy of the defendant\u2019s cooperation shall be binding insofar as the appropriateness of this Office\u2019s filing of any such motion is concerned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) identified Morales\u2019s guideline sentencing range as 70-87 months\u2019 incarceration. The district court ultimately sentenced Morales to 70 months\u2019 imprisonment. The government did not file a motion for a reduction based on substantial assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-10\">Morales filed a <em>pro se </em>motion in district court requesting the court to compel the government to honor its agreement by filing a Rule 35(b) motion based on his testimony against a co-defendant, as well as other substantial assistance. This was denied, as was a later motion for a reduction of his sentence or downward departure. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-11\">II.STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b740-12\">We construe briefs filed by <em>pro se </em>litigants liberally. <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998). We review <em>de novo </em>whether the government has breached a plea agreement. <em>United States v. Mahique, </em>150 F.3d 1330, 1332 (11th Cir.1998). We also review <em>de novo </em>whether the government <em>can </em>be compelled to file a substantial assistance motion. <em>See United States v. Forney, </em>9 F.3d 1492, 1498 (11th Cir.1993). We review the district court\u2019s denial of an evidentiary hearing for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Gay, </em>251 F.3d 950, 951 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-13\">III.DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b740-14\">A court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence where the government moves for such a reduction under Rule 35(b) based on the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance in investigating or prosecuting another person. Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. Morales argues that he is entitled to a reduction in his sentence because he agreed to testify against his co-defendant and provided additional infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>mation to the government. Morales contends that because the government did not make such a motion, it breached the plea agreement and that he is now entitled to specific performance of the agreement. He also argues that the district court violated his Fifth and Eighth Amendment rights by not compelling the government to move for a Rule 35(b) sentence reduction and that the district court abused its discretion by declining to grant an eviden-tiary hearing as to whether Morales was entitled to a Rule 35(b) sentence reduction. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Although the government has the discretion to determine whether to file a Rule 35(b) motion, in <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992), the Supreme Court held that \u201cfederal district courts have authority to review a prosecutor\u2019s refusal to file a substantial-assistance motion and to grant a remedy if they find that the refusal was based on an unconstitutional motive ... say, because of the defendant\u2019s race or religion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Because Morales has not proven that the government acted with an unconstitutional motive in declining to move for a sentence reduction, the district court lacked jurisdiction to compel the government to make a Rule 35(b) motion. Morales seeks to satisfy the \u201cunconstitutional motive\u201d element by arguing that by refusing to file the motion, the district court violated Morales\u2019s due process rights and infringed on his liberty rights, in violation of the Fifth and Eighth Amendments. This argument is unavailing for two reasons. First, it treats the refusal to file the motion as the cause of a constitutional violation, whereas the Supreme Court requires that, in order to obtain relief, the government\u2019s refusal to file the motion must be \u201cbased on an unconstitutional motive.\u201d Second, <em>Wade </em>is limited to the types of impermissible prosecutorial motives described by the Supreme Court, namely those based on, \u201crace, religion or other arbitrary classification.\u201d <em>Forney, </em>9 F.3d at 1501 n. 4 (citing <em>Wade, </em>504 U.S. at 186, 112 S.Ct. 1840); <em>see United States v. McNeese, </em>547 F.3d 1307, 1309 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201cThe government\u2019s desire to retain some control over McNeese\u2019s sentence is not of the same ilk as those unconstitutional motives described by the Supreme Court, namely the defendant\u2019s race or religion.\u201d). Morales does not assert that the government declined to make a Rule 35(b) motion based on one of the unconstitutional motives described by the Court in <em>Wade. </em>We therefore conclude that the district court lacked the authority to compel the government to make a Rule 35(b) motion based on Morales\u2019s alleged substantial assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">Next, the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to conduct an evidentiary hearing as to whether the government violated Morales\u2019s rights in refusing to file the Rule 35(b) motion. A defendant is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing simply because he alleges that he \u201cprovided substantial assistance or [ ] makes only generalized allegations of an improper motive.\u201d <em>United States v. Dorsey, </em>554 F.3d 958, 961 (11th Cir.2009). It is only where there is an \u201can allegation <em>and </em>a substantial showing\u201d of an unconstitutional prosecutorial motive that an evi-dentiary hearing is appropriate. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Forney, </em>9 F.3d at 1502) (emphasis in original). Because we conclude that Morales has not made a substantial showing that the government declined to file a Rule 35(b) motion because of an unconstitutional motive, the district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to grant an eviden-tiary hearing on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">Finally, we conclude that the government did not breach the plea agreement by declining to move for a Rule 35(b) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>sentence reduction. The plea agreement specifically stated the government would file a Rule 35(b) motion if, in its \u201csole and unreviewable judgment,\u201d it determined that such a motion was warranted. This court has held that such language precludes courts \u201cfrom intruding into prosecu-torial discretion.\u201d <em>Forney, </em>9 F.3d at 1501. The plea agreement at issue in Morales\u2019s case did not obligate the government to file a Rule 35(b) motion, therefore the government did not breach the agreement by declining to seek a reduction of Morales\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-3\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"AFV\">For the reasons stated, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"Aah8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
