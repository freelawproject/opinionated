We do not have jurisdiction to review Enax\u2019s appeal from the district court\u2019s 24 August 2007 order. As to Enax\u2019s appeal of the 13 September 2007 and 9 October 2007 orders, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Enax\u2019s motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-12\">Enax filed in May 2007 a <em>pro se </em>complaint against Defendant Goldsmith, an Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) revenue officer, and Defendant Budde, an IRS group manager, in their individual capacities. Enax alleged civil-rights violations related to an IRS levy on his Social Security disability benefits. Filing the complaint under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, Enax contended that Defendants were members of a \u201csecret society\u201d that stole \u201cby stealth and fraud\u201d money from his Social Security benefits, thereby \u201creducing [Mr. Enax] to a condition of involuntary servitude.\u201d The district court dismissed the complaint without prejudice for failure to state a claim because Enax did not allege that Defendants were state actors, a necessary element of a section 1983 claim. The court permitted Enax to file an amended complaint on or before 13 July 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-14\">Enax timely filed an amended complaint, but it did not comply with a local rule that requires an amended pleading to be filed in its entirety. The district court dismissed the complaint without prejudice and allowed Enax to file an amended complaint that conformed with local rules by 10 August 2007. Enax did not file an amended complaint within the allotted time. Two weeks later, on 24 August 2007, the district court dismissed the case for lack of prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-15\">On 12 September 2007, Enax filed a Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) (\u201cRule 60(b)\u201d) motion to vacate the district court\u2019s order of dismissal based on \u201cclerical error.\u201d The court denied the motion the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-16\">On 2 October 2007, Enax filed a second motion, this time to vacate the district court\u2019s 13 September order denying the original motion to vacate. Because Enax offered no legal basis for the motion, the district court denied the motion on 9 October 2007. Enax filed a notice of appeal on 24 October 2007, seeking review of the district court\u2019s 24 August dismissal order and its 13 September and 9 October orders denying Enax\u2019s motions to vacate.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-17\">We review for an abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 60(b) motion. <em>Burke v. Smith, </em>252 F.3d 1260, 1263 (11th Cir.2001). First, we examine Enax\u2019s appeal from the district court\u2019s 24 August <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>order. Then, we will review Enax\u2019s appeal from the 13 September and 9 October orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">A petitioner\u2019s notice of appeal must be filed within the time limits set forth in Fed. R.App. P. 4(a). Compliance with the requirements for filing timely a notice of appeal is both \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Coleman v. Thompson, </em>501 U.S. 722, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 2565, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991). We do not have jurisdiction to hear Enax\u2019s appeal from the 24 August order under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A) or Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the latest, Enax\u2019s notice of appeal must have been filed by 23 October 2007 to be timely. Because Enax did not file a notice of appeal until 24 October 2007, it was untimely; and we do not have jurisdiction to review it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">We may, however, review Enax\u2019s appeals from the 13 September and 9 October district court orders denying his Rule 60(b) motions. Relief under Rule 60(b) is an \u201cextraordinary remedy which may be invoked only upon a showing of exceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>Crapp v. City of Miami Beach, </em>242 F.3d 1017, 1020 (11th Cir.2001) (internal citation omitted). Because \u201can appeal from a denial of a Rule 60(b) motion cannot serve as a substitute for an appeal of the underlying order,\u201d we review only the district court\u2019s refusal to reinstate Enax\u2019s case: not the merits of Enax\u2019s case or the district court\u2019s underlying decision to dismiss it. <em>Carter ex rel. Carter v. United States, </em>780 F.2d 925, 927 (11th Cir.1986) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">Here, Enax appeals impermissibly the merits of the complaint dismissed by the district court. He presents no legitimate reason why the district court should have reinstated his suit under Rule 60(b) due to clerical error or for any other eligible ground for relief. The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Enax\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion in its 13 September and 9 October orders. Accordingly, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-9\">DISMISS IN PART, AFFIRM IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b861-7\">. A sixty-day appeal period applies here. Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B). <em>See Wallace v. Chappell, </em>637 F.2d 1345, 1348 (9th Cir.1981) (en banc) (sixty-day filing period for Rule 4(a) applies to alleged grievance arising from government activity if \u201cdefendant officers were acting under color of office\u201d or if \"any party in the case is represented by a government attorney\u201d). <em>See also Williams v. Collins, </em>728 F.2d 721, 724 (5th Cir.1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b861-21\">. Because Enax's Rule 60(b) motion was filed on 12 September 2007, more than ten business days after entry of the 24 August 2007 order of dismissal, it did not toll the period for filing a timely notice of appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(A)(vi).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
