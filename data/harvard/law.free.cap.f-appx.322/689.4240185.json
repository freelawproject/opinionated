Because we find that Selensky\u2019s claims are barred by the Eleventh Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-15\">Selensky\u2019s present suit names the State of Alabama as the sole defendant. The Eleventh Amendment prohibits suits in federal courts against a state, except where such immunity is waived by the state or abrogated by Congress. U.S. Const, amend. XI; <em>see Manders v. Lee, </em>338 F.3d 1304, 1308 (11th Cir.2003). The State of Alabama has not agreed to be sued under the circumstances present here. The Aabama State Constitution provides \u201c[t]hat the State of Alabama shall never be made a defendant in any court of law or equity.\u201d Ala. Const. Art. I, \u00a7 14; <em>see also Alabama v. Pugh, </em>438 U.S. 781, 782, 98 S.Ct. 3057, 57 L.Ed.2d 1114 (1978). Selensky has presented no evidence that Congress abrogated Alabama\u2019s Eleventh Amendment immunity over her present claims. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of this action.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b715-16\">. We may affirm the district court's judgment on any ground that appears in the record, <em>see Thomas </em>v. <em>Cooper Lighting, Inc., </em>506 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir.2007); we note, however, that the magistrate judge recommended dismissal for the reasons later adopted by the district court as well as on grounds of Eleventh Amendment immunity.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
