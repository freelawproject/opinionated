Previously, Jiles was found guilty of: (1) possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1); (2) use of a firearm in a drug trafficking crime, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1); and (3) two counts of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-11\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on a subsequent change in the sentencing guidelines, for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-12\">Amendment 706 allows courts to modify a term of imprisonment, under 18 \u00a7 3582(c)(2), for offenses involving crack cocaine, by reducing the offense level by two levels. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c); <em>see also United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1325 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009). However, if the original sentence was ultimately based on something other than the drug quantity, Amendment 706 may not have had an effect on the sentencing range and, if so, the defendant will not be eligible to be considered for a sentence reduction. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-15\">Once eligibility is established, in deciding whether to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the district court first must determine what sentence it would have imposed, had the amended guideline range been in effect at the time of sentencing; and then, in light of this finding, it must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to determine whether or not to reduce the defendant\u2019s original sentence. <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 760 (11th Cir.1998). Although this two \u2014 step analysis is required, a court is not required to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b709-16\">Here, we conclude from the record that the district court did not err in denying Jiles\u2019s request for a sentence reduction. First, Jiles\u2019s sentence for the use of a firearm in a drug trafficking crime resulted from the statutory mandatory minimum term in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1), not any guideline provision. Second, his convictions for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon were not affected by Amendment 706. Finally, the decision to group his conviction for possession of cocaine base with his conviction for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon meant that the base offense level was determined by his possession of a firearm, and not his possession of crack cocaine. Therefore, Amendment 706 did not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>the effect of lowering Jiles\u2019s offense level and, consequently, the district court did not have authority to reduce his sentence. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying the motion to reduce sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
