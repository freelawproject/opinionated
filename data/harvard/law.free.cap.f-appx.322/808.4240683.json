As for the second issue, the record reveals that appellant moved the court for leave to file a second amended complaint on August 3, 2008. His motion was styled: \u201cMotion to Reconsider Order Dismissing the Amended Complaint with prejudice or in the alternative Motion to Further Amend the Complaint.\u201d The court denied these alternative motions on October 14, 2008. Appellant\u2019s notice of appeal only appealed the district court\u2019s \u201cOrder of July 24, 2008 granting Defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss.\u201d Because the notice did not appeal the October 14 order, that order is not before us; hence, we do not consider whether the court abused its discretion in denying further leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
