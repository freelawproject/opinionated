Palmer argues that he was entitled to \u00a7 3582 relief, despite the fact that he was sentenced as a career offender. After careful review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b965-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>In a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), and <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009). \u201cOnce it is established that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582 applies, a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a sentence reduction is reviewed only for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 n. 1 (11th Cir.2008). Where the issue presented involves a legal interpretation, however, review is <em>de novo. United States v. Pringle, </em>350 F.3d 1172, 1178 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-7\">Although a district court generally cannot modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed, an exception lies in \u00a7 3582(c)(2), where:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-8\">in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o), upon motion of the defendant or the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or on its own motion, the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) ] to the extent that they are applicable, <em>if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b965-9\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (emphasis added). A reduction of a term of imprisonment is not \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission\u201d \u2014 and is, therefore, not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u2014 if the retroactive amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-12\">Effective November 1, 2007, Amendment 706 adjusted downward by two levels the base offense level assigned to each threshold quantity of crack cocaine listed in the Drug Quantity Table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, amend. 706 (2007). Amendment 706, as amended by Amendment 713, is retroactively applicable and, therefore, may be the basis for a \u00a7 3582 motion. U.S.S.G.App. C, amends. 706, 713 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-13\">Although the retroactive effect of Amendment 706 allows a defendant whose guideline imprisonment range was determined in accordance with the offense level calculations under \u00a7 2D1.1 to seek a reduction in his sentence, a defendant whose original sentence ultimately was based on something other than the offense level calculation under \u00a7 2D 1.1 is precluded from receiving a sentence reduction because the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the applicable guideline range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). Therefore, a defendant sentenced as a career offender pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 is not entitled to \u00a7 3582 relief because Amendments 706 and 713 did not lower the applicable guideline range for career offenders. <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-14\">Just as in <em>Moore, </em>the record here shows that Palmer\u2019s sentencing range was determined by application of the career offender guideline in \u00a7 4B1.1, and the crack cocaine base offense level played no ultimate role in his sentence. Thus, Palmer was not sentenced under the otherwise applicable base offense level in \u00a7 2D1.1, and he was ineligible for \u00a7 3582 relief under Amendment 706.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore, the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>properly denied the \u00a7 3582 motion, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b964-14\">. The Government's \"Motion for Summary Affirmance, and, In Case This Motion is Denied, Motion for Treatment of This [Motion] as The Brief for The United States,\u201d is DE<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>NIED AS MOOT in part, as to the request that we summarily affirm, and GRANTED in part, as to the request that we treat the motion as the brief for the Government.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b965-15\">. Furthermore, Palmer's reliance on <em>United States v. Poindexter, </em>550 F.Supp.2d 578 (E.D.Pa.2008), is unavailing because that case is not binding, and we are required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>follow our own precedent in <em>Moore. See United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir.2008) (stating, in the direct appeal context, that we are bound to follow our own precedent unless it is overruled <em>en banc </em>or by the Supreme Court). And in any event, <em>Poin-dexter </em>is distinguishable. Palmer was sentenced pursuant to the career offender guideline section, even though he received a downward departure for substantial assistance, unlike the defendant in <em>Poindexter, </em>who received \u00a7 3582 relief because his guideline range was based on \u00a7 2D 1.1, given that the original sentencing court determined that he should not have been sentenced as a career offender and assigned the base offense level applicable absent the career offender designation. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1329-30 (discussing <em>Poindexter); Poindexter, </em>550 F.Supp.2d at 580-81.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
