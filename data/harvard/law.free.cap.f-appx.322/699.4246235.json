Gentile\u2019s motion sought vacatur of the district court\u2019s underlying order granting the government\u2019s petition for approval of a levy on Gentile\u2019s primary residence, pursuant to Internal Revenue Code (\u201cI.R.C.\u201d) \u00a7 6334(e)(1). For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-16\">The government filed a petition for judicial approval of a levy upon Gentile\u2019s primary residence, pursuant to \u00a7 6334(e)(1), for the purposes of collecting $144,551.76 in unpaid federal taxes from 2000 and 2001. Section 6334 governs what assets are exempt from levies for tax collection purposes. Pursuant to \u00a7 6334(e)(1), \u201ca principal residence shall not be exempt from levy if a judge or magistrate of a district court of the United States approves (in writing) the levy of such residence.\u201d The government attached the declaration of Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) officer Daniel Haber. Haber declared that (1) he had reviewed applicable IRS records and determined that Gentile owed $144,551.76; (2) the IRS gave Gentile notice, and demanded payment, of the liability, but Gentile failed to pay; (3) the IRS had attempted to satisfy the liability from assets besides Gentile\u2019s private residence, but had found that no reasonable alternative existed; and (4) the IRS generally had followed the requirements of applicable law and relevant administrative procedures. Gentile filed a motion to dismiss the government\u2019s petition for failure to state a claim, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), on the ground that the government had not established the essential elements of unpaid federal income tax liabilities because the taxes demanded were an unconstitutional direct tax on his earnings. The district court held a hearing and received exhibits. Gentile objected to the exhibits on the ground that they did not demonstrate that the taxes demanded were constitutional. On February 15, 2008, the district court entered an order granting the government\u2019s petition for approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>Three months later, on May 16, 2008, Gentile filed the instant motion to vacate, pursuant to Rule 60(b)(4), on the ground that the order was void because the district court had acted inconsistently with due process of law. Gentile asserted that the demanded taxes were unconstitutional. The government responded that this Court had long ago dismissed arguments such as Gentile\u2019s that were based on the unconstitutionality of the federal income tax. On June 16, 2008, the district court denied Gentile\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion to vacate. On July 31, 2008, Gentile filed a notice of appeal (\u201cNOA\u201d) from this denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">As an initial matter, the scope of our review is limited to the district court\u2019s denial of Gentile\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion to vacate. Gentile filed his NOA more than 60 days after the district court\u2019s entry of the February 15, 2008 order granting the government\u2019s petition for approval. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(a)(1)(B) (\u201cWhen the United States or its officer or agency is a party, [an NOA] may be filed by any party within 60 days after the judgment or order appealed from is entered.\u201d) Gentile\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion to vacate, moreover, did not toll the time for filing the NOA because the Rule 60(b) motion was filed more than 10 days after the district court granted the government\u2019s petition for approval on February 15, 2008. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(a)(4)(A)(vi) (instructing that a Rule 60 motion that is filed no later than ten days after the judgment is entered tolls the running of the 60-day time for filing an NOA). Therefore, the instant appeal is untimely as to the underlying order granting the petition for approval. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 4(a)(1)(B). Moreover, review of the denial of Gentile\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion to vacate does not give us authority to review the grant of the government\u2019s petition for approval. <em>See Am. Bankers Ins. Co. of Florida v. Northwestern Nat\u2019l Ins. Co., </em>198 F.3d 1332, 1338 (11th Cir.1999) (holding that appeal from a denial of a Rule 60(b) motion to vacate is \u201cnarrow in scope\u201d and must address only the propriety of denying the Rule 60(b) motion to vacate and not the underlying judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 60(b)(4) motion to vacate on the ground of voidness. <em>Burke v. Smith, </em>252 F.3d 1260, 1263 (11th Cir.2001). Pursuant to Rule 60(b), the district court \u201cmay relieve a party or its legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding\u201d if, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthe judgment is void.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(4). \u201cGenerally, a judgment is void under Rule 60(b)(4) if the court that rendered it lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter, or of the parties, or if it acted in a manner inconsistent with due process of law.\u201d <em>Burke, </em>252 F.3d at 1263 (internal quotation marks omitted). We have held that \u201cRule 60(b) may not be used to challenge mistakes of law which could have been raised on direct appeal.\u201d <em>Am. Bankers Ins. Co. of Florida, </em>198 F.3d at 1338. As to subject matter jurisdiction, \u201ca plaintiff who invokes the jurisdiction of a federal court bears the burden of showing (1) an injury in fact, meaning an injury that is concrete and particularized, and actual or imminent, (2) a causal connection between the injury and the causal conduct, and (3) a likelihood that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.\u201d <em>KH Outdoor, L.L.C. v. Clay County, Fla., </em>482 F.3d 1299, 1303 (11th Cir.2007). As to due process, the Due Process Clause generally requires notice and an opportunity to be heard. <em>Mullane v. Cent. Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>339 U.S. 306, 313-14, 70 S.Ct. 652, 657, 94 L.Ed. 865 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">The district court did not err in denying Gentile\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion to vacate on the ground of voidness. <em>See Burke, </em>252 F.3d at 1263. Gentile argues that the grant of the government\u2019s petition for approval was void because (1) the district court denied him due process by failing to consider his arguments on the constitutionality of the demanded taxes, (2) the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the government had failed to establish an actual injury, and (3) the demanded taxes were unconstitutional. First, the district court did not violate Gentile\u2019s due process rights. Haber in his declaration stated that the IRS gave Gentile notice of the intended levy, and the record demonstrates that the district court held a hearing on the matter. Gentile has not challenged this evidence. Thus, Gentile received notice and an opportunity to be heard. <em>See Mullane, </em>339 U.S. at 313-14, 70 S.Ct. at 657. Gentile repeatedly argued, in his Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss and in objecting to the government\u2019s exhibits, that the taxes demanded were unconstitutional direct taxes on his earnings. Although he argues as much, Gentle has not demonstrated that the district court did not take into account these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Also, the available record demonstrates that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction. Haber stated that he had reviewed applicable IRS records and determined that Gentile owed $144,551.76. Thus, the government showed that it suffered an actual injury, and the district court had subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See KH Outdoor, L.L.C., </em>482 F.3d at 1303. Although he argues that the government\u2019s showing was insufficient because it did not cite specific tax code provisions or explain how the assessments constituted indirect taxes in assessing his tax liabilities, Gentile has not presented evidence that the government\u2019s notice of tax liabilities did not include this information or how the absence of such information establishes that the government did not suffer an injury in fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">Finally, Gentile\u2019s arguments regarding the constitutionality of the demanded taxes were not properly brought in his Rule 60(b) motion to vacate, as they should have been made on direct appeal. <em>See Am. Bankers Ins. Co. of Florida, </em>198 F.3d at 1338. Thus, we need not consider these arguments. Accordingly, because Gentile has not demonstrated that he did not receive due process or the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
