On appeal, Townsley argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress. Specifically, he argues that the district court applied a presumption in favor of the government\u2019s witnesses and summarily discounted his own testimony without making proper credibility findings. Townsley also argues that the district court erred in sentencing him under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1), because his three prior Florida convictions for unlawfully carrying a concealed weapon, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 790.01(2), did not constitute \u201cviolent felonies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-10\">\u201cA district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress presents a mixed question of law and fact.\u201d <em>United States v. Zapata, </em>180 F.3d 1237, 1240 (11th Cir.1999). We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>Id. </em>All facts are construed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below. <em>United States v. Bervaldi, </em>226 F.3d 1256, 1262 (11th Cir.2000). The district court\u2019s application of the law to the facts is reviewed <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b864-13\">Townsley relies primarily on our decision in <em>Gallego v. United States, </em>174 F.3d 1196 (11th Cir.1999). In that case, Galle-go, a federal prisoner, brought an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion alleging that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Id. </em>1196-1197. He argued that his attorney had failed to inform him that he had a constitutional right to testify at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 1197. After hearing conflicting testimony from Gallego and his attorney, the magistrate-and later the district court-ruled against Gallego because he had not provided any additional evidence to support his motion. <em>Id. </em>at 1198. The magistrate did not make any findings as to the credibility of Gallego\u2019s testimony. <em>Id. </em>We vacated and remanded the lower court\u2019s findings, holding that a court may not adopt a <em>per se </em>rule against a defendant in a case involving conflicting testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 1198-1199. Instead, a court must weigh the credibility of the parties\u2019 testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 1198.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-14\">The facts of this case are distinguishable from those of <em>Gallego. </em>In this case, the district court explicitly found that the government\u2019s witnesses had testified credibly. Also, unlike the magistrate judge in <em>Gallego, </em>the district court did not automatically discount all of Townsley\u2019s testimony. The court believed Townsley\u2019s testimony that the officers had been making statements to him prior to giving him his <em>Miranda </em>warnings. The court simply concluded that these statements did not constitute \u201cinterrogation,\u201d and, thus, there had been no violation of <em>Miranda.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b865-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>Because the district court here properly analyzed the testimony and the credibility of the witnesses at the suppression hearing, and because the evidence supported its finding of probable cause, it did not clearly err in denying Townsley\u2019s motion to suppress. Because Townsley\u2019s only challenge to his convictions is his suppression argument, and because we reject that challenge, his convictions are due to be affirmed. We turn next to Townsley\u2019s challenge to his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s determination that a defendant\u2019s prior convictions constitute \u201cviolent felonies\u201d under the ACCA. <em>United States v. Bennett, </em>472 F.3d 825, 831 (11th Cir.2006). The ACCA provides that a defendant is subject to an enhanced 15-year mandatory minimum sentence if the defendant has been convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), and the defendant has at least three prior convictions for a \u201cviolent felony\u201d or a \u201cserious drug offense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">The ACCA defines the term \u201cviolent felony\u201d as \u201cany crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\u201d that \u201c(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or (ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B). The term \u201cserious drug offense\u201d is defined as any state or federal drug offense with a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A). The Sentencing Guidelines provide for an enhanced guideline range for defendants who fall under the ACCA. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">Florida law makes it a felony for a person to carry a concealed firearm without a license to do so. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 790.01(2)(2008). In <em>United States v. Hall, </em>77 F.3d 398, 401-402 (11th Cir.1996), we held that violations of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 790.01(2) were \u201cviolent felonies\u201d under the ACCA. Later, relying on our analysis in <em>Hall, </em>we also held that violations of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 790.01(2) were \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d under the career offender guideline, \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>United States v. Gilbert, </em>138 F.3d 1371, 1372 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-10\">Recently, in <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), the Supreme Court established a new standard for determining whether a prior conviction is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA. The Court interpreted the list of enumerated crimes in the first clause of \u00a7 924(e) (2) (B) (ii) as having a limiting effect on the second clause of \u00a7 924(e) (2) (B) (ii). <em>Id. </em>at 1584-1585. The Court concluded that the second clause did not cover all crimes that involved a \u201cserious potential risk of physical injury to another,\u201d but only those crimes that were \u201croughly similar, in kind as well as in degree of risk posed\u201d to burglary, arson, extortion, or crimes involving the use of explosives. <em>Id. </em>at 1585. The Court also noted that all of these enumerated crimes \u201ctypically involve purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1586 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-13\">In <em>United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347 (11th Cir.2008). We applied the <em>Be-gay </em>analysis to Florida\u2019s concealed weapons statute. Archer was originally sentenced as a career offender based in part on a previous conviction under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 790.01(2). <em>Archer, </em>531 F.3d at 1349. We initially affirmed Archer\u2019s sentence based on our prior. precedent in <em>GilbeH, </em>but the Supreme Court granted certiorari, vacated our decision, and remanded the case for further consideration in light of its decision in <em>Begay. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b865-14\">On remand, we concluded that <em>Begay </em>had effectively abrogated <em>Gilbert. Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>1852. Although <em>Begay </em>involved the definition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA, whereas <em>Gilbert </em>and <em>Archer </em>involved the definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the career offender guideline, we noted that these two definitions were virtually identical. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, the <em>Begay </em>test applied to both the ACCA and \u00a7 4B1.2. <em>Id. </em>Applying the <em>Begay </em>analysis, we held that violations of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 790.01(2) were not \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d under the career offender guideline. <em>Id. </em>We noted that Fla. Stat. \u00a7 790.01(2) only punishes possession, and therefore does not involve the same sort of aggressive, violent, or purposeful conduct as the other felonies listed in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B). <em>Id. </em>at 1351. Also, we noted that an individual can obtain a license to carry a concealed weapon in Florida, which indicates that violations of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 790.01(2) are not as serious as the crimes of burglary, arson, or extortion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">In this case, the district court found that Townsley was an armed career criminal based in part on his three previous convictions for carrying a concealed firearm, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 790.01(2). In light of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Archer, </em>the district court erred in counting these convictions as violent felonies. Accordingly, we vacate Townsley\u2019s sentences and remand this case for resentencing. Because we are vacating Townsley\u2019s sentences, we need not address his argument that his present total sentence is unreasonable. <em>Cf. United States v. McVay, </em>447 F.3d 1348, 1356 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">Accordingly, Townsley\u2019s convictions are AFFIRMED, but his sentences are VACATED AND REMANDED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b864-11\">.
