Although the district court reduced Cantrell\u2019s sentence for his crack cocaine conviction under Amendment 706<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to the sentencing guidelines, it denied his request to reduce his sentence below the amended guidelines range under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">In this case, Cantrell\u2019s original offense level was 27 and his criminal history category was VI, giving him a guidelines range of 130 to 162 months. The district court imposed a 144-month sentence. After Amendment 706 became retroactive, Cantrell\u2019s offense level dropped to 25; and his guidelines range became 110 to 137 months. In resentencing Cantrell under section 3582(c)(2), the district court noted that it had considered Cantrell\u2019s file, the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and the provisions and commentary of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10. The court determined that, because Cantrell\u2019s original sentence fell in the middle of the applicable guidelines range, his amended sentence also should; and the court imposed a sentence of 120 months. The court rejected Cantrell\u2019s argument that it had authority to impose a below-guidelines sentence, and noted that, even if the court could, it would impose the same sentence because the sentence was \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d given the circumstances of Cantrell\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-11\">On appeal, Cantrell challenges the district court\u2019s determination that it lacked authority under section 3582(c)(2) to reduce his sentence below the amended guidelines range. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the scope of its authority under section 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-12\">In <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>we concluded that <em>Booker </em>and Kimbrough<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> do not apply to section 3582(c)(2) proceedings; a district court is bound by the limitations imposed on its discretion by section 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statements by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(U.S. Feb. 10, 2009) (No. 08-8664). Thus, the district court recognized correctly that it lacked authority to sentence Cantrell below the amended guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-13\">Cantrell also argues that his ultimate sentence is unreasonable both proeedurally and substantively. \u201cOnce it is established that [section] 3582 applies, a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a sem tence reduction is reviewed only for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 n. 1 (11th Cir.2008).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-14\">A \u201cdistrict court must make two distinct determinations before deciding whether to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence under\u201d section 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Vautier, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>144 F.3d 756, 760 (11th Cir.1998). First, the court must determine the sentence it would have imposed, given the defendant\u2019s amended guidelines range and holding constant all other guidelines determinations made at the original sentencing hearing. <em>Id. </em>Then, the court must consider the factors in section 3553(a) and determine, in its discretion, whether to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>Id. </em>The court need not present particular findings on each section 3553(a) factor as long as the court clearly considered the factors and set forth adequate reasons for its sentence. See <em>United States v. Brown, </em>104 F.3d 1254, 1255-56 (11th Cir.1997) (in the context of a section 3582(c)(2) denial).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">Here, the district court abused no discretion in reducing Cantrell\u2019s sentence. The court followed the appropriate section 3582(c)(2) procedures by substituting Cantrell\u2019s amended guidelines range for his original range, considering the section 3553(a) factors and Cantrell\u2019s file, and explaining that a sentence reduction to 120 months was \u201creasonable and just,\u201d given the circumstances of the case. Cantrell\u2019s argument is meritless that the court erred by not expressly considering all of the section 3553(a) factors; the court explained adequately that it had considered the factors in the context of Cantrell\u2019s case, and it was not required to discuss each factor. <em>See id.; United States v. Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.1997) (\u201ca district court commits no reversible error by failing to articulate specifically the applicability \u2014 if any \u2014 of each of the section 3553(a) factors, as long as the record demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">We also conclude that the sentence imposed was reasonable. Cantrell received a sentence in the middle of the amended guidelines range. The court considered Cantrell\u2019s arguments and determined that a sentence within this range was appropriate. Other than his <em>Booker </em>arguments, Cantrell pointed only to his post-sentence rehabilitation in support of a lower sentence; he did not otherwise explain how the section 3553(a) factors warranted a lower sentence. That he may have rehabilitated himself does not show that the sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b812-8\">.
