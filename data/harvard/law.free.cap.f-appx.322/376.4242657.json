We have jurisdiction to review the denial of a continuance in an immigration proceeding. <em>Ahmed v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 433, 437 (5th Cir.2006). \u201cWhen, as here, the BIA affirms the immigration judge and relies on the reasons set forth in the immigration judge\u2019s decision, this court reviews the decision of the immigration judge as well as the decision of the BIA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The grant of a motion to continue lies within the sound discretion of the Immigration Judge, who may grant the motion for good cause shown. <em>Masih v. Mukasey, </em>536 F.3d 370, 373 (5th Cir.2008); <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.29. Zafar failed to show good cause. The three previous I-130 petitions filed by Zafar\u2019s wife were denied. Zafar has made no showing that the pending fourth 1-130 petition would be adjudicated any differently than the prior three petitions. Zafar\u2019s marriage is not entitled to a presumption of legitimacy because the marriage occurred after Zafar was placed in exclusion proceedings. <em>See Matter of Arthur, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 475, 479 (BIA 1992). Further, the case has been continued numerous times for over two years. Thus, the BIA did not abuse its discretion by affirming the Immigration Judge\u2019s denial of the motion for continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-11\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b403-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
