On appeal, Mitchell argues that the district court erred in denying his Rule 35(b) motion to reduce sentence because, although only the government may file a Rule 35 motion, he was merely trying to inform the court that he never received the benefit of the government\u2019s motion for downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s decision that it lacks authority to reduce a sentence under Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b). <em>United States v. Orozco, </em>160 F.3d 1309, 1312-13 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">Rule 35(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that the district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence to reflect substantial assistance provided by the defendant to the government after sentencing only \u201c[u]pon the government\u2019s motion.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b)(1). As the language of the rule indicates, the district court may only reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to Rule 35(b) upon the government\u2019s motion. <em>United States v. Howard, </em>902 F.2d 894, 897 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">Generally, the government has the power, but not the duty, to file a motion to reduce sentence when a defendant has substantially assisted. <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992) (analyzing substantial assistance motions under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e)). Thus, a district court only may review the government\u2019s refusal to file a substantial assistance motion if the defendant makes a showing that the refusal was based upon an unconstitutional motive, such as his race or religion. <em>Id. </em>at 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">The district court did not err in finding that it lacked authority to grant Mitchell\u2019s Rule 35(b) motion to reduce sentence. Because the government never filed a Rule 35(b) motion, the district court properly concluded that it lacked the authority to reduce Mitchell\u2019s sentence. In addition, the government\u2019s failure to file such a motion was not subject to review because Mitchell did not make any showing that the government\u2019s decision in that regard was based on an unconstitutional motive.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b942-9\">Accordingly, Mitchell\u2019s arguments are without merit and we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying his Rule 35(b) motion to reduce sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b942-7\">. We also note that, contrary to Mitchell's assertion, he received the benefit of the government's U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 motion when the district court granted the motion, reduced his offense level one level, from 37 to 36, and, correspondingly, reduced his sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
