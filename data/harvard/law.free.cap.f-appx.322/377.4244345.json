Aquino-Perez argues that the 57-month sentence was greater than necessary to comply with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and was unreasonable. He argues that the district court did not adequately explain and justify the sentence in terms of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and did not consider and address his arguments for a below-the-guideline range sentence. He also argues that the presumption of reasonableness should not apply to the guideline sentence calculated using U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 because \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically grounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-13\">Aquino-Perez argues that the question of whether a district court complied with the explanation requirement found in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1) should be reviewed de novo even if the defendant does not object below. He concedes that, under this court\u2019s precedent, plain error review applies if a defendant does not object in the district court to procedural error; he raises this issue to preserve for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-14\">Aquino-Perez did not argue in the district court that the district court failed to adequately explain the sentence or that \u00a7 2L1.2 should not be given deference because it is not \u201cempirically based.\u201d Therefore, plain error review applies. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied,</em>-\u2014U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008). To show plain error, the appellant must show an error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>United States v. Baker, </em>538 F.3d 324, 332 (5th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied</em>,\u2014U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 962, 173 L.Ed.2d 153 (2009). If the appellant makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b404-19\">Aquino-Perez did argue in the district court that the sentence was greater than necessary to satisfy the factors in \u00a7 3553(a). Therefore, review of the substantive reasonableness of the sentence is under the abuse of discretion standard. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-20\">The district court considered Aquino-Perez\u2019s request and arguments in support of a sentence below the applicable guideline range, stated that it had considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and ultimately determined that a sentence at the bottom of that range was appropriate. Aquino-Perez\u2019s within-guidelines sentence is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness. <em>See Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 338. Because the district court imposed a sentence within the advisory guideline range, little explanation was required. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005). Aquino-Perez has not shown that the district court made any procedural errors in calculating the guideline sentence, failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, or failed to provide adequate reasons for the sentence. He has not shown that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically based or that his sentence is excessive. In <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), the Court said nothing concerning the applicability of the presumption of reasonableness. Moreover, the appellate presumption\u2019s continued applicability to \u00a7 2L1.2 sentences is supported by our decision in <em>Campos-Maldonado. </em>Therefore, Aquino-Perez has not shown plain error. <em>See Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 339. He has also failed to show that the sentence was greater than necessary to satisfy the factors in \u00a7 3553(a). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b404-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
