On appeal, Craig argues that the district court clearly erred in applying a two-level specific offense characteristic under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) for possessing a firearm. He maintains that weapons recovered from his residence \u201cwere older, garden variety, firearms\u201d and that it was clearly improbable that the weapons were connected to the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-15\">We review \u201cthe district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo\u201d </em>and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Hall, </em>46 F.3d 62, 63 (11th Cir.1995). The offense level for a drug offense is increased by two levels if \u201ca dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). \u201cThe adjustment [for possessing a weapon] should be applied if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment, (n.3). \u201cOnce the prosecution has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the firearm was present at the site of the charged conduct, the evidentiary burden shifts to the defendant to show that a connection between the firearm and the offense is clearly improbable.\u201d <em>Hall, </em>46 F.3d at 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-16\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no error. The evidence at trial established that the firearms were present at Craig\u2019s residence, where he received large quantities of cocaine on numerous occasions. Because Craig failed to show that a connection between the weapons and the offense was clearly improbable, the district court did not clearly err in applying the two-level specific offense characteristic under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
