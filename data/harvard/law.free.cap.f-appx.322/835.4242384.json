Clemmons appeals the district court\u2019s order granting his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582 motion for a sentence reduction based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, but denying his request for a downward variance. On appeal, Clem-mons argues that the district court erred in finding that a 110-month sentence, at the low end of the amended guideline range, was reasonable in his case. He argues that he should have received a downward variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-15\">We review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002). Section 3582(c)(2) gives federal courts the authority to consider reducing the sentence \u201cof a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d We have held that a district court must follow a two-step process in ruling on a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). First, the district court must recalculate the defendant\u2019s sentencing range based on the relevant amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>None of the other guideline determinations made during the original sentencing are changed. <em>Id. </em>Second, the court must decide whether to retain the original sentence or to resentence the defendant based on the amended guideline range. <em>Id. </em>at 781. In making this decision, the district court must consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id. </em>These factors include, among other things: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense, and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for deterrence; (3) the need to protect the public from crimes committed by the defendant, and (4) the advisory guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-16\">The Sentencing Guidelines contain a policy statement that instructs the district court not to reduce a sentence below the new guideline range: \u201cthe court shall not reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guidelines range determined under [\u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l) ].\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>We have previously held that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), by itself, does not give a court the authority to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220-1221 (11th Cir.2005). Similarly, we have held that <em>Booker </em>did not apply in a case where Amendment 706 did not lower the defendant\u2019s guideline range. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir.2008). Finally, this court has recently held that <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>do not preclude Congress and the Sentencing Commission from limiting a district court\u2019s discretion in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) resentencing via \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A). <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.2009). Therefore, the district court did not err when it refused to grant Clem-mons\u2019 request for a sentence lower than the advisory guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b863-16\">.
