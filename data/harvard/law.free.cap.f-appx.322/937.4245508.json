Kimbro moved to reduce his sentence based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-24\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). - Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We have held that, \u201c[w]here a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-25\">Kimbro argues that, under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court should have treated the Guidelines as advisory and considered whether he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>was entitled to a reduced sentence in the light of the statutory factors for sentencing, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), but that argument is foreclosed by precedent. <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1191-93 (11th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220-21 (11th Cir.2005). Because Amendment 706 did not have the effect of lowering Kimbro\u2019s guideline range, he was ineligible for a sentence reduction. <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330. The district court did not err in denying Kim-bro\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
