Blythe was convicted of drug offenses involving crack cocaine, and he filed his motion pursuant to Amendment 706 to the sentencing guidelines, which lowered the base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine. On appeal, Blythe argues the sentencing court violated his right to due process of law by finding him responsible for the amount of cocaine attributed to the conspiracy as a whole when that amount was not reasonably foreseeable to him. Accordingly, Blythe claims the district court erred in denying his \u00a7 3582 motion based on such an amount, and requests resentencing to ascertain the correct amount of drugs for which he should be held responsible. Blythe also argues that once a \u00a7 3582 motion is properly before the district court, <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), requires the sentencing guidelines be re-applied as advisory, rather than mandatory. We review each issue in turn, and affirm Blythe\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-13\">A district court may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed except where expressly permitted by statute or by Fed.R.Crim.P. 35. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B). One statutory exception to this general rule is relief under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-14\">[I]n the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o), upon motion of the defendant or the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or on its own motion, the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-15\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on a subsequent change in the sentencing guidelines, for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.\\003). However, in the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) context, \u201cwe review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002). We also review <em>\u201cde novo </em>questions of statutory interpretation.\u201d <em>United States v. Maupin, </em>520 F.3d 1304, 1306 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>A \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce sentence does not provide the basis for <em>de novo </em>resentencing. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(3); <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005). Accordingly, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not \u201cgrant to the court jurisdiction to consider extraneous resentencing issues.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 782 (11th Cir.2000). A district court should leave intact its previous factual decisions from the sentencing hearing, including drug quantity calculations, when deciding whether to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582. <em>See United States v. Cothran, </em>106 F.3d 1560, 1563 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Additionally, a reduction in the term of imprisonment is not consistent with the guidelines policy statement, and therefore not authorized by \u00a7 3582(c)(2), if \u201c[a]n amendment listed in subsection (c) does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B); <em>see also United States v. Armstrong, </em>347 F.3d 905, 909 (11th Cir.2003) (stating only retroactively applicable amendments \u201cthat have the effect of lowering the sentencing range upon which a sentence was based, may be considered for reduction of a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">On November 1, 2007, the Sentencing Commission promulgated Amendment 706, which amended the Drug Quantity Table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 706. The effect of Amendment 706 is to provide a two-level reduction in base offense levels for certain crack-cocaine offenses. <em>See id. </em>The Commission made this amendment retroactively applicable, effective as of March 3, 2008. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G., App. C, Amend. 713. However, Amendment 706 did not lower base offense levels for offenses involving greater than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G., App. C, Amend. 706; <em>see also United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">Blythe\u2019s argument that he should not be held responsible for the sentencing court\u2019s drug quantity finding fails because the district court was not required to reexamine the sentencing court\u2019s drug quantity determination in considering his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Cothran, </em>106 F.3d at 1563. Accordingly, the district court did not err in finding Blythe was responsible for over 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine based on the prior drug quantity finding to that effect at sentencing. Moreover, because Blythe was responsible for over 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine, Amendment 706 did not change his applicable offense level under amended U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G., App. C., Amend. 706. Thus, because the amendment did not lower Blythe\u2019s guidelines range, the district court acted within its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3582 motion. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B); <em>see also Armstrong, </em>347 F.3d at 909.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-10\">As noted above, we review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority. <em>White, </em>305 F.3d at 1267. Under <em>Booker, </em>a district court must calculate the guidelines range and consult the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to determine a reasonable sentence at a defendant\u2019s original sentencing hearing. <em>See United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). However, also as noted above, the district court may not conduct a <em>de novo </em>resentencing based on a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(3); <em>Moreno, </em>421 F.3d at 1220. More specifically, <em>Booker </em>cannot serve as a basis for a \u00a7 3582 sentence reduction where Amendment 706 does not apply because of the high quantity of crack cocaine involved in the offense of conviction. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number><em>Jones, </em>548 F.3d at 1368-69. Accordingly, the district court did not err in declining to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 factors, in light of <em>Booker, </em>as a basis for reducing Blythe\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because Blythe was ineligible for relief under Amendment 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
