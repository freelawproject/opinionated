On appeal, Blango argues that: (1) the jury returned a compromised verdict by finding him not guilty of the first two bank robberies, but guilty of the second two robberies, and the verdict thus showed that insufficient evidence existed to establish his guilt; and (2) the mandatory minimum sentence he received conflicted with the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-9\">\u201cSufficiency of the evidence is a question of law reviewed <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Martinez, </em>83 F.3d 371, 373-74 (11th Cir.1996). Normally, we review de novo the legality of a criminal sentence. <em>United States v. Castaing-Sosa, </em>530 F.3d 1358, 1360 n. 3 (11th Cir.2008). However, we review for plain error when, as here, a party appeals an issue to which it did not object in the district court. <em>United States v. Walther, </em>867 F.2d 1334, 1343 (11th Cir.1989). Plain error requires a defendant to show: (1) an error; (2) that is plain; (3) affects substantial rights; and (4) seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 631, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-11\">First, we find no merit in Blango\u2019s claim that there was insufficient evidence to sustain Blango\u2019s convictions. The evidence is sufficient to sustain a conviction if \u201cany rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Mint-mire, </em>507 F.3d 1273, 1289 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation and emphasis omitted). We view \u201cthe evidence in the light most favorable to the Government and ... [draw] all reasonable inferences and credibility assessments in the Government\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, a conviction must be upheld unless the jury could not have found the defendant guilty under any reasonable construction of the evidence. <em>United States v. Chastain, </em>198 F.3d 1338, 1351 (11th Cir.1999). The credibility of witnesses is the exclusive province of the jury. <em>Id. </em>Testimony is incredible as a matter of law if it includes \u201cfacts that [the witness] physically could not have possibly observed or events that could not have occurred under the laws of nature.\u201d <em>United States v. Rivera, </em>775 F.2d 1559, 1561 (11th Cir.1985) (quotation omitted, brackets in original). \u201c[J]ury verdicts are insulated from review on the ground that they are inconsistent .... [, and] as long as the guilty verdict is supported by sufficient evidence, it must stand, even in the face of an inconsistent verdict on another count.\u201d <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>146 F.3d 1338, 1344-45 (11th Cir.1998) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>The statute for armed bank robbery, in relevant part, provides that: \u201c[l][w]hoever, by force and violence, or by intimidation, [2] takes ... from the ... presence of another ... [3] any ... money ... [4] belonging to, or in the care, custody, control, management, or possession of, any bank .... [5] having accounts insured by the [FDIC]\u201d shall be fined or imprisoned. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a),(h). Section 924(c) provides additional penalties for a person \u201c[1] who, during and in relation to any crime of violence, ... [2] uses or carries a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). \u201cBank robbery is a crime of violence covered by [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924].\u201d <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>187 F.3d 1269, 1270 (11th Cir.1999). Additionally, if a person aids in the commission of an offense, he is punished as a principal. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2(a). In order to prove a violation of \u00a7 924(c) under an aiding and abetting theory, the government must show that the defendant knew that the codefendant would use a firearm in the commission of the robbery. <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>987 F.2d 697, 701-02 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">As an initial matter, Blango\u2019s challenge to the jury verdict as inconsistent is not a ground subject to review. <em>Mitchell, </em>146 F.3d at 1344-45. Moreover, sufficient evidence existed for the jury to find the essential elements of the crimes beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">Indeed, sufficient evidence existed to support Blango\u2019s conviction for the November 2, 2004 robbery of the San Carlos Bank of America. As the record shows, a bank manager testified that the San Carlos branch had accounts insured by the FDIC and lost $18,110.90 in the robbery; other witnesses testified that during the robbery two robbers had guns and ordered everyone to the floor; and a witness, Adrian Gadsden, testified that he robbed the bank with Blango. Viewed in the light most favorable to the government, the evidence established that Blango: (1) by force, violence, or intimidation; (2) took from the presence of the tellers; (3) $18,110.90; (4) from a bank insured by the FDIC; (5) while carrying a firearm. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(c)(1)(A); 2113(a),(h); <em>Mintmire, </em>507 F.3d at 1289; <em>Hunt, </em>187 F.3d at 1270.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">Similarly, sufficient evidence existed as to the November 16, 2004 robbery of the Port Charlotte Bank of America. The record shows that the bank manager testified that the Port Charlotte branch had accounts insured by the FDIC and lost $2,755.98 in the robbery; a bank employee testified that she saw one robber waving a gun and ordering people to get down while the other robber jumped over the counter; another bank employee identified video footage showing a robber removing cash from a drawer; and Gadsden testified that he robbed the bank with Blango and that Blango gave him a gun to use during the robbery. This testimony established that Blango: (1) with force and intimidation; (2) took from the presence of the tellers; (3) $2,755.98; (4) from a bank insured by the FDIC; (5) while Gadsden carried a firearm. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(c)(1)(A); 2113(a),(h). It also established that Blan-go knew that Gadsden would use the firearm during the robbery because he gave the firearm to Gadsden for that purpose. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2(a); <em>Thomas, </em>987 F.2d at 701-02.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-12\">In addition, as to both November robberies, the witnesses\u2019 testimony was not incredible, and the jury was entitled to believe those witnesses even if the jury chose not to believe the witness testimony as to the first two bank robberies. <em>Chastain, </em>198 F.3d at 1351; <em>Rivera, </em>775 F.2d at 1561. Therefore, sufficient evidence existed for the jury to convict Blango on Counts 5-8 of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>We likewise reject Blango\u2019s argument that the mandatory minimum sentence he received conflicted with the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. \u201cIt is well-settled that a district court is not authorized to sentence a defendant below the statutory mandatory minimum unless the government filed a substantial assistance motion pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 or the defendant falls within the safety-valve of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f).\u201d <em>Castaing-Sosa, </em>530 F.3d at 1360-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">The record here shows that the district court did not err, let alone plainly err, by sentencing Blango to the statutory mandatory minimum. In fact, the district court could not sentence him below that amount because the government did not file a substantial assistance motion, and Blango did not qualify for the safety-valve.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
