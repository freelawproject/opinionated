Because defamation by a police officer is not actionable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">Walker filed a \u00a7 1983 action <em>in forma pauperis </em>alleging that the Atlanta Police Department Public Affairs Unit, N.K. Red-\u25a0linger, Homicide Detective, and Assistants) released a document<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201chideously defaming the character of the Plaintiff.\u201d Rl-1 at 3; Rl-2. Walker also alleged that the \u201cdocument express[ed] a very strong allegation of guilt towards\u201d him that made it impossible for a jury of his peers to judge him justly and impartially, violating \u201cseveral of [his] Constitutional rights.\u201d Rl-1 at 3-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-10\">The district court reviewed Walker\u2019s complaint for frivolity under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A. Rl-4 at 1. The district court found that a claim of being defamed by police officers is not actionable under \u00a7 1983, which meant that Walker\u2019s complaint was frivolous, and that he was not entitled to monetary damages on the basis that he was defamed by the allegedly erroneous document. <em>Id. </em>at 3^4.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-13\">To the extent that Walker sought a new trial, the district court found that the proper method for Walker to challenge his conviction was to file a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. <em>Id. </em>at 4. The district court, therefore, dismissed without prejudice Walker\u2019s request for a new trial so that he could later file a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. <em>Id. </em>at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-14\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b836-15\">Walker argues that the district court should not have dismissed his complaint because his defamation allegations raised a material issue upon which relief could be granted under \u00a7 1983. He alleges that the defamatory actions of the Atlanta Police Department Public Affairs Unit <em>et al. </em>violated his rights under the First, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Atlanta Police Department Public Affairs Unit did not file a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-16\">We review the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of Walker\u2019s complaint based on frivolity under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A for abuse of discretion. <em>See Miller v. Donald, </em>541 F.3d 1091, 1100 (11th Cir.2008). A claim is frivolous if it lacks arguable merit either in law or fact. <em>See Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 1831-32, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989); <em>Miller, </em>541 F.3d at 1100. \u201cPro <em>se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>than pleadings drafted by attorneys\u201d and are liberally construed. <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">To obtain relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must meet two elements: (1) the conduct complained of must be committed by a person acting under color of state law; and (2) the conduct must deprive the plaintiff of rights or privileges secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States. <em>See Rivers v. Campbell, </em>791 F.2d 837, 839 (11th Cir.1986) (per curiam). Walker alleges that the Atlanta Police Department acting \u201cunder color of law\u201d defamed him by releasing a media advisory that labeled him as a murder suspect, thereby depriving him of the \u201cconstitutionally mandated safeg[ua]rds of a criminal trial,\u201d such as the presumption of innocence. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 16-17. Although imputing criminal behavior to an individual is generally considered defamation and actionable without proof of special damages, the Supreme Court has held that a claim of being defamed by a police officer is not actionable under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Paul v. Davis, </em>424 U.S. 693, 711-12, 96 S.Ct. 1155, 1165-66, 47 L.Ed.2d 405 (1976). Therefore, Walker cannot gain relief under \u00a7 1983 and is not entitled to money damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Walker\u2019s complaint. Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b836-11\">. The document is a media advisory that depicted Walker's picture and labeled him as a murder suspect who \"has a history of violence and should be considered armed and dangerous.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at (unnumbered) page 25. Walker's brief is unpaginat-ed except for the cover page. The current pagination proceeds sequentially from the page he numbered as one.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b836-17\">. In the Appellant\u2019s Brief, Walker fails to mention his claim that he should receive a new criminal trial that does not reference the document. Therefore, he has abandoned this claim. <em>See United States v. Cunningham, </em>161 F.3d 1343, 1344 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
