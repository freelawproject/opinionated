In denying his \u00a7 3582 motion, the district court noted that Rivera was sentenced to a mandatory life sentence and was a career offender. On appeal, Rivera argues that the district court\u2019s denial of his motion was based on facts that were unsupported by the record because the district court factually erred in finding that he was sentenced as a career offender and that he was serving a mandatory minimum life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-23\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on a subsequent change in the sentencing guidelines, for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003). We review <em>\u201cde novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002). A district court\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Crawford, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>407 F.3d 1174, 1177 (11th Cir.2005). However, we will not reverse based on a harmless error. <em>United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1292 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">A district court generally cannot modify a term of imprisonment after it has been imposed. <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.2005). However, there is an exception under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) that provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b978-5\">[When] a defendant ... has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o), ... the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) ] to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Abr\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines reduced by two levels the base offense level for crack cocaine cases calculated under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 706. The amendment became effective on November 1, 2007. <em>Id. </em>The Sentencing Commission listed Amendment 706 in \u00a7 lB1.10(c) on March 3, 2008, therefore making the amendment retroactively applicable. <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 713. However, a movant is not entitled to a resentencing pursuant to Amendment 706 when the provisions of that amendment do not result in a lower base offense level and guidelines range. <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 986 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-7\">Here, the district court clearly erred in finding that Rivera was sentenced as a career offender and he was sentenced to a mandatory life sentence. Nonetheless, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Rivera\u2019s \u00a7 3582 motion because his guideline range was unaffected by Amendment 706 as his sentence was not based on crack cocaine. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
