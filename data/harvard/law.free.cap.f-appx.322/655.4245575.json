Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Here because the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion, \u201cthe IJ\u2019s decision becomes the final removal order subject to review.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1254 (11th Cir.2006). We review administrative fact findings under the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d test. <em>Id. </em>at 1255. Under that test, we must affirm the agency decision if it is supported by \u201creasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1244-45. We will reverse \u201conly when the record compels a reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify reversal of an administrative finding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-15\">A petitioner bears the burden of proving that she is a \u201crefugee\u201d in order to be eligible for asylum. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1); <em>D-Muhumed v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817-18 (11th Cir.2004). A \u201crefugee\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9q\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-16\">INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). To establish asylum eligibility, the alien must, with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that the statutorily listed factor will cause such future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. Martinez\u2019s claim for asylum is based on alleged persecution on account of her involvement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>with a political party in her home country of Venezuela. Therefore, she must demonstrate a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that she will be persecuted based on her political opinion if she returns to Venezuela. <em>Id. </em>Martinez contends that the IJ erred in determining that she had not demonstrated past persecution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Martinez did not establish past persecution. \u201c[Persecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and that mere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Martinez argues that she suffered past persecution based on threatening phone calls that she received, a statement made in her presence (but not directed at her) that several men were going to kill people distributing political flyers, and one instance where she was assaulted in the street and suffered minor injuries. Those incidents, however, do not rise to the level of past persecution. <em>See Djonda v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1168, 1174 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201c[T]hreats viewed in conjunction with [a] minor beating would not compel the conclusion that [the petitioner] suffered persecution.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Martinez\u2019s claim for withholding of removal also fails. The standard for withholding of removal \u201cis more stringent than the \u2018well-founded fear\u2019 standard for asylum.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 819. Because Martinez did not satisfy the lesser standard for asylum, she cannot meet the standard for withholding of removal. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">Finally, we lack jurisdiction to review Martinez\u2019s CAT claim because she did not raise it before the BIA. <em>See Sundar v. INS, </em>328 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-10\">PETITION DENIED IN PART AND DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b682-12\">. We will refer to the petitioners collectively as \"Martinez,\u201d unless context requires otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b683-8\">. Martinez\u2019s brief does not offer more than a passing reference to the possibility that she has a \u201cwell-founded\u201d fear of future persecution, and therefore she has abandoned that issue, <em>see Greenbriar, Ltd. v. City of Alabaster, </em>881 F.2d 1570, 1573 n. 6 (11th Cir.1989), and she did not raise that issue before the BIA anyway, <em>see Amaya-Artunduaga v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250-51 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
