On appeal, Williams argues the district court erred in concluding it lacked authority to apply <em>United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347 (11th Cir.2008), retroactively in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-25\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to [\u00a7 3582(c)(2) ] ... for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003). A district court may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed except where expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>permitted by statute or by Fed.R.Crim.P. 35. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B). One statutory exception to this general rule includes relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ain\">[I]n the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ] 994(o), upon motion of the defendant or the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or on its own motion, the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in [\u00a7 ] 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). \u201c[A] sentencing adjustment undertaken pursuant to [\u00a7 ] 3582(c)(2) does not constitute a <em>de novo </em>resentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">Because <em>Archer </em>is not a retroactive guideline amendment promulgated by the Commission, it cannot establish an independent jurisdictional basis under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Accordingly, the district court did not err in determining that it lacked authority to apply <em>Archer </em>retroactively in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b853-9\">. Williams had previously filed a motion for a reduced sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), requesting a reduction based on Amendment 706 to the Guidelines. The district court denied the motion because Williams was sentenced based on the career offender provisions of the Guidelines. Williams did not appeal the denial of that motion, and thus it is not before this Court on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
