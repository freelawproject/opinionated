We granted an alternative writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">Facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-10\">On August 2, 1972, real party Davalos sustained traumatic amputation of the fingers and thumb of the right hand while operating a punch press machine. In July 1973, he filed an action against his employer and others, sounding in negligence, breach of warranty and products liability. Concerning damages, there is an allegation that plaintiff will suffer future loss of earnings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-11\">In March of 1976, petitioner filed a demand for statement of damages pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 425.11, and on April 2, 1976, Davalos filed his response indicating general damages of $200,000, past loss of earnings of $20,500, and future loss of earnings of $266,770.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-12\">In December of 1976, petitioner filed requests for admissions<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> directed to Davalos, and Davalos set a hearing on his objections<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to those requests for January 14, 1977. The requests for admissions are, in effect, directed to the basis of computation of loss of future earnings. Petitioner either knows or suspects that Davalos entered the United States illegally, has not been granted permanent resident status, has no Green Card, and is subject to deportation at any time. These suspicions appear to be substantiated in part by Davalos\u2019 deposition. It follows logically, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>petitioner says, that projected loss of future earnings must be based upon the wage scale and availability of employment in the country of citizenship and not upon those in the country where Davalos is, allegedly, an illegal alien.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-5\">The objections to the requests for admissions are stated upon, four grounds: (1) that the requests call for privileged information; (2) that the requests are irrelevant \u201cto the issues\u201d; (3) that the requests are harassing; and (4) that the requests are propounded in bad faith. In its order of January 14, 1977, the superior court sustained the objections without giving any reason for its ruling.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Discussion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-7\">California Code of Civil Procedure section 2033, subdivision (a)(2) provides as follows: \u201c[Wjritten objections on the ground that some or all of the requested admissions are privileged or irrelevant or that the request is otherwise improper in whole or in part,...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">Other than the assertion that the requests are not propounded in good faith, there is no showing whatsoever of bad faith, a term presumably lifted from Code of Civil Procedure section 2019, subdivision (d). Neither is there any showing of harassment in the 12 short requests which occupy only a single page. The requests are clearly relevant to the subject matter of the action as framed by the pleadings, and they are likely to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The only privilege which might be applicable is the privilege against self-mcrimination.  It is, however, well established that deportation proceedings are civil, not criminal. <em>(Harisiades </em>v. <em>Shaughnessy, 342 </em>U.S. 580 [96 L.Ed. 586, 72 S.Ct. 512]; <em>Abel v. United States, </em>362 U.S. 217 [4 L.Ed.2d 668, 80 S.Ct. 683].)  The privilege is therefore not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">In <em>Cembrook </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>56 Cal.2d 423 [15 Cal.Rptr. 127, 364 P.2d 303], the Supreme Court disapproved a blanket order barring disclosure in toto. The order of the superior court in the present case was precisely such a blanket order and was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">Davalos is entitled to sue, to be a party, and to give evidence, and it is precisely that evidence which petitioner seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>Disposition:</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue requiring respondent court to vacate its order of January 14, 1977, sustaining real party\u2019s objections to petitioner\u2019s requests for admissions, and to enter a new and different order overruling said objections and ordering answers within 20 days without objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Roth, P.
