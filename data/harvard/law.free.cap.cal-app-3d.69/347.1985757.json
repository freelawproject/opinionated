J.</author>\n<p id=\"AW\">Lloyd William Sahley appeals the judgment on the pleadings dismissing his complaint against the County of San Diego for injuries suffered when he slipped and fell in a shower at the county jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">Since he was a preconviction detainee at the time of his fall, Sahley argues he was not a \u201cprisoner\u201d and his suit is not barred by sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-11\">The doctrine of governmental immunity, which exempts governmental agencies from having to answer for their torts, has a long and varied history. Most recently in California, the Supreme Court abolished the rule <em>(Muskopf </em>v. <em>Corning Hospital Dist., </em>55 Cal.2d 211 [11 Cal.Rptr. 89, 359 P.2d 457]), only to have the Legislature reinstate it with the Governmental Tort Claims Act of 1963. Government Code section 844.6 says in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-12\">\u201c(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, except as provided in this section and in Sections 814, 814.2, 845.4, and 845.6, a public entity is not liable for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-14\">\u201c(2) An injuiy to any prisoner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>A \u201c \u2018prisoner\u2019 includes an inmate of a prison, jail or penal or correctional facility\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 844). The Legislative Committee comment on this section includes as prisoners persons in the custody of a law enforcement officer although undergoing medical treatment in a county hospital, those in work camps and those engaged in fire suppression; parolees are not. From case law, the deprivation of liberty by lawful process or some kind of involuntary restraint characterizes one\u2019s status as a prisoner or inmate <em>(Patricia J. </em>v. <em>Rio Linda Union Sch. Dist., </em>61 Cal.App.3d 278, 283 [132 Cal.Rptr. 211]; <em>Jiminez </em>v. <em>County of Santa Cruz, </em>42 Cal.App.3d 407, 410 [116 Cal.Rptr. 878]; <em>Larson </em>v. <em>City of Oakland, </em>17 Cal.App.3d 91, 96 [94 Cal.Rptr. 466]; <em>Datil </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, </em>263 Cal.App.2d 655, 658 [69 Cal.Rptr. 788]). Thus, a person who has been booked is considered a prisoner <em>(Datil </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>263 Cal.App.2d 655, 659) while persons who have been temporarily detained for investigation <em>(Larson </em>v. <em>City of Oakland, supra, </em>17 Cal.App.3d 91, 97), juveniles who are wards of the court but in custody of their parents <em>(Patricia J. </em>v. <em>Rio Linda Union Sch. Dist., supra, </em>61 Cal.App.3d 278, 287), and persons falsely imprisoned beyond the term of their prison sentences are not <em>(Sullivan </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, </em>12 Cal.3d 710, 715 [117 Cal.Rptr. 241, 527 P.2d 865]). Here, Sahley was a preconviction detainee awaiting trial; he had been booked and arraigned; he was a \u201cprisoner\u201d for purposes of governmental immunity (see <em>Datil </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>263 Cal.App.2d 655).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Cologne, J., and Staniforth, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">A petition for a rehearing was denied May 12, 1977.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
