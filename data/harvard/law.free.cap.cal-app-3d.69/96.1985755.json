J.</author>\n<p id=\"AnK0\">Plaintiff and appellant represents retired police officers Formerly employed by real party in interest, City of Santa Monica (City). When they retired, these employees received lump-sum payments For unused sick leave and vacation time. Respondent Public Employees Retirement System (Board) did not\u2014and does not\u2014include such lump-sum payments in computing the retirement pensions to which these employees are entitled.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After an administrative hearing, the Board refused to include such payments, and this writ petition followed. The trial court ruled in favor of the Board and the City, concluding that under the applicable law, unused sick leave and vacation benefits are not to be included in computing pensions. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">We note that this case does not involve an employee\u2019s right to receive lump-sum payments for unused sick leave, a matter apparently left to the local public employer. (Cf. Lab. Code, \u00a7 227.3 [vacation pay]; see Gov. Code, \u00a7 18100 et seq. [state employees\u2019 sick pay].) This case involves only the inclusion of such amounts in the computation of pensions.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">Local public agencies, such as the City here, may elect to participate <em>in the state </em>retirement system. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 20450 et seq.) Such agencies are then subject to various provisions of the State Retirement System Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">First, the pension to which these employees are entitled is calculated to equal a certain fraction of the employee\u2019s \u201cfinal compensation\u201d multiplied by a fraction based on age and length of service. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 21252.01.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">Second, the phrase, \u201cfinal compensation,\u201d means \u201cthe highest average annual compensation earnable . . . during the three consecutive years of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>employment\u201d preceding retirement. (\u00a7 20024.01.) This section, however, defines only the relevant period to be used in determining the earnings factor used in computing a pension.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">Third, the phrase \u201ccompensation earnable\u201d means \u201cthe average monthly compensation\u201d based on \u201cthe average time put in by members in the same group or class of employment and at the same rate of pay.\u201d (\u00a7 20023.) This definition, although not defining the forms of compensation to be included, does tell us that the earnings factor is based on categories or groups of employees, rather than on individual earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Finally, the word \u201ccompensation\u201d means \u201cremuneration paid in cash . . . for . . . services or for time during which the member is excused from work because of holidays, sick leave, vacation,...\u201d (\u00a7 20022.)</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Petitioner contends that any item included in the definition of \u201ccompensation\u201d (\u00a7 20022) is also included in \u201cfinal compensation\u201d (\u00a7 21252.01). Petitioner\u2019s theory is that since the statutory definition of \u201ccompensation\u201d includes sick leave and vacation time, and since those statutes which describe the method of computing pensions also refer to \u201ccompensation,\u201d lump-sum payments for sick leave and vacation time must necessarily be included in computing pensions.  We disagree with petitioner\u2019s theoiy, which, by focusing exclusively on the definition of \u201ccompensation\u201d\u2014contained in chapter 1 of an 11-chapter law (pt. 3 of div. 5; \u00a7 20000 et seq.)\u2014fails to consider the provisions of the State Retirement System as a coherent whole. Stated differently, although we can assume that for some purposes the concept of \u201ccompensation\u201d includes lump-sum payments for sick leave, \u201ccompensation\u201d within the meaning of the State Retirement System does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">First, as noted above, a pension is generally based on two factors: compensation and time, or length of employment. (\u00a7 21252.01.) Sick leave and vacation time are treated by the Legislature as a <em>time </em>factor. Thus, in \u201ccomputing the service with which a member is entitled to be credited . . . time during which the member is excused from working because of holidays, sick leave, vacation, or leave of absence, with compensation, shall be included.\u201d (\u00a7 20810.) And, when an employee has not used all the sick leave time to which he is entitled, such sick leave time is credited when the employee retires as \u201c0.004 year of service credit for each unused day of sick leave . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 20862.8; see also \u00a7 20862.5.) The legislative intent was to assure that an employee, entitled to certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>time off from work, was nevertheless treated as if he had worked continuously.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Second, in defining \u201ccompensation earnable,\u201d section 20023 refers to \u201caverage monthly compensation\u201d and \u201csame rate of pay,\u201d suggesting, as noted, that the Legislature intended to exclude nonperiodic payments that did not apply to all employees similarly situated.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Specifically, the Legislature has excluded overtime pay from the compensation to be included in computing a pension. (\u00a7 20025.2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Lump-sum payments for unused sick leave and vacation time, although not conventional instances of overtime pay, are analogous in that an employee is entitled to receive such lump-sum payments when he has worked more time than he was expected to work.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Besides, as noted, when the Legislature in section 20862.8 did specifically permit unused sick leave\u2014extra work time\u2014to be used in pension computations, it did so as a factor of time. Finally, given what appears to be a random policy concerning a public employee\u2019s right to accrue sick time and vacation time, the Legislature had no great incentive to enact specific legislation on the subject.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Third, section 20024.01 limits the relevant period to \u201ccompensation earnable\u201d during the three years preceding retirement. Lump-sum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>payments may\u2014or may not <em>{ante, </em>fn. 3)\u2014cover only a three-year period. Certainly, amounts accrued over a lengthy period of time would totally distort the legislative scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">In short, we conclude that, viewing the State Retirement System as an entity, the Legislature intended to exclude lump-sum payments for unused sick leave and vacation time from pension computations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">After the court ruled in favor of the Board, petitioner, in what was captioned a motion for a new trial, presented a new theory to the court, based on section 20025, which provides that the \u201centire compensation of a local member shall be included in any computation to be made . .. for service rendered . . . .\u201d Section 20025 has nothing to do with the issue in this case. That section originally placed a ceiling on the <em>amount </em>of earnings that would be included in computing the pension\u2014$416.66 a month. Over the years, the section was frequently amended and, in short, distinguishes between those employees subject to a contract in which the pension is based on the \u201centire compensation\u201d and those employees subject to a contract which permits a maximum pension base of only $416.66. Section 20025 does not purport to define the forms of compensation to be included.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Finally, we note that petitioner relies on a Connecticut case for the proposition that unused sick days are to be included in the compensation on which the pension is based. <em>(Anderson </em>v. <em>Pension &amp; Retire. Bd., City of Milford </em>(1974) 167 Conn. 352 [355 A .2d 283].) That case does not help. There, the issue was the interpretation of a provision in a collective bargaining agreement. Leaving aside the difference between determining the intention of parties to a contract and that of the Legislature, even the provision involved in the Connecticut case was different. There, the pension was based on an average annual pay, \u201c \u2018including but not limited to base salary, holiday pay, longevity pay, overtime pay, etc., ...\u2019 \u201d <em>(Anderson </em>v. <em>Pension &amp; Retire. Bd., City of Milford, supra, </em>355 A.2d at p. 285.)</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>The trial court correctly ruled that such lump-sum payments are not to be included in the compensation on which an employee\u2019s pension is based.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Stephens, J., and Ashby, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied June 9, 1977. Bird, C. J., did not participate therein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b114-11\"> Petitioner\u2019s members are entitled to receive lump-sum or periodic payments, upon retirement, for unused sick time and vacation time under a judgment resulting from litigation the details of which are not known to us. The parties, however, have framed the issue to encompass the Board\u2019s duty to include such lump-sum payments in pension computations, regardless of the source of the employee\u2019s rights to such payments\u2014practice, contract, or judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b114-12\"> All references are to the Government Code. See, generally, section 21252 et seq., for employees other than \u201clocal safety members ....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b116-8\"> Although petitioner points out that other forms of \u201cbonus\u201d payments are included, \u201csuch as educational incentive bonus, longevity bonus, shooting pay, holiday pay,\u201d these amounts are paid periodically to all persons similarly situated, and are part of the employee\u2019s regular salary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b116-9\"> Concededly, our analysis is not fool-proof. The inclusion of sick pay, vacation pay, and holiday pay under section 20022 and the exclusion of overtime pay under section 20025.2 would suggest the Legislature intended a computation based on a straight 52-week year. Nevertheless, the Board agreed that all holiday pay is included in the compensation from which deductions are made and on which pensions are computed, even though the City in this case has the odd policy of paying a police officer an extra day\u2019s pay for each holiday whether or not that officer worked the holiday. Other cities pay employees an extra day\u2019s pay for a holiday only if they work that day. Holiday pay is, however, paid in the month it is earned, so that the inclusion of such pay is consistent with the policy that only the last three years\u2019 earnings are relevant. (\u00a7 20024.01, discussed in the text.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b116-10\"> The employees here rely on a judgment. <em>(Ante, </em>fn. 2.) At' the administrative hearing and at oral argument In the superior court, there was evidence and discussion about agency policies concerning accrued sick leave or vacation benefits. In Santa Monica, 130 days\u2014earned at 12 days per year\u2014of sick leave could be accumulated, at least for police officers. The City also permitted employees to accumulate 25 days of vacation time. The Attorney General\u2019s representative believed that her office allowed 40 days of vacation time t\u00f3 be accrued. The state does not pay lump-sum sick leave benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b117-8\"> The trial court first concluded that such payments constituted \u201ccompensation\u201d (\u00a7 20022) but did not constitute \u201ccompensation earnable\u201d (\u00a7 20023). An unintended effect of this ruling was that employees would be required to contribute a percentage of these lump-sum benefits to the pension fund even though the amounts would not be considered in computing the pension. (See \u00a7\u00a7 20025, 20683.) The trial court then modified its ruling to conclude that such benefits are neither \u201ccompensation\u201d nor \u201ccompensation earnable.\u201d Petitioner, although not acquiescing in the court\u2019s basic ruling, agreed that the modification was a desirable one.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
