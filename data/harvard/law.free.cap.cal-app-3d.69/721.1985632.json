It raises the issue of the obligation of a deputy public defender to accept an appointment in that capacity over his objection. Concluding that the petitioner in the case at bench established reasons for his refusal to accept the appointment pursuant to rule 2-111 of the California Rules of Professional Conduct, we issued our writ of review annulling the action of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">John L. Miller was charged with murder by an information filed in the Los Angeles Superior Court. Gerald L. Chaleff, a deputy public defender, was appointed to represent him over Miller\u2019s objection. Miller sought permission to appear in propria persona. After a series of hearings to determine Miller\u2019s capacity for self-representation during the course of which Miller indicated a desire for advisory counsel, the trial court granted Miller permission to represent himself. Confirming that Miller still desired advisory counsel, the court appointed \u201cthe public defender\u201d in that capacity. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mattson </em>(1959) 51 Cal.2d <em>777, </em>797 [336 P.2d 937].)</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Chaleff stated, \u201cI would have, to respectfully decline.\u201d He gave as his reasons: (1) the failure of Government Code section 27706 to authorize the public defender to act in an advisory capacity; (2) the adverse consequences to his other case load of being required to appear in court on a schedule dictated by Miller; (3) Miller\u2019s refusal to permit a workable relationship of attorney and client to be established; (4) the relationship was one in which Miller would not permit Chaleff to present defenses which Chaleff believed were available; and (5) \u201csevere ethical problems in relation to being an advisor in that what [was] asked of [Chaleff]\u201d could put him in a position where he would \u201chave to come to the court and report to the court that [he felt] the conduct by . . . Miller was wrong.\u201d Chaleff amplified his fourth reason, stating: \u201cI\u2019m referring to . . . issues [other than Miller\u2019s decision to testify] such as witnesses or other types of conduct that may come about that may cause me to feel that it violates my ethical responsibilities as an attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Chaleff further noted to the court a conflict with Miller over presentation of the defense, adding: \u201cI might say that I\u2019m sort of handcuffed explaining to this court because of the attorney-client <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>privilege and the fact that Mr. Miller has stated that he would like me to ... retain confidential anything he\u2019s told me ... <footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Despite Chaleff\u2019s objection and explanation, the court insisted in its order, and when Chaleff did not agree to serve as ordered, found him in contempt. The trial court then appointed private counsel to advise Miller. Chaleff filed the petition for writ of review which brings the . contempt matter to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Public defenders and their deputies are subject to the Rules of Professional Conduct governing the action of lawyers no less than other members of the State Bar. Rule 2-111 of the Rules of Professional Conduct permits a lawyer to withdraw from representation of a client if the client insists upon presenting a claim or defense that is not warranted under existing law and cannot be supported by a good faith argument for extension, modification, or reversal of existing law (subd. (C)(1)(a)), or if the employment creates a situation in which it is unreasonably difficult for the member of the State Bar to cany out his employment effectively (subd. (C)(1)(d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">On its face and in its spirit, rule 2-111 is applicable to an attorney appointed to act as an adviser to a defendant conducting his own defense. The language of the rule contains no exception. The spirit of the rule exemplifies the proposition that while the attorney\u2019s duty is to his client, he cannot be placed in the position where discharging that duty impinges upon his ethical responsibility as a member of the bar. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Mattson, supra, </em>51 Cal.2d <em>777, </em>793.)</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">Here Chaleff called to the court\u2019s attention the fact that his representation of Miller could place him in an untenable ethical position. Here Chaleff went as far as he could go in the disclosure without divulging privileged information. In that situation, rule 2-111 permitted Chaleff to withdraw from the representation of Miller. The court, by holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>Chaleff in contempt, placed upon Chaleff a burden beyond that allowed by the rule.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court in so doing exceeded its authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">The judgment of contempt is annulled.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Lillie, Acting P. J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b562-8\"> Evidence well after the fact shows that a significant difference between Miller, and Chaleff was Miller\u2019s self-destructive urge to so conduct the defense as to receive the death penalty. That evidence was not before the trial court when it made its ord\u00e9r and hence cannot be considered in testing the trial court\u2019s action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b563-9\"> Because we rest our decision upon rule 2-111 of the Rules of Professional Conduct, we indicate neither agreement nor disagreement with the holding of <em>Ligda </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 5 Cal.App.3d 811 [85 Cal.Rptr. 744] to the effect that a deputy public defender may, with his consent, be appointed as advisory counsel despite the absence of authority for such an appointment in Government Code section 27706 which defines the authority of the public defender without mentioning or implying that the authority includes service as an adviser to a person conducting his own defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b563-6\">HANSON, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7y\">I concur with the majority opinion that the trial court exceeded its authority and that the judgment of contempt should be annulled. However, I have serious reservations in arriving at that conclusion, from this record, based on rule 2-111 of the California Rules of Professional Conduct as discussed in the majority <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">I arrive at the same result by addressing directly what I perceive to be the critical issue presented by the record. The key issue as I see it is whether or not the trial court in a criminal case where the defendant has demanded and been granted the right of self-representation pursuant to <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California </em>(1975) 422 U.S. 806 [45 L.Ed.2d 562, 95 S.Ct. 2525], is empowered to appoint a public defender to serve in the capacity of \u201cadvisory counsel\u201d at (1) defendant\u2019s request or (2) under the inherent power of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">A more detailed treatment of the underlying criminal case and the contempt order as disclosed by the record may serve to sharpen the root issue. _</p>\n<p id=\"b564-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>The Underlying Criminal Case</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">The record discloses that in the case of People v. Miller (John Lawrence), Los Angeles Superior Court No. A016192, defendant Miller was charged with the murder of his parents in violation of Penal Code section 187 on October 21, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">On October 30, 1975, defendant Miller was arraigned and the court appointed Deputy Public Defender Chaleff (hereinafter attorney Chaleff) as his defense counsel despite his statement that he did not need an attorney. Attorney Chaleff also represented defendant Miller over the defendant\u2019s objection at the preliminary hearing on November 12, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Special hearings were conducted on November 26, December 1, 5, 22, and 23, 1975, to determine whether or not defendant Miller could represent himself in propria persona. The court after fully advising defendant Miller of the pitfalls, dangers and consequences of acting as his own counsel and determining that he was mentally capable, literate, fully informed and had made (both orally and in writing) a voluntary, intelligent and understanding waiver of his right to representation by appointed counsel granted him the right to represent himself in propria persona after the December 23 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Defendant Miller at the November 26 hearing had indicated he would like \u201cadvisoiy counsel\u201d and that the public defender would be acceptable to serve in that capacity. The court at the December 23 hearing, after granting defendant Miller the right to represent himself, said: \u201cNow, in conformance with what you\u2019ve told me previously,.! take it that you\u2019re asking the Court to appoint a lawyer to act as advisory counsel. [If] Is that correct? [1f] The Defendant: Yes, that\u2019s correct. [1] The Court: And I take it that you still do not have funds to employ your own lawyer for this purpose? [If] The Defendant: That\u2019s correct. [1f] The Court: Very well, the public defender is appointed as advisory counsel to aid the defendant if and when he requests help <em>and </em>to be available to represent the defendant should the Court find it necessary at any time to terminate the defendant\u2019s right of self-representation [due] to the misconduct of the defendant pursuant to Penal Code Section 987, Subdivision a, <em>Faretta versus California, </em>and this Court\u2019s inherent power to conduct this proceedings in an orderly and expeditious manner.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b565-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>Colloquy between the court and attorney Chaleff brought out that Chaleff would not be responsible for conduct of the trial, would not be Miller\u2019s investigator or runner, but Chaleff\u2019s \u201cduties would be to render legal advice and counsel if and when the defendant requested it <em>and </em>in the event that the defendant\u2019s pro per privileges were terminated to then conduct the trial of the case.\u201d (Italics added.) While attorney Chaleff would not initiate on his own any legal matters (motions, etc.), he could volunteer to defendant who could accept or reject.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">Following a recitation of his reasons for his refusal to act as \u201cadvisory counsel\u201d set forth in the majority opinion, attorney Chaleff respectfully declined and the court found him in contempt and fined him $50 with a \u201cstay\u201d to purge himself of contempt by agreeing to act as \u201cadvisory counsel\u201d or unless sentence was further stayed by a higher court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">The contempt order adjudicating attorney Chaleff guilty of contempt satisfies the technical requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>1211<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which are jurisdictional and contains sufficient facts to constitute a legal contempt (see <em>Vaughn </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1967) 252 Cal.App.2d 348, 357 [60 Cal.Rptr. 575]) <em>provided the court was empowered to appoint attorney Chaleff as \u201cadvisory </em>counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\"><em>Does defendant Miller have a legal right to \u201cadvisory counsel\u201d having requested and been granted the right of self-representation pursuant to </em>Faretta v. California, supra, <em>422 U.S. 806?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">In <em>Faretta </em>the trial court had appointed the public defender to represent defendant although the latter vigorously sought to appear and proceed without counsel in propria persona. The United States Supreme Court held that the denial of self-representation was impermissible under the Sixth Amendment stating in the concluding paragraph of the majority opinion: \u201cIn forcing Faretta, under these circumstances, to accept against his will a state-appointed public defender, the California courts deprived him of his constitutional right to conduct his own defense... .\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (422 U.S. at p. 836 [45 L.Ed.2d at p. 582].)</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">The majority opinion in <em>Faretta </em>does not mandate appointment of \u201cadvisory counsel.\u201d The question was posed by Mr. Justice Blackmun in his dissent where he said: \u201c[I]f a defendant has elected to exercise his right to proceed <em>pro se, </em>does he still have a constitutional right to assistance of standby counsel? . . .\u201d (Italics in original.) <em>(Faretta </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>422 U.S. 806, 852 [45 L.Ed.2d 562, 592].) The majority opinion did not address this question of a right to advisory or standby counsel directly. Instead it expressed permissive approval only in footnote 46 (422 U.S. at pp. 834-835 [45 L.Ed.2d at p. 581]) when it said: \u201c[0]f course, a State may\u2014even over objection by the accused\u2014appoint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>a \u2018standby counsel\u2019 to aid the accused if and when the accused requests help, and to be available to represent the accused in the event that termination of the defendant\u2019s self-representation is necessary. [Citation.]\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">The word \u201cmay\u201d renders it merely discretionary as to each state and not mandated by law. In <em>People </em>v. <em>McDaniel, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d 156, 162, 168 footnote 6, the California Supreme Court noted that <em>United States </em>v. <em>Swinton </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1975) 400 F.Supp. 805, 807, held that <em>Faretta </em>did not give a constitutional right to co-counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Under <em>pre-Faretta </em>authority, the California rule was that a defendant is not entitled as a matter of right to have his case presented in court by himself and by counsel simultaneously. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Sharp </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 448, 459 [103 Cal.Rptr. 233, 499 P.2d 489]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hill (1969) 70 </em>Cal.2d 678, 692 [76 Cal.Rptr. 225, 452 P.2d 329]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mattson </em>(1959) 51 Cal.2d 777, 787-789 [336 P.2d 937].)</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">The above rule was extensively discussed in <em>Mattson, supra, </em>where the court at page 789 said: \u201c[D]espite the constitutional (art. I, \u00a7 13) and statutory (Pen. Code, \u00a7 686) provisions that defendant has the right to appear and defend in person <em>and </em>with counsel, defendant is not entitled to have his case <em>presented </em>in court <em>both by himself and by counsel </em>acting at the same time or alternating at defendant\u2019s pleasure. [Italics in original.] <em>(People </em>v. <em>Northcott </em>(1930), <em>supra, </em>209 Cal. 639, 648-650 [6] 651; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mims </em>(1958), 160 Cal.App.2d 589, 595 [2] [325 P.2d 234].) <em>So long as defendant is represented by counsel at the trial, he has no right to be heard by himself (People </em>v. <em>McKinney </em>(1957), <em>supra, </em>152 Cal.App.2d 332, 336 [6]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Glenn </em>(1950), <em>supra, 96 </em>Cal.App.2d 859, 868; <em>conversely, when defendant has intelligently declined the aid of counsel he has no right to interrupt the trial with a demand for legal assistance (In re Connor </em>(1940), 16 Cal.2d 701, 709 [8] [108 P.2d 10]).\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">In <em>Sharp, supra, </em>our Supreme Court in construing the California constitutional amendment (Const., art. I, \u00a7 13) and modified statutory language subsequent to <em>Mattson </em>concluded neither conferred any right of self-representation. The <em>Sharp </em>decision did not undercut the validity of <em>Mattson </em>in respect to \u201cadvisory counsel.\u201d The court in <em>Sharp </em>in fact specifically stated in the body of its opinion that \u201c[T]he holding in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number><em>Mattson </em>. . . is . . . that an accused is not entitled to have his case presented in court by both himself and counsel acting at the same time. ...\u201d (7 Cal.3d at p. 459.)</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">I find no California <em>post-Faretta </em>statutory or case law authority which authorizes a defendant in a criminal case who has elected to represent himself at the trial to have court-appointed \u201cadvisory counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1977) 65 Cal.App.3d 978, 987 [135 Cal.Rptr. 668] (petn. den. by Cal. Supreme Ct. on Mar. 3, 1977), we held that \u201c[t]he California case law, <em>pre-Faretta </em>was that a defendant is not entitled to have his case presented in court by himself and by cocounsel simultaneously. . . .\u201d and that \u201cNeither <em>Faretta </em>nor subsequent California case law changes ...\u201d that rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Moreover, those federal and other state courts which have considered the issue since <em>Faretta </em>have held that there is no federal constitutional right to advisory counsel or hybrid representation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Here, defendant Miller elected to represent himself after intelligently declining the aid of counsel and then requested the aid of \u201cadvisory counsel\u201d which the court granted. I conclude that <em>Mattson </em>which predates <em>Faretta </em>and <em>Harris </em>which posdates <em>Faretta </em>control and defendant Miller in the instant case did not have a constitutional, statutory or California decisional right to \u201cadvisory counsel\u201d and his request in that respect was improperly granted and should have been denied. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number><em>Did the trial court properly exercise its \u201cinherent power\u201d by appointing attorney Chaleff to act as \u201cadvisory counsel\u201dfor defendant Miller?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">Here, as previously noted, the record reflects that the trial court inquired of defendant Miller as follows: \u201c[I] take it that you\u2019re asking the Court to appoint a lawyer to act as advisory counsel. [f| Is that correct?\u201d The defendant responded: \u201cYes, that\u2019s correct.\u201d Thereafter the court stated: <em>\u201cVery well, the public defender is appointed as advisory counsel to aid the defendant if and when he requests help </em>and <em>to be available to represent the defendant should the Court find it necessary at any time to terminate the defendant\u2019s right of self-representation to the misconduct of the defendant . . . and this Court\u2019s inherent power to conduct this proceedings in an orderly and expeditious manner. \u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Thus the court below in addition to granting defendant Miller\u2019s request for \u201cadvisory counsel\u201d and appointing attorney Chaleff as \u201cadvisory counsel\u201d added to his duties (in the conjunctive <em>\u201cand\u201d) </em>the obligation to serve as \u201cstandby counsel.\u201d The court relied for authority on its \u201cinherent power to conduct this proceedings in \u00e1n orderly and expeditious manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">I conclude that while the trial court may have properly exercised its nherent power in appointing attorney Chaleff as \u201cstandby counsel\u201d it (the court) improperly exercised that power by ordering attorney Chaleff to serve as \u201cadvisory counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">The distinctions between the duties performed by \u201cadvisory\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and \u201cstandby\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> counsel are real and could have a long range impact on the orderly and efficient administration of justice, especially in light of the Pandora\u2019s box opened by <em>Faretta.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">In.my view to have, as here, an in propria persona defendant who has \u201cintelligently declined the aid of counsel. . . interrupt the trial\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mattson, supra, </em>51 Cal.2d <em>777, </em>789) by whispering with \u201cadvisory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>counsel\u201d throughout the trial could, in the long run, result in an unwise policy in that it would tend to impede rather than insure an orderly, expeditious, and efficient administration of justice. A defendant appearing in propria persona has elected to represent himself. <em>He is his own counsel. </em>He should not be allowed to have it both ways. To hold otherwise would tend to circumvent <em>Mattson </em>as hereinbefore discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">Furthermore, why should an indigent defendant who has elected to represent himself be furnished \u201cadvisory counsel\u201d at public expense?<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> I am aware of no persuasive argument for affording <em>indigent </em>defendants in criminal cases greater rights, at public expense, than <em>nonindigent </em>defendants who have to pay for their own counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Clearly, a <em>nonindigent </em>defendant can hire private counsel who controls the case during the trial and an <em>indigent </em>defendant is afforded appointed counsel (usually a public defender or private counsel in the event of a conflict) at public expense to represent him during the trial. Also, a <em>nonindigent </em>defendant has the right to appear in propria persona as does an <em>indigent </em>defendant under <em>Faretta. </em>While a <em>nonindigent </em>defendant may appear in propria persona and also could theoretically retain private counsel to serve in an \u201cadvisory\u201d capacity and sit beside him at the counsel table with the court\u2019s permission, such a situation has been so rare as to be practically nonexistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Moreover, the court itself should not need to expend additional public funds appointing \u201cadvisory counsel\u201d merely for it (the court) to avoid committing error as insinuated by defendant Miller.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That is the court\u2019s job.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">Accordingly, since I have concluded that the defendant has no right to \u201cadvisory counsel\u201d and the court improperly appointed attorney Chaleff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>to serve in that capacity, he (attorney Chaleff) cannot be held in contempt for refusing to perform a duty which the court was unauthorized to order.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">I would therefore declare null and void the minute order of December 23, 1975, adjudging petitioner guilty of contempt of court and imposing punishment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b563-10\"> While clearly the rules of professional conduct and ethical standards apply equally to all attorneys whether a deputy public defender or a private practitioner, as I read the record Deputy Public Defender Chaleff\u2019s claims of conflict and personal ethical problems basically stem from the fact that defendant Miller wanted to plead guilty as charged and be sentenced according to law while Deputy Public Defender Chaleff wanted to proceed to trial and put on a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"pA7d\">My concern is that the majority opinion may be construed as across the board sanctioning such an approach, which would result in unnecessary and expensive lengthy trials in a large percent of criminal cases where defendants who desire to plead guilty are represented by public defenders. Here the end result, following trial, was the same as desired by defendant at the outset of the criminal proceedings. It is the trial court\u2019s ultimate responsibility with the assistance of counsel to insure during the taking of the plea of guilty, especially to first degree murder, that all the defendant\u2019s constitutional safeguards are protected, that the pleas are intelligently and voluntarily made, and that defendant did in fact commit the crime to which he has pleaded guilty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b565-6\"> The court following attorney Chaleff\u2019s refusal to act as \u201cadvisory counsel\u201d then appointed Jack S. Stanley, \u201ca member of the private bar, as advisory counsel to aid the defendant if and when he requests help <em>and </em>to be available to represent the defendant should the Court find it necessary at any time to terminate the defendant\u2019s right of self-representation.\u201d (Italics added.) Mr. Stanley accepted the appointment as \u201cadvisory counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ATL5\">The court transcript of proceedings held when defendant Miller was sentenced on April 19, 1976, in which defendant Miller was sentenced to death declares that Miller stated the \u201cconflict\u201d between himself and attorney Chaleff had been that he (Miller) wanted to plead guilty and get the thing over with and wanted no defense but that attorney Chaleff felt there should be a * Defendant Miller also told the court: \u201cBut you have been concerned all along the line with reversible error. In that regard you have had Mr. Standby Adviser here being your assistant, insuring against reversible error, as you yourself stated when we were going through the instructions for the jury on the guilt phase. [1] I personally don\u2019t feel that he has done his job and I think there is reversible error, and I don\u2019t want reversible error, because I don\u2019t want a retrial... [1] I think that the verdict and sentence are both just. I have no disagreements there at all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A7M\">*The reporter\u2019s transcript contains the following colloquy:</p>\n<p id=\"AQI\">\u201cTHE COURT: This matter is before the Court on hearing of probation and sentence at this time, Mr. Miller. We are not here to take evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"ATR\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: You made statements as to what the conflict was. Okay. I will tell you what the conflict was. Since you won\u2019t let him speak, I will state it myself.</p>\n<p id=\"A1-\">\u201cThe conflict was that I wanted to simply plead g\u00fcilty and get this thing over with and, since I wasn\u2019t allowed to, then I wanted no defense, and he felt that ethically he could not on no defense. So that was the basis of our conflict of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"AQQj\">\u201cThat is why I went pro per and that is why no defense was put on ultimately.</p>\n<p id=\"AGL\">\u201cI will say this, that by doing what I did my pro per status could have been pulled, had it been realized what I was doing.\u2014\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b566-8\"> Code of Civil Procedure section 1211 provides in pertinent part: \u201cWhen a contempt is committed in the immediate view and presence of the court, or of the judge at chambers, it may be punished summarily; for which an order must be made, reciting the facts as occurring in such immediate view and presence, adjudging that the person proceeded against is thereby guilty of a contempt, and that he be punished as therein prescribed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b566-9\"> In <em>People </em>v. <em>McDaniel </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 156 [127 Cal.Rptr. 467, 545 P.2d 843], the state Supreme Court stated <em>Faretta </em>\u201cis not to be given retroactive application\u201d (p. 163) and \u201cis to be applied only prospectively in those cases wherein an accused sought or seeks to assert his right of self-representation in a trial which has commenced or will commence after June 30, 1975, the date upon which the decision in <em>Faretta </em>was filed.\u201d (P. 168.) Here the crimes were committed after the <em>Faretta </em>decision was filed which rendered that decision fully applicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b568-8\"> Several courts have held that in general the defendant must make a choice between proceeding with counsel and proceeding pro se. (See, e.g., <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(8th Cir. 1976) 534 F.2d 119, 123; <em>Gibbs </em>v. <em>State </em>(Del. 1976) 359 A.2d 164, 166; <em>People </em>v. <em>Heidelberg </em>(1975) 33 Ill.App.3d 574 [338 N.E.2d 56, 69]; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Wolfish </em>(2d Cir. 1975) 525 F.2d 457,462-463.)</p>\n<p id=\"Ayf\">Only one jurisdiction, Kentucky, has construed the United States Constitution as giving the pro per defendant a right to advisory counsel, and that holding predates <em>Faretta. </em>(See <em>Wake </em>v. <em>Barker </em>(Ky. 1974) 514 S.W.2d 692, 696.) Several courts have decided that there is no right to \u201chybrid\u201d representation. Hybrid representation involves the defendant assisting counsel, rather than counsel advising a defendant who has elected to proceed pro se. Without exception, those courts which have considered the question have held that a defendant has no such right to hybrid representation. (See <em>U. S. </em>v. <em>Williams, supra, </em>534 F.2d 119; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Hill </em>(10th Cir. 1975) 526 F.2d 1019, 1024-1025; <em>Gibbs </em>v. <em>State, supra, </em>359 A.2d 164; <em>Stiner </em>v. <em>State </em>(Okla. 1975) 539 P.2d 750, 753; <em>Callahan </em>v. <em>State </em>(1976) 30 Md.App. 628 [354 A.2d 191, 194-195]; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Swinton, supra, </em>400 F.Supp. 805, 806, especially absent some indication of special need; see also, <em>U. S. </em>v. <em>Lang </em>(4th Cir. 1975) 527 F.2d 1264, 1265.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b569-9\"> I construe the term \u201cadvisory counsel\u201d to mean an attorney who is present in the courtroom at the defendant\u2019s side, does not speak for him, and does not participate in the conduct of the trial but only gives him legal advice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b569-10\"> I construe the term \u201cstandby counsel\u201d to mean an attorney who is present in the courtroom and follows the evidence and proceedings but does not give legal advice to the defendant. He \u201cstands by\u201d in the event it is necessary for the trial court to revoke defendant\u2019s in propria persona status or even remove the defendant from the courtroom because of disruptive tactics so the case may proceed in an orderly manner to verdict.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b570-9\"> Here the record reflects defendant Miller had his own reasons for wishing to appear in propria persona and was manipulating the court to achieve those ends. However, the special jail privileges afforded in propria persona defendants, i.e., library privileges, telephone calls, etc., may generate motions seeking in propria persona status by <em>indigent </em>defendants while in custody awaiting trial. The supplying of \u201cadvisory counsel\u201d .could well increase such motions and work adversely to the efficient administration of justice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b570-10\"> See footnote 2, <em>ante, </em>page 727.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b571-6\"> To the extent that the case of <em>Ligda </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 5 Cal.App.3d 811 [85 Cal.Rptr. 744], may be construed to be contrary to the views expressed herein, I disagree. Taking a broad overview, what may have been a sound <em>pre-Faretta </em>result in <em>Ligda </em>in Solano County in 1970 is not necessarily a sound <em>post-Faretta </em>result in <em>Chaleff </em>in Los Angeles or any in 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"AT5Y\">Moreover, <em>Ligda </em>is factually distinguishable from the case at bench. Paul Ligda was the county public defender (Solano County) and the superior of Deputy Public Defender Stephen R. Camden initially who represented the defendant in the case of People v. Johnson (George Washington). Defendant Johnson requested the court for permission to appear in propria persona. Attorney Camden, the deputy public defender, told the court: \u201c[I]f Mr. Johnson\u2019s motion is granted and he is allowed to proceed pro per, I would at any time he asked me for legal advice, I would be glad to give him the information he requests or any of my legal knowledge that he may need in preparing for his trial.\u201d (5 Cal.App.3d at p. 818.) The trial court granted defendant Johnson\u2019s motion to represent himself and said: \u201c \u2018Furthermore, if you wish legal assistance you may make a date with Mr. Camden. At this time he has indicated his willingness to provide any continuing counsel if you wish his assistance during trial, to be present, and you may have that.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id, </em>at p. 818.) Later Attorney Camden was ordered to serve as \u201cadvisory counsel\u201d and Mr. Ligda obtained a temporary restraining order forbidding the trial court from compelling Attorney Camden to remain in court. The reviewing court discharged the alternative writ of prohibition and denied the peremptory writ.</p>\n<p id=\"AYZD\">In the case at bench attorney Chaleff never volunteered to serve as \u201cadvisory counsel\u201d and respectfully declined to act in that capacity when ordered by the court. In addition, in <em>Ligda </em>Attorney Camden\u2019s offer to provide continuing legal advice to defendant Johnson may have been an important factor the court considered in granting the defendant in propria persona status.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
