Comp. L., \u00a7 4694; <em>Abell v. Munson, </em>18 Mich., 312; <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>id., 393.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>There are many reasons against and none in favor of granting the relief sought. The contract was void, and a reference to the circumstances which gave rise to it shows it to be destitute of all equities. The contract even if valid was so drawn that it was optional with the complainant to retain the property or convey it. If within the period fixed \u2014 one year from the date thereof \u2014 the property had become much more valuable, it is quite evident defendant would not have been called upon to take it. The defendant had no voice in the matter except to pay the agreed price and take the property in case complainant considered it for his interests to so demand. There was not, therefore, that mutuality in this agreement which a court of equity considers so essential in a suit for specific performance. <em>McMurtrie v. Bennette, </em>Har.
