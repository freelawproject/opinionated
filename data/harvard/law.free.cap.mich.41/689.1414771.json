A deed was executed to Jarvis by the commissioner on the same day of the sale, and by Jarvis recorded the 11th day of November following.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">The petition to set aside this sale was filed March 25th, 1879, by Abigail Morris, and sets forth that she is the wife of the mortgagor, who was insane at the time the mortgage was given by him; that in the foreclosure suit she was appointed guardian <em>ad litem, </em>and that she acted under the advice of counsel and submitted the charge of the suit wholly to counsel; that the property was sold at less than one-fourth its actual value to Jarvis, and that Jarvis has paid nothing for the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">It also appears from the record that the petitioner as guardian <em>ad litem </em>put in an answer and that proofs were taken upon which the decree was rendered. Jarvis was not brought into court and had no notice of the proceedings taken upon the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">It would seem one of the plainest principles in juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>prudence, that where third parties had acquired rights under judicial proceedings, they could not be deprived thereof, without being in some way brought into court and given an opportunity to be heard. This was held in <em>Crawford v. Taller, 35 </em>Mich., 57, and the rule there laid down must govern in this case. The order setting aside the sale and opening the case must be set aside with costs to appellants.</p>\n<judges id=\"b707-4\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
