This was dated May 23, 1868.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">At the date of this obligation there was no statute in this State expressly providing for the compounding of interest, and it has been generally believed that it was not competent without such a statute to make a valid contract in advance for interest upon overdue installments of interest. Such was the conclusion of Chancellor Kent at an early day; <em>Connecticut v. Jackson, </em>1 Johns. Ch., 13; <em>Van Benschooten v. Lawson, </em>6 Johns. Ch., 314; and his conclusion seemed to commend itself to the judgment of our people, as it did to that of judicial tribunals of other States. <em>Sparks v. Garrigues, 1 </em>Binn., 165; <em>Stokely v. Thompson, </em>34 Penn. St., 210; <em>Hastings v. Wiswall, </em>8 Mass., 455; <em>Von Hemert v. Porter, </em>11 Met., 210; <em>Ferry v. Ferry, </em>2 Cush., 92; <em>Doe v. Warren, </em>7 Me., 48; <em>Niles v. The Board, &amp;c., </em>8 Blackf., 159; <em>Grimes v. Blake, </em>16 Ind., 160; <em>Leonard v. Villars, </em>23 Ill., 377. The judgment of Chancellor Kent has recently been criticised in New York, but it has been affirmed by a majority of the Court of Appeals after full discussion. <em>Young v. Hill, </em>67 N. Y., 162. In New Hampshire a different conclusion was reached at an early day: <em>Peirce v. Rowe, </em>1 N. H., 179: and this case has been followed in some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>states: <em>Austin v. Imus, </em>23 Vt., 286; <em>Preston v. Walker, </em>26 Iowa, 205; <em>Lewis v. Paschal, </em>37 Tex., 315; <em>Bledsoe v. Nixon, </em>69 N. C., 89: and it is. not disputed anywhere that after the interest has accrued, a valid promise may be made to pay interest upon it. <em>Camp v. Bates, </em>11 Conn., 487; <em>Wilcox v. Howland, </em>23 Pick., 167; <em>Stewart v. Petree, </em>55 N. Y., 621. That coupons attached to negotiable paper may draw interest after dishonor is held in some cases; <em>Gelpcke v. Dubuque, </em>1 Wal., 175; <em>Mills v. Jefferson, </em>20 Wis., 50; but these coupons are for many purposes a severable contract, and are in the nature of notes given in advance for interest to become due at a certain time. The authority thus to give a separate or severable contract for future interest was never doubted, and we have no occasion \u2014 even if we were so disposed\u2014 to question in this suit the soundness of the decisions that have held interest recoverable upon them. We are satisfied with the New York rule which forbids the compounding of interest by virtue of any provision in the obligation on which the interest accrues, and are therefore of opinion that the court erred in allowing compound interest on the obligation above mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">The second obligation was \u00e1 mortgage dated February 24, 1872, by which the mortgagor was to pay to the mortgagee the sum of six hundred and sixty-eight dollars and sixty-six cents \u201cone year after date with annual interest at ten per cent.\u201d This mortgage, it will be perceived, was given after the passage of the act of 1869 \u2014 Comp. L., \u00a7 1637 \u2014 by which it is provided \u201cThat when any installment of interest upon any note, bond, mortgage or other written contract shall, have become due, and the same shall remain unpaid, interest may be computed and collected on any such installment so due and unpaid, from the time at which it became due, at the same rate as specified in any such note, bond, mortgage or other written contract, not exceeding ten per cent; and if no rate of interest be specified in such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>instrument, then at the rate of seven per centum per annum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AqOf\">Neither principal nor interest was paid on this mortgage when it fell due, and the circuit court computed and allowed compound interest upon it. We think the court erred. There were no installments of interest to come due on this mortgage: it was payable, principal and interest, all at one time. Every day after the year was completed, the principal with interest up to that day was overdue; no more overdue at the end of the second year than it was on any day within the year preceding, and therefore no more payable in yearly installments than in monthly or weekly installments. The statute contemplates cases in which payments of interest fall due by themselves, and may be demanded separate from the principal; but that was not the case here: the principal and interest constituted at all times one debt, and any demand or suit for it must have embraced the whole. The words <em>\u201c </em>annual interest at ten per cent \u201d in such an obligation can mean no more than this; that the interest shall be computed at ten per centum per annum: they cannot be read as providing for successive installments of interest when the principal itself is to be paid at the end of the first year.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">Our conclusion is that the court erred in allowing anything more than <em>simple </em>interest on either obligation ; and the decree must be modified accordingly. The defendants will recover the costs of this court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b552-5\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
