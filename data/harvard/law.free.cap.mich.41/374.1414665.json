Johnson, 4 </em>Wend., 639; transcript of judgment to the circuit need not be obtained where it is shown on the trial that defendant has no real estate, <em>Thomas v. Dodge, </em>8 Mich., 51.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b391-6\"><em>William Sadler </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3e\">Remedy -at law is not exhausted until execution is returned unsatisfied, <em>Thayer v. Swift, </em>Har. Ch., 430; and it cannot be so returned until return day, <em>Steward v. Stevens, </em>id., 169; <em>Smith v. Thompson, </em>Walk. Ch., 1; <em>Bosman v.

This required the plaintiff to show that he had fully exhausted his remedy at law by the recovery of a judgment, the issue and return, at the expiration of the time fixed for a return, of an execution unsatisfied in whole or in part, and where permitted, the filing of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>transcript in the circuit court, and the issue and return of an execution therefrom. An offer to prove that such proceedings would be fruitless for want of property would not be a use of all legal means, and could not supply the place of the usual and proper remedies to enforce collection.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-3\">The judgment must be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b392-4\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
