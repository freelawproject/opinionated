Fitzhugh, </em>6 H. &amp; N, 502; <em>McConeghy v. McCaw, </em>31 Ala., 447; conversion consists in appropriating another\u2019s property to one\u2019s own use and beneficial enjoyment, or in its destruction, or in exercising dominion over it in defiance of the owner\u2019s right, or in withholding it under claim of title, 2 Greenl. Ev., \u00a7 642; <em>Salt Sprizigs Nat. Bazik v. Wheeler, </em>48 N. Y., 492.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b662-7\">Cooley, I.</author>\n<p id=\"AAP\">The plaintiff is the wife of Wildman Mills, and sues defendant in trover for seizing and selling on a tax warrant a quantity of hay which she claims as her own, to satisfy a tax assessed against her husband. \u25a0 The case was tried <em>by </em>the circuit judge without a jury, and is now before us on his finding of facts. The' finding shows that the hay was raised on plaintiff\u2019s land and stored in her barn, where defendant, who was tax collector, levied upon it. He did not, however, take manual possession of the hay or any part thereof, but advertised and sold it in the mow, and left it there. The plaintiff\u2019s possession was therefore in no manner disturbed by defendant\u2019s action, and the circuit judge finds that she afterwards sold three tons of the hay to a third person.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">On these facts the circuit judge was correct in holding that there was no conversion. Defendant never for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>a moment had practical domini\u00f3n over the hay, and never for a moment excluded the dominion of the plaintiff. What he did was, to assert a right to sell, and to make what, on plaintiff\u2019s view of the facts was a wholly ineffectual <em>sale; </em>but neither he nor the purchaser undertook to make the sale effectual. It was left to rest in words alone, and words alone cannot amount to a conversion. Had plaintiff acquiesced in the sale, or had the sale been of a growing crop of which the officer had taken all the possession the circumstances admitted, it might have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">There is another fatal defect in the plaintiff\u2019s case: the circuit judge does not find that she owned the hay. He finds facts from which that conclusion might be drawn, but it is by no means a necessary conclusion, and if it were, it does not belong to us to draw it.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">The judgment must be affirmed-with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b663-6\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
