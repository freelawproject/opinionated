This case was tried before Judge Cochrane who died before the bill of exceptions was settled. A new trial was granted by the Superior Court but the order was rescinded after the passage of Act No. 8 of 1879, on the supposition that this rendered it proper to have exceptions settled on the stenographer\u2019s minutes by the acting judge of that court, and the exceptions were thus settled. At the opening of this term the plaintiff in error moved to have the exceptions stricken out and a new trial granted under the decision in <em>Campau v. Judge of Superior Court, </em>40 Mich., 630.

We held it over on the idea that an important question might be involved concerning the validity and construction of the statute. But we cannot distinguish this case from those decided before. The new trial was granted when the party had an absolute right to it, which it was not competent to deprive him of against his will. We therefore are compelled to order .that a new trial be granted on the record as it stands without argument upon the special errors in the bill of exceptions, which the party was not compellable to have settled after the new trial had been once allowed him.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">The judgment must be reversed and a new trial granted, but with $20 costs instead of full costs of hearing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
