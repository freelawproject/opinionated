Hinchman and others against Charles A. Watson, William D. Wait and Thomas G. Sutherland, co-partners. The declaration was filed Feb. 10, 1879. Watson pleaded the general issue with notice of set off, March 1st. Wait did not appear, and his default was entered and made absolute March 13th. Watson\u2019s' plea was withdrawn in open court May 27th, and on June 2d judgment was entered for plaintiffs, which was set aside June 30th, without notice to Watson, and on motion of plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys, who were allowed to file an affidavit showing that in another suit brought by strangers to this record against these defendants in another court, the defendants filed Wait\u2019s affidavit for the appointment of a guardian <em>ad litem, </em>on the ground that he was a minor, being 20 years old June 19th, 1879. Plaintiffs then discontinued as to Wait and took judgment against the other defendants, who bring error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b733-4\"><em>Wisner &amp; Speed </em>for plaintiffs in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABF\">cited <em>Winslow v.

The affidavit as to the infancy of defendant Wait, simply recited the fact that in another court and cause defendant Wait had made an affidavit that he was an infant, for the purpose of having a guardian <em>ad litem </em>appointed. If such affidavit filed in this case could be considered as any evidence of Wait\u2019s infancy, of which at least there must be considerable doubt, it could not be conclusive as to his co-defendants, whose liability could not thus be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>enlarged, without an opportunity being given them to contest the fact. Nor could the judgment rendered against the three defendants be vacated upon this showing as to the infancy of one of them, the declaration amended setting up a cause of action against the two remaining defendants and a judgment rendered against them without notice to the attorneys who had appeared in the cause. ' We have repeatedly held that the rights of parties could not thus be changed or affected without giving them an opportunity to be heard. <em>Montgomery v.
