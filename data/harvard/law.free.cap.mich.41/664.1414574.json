Henkel gave evidence tending to show that the herring were stowed when received, in a cool cellar where they would, have remained good for months if in good condition when placed there, but that in about a week after they were received, some packages were examined and the fish were found to be soft and unfit for use, of which fact the local merchandise broker who had negotiated the sale and who had been for some -time in Welsh\u2019s employment, was notified at once., Henkel afterwards notified Welsh by letter. In order to show that defendant had acted in accordance with the usual custom in the receipt of this class of goods, a witness who was first shown to have been a grocer for many years and expert in handling fish, was asked what the rule or custom of merchants was in receiving, say Portland round herring, in half barrels, as to examining them after they were received, to ascertain their condition; whether they examined fish immediately upon the receipt upon the sidewalk; what their custom was about the receipt of fish; how soon after goods of this class are received they should be examined by the purchaser; and how soon after the receipt of such goods, they gave notice to the vendor if the goods were not as repres\u00e9nted. These questions were excluded. The jury found for the plaintiff and defendant brought error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b681-4\"><em>John IT.

Indeed a usage that should require a dealer at his peril to open and examine every package before' receiving it would be so burdensome and unreasonable that we might well say no one could be bound by it. It would be fixing a condition to a. business which would almost preclude its successful management. But the evidence offered on that point was wholly unobjectionable, and should have been received. If the defects were discovered within such time as under all the circumstances was not unreasonable, it is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">We think the circuit judge erred, also, in declining to charge that notice of the defects given to the agent or broker through whom the sale had been made to the plaintiff was notice to the plaintiff himself. The agency, presumptively at least, continued until the transaction was closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">The'judgment must be reversed with costs and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b682-7\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
