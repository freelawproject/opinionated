She moved to quash her arrest and suppress evidence, contesting the initial stop of her vehicle for ILU. The trial court granted the motion and denied the State's motion to reconsider. The State appeals. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b6 2 I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 3 At the hearing on defendant's motion, the sole witness was Trent Raupp, a McHenry County sheriff's deputy. He testified as follows. On February 11, 2017, at 1:40 a.m., he was on patrol in the area of U.S. Route 12 and Illinois Route 31. Defendant's Jeep was stopped in the left-turn lane at a light at the intersection. When the light turned green, she turned left onto Route 31. There was nothing unusual in the turn. Raupp followed defendant. She was not speeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 4 Raupp testified that, as defendant drove south, he observed her commit three lane violations. The first time, the Jeep's driver's-side tires rolled onto the yellow center line and touched it for a few seconds. The vehicle did not cross the line but returned to its lane. Raupp could not recall whether the move back was abrupt or smooth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 5 Raupp testified that the second time was when, after traveling some distance, the Jeep's passenger's-side tires touched the white fog line but never crossed over it. Raupp was asked, \"But it never left its lane; correct?\" He responded, \"Correct, sir.\" The touching was only \"temporary.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Jeep moved back toward the center of the lane without doing anything unusual; Raupp could not say that the move was abrupt. The third violation was when the Jeep's passenger's-side tires again rode on the white fog line. This was \"momentary.\" The tires never crossed over the line.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 6 Other than the three incidents of what he regarded as ILU, Raupp did not see defendant violate any traffic laws. He acknowledged that the stretch of road on which he followed defendant was not straight and had \"some twists and turns.\" Also, he acknowledged that the video system in his squad car had been inoperable since October 2016 and that he had not requested any repair. Based on the three incidents alone, he stopped the Jeep nearly a mile from where he first saw it. The trial court denied the State's motion for a directed finding, and the State rested without presenting additional evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 7 Defendant argued that Raupp had had no basis to stop her for touching a center or fog line. The State maintained that Raupp had had a reasonable suspicion to stop defendant for ILU. The State did not raise any other basis for the stop, such as erratic driving or weaving within a lane. It contended, however, that under\n   <em>\n    Heien v. North Carolina\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=574%20U.S.%2054\">\n    574 U.S. 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12593411\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/530/\">\n    135 S.Ct. 530\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12593411\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/530/\">\n    190 L.Ed.2d 475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014), even had Raupp gotten the law wrong, his mistake was reasonable and therefore did not invalidate the stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 8 The trial court held for defendant, explaining as follows.\n   <em>\n    Heien\n   </em>\n   is limited to extraordinary situations where the law gives police no guidance. Here,\n   <em>\n    People v. Hackett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20IL%20111781\">\n    2012 IL 111781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=361%20Ill.%20Dec.%20536\">\n    361 Ill.Dec. 536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=971%20N.E.2d%201058\">\n    971 N.E.2d 1058\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , provided guidance by\n   holding that a stop for ILU is valid if an officer sees a driver deviate from his or her established lane of travel. Raupp, however, saw no such deviation, because, the judge reasoned, \"[t]o touch the center line or the fog line is not to leave your lane. It is to remain within your lane, all be it [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] up against the outer-most [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] boundaries thereof.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 9 The State moved to reconsider. It argued in part that\n   <em>\n    Hackett\n   </em>\n   held that crossing the yellow line or the fog line violates the ILU statute but did not address whether touching either line without crossing it also violates the law. The State argued alternatively that, under\n   <em>\n    People v. Greco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1599208\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-app-3d/336/253/#p257\">\n    336 Ill.

The State also reiterated that at worst Raupp had made a reasonable mistake of law, validating the stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 10 The trial court denied the State's motion to reconsider. In a lengthy order, the court stated as follows. Raupp's testimony had been \"problematic. He either didn't remember important details or was flippant with [defendant's] attorney.\" \"In any event,\" however, \"Deputy Raupp never saw the Jeep's tires cross over either the yellow center line or the white fog line, nor did he observe any jerky or erratic driving corrections. The three lane-line touches occurred over a mile-long 'twist[ing] and turn[ing] stretch of road.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 11 The court's order continued as follows. Under\n   <em>\n    Hackett\n   </em>\n   , to stop defendant for ILU, Raupp had needed a reasonable suspicion that she had deviated from her lane. Whether she had been driving as nearly as practicable within her lane was not pertinent to reasonable suspicion.

That had not occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 12 Turning to the State's argument based on\n   <em>\n    Greco\n   </em>\n   , the court first found that it was forfeited, as the State had not raised it until its motion to reconsider. Second, the court held that the argument lacked merit anyway. Raupp had never testified that he saw defendant weaving within her lane or driving erratically, and he could not say that her deviations were abrupt or how long they had lasted. Moreover, she had been driving on a curved road in the darkness of the early morning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 13 Finally, the court held,\n   <em>\n    Heien\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    People v. Gaytan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20IL%20116223\">\n    2015 IL 116223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=392%20Ill.%20Dec.%20333\">\n    392 Ill.Dec. 333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=32%20N.E.3d%20641\">\n    32 N.E.3d 641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which adopted\n   <em>\n    Heien\n   </em>\n   's holding, did not apply. In those cases, the statutes involved were ambiguous; here, the ILU statute clearly required a lane deviation, which meant crossing over a line. Thus, Raupp's mistake of law\n   had not been reasonable. The court denied the motion to reconsider. The State appealed (see Ill. S. Ct. R. 604(a) (eff. July 1, 2017) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 14 II. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 15 On appeal, the State contends that (1) the trial court applied the wrong legal standard to the motion to quash and suppress; (2) the court erred in holding that there was no reasonable suspicion to stop defendant for ILU; (3) even if defendant had not actually violated the ILU statute, Raupp's mistake of law in believing otherwise was reasonable, thus giving him a reasonable suspicion to stop her; and (4) alternatively, under\n   <em>\n    Greco\n   </em>\n   , Raupp had a reasonable suspicion to stop defendant for driving erratically.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 16 The State's first argument need not concern us. We review the trial court's judgment, not its reasoning, and we may affirm on any basis called for by the record. See\n   <em>\n    People v. Cleveland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3474522\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-app-3d/342/912/#p915\">\n    342 Ill. App. 3d 912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 915,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=277%20Ill.%20Dec.%20486\">\n    277 Ill.Dec. 486\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=796%20N.E.2d%20201\">\n    796 N.E.2d 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003). The State's fourth argument need not concern us either. The State concedes that it forfeited the\n   <em>\n    Greco\n   </em>\n   argument by failing to timely raise it. See\n   <em>\n    Hanley v. City of Chicago\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3718728\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-app-3d/343/49/#p54\">\n    343 Ill. App. 3d 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 54,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=277%20Ill.%20Dec.%20140\">\n    277 Ill.Dec. 140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=795%20N.E.2d%20808\">\n    795 N.E.2d 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003). We decline to disregard the forfeiture, as the State's tardiness in raising the\n   <em>\n    Greco\n   </em>\n   argument denied defendant the opportunity to introduce evidence against it. See\n   <em>\n    In re Marriage of Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5569994\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/131/273/#p279\">\n    131 Ill. 2d 273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 279,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=137%20Ill.%20Dec.%2078\">\n    137 Ill.Dec. 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=545%20N.E.2d%20731\">\n    545 N.E.2d 731\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989). We note that the trial court found the argument both forfeited and meritless on the facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 17 We turn to the State's second and third arguments. The State contends that, under section 11-709(a) of the Illinois Vehicle Code ( 625 ILCS 5/11-709(a) (West 2016) ), a person commits ILU when his or her vehicle touches the yellow line or the fog line, even if it never crosses over the line. The State contends further that, even if section 11-709(a) does not make this conduct an offense, Raupp reasonably believed that it did and therefore under\n   <em>\n    Heien\n   </em>\n   had a proper basis to stop defendant. We disagree with both contentions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 18 Resolving the issues that the State's arguments raise requires us to construe section 11709(a). The construction of a statute is an issue of law, which we review\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Sylvester v. Industrial Comm'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"259070\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/197/225/#p232\">\n    197 Ill. 2d 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 232,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=258%20Ill.%20Dec.%20548\">\n    258 Ill.Dec. 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=756%20N.E.2d%20822\">\n    756 N.E.2d 822\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001).

Although the statute requires a driver to remain entirely within a single lane only as nearly as practicable, it is settled that an officer may stop a vehicle for driving outside its lane for no obvious reason, without further inquiry into practicability.\n   <em>\n    Hackett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20IL%20111781\">\n    2012 IL 111781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 27-28,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=361%20Ill.%20Dec.%20536\">\n    361 Ill.Dec. 536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=971%20N.E.2d%201058\">\n    971 N.E.2d 1058\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the issue here is whether Raupp had a reasonable suspicion that defendant failed to drive \"entirely within a single lane\" ( 625 ILCS 5/11-709(a) (West 2016) ), either when (1) her driver's-side tires touched, but did not cross, the yellow center line or (2) her passenger's-side tires touched, but did not cross, the white fog line.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 20 The statute does not define \"lane\" and does not specify whether either a center line or a fog line is part of the \"lane\" in which the driver is traveling.

Although the Code does not specifically define \"lane,\" it defines \"[l]aned roadway\" as \"[a] roadway which is divided into two or more clearly marked lanes for vehicular traffic.\" 625 ILCS 5/1-136 (West 2016). As a matter of established usage, a \"lane\" is \"a strip of roadway for a single line of vehicles.\" Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 652 (10th ed. 2001). As these definitions suggest, in common practice, a traffic \"lane\" is one in which vehicles legally and customarily are driven toward their destinations. Dividing lines or boundary lines, by contrast, are legally and customarily used only to change lanes, turn, or make other maneuvers (see 625 ILCS 5/11-709(a) (West 2016) (vehicle \"shall not be moved from such lane until the driver has first ascertained that such movement can be made with safety\") ). If a line's purpose is to divide two lanes, then a vehicle has not changed lanes until it has crossed the line.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 22 We note that, in\n   <em>\n    Hackett\n   </em>\n   , the supreme court quoted\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   : \"[W]hen a motorist crosses over a lane line and is not driving as nearly as practicable within one lane, the motorist has violated the [ILU] statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Hackett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20IL%20111781\">\n    2012 IL 111781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 16, 25, 26,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=361%20Ill.%20Dec.%20536\">\n    361 Ill.Dec. 536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=971%20N.E.2d%201058\">\n    971 N.E.2d 1058\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"55988\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/172/289/#p297\">\n    172 Ill. 2d at 297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=216%20Ill.%20Dec.%20658\">\n    216 Ill.Dec. 658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=665%20N.E.2d%201215\">\n    665 N.E.2d 1215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The rules issued by our Secretary of State's office, of which police officers as well as drivers are on notice, state in pertinent part as follows. \"Yellow center\n   <em>\n    lines separate lanes of traffic\n   </em>\n   moving in opposite directions.\" (Emphasis added.)

The issue was whether the police had a reasonable suspicion to stop the defendant for ILU after he drove his vehicle onto but not across the fog line.

The court noted the following considerations. First, a section of the Idaho Code required drivers to drive on the right half of the roadway but, although it excluded sidewalks, shoulders, berms, and rights-of-way, it made no mention of fog lines.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4188807\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/159/439/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 520 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Idaho%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2049-630\">\n    Idaho Code Ann. \u00a7 49-630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) ). Second, not every road has a fog line; for those that do not, the roadway extends to the curb. Thus, a road that does have a fog line would provide a narrower lane of travel than one that does not, an unreasonable disparity.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Idaho%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2049-630\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Idaho%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2049-630\">\n    at 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
