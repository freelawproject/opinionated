Larke with unlawful possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, and additionally alleged defendant was within 1000 feet of a school at the time of the offense. A La Salle County jury found defendant guilty of the offense charged. On appeal, defendant assigns error to the trial court's admission of other-crimes evidence, and the trial court's decision not to answer a question posed by the jury during deliberation. Additionally, defendant contends a recent amendment to section 407 of the Illinois Controlled Substances Act applies retroactively to defendant's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b6 2 I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 3 On June 16, 2015, the State charged Lamont L. Larke (defendant) with unlawful possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver ( 720 ILCS 570/401(c)(2) (West 2014) ) and alleged \"that the said defendant knowingly and unlawfully possessed with the intent to deliver 1 gram or more but less than 15 grams of a substance containing cocaine, a controlled substance.\" On September 8, 2015, the State indicted defendant on a second count of unlawful possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver ( 720 ILCS 570/407(b)(1) (West 2014) ) and alleged \"that the said defendant knowingly and unlawfully possessed with the intent to deliver more than 1 gram, but not more than 15 grams, of a substance containing cocaine, a controlled substance *** within 1,000 feet of Jefferson Grade School, in Ottawa, Illinois.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 4 On August 21, 2015, the State filed a motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   seeking to admit other-crimes evidence of defendant's prior conviction for unlawful possession of cannabis\n   with intent to deliver in Cook County case No. 10-CR-043260 for purposes of impeachment. On September 22, 2015, the trial court conducted a jury trial in the matter which ended in a hung jury and was declared a mistrial. On October 28, 2015, the State filed a second motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   seeking to admit other-crimes evidence of defendant's prior conviction in the State's case-in-chief as evidence of defendant's knowledge and/or intent. On February 8, 2016, immediately before defendant's second jury trial, the trial court conducted a hearing on the State's motion to admit the other-crimes evidence. During the hearing, the State argued the other crime's evidence was admissible to show defendant's knowledge and intent. Defendant objected to the admission of the other-crimes evidence and argued the prejudicial effect far outweighed the probative value. When ruling, the trial court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   \"THE COURT: All right. I have to balance the probative and prejudicial. Threshold question of similarities has been met.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Now the prejudicial. It's close in time and proximity to the previous conviction. No, I think it's probative. I think the probative value far outweighs the prejudicial. I'm going to permit them to use it with the caveat it must be a special limiting instruction and, State, you're going to have to watch that.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 To begin the trial, the State called Steve Hopkins, an officer with the Ottawa Police Department, to testify. Hopkins testified that at about 1:15 a.m. on May 30, 2015, he was patrolling the 1500 block of Columbus Street in Ottawa, Illinois. Hopkins observed what appeared to be people arguing next to a gas pump at the Circle K gas station. Hopkins's squad car was equipped with a video camera. The video camera was not activated because Hopkins did not turn on his overhead lights when pulling into the parking lot. Hopkins approached the car to make sure \"nothing was going on.\" At this time, Hopkins made contact with defendant, and Corporal Kyle Booras arrived at the scene. Defendant was sitting in the passenger's seat of the car with two or three others in the car. Hopkins noticed an open bottle of alcohol near where defendant was sitting. Defendant was asked to exit the vehicle, and Booras searched defendant. Booras found some baggies on defendant's person. Defendant told Hopkins the baggies were for personal use. A subsequent search of the vehicle yielded no further contraband or paraphernalia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 Next, the State called Booras to testify. On the night in question, Booras arrived at the Circle K to back up Hopkins. Booras walked up to the vehicle and made contact with defendant. Booras observed some open alcohol containers in the vehicle. Booras asked defendant to step out of the vehicle and asked defendant to pour out the alcohol. Defendant informed Booras that he had \"a little crack.\" Booras found bags that contained a white, chalky substance on defendant's person. Booras also located $239 in defendant's pants pocket. Booras did not find drug paraphernalia on defendant. Defendant told the officers that the white, chalky substance was his and was for his own personal use. Defendant also told the officers that the money in his pocket came from a security job he worked in Chicago. Booras never saw defendant selling anything.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 The parties agreed that if called to testify, Cynthia Koulis, a forensic scientist at the Illinois State Police crime lab, would testify that she received a plastic bag containing 28 smaller plastic bags. Koulis also received another bag that contained two smaller plastic bags. Each individual plastic bag contained an off-white, rock-like substance. Koulis tested 10 of the bags.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The 10 bags tested positive for the presence of cocaine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 The State called Marc Hoster, a detective with the Ottawa Police Department, to testify. Hoster was assigned to investigate drug-related crimes and had received specialized drug training. Hoster was familiar with the various weights at which different controlled substances were generally packaged and sold. Hoster testified that the 10 bags in question appeared \"to be exactly the same package in the same way, same size, tied off, knotted in the exact same way. Looks like they were all packaged at the same time or relatively the same time together.\" Hoster opined that the 10 bags were not for personal use. Additionally, Hoster testified that the Circle K gas station was 600 feet from Jefferson School, and the defense stipulated the distance was less than 1000 feet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9 Following Hoster's testimony, the court addressed the jury as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \"THE COURT: All right, ladies and gentlemen, we have reached a point in the trial where I'm going to read you an instruction. Please listen carefully because you're going to get it again but I need to read this instruction before the next piece of evidence comes in.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Evidence will be received that the defendant has been involved in an offense other than that charged in the indictment. This evidence has been received on the issue of the defendant's intent and knowledge and may be considered by you only for that limited purpose. It is for you to determine what weight should be given to this evidence on the issue of knowledge and intent.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Over defendant's objection, the State admitted a certified copy of defendant's conviction for unlawful possession of cannabis with the intent to deliver in Cook County case No. 10-CR043260. At the close of the State's evidence, the trial court denied defendant's motion for a directed verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 10 During closing argument, the State argued there was no dispute concerning the amount of cocaine or that defendant possessed the cocaine within 1000 feet of Jefferson Grade School. Thus, the only question before the jury was defendant's intent to deliver. The defense argued that the State did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant intended to deliver the drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 11 During deliberation, the jury sent a note to the court which read \"[i]f we have a hung jury, will the defendant be found not guilty on all charges?\" In a conversation between the State, defense counsel, and the court, the State suggested that the court instruct the jury to keep deliberating. Defense counsel suggested that the court instruct the jury that \"if they have a hung jury the defendant will not be found not guilty.\" The court brought the jury back into the courtroom and stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \"THE COURT: Ladies and gentlemen, at this time the best way I can answer this, you have your jury instructions. Continue on, okay? That's the best I can do for you.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 12 The jury returned a verdict of guilty to the charge of unlawful possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver within 1000 feet of a school. On April 8, 2016, the trial court sentenced defendant to served seven years in the Illinois Department of Corrections. Defendant filed no posttrial motions. Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 13 II. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 14 Defendant first argues the trial court erred when it allowed the State to introduce evidence of defendant's prior conviction for possession of cannabis with intent to deliver as other-crimes evidence of defendant's intent to deliver the cocaine\n   in the instant case. Specifically, defendant argues the other-crimes evidence should not have been admitted because there was no showing of a general threshold similarity between the facts of the prior conviction and the current charged offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 15 The State argues defendant forfeited his other-crimes evidence argument. Alternatively, the State contends the trial court's admission of the other-crimes evidence was not error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 16 At the outset, defendant acknowledges that his failure to include this issue in a posttrial motion amounts to forfeiture of the claim on appeal.\n   <em>\n    People v.

Defendant requests review pursuant to plain error. The doctrine of plain error is a limited and narrow exception to the rule of procedural default wherein a reviewing court may consider an unpreserved error: (1) where a clear and obvious error occurred and the evidence was so closely balanced that the error alone threatened to tip the scales of justice against defendant, regardless of the seriousness of the error; or (2) where a clear and obvious error occurred, and the error was so serious that it affected the fairness of defendant's trial and challenged the integrity of the judicial process regardless of the closeness of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    People v.

This court held that the information provided by the prosecutor, \"albeit the bare minimum, was sufficient for the trial court to determine, in its discretion, that a general threshold similarity existed between the facts of the prior offense and the facts of the current offense.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20N.E.3d%201189\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 20 Just like in\n   <em>\n    Watkins\n   </em>\n   , the prosecutor in this case presented the court with information that defendant's prior conviction was for possession of cannabis with intent to deliver, that his prior conviction was close in time to the current charge, and that defendant's prior conviction also involved possession of a drug with intent to deliver. The other-crimes evidence was reliable because it was a conviction. The fact that a different drug was involved in defendant's prior offense did not serve to make the prior offense and the current, charged offense dissimilar. See\n   <em>\n    United States v. Hernandez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1793452\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/84/931/#p935\">\n    84 F.3d 931\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 935 (7th Cir. 1996). Moreover, defendant's intent was an element of the crime charged in this case, thereby elevating the probative value of the other-crimes evidence. For these reasons, defendant cannot establish plain error as no clear and obvious error occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 21 Next, defendant argues the trial court erred by failing to give a direct answer to the jury's question about whether defendant would be found not guilty on all charges if there was a hung jury. Defendant argues the trial court should have answered \"no,\" and because the trial court did not answer the question directly, defendant was prejudiced and denied his right to a fair jury trial. Conversely, the State contends the trial court's actions were not in error because the jury was not entitled to receive a direct answer to their question where the question was irrelevant to whether defendant was guilty of the offense for which he was on trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 22 Defendant once again acknowledges his forfeiture of this issue. We consider whether the doctrine of plain error excuses defendant's forfeiture.

The disposition following a verdict, much like the nature of the punishment to follow a guilty verdict, involves matters the jurors are not called upon to deliberate. The consequences of a jury verdict do not involve points of law the jury must deliberate. Therefore, the trial court did not err by referring the jurors back to the instructions previously received.

Jan. 1, 2018). Defendant argues this amendment, which reduced the sentencing enhancement for delivery violations from a distance of 1000 feet to 500 feet of protected areas, applies retroactively to defendant's case. The State argues the statutory amendment to section 407 does not apply\n   retroactively to defendant's case, and asserts our supreme court's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    People v.

Aguilar\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"872475\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-app-3d/265/105/\">\n     265 Ill. App. 3d 105\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=202%20Ill.%20Dec.%20485\">\n     202 Ill.Dec. 485\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=637%20N.E.2d%201221\">\n     637 N.E.2d 1221\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1994). The instant case is factually distinguishable from\n    <em>\n     Aguilar\n    </em>\n    . Moreover, in its discretion, contrary to defendant's argument that the trial court made no factual findings, the trial court specifically balanced the evidence and found that the crimes were similar and close in time. The trial court also granted a special limiting instruction.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
