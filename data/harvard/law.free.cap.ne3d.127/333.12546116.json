In this case, Progressive sought a declaratory judgment that its insurance policy was in excess of United's policy in the matter of\n   <em>\n    Sabrina Stiffler, Administratrix of the Estate of Christopher Stiffler, Deceased, et al. v. Stevens Enterprises of Ohio, LLC, et al.\n   </em>\n   , Jackson County, Ohio Court of Common Pleas, Case Number 15 PI 0014 (\"Underlying Litigation\"). There, United and Progressive agreed to split the $1,350,000.00 indemnity payment-with each paying $675,000.00-but reserved the right to seek contribution from each other for amounts paid in excess of their respective policies. The trial court ultimately found that United's policy provided primary coverage for the liability claims while Progressive's policy provided excess coverage. Since both policies had a limit of $1 million, United was responsible for $1 million of the $1,350,000.00; and Progressive was responsible for the remainder. Therefore, the trial court ordered United to reimburse Progressive the amount of $325,000.00 plus statutory interest at a rate of 3% per annum beginning September 28, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b62} On appeal, United contends that its policy and Progressive's policy provided pro-rata coverage with respect to the Underlying Litigation and that both parties were responsible for a proportionate share of the indemnity payment. According to United, the trial court improperly construed Progressive's policy instead of applying the language as written. Progressive argues that the trial court's ruling was consistent with the intent of the parties to the Progressive policy and consistent with common industry practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b63} For the reasons that follow, we find that Progressive's policy provided excess coverage in the Underlying Litigation.

In support of its argument, Progressive attached a copy of the Progressive Policy, which includes an \"Automatic Termination\" provision and an \"Other Insurance\" provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b66} The Automatic Termination provision states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   If\n   <strong>\n    you\n   </strong>\n   obtain other insurance on an\n   <strong>\n    insured auto\n   </strong>\n   , any similar insurance provided by this policy will terminate as to that\n   <strong>\n    insured auto\n   </strong>\n   on the effective date of the other insurance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (Emphasis sic.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b67} Additionally, the Other Insurance provision provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   For any\n   <strong>\n    insured auto\n   </strong>\n   that is specifically described on the\n   <strong>\n    declarations page\n   </strong>\n   , this\n   policy provides primary coverage.

The Progressive Policy Provided Excess Coverage in the Underlying Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b613} We address United's first and second assignments of error in tandem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b614} In its first assignment of error, United alleges that the trial court erred in finding that the United Policy provided primary liability coverage while the Progressive Policy provided excess coverage for the Underlying Litigation. According to United, both parties were responsible for a proportionate share of the indemnity payment because the United Policy and the Progressive Policy provided pro-rata coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b615} In its second assignment of error, United alleges that the trial court improperly construed the language of the Progressive Policy rather than applying it as written. Based on the clear and unambiguous language of the Progressive Policy's Other Insurance provision, United argues that the Progressive Policy provided primary coverage for the Trailer. Once again, the Other Insurance provision states that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   [I]f the\n   <strong>\n    insured auto\n   </strong>\n   which is specifically described on the\n   <strong>\n    declarations page\n   </strong>\n   is a\n   <strong>\n    trailer\n   </strong>\n   , this policy will be primary only if the\n   <strong>\n    trailer\n   </strong>\n   is attached to an\n   <strong>\n    insured auto\n   </strong>\n   that is a power unit you own and is specifically described on the\n   <strong>\n    declarations page\n   </strong>\n   , and excess in all other circumstances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   (Emphasis sic.) Since the phrase \"insured auto,\" as used in the Progressive Policy, is defined as \"[a]ny auto specifically described on the declarations page,\" United argues that the Progressive Policy provided primary coverage for the Trailer since the Tractor remained listed on the policy's declarations page. However, United concedes that the August 16, 2014 issuance of the United Policy covering the Tractor terminated Progressive's coverage of the Tractor under Progressive's Automatic Termination provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b616} In contrast, Progressive believes that the trial court properly applied the Progressive Policy in a way that was consistent with the language of the policy and the intent of the parties. According to Progressive, the purpose of the Other Insurance provision was to render trailer coverage in excess unless the power unit pulling the trailer was an auto owned by the policyholder and insured only by Progressive. This is consistent with other provisions of the Progressive Policy, which provide that \"[a]n insured auto and any trailer or trailers attached thereto shall be deemed to be one auto with respect to our Limit of Liability.\" (Emphasis deleted.) Progressive agrees that United's Policy, which it issued on August 16, 2014 and which covered the Tractor, terminated Progressive's coverage of the Tractor under Progressive's Automatic Termination provision. Since the Progressive Policy no longer covered the Tractor at the time of the Accident, Progressive alleges that coverage for the Trailer was rendered excess.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b617} Insurance policies cannot be read in an overly circumscribed fashion.\n   <em>\n    Gomolka v.

Although the Tractor remained on the Progressive Policy's declarations page, both parties agree that the issuance of the United Policy on August 16, 2014 terminated Progressive's coverage of the Tractor under Progressive's Automatic Termination provision. Since the Trailer's power unit was no longer insured by Progressive, it logically follows from the language and intent of the Progressive Policy that the trailer coverage was rendered in excess.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Calvalege\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1993%20WL%20535677\">\n    1993 WL 535677\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3. Therefore, we find that the United Policy provided primary liability coverage while the Progressive Policy provided excess coverage for the Underlying Litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b620} Accordingly, we overrule United's first and second assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Progressive Is Entitled to Reimbursement from United in the Amount of $325,000 Plus Statutory Interest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b621} In its third assignment of error, United alleges that the trial court erred in holding that United is required to pay\n   $325,000.00 in contribution plus interest to Progressive. According to United, the trial court should have found that United and Progressive's policies were co-primary and provided pro-rata coverage with respect to the Underlying Litigation. Therefore, United argues that the parties properly split the $1,350,000.00 indemnity payment, with each paying $675,000.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b622} However, we found that Progressive's coverage was in excess, not co-primary. Since both policies had a limit of $1 million, we find that United was responsible for $1 million of the $1,350,000.00 indemnity payment; and Progressive was responsible for the remaining $350,000.00. Since Progressive paid in excess of $350,000.00, it is entitled to reimbursement by United. Therefore, we affirm the damages award in the amount of $325,000.00 plus statutory interest at a rate of 3% per annum beginning September 28, 2016, the date of the Settlement Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b623} Accordingly, we overrule United's third assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b624} Having overruled all three of United's assignments of error, we therefore affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Harsha, J. and Abele, J.: Concur in Judgment and Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    The Progressive Policy refers to this vehicle as a \"1999 Intl 990.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    The United Policy refers to this vehicle as a \"1999 International 9900 Tractor.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
