For the following reasons, we reverse and remand this matter to the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} This case arises from a failed business transaction between 180 and CAM. CAM intended to purchase Calypso Distribution Services, Ltd. (\"Calypso\"), a logistics company, and the industrial facility that Calypso used to operate its business.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In a simultaneous transaction, CAM planned to enter into a sale-leaseback arrangement\n   with a third party. In this arrangement, CAM would sell the Innis Road property to the third party and enter into a long-term lease for the property. CAM needed the money from the sale of the Innis Road property to fund its purchase of Calypso and the property itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} After entering into a letter of intent with Calypso, CAM hired plaintiff-appellee, Alterra Real Estate Advisors, LLC (\"Alterra\"), to market the Innis Road property. Pursuant to the listing agreement between Alterra and CAM, Alterra would receive a commission of four to six percent of the gross sale price upon the closing of the sale-leaseback transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In June 2014, 180 expressed interest in the Innis Road property. Bryan Norton, 180's chief operating officer, met with Jim Pack, CAM's chief executive officer and president, in July 2014. During that meeting, Pack told Norton that he intended to integrate Calypso with his trucking company and invest at least one million dollars in the combined businesses. Impressed with Pack's pitch, Norton and his partner, Mark Weber, decided to do business with Pack.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On July 25, 2014, 180 and CAM entered into a purchase agreement whereby 180 agreed to pay $8.5 million to purchase the Innis Road property. The agreement also provided that 180 would lease the property back to CAM. In accordance with the agreement's terms, 180 deposited $170,000 with an escrow agent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Section 3 of the purchase agreement mandated a due-diligence period in which 180 could conduct \"any and all feasibility studies, inspections, and all other tests, studies or analysis, which in [180's] sole discretion, it determine[d] [was] necessary in order to determine the feasibility of the transaction.\" (Ex. 1, Norton Dep.) If 180 \"determine[d] in its sole discretion that the [Innis Road property] [was] not appropriate for its use in accordance with its intentions or if [180 was] unsatisfied for any reason with the results of any such inspections, tests, studies or analysis,\" 180 could terminate the purchase agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Upon termination of the purchase agreement, the purchase agreement would be \"deemed null and void,\" none of the parties would have any further obligations to any other party or any third party, and the escrow agent was required to return 180's deposit to 180.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 7} After conducting its initial due diligence, 180 sent CAM a letter, dated September 25, 2014, identifying the contingencies that CAM had to satisfy for the deal to close. In relevant part, the letter stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   As we have previously discussed and agreed, [180's] Purchase of the [Innis Road property] is contingent on a revision to the Purchase Agreement and Lease that reflects [CAM's] commitment of one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) as an additional security deposit for [CAM's] performance of the Lease.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Further, pursuant to Paragraph 3 of the Purchase Agreement, [180] requests that the following repairs and issues be addressed before closing:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 Repair and replacement of the asphalt pavement;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 Repair and replacement of the concrete pavement;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 Recompacting of the gravel lot;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 Removal of the inactive generator;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 Repair and replacement of the building fa\u00e7ade;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 Repair and [r]eplacement of the roof;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 Repair and replacement of broken bathroom fixtures, including: toilets, urinals, and sinks;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 Repair and replacement of flooring materials to address holes or other safety hazards;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 Removal of the two abandoned boilers * * *;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 Possible replacement of current warehouse lights with new energy efficient fixtures.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (Ex. 2, Norton Dep.) While CAM agreed to address some of these issues, it did not agree to address others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 8} In the meantime, 180 was encountering difficulty obtaining financing to purchase the Innis Road property. In an email to Pack dated November 18, 2014, 180 attempted to restructure the terms of the parties' deal. 180 explained that almost all lenders and financiers it had approached had flatly rejected the deal \"once they analyze[d] the earnings of the tenant as well as the comps and other characteristics of the building.\" (Ex. 3, Norton Dep.) 180 then set forth a broad proposal incorporating new terms for the sale-leaseback transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 9} In conversations discussing the restructuring, Norton learned for the first time that Pack did not have one million dollars to invest in the prospective post-purchase company. Norton's partner, Weber, became angry when Norton told him that Pack did not have the promised investment funds. To 180, the million-dollar investment was a key aspect of the sale-leaseback transaction because that investment would secure the new company's sustainability, and consequently, ensure the company's ability to pay rent on the Innis Road property. Norton told Pack that 180 had wasted \"a very significant amount of time and money on [the] acquisition\" of the Innis Road property and Weber had \"given some serious consideration to suing [CAM] based on the way [Pack] ha[d] behaved in [the] transaction.\" (Norton Dep. at 43.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Ultimately, CAM rejected 180's proposed restructuring of the transaction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   At that point, the deal fell apart. Norton then asked Pack to release 180's $170,000 deposit so the escrow agent could return the deposit to 180. Pack responded, \"[O]kay[,] [i]f you want us to release the escrow [deposit], then * * * we need a release because you previously threatened to sue us.\" (Apr. 6, 2017 Tr. at 64.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On December 23, 2014, 180 and CAM entered into a contract entitled \"Settlement Agreement and Release of Claims.\" In that agreement, both parties agreed to release and discharge the other from any claims arising from or related to the purchase agreement or the Innis Road property. In relevant part, the recitals set forth in the agreement provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   This Agreement is entered into with reference to the following facts:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   A. [CAM] entered into an agreement with * * * the current owner of the real property commonly known as 2035 Innis Road, Columbus, Ohio, 43224 (the \"Property\") to acquire the Property in conjunction with [CAM's] acquisition of the Calypso Logistics operating company;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   B. On or about July 25, 2014, [CAM] entered into a Purchase Agreement with 180 Industrial (the \"Purchase Agreement\") to sell the Property and all of the associated right, title and interest in and to all buildings and other improvements on or within the Property to 180 Industrial;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   C. Consistent with the Purchase Agreement, 180 Industrial completed its due diligence on [CAM] and the Property and determined that it could not proceed to close under the terms set forth in the Purchase Agreement;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   D. On or about November 18, 2014, 180 Industrial sent [CAM] an email proposal setting forth new terms under which 180 Industrial would close on its acquisition of the Property;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   E. The Parties were unable to reach agreement on revised terms and the Parties agreed to terminate the Purchase Agreement * * *[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   (Ex. 5, Norton Dep.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Additionally, the settlement agreement and release contained a fee-shifting provision. Section M of the agreement stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   If any action is brought to enforce this Agreement, or is brought in connection with any dispute arising out of this Agreement or the claims that are the subject of this Agreement, the prevailing Party shall be entitled to recover damages, attorney's fees, and other costs incurred in such litigation that they may prove are the direct and proximate result of any breach, in addition to any other relief which that Party may be entitled to by law or in equity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 13} After the parties executed the settlement agreement and release, Norton informed Jason Sipos, Calypso's president, that the purchase agreement between it and CAM had terminated. Sipos asked whether Norton would be interested in entering a sale-leaseback transaction directly with Calypso. This conversation led to Calypso and Triple Net Acquisitions, LLC (\"Triple Net\") executing a purchase agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under that agreement, Triple Net would purchase the Innis Road property for $3.5 million and Calypso would enter into a long-term, triple-net lease with Triple Net.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Pack discovered that Calypso was pursuing a sale-leaseback transaction with Triple Net in March 2015. Pack believed that \"180 had went to Calypso [ ] directly and it reformed this deal and cut us out of it.\" (Apr. 6, 2017 Tr. at 140.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 15} On May 26, 2015, CAM and Alterra filed suit against 180.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the complaint, CAM contended that the settlement agreement and release was void and/or voidable because it resulted from fraud in the inducement, and CAM sought a declaratory judgment to that effect. CAM also asserted a claim for fraud and, with Alterra, claims for breach of contract and tortious interference with a business and contractual relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 16} In essence, plaintiffs maintained that 180 misrepresented its reasons for terminating the purchase agreement. According to plaintiffs, 180 lied when it told CAM that it could not purchase the Innis Road property under the original contractual terms and when it proposed revised terms for the purchase. Plaintiffs contended that these alleged misrepresentations were a sham that 180 devised to trigger the demise of the parties' deal so 180 could contract directly with Calypso.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Approximately two months after plaintiffs filed the complaint, 180 moved for summary judgment. Plaintiffs responded with a Civ.R. 56(F) motion that requested\n   a time extension in order to conduct discovery. In an entry dated September 9, 2015, the trial court granted plaintiffs 60 days to pursue discovery into whether 180 fraudulently induced the execution of the settlement agreement and release. Plaintiffs used this additional time to complete written discovery and take Norton's deposition. Using this discovery, plaintiffs opposed the motion for summary judgment in a memorandum filed December 8, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 18} On March 29, 2016, the trial court issued a decision granting 180's motion for summary judgment. In short, the trial court found that 180 had not induced CAM to enter the settlement agreement and release. The trial court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   [CAM] requested the release and was not \"induced\" into it. The Court acknowledges [CAM] did so because it was unaware that 180 Industrial and Calypso were allegedly improperly acting in concert to close it out of the deal, but [CAM] has not shown how 180 Industrial's purported improper conduct induced it into seeking a mutual release of claims. Again, 180 Industrial was only seeking to terminate the purchase contract; [CAM] demanded that the parties enter into a release agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Even construing the evidence in a light most favorable to [CAM], any fraudulent conduct was committed in connection with the real estate purchase contract, not with the execution of the release agreement. There are insufficient circumstances from which reasonable minds could conclude that 180 Industrial somehow induced Plaintiff into asking for a release. Therefore, the Court finds, as a matter of law, that the release is not void for fraudulent inducement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   (Mar. 29, 2016 Decision and Entry at 13-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Because the release was valid and enforceable, the trial court found that it barred CAM from asserting its claims against 180, and 180 was entitled to judgment on those claims as a matter of law. The trial court also ruled that 180 was entitled to summary judgment on Alterra's claims because Alterra had no contractual relationship with 180 or Calypso. Finally, the trial court found that 180 could move for an award of attorney fees and costs under the fee-shifting provision in the settlement agreement and release because 180 was the prevailing party in the instant action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 20} 180 then moved for an award of attorney fees and costs totaling $50,563.05. 180 supported its request with its attorneys' affidavits, copies of billing records, and an expert affidavit testifying to the reasonableness of the attorney fees sought. Immediately prior to the hearing on the motion for attorney fees and costs, 180 filed supplemental affidavits setting forth additional attorney fees and costs. In total, 180 sought $70,588.27 in attorney fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 21} At the fees hearing, CAM presented the testimony of its own expert witness, who opined that the reasonable amount of fees due 180's attorneys was only $25,000. In an entry dated November 17, 2016, the trial court ordered CAM to pay $30,599.44, which consisted of $28,500 in attorney fees, $1,500 in expert expenses, and $559.44 in litigation expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 22} While 180 was pursuing an award under the fee-shifting provision of the settlement agreement and release, it also moved for sanctions against CAM, Alterra, and their attorneys under R.C. 2323.51. 180 argued that: (1) CAM's assertion of fraudulent inducement and Alterra's claims for breach of contract and tortious interference were not warranted under existing law or a good faith argument for a change in the law, (2) plaintiffs made false statements in their complaint and memorandum\n   in opposition to summary judgment, and (3) plaintiffs' counsel concealed Pack's presence at Norton's videoconference deposition. 180 contended that all this conduct was frivolous under R.C. 2323.51(A)(2)(a) and justified an award of reasonable attorney fees and costs. Additionally, in conjunction with its motion for sanctions, 180 filed a motion seeking leave to conduct discovery to obtain additional evidence regarding plaintiffs' alleged frivolous conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 23} In a decision and entry dated July 14, 2016, the trial court set a hearing date for 180's motion for sanctions and denied 180's motion for leave to conduct discovery. The sanctions hearing ultimately occurred before a magistrate. Prior to that hearing, the magistrate limited the time for the hearing to three hours, thus giving each side one and one-half hours in which to present its case. Both Pack and Norton testified at the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 24} On December 4, 2017, the magistrate issued a decision finding that neither plaintiffs nor their counsel engaged in frivolous conduct. Consequently, the magistrate recommended that the trial court deny 180's motion for sanctions. 180 objected to the magistrate's decision. In a decision and entry dated January 10, 2018, the trial court overruled 180's objections and adopted the magistrate's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 25} 180 now appeals the January 10, 2018 judgment, and it assigns the following errors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   [1.] THE TRIAL COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION IN ITS AWARD OF ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS BECAUSE IT DID NOT DETERMINE A REASONABLE NUMBER OF HOURS OR A REASONABLE HOURLY RATE, DID NOT FOLLOW ITS OWN FLAWED METHODOLOGY, AND AWARDED AN AMOUNT OF FEES AND COSTS THAT WAS SO UNREASONABLY LOW THAT IT SHOCKS THE CONSCIENCE.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   [2.] THE TRIAL COURT ERRED AS A MATTER OF LAW IN DENYING DEFENDANT/APPELLANT'S MOTION FOR SANCTIONS PURSUANT TO R.C. 2323.51(A)(2)(a)(i)-(iv) BY NOT FINDING PLAINTIFFS' ACTIONS WERE FRIVOLOUS IN LIGHT OF EXISTING LAW.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   [3.] THE TRIAL COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION IN DENYING DEFENDANT/APPELLANT'S REQUESTS FOR DISCOVERY AND ITS MOTION FOR SANCTIONS PURSUANT TO R.C. 2323.51(A)(2)(a)(i)-(iv) [and in] MAKING RULINGS ON FACTUAL ISSUES WHICH WERE AGAINST SOUND, REASONABLE, AND LEGAL DECISIONMAKING.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 26} By its first assignment of error, 180 initially argues that the trial court erred in not using the lodestar method to calculate the amount of reasonable attorney fees owed 180 under the fee-shifting provision of the settlement agreement and release. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Generally, Ohio follows the \"American Rule,\" which precludes a prevailing party in a civil action from recovering attorney fees as a part of the costs of litigation.\n   <em>\n    Wilborn v.

However, the trial court did not perform the first step of the lodestar method, i.e., multiplying the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation by a reasonable hourly rate. The trial court, instead, generally addressed many of the Prof.Cond.R. 1.5(a) factors and then summarily concluded, \"as a round number it's going to be $30,000 that I find is reasonable, including the expert and costs.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Sept. 1, 2016 Tr. at 56.) Although the trial court later reconsidered its initial ruling in a decision dated January 18, 2017, that decision does not further illuminate the trial court's fee analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Moreover, we cannot adduce from the evidence how a calculation of reasonable attorney fees using the lodestar method would result in an award of $30,000. As we stated above, 180 provided the trial court with invoices totaling $70,588.27. Plaintiffs presented an expert witness to contradict that evidence, but the expert did not opine regarding the total number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation or reasonable hourly rates for the attorneys who worked those hours. While the expert testified about reasons to reduce the hours billed, he did not quantify the exact number of hours to cut. Given the expert's failure to supply basic information necessary for calculating reasonable attorney fees using the lodestar method, his testimony provides no insight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 32} Consequently, in the final analysis, we conclude that the trial court's approach to determining reasonable attorney fees precludes any meaningful appellate review. We thus sustain 180's first assignment of error to the extent that it advances error in the application of the lodestar method.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Our ruling on the first part of 180's first assignment of error moots the remaining two arguments contained within the assignment. We, therefore, will not address whether the trial court inconsistently applied its own methodology or whether the amount of attorney fees and costs awarded was so unreasonably low that it shocks the conscience.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Because 180's second and third assignments of error both address rulings related to the motion for sanctions, we will discuss those two assignments of error together. We will begin our review with 180's argument that the trial court erred in denying it leave to conduct discovery into plaintiffs' and their attorneys' alleged frivolous conduct.

In gauging materiality, a court applies an objective standard that generally precludes the consideration of any idiosyncratic qualities of the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Saxe\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   {\u00b6 47} We begin our review of whether 180 induced CAM by considering CAM's stated reasons for demanding the execution of a mutual release before it would release the escrowed funds to 180. CAM offers two reasons: (1) 180 stated that it could not close under the terms of the purchase agreement, and (2) 180 stated that it would close under the revised terms set out in the November 18, 2014 email. Pack testified that he relied on these two representations when executing the settlement agreement and release. Mere reliance, however, is insufficient to show inducement. CAM also had to prove that those representations were material, i.e., they would likely motivate a reasonable person to enter into a release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   {\u00b6 48} CAM has never attempted to prove materiality. Instead, CAM dodges the issue altogether by arguing that 180 induced the settlement agreement and release because, but for 180's representations, the agreement would not exist. This argument completely ignores that CAM, not 180, demanded the release. Thus, for CAM's \"but for\" connection to exist, 180's representations must be proven material to the creation of the release, that is, the representations would likely lead a reasonable person in CAM's shoes to demand and execute a release. In other words, absent materiality, there is no basis for concluding that 180's representations induced the release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   {\u00b6 49} CAM's avoidance of the materiality issue likely stems from its inability to make the required showing. Nothing in the representations at issue would influence a reasonable person to act as CAM did. 180 essentially told CAM that it would not purchase the Innis Road property under the parameters of the original deal, but it would proceed under modified terms. Nothing in the content of that statement would cause a reasonable person to decide that he or she needed to demand a release for protection from future litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   {\u00b6 50} Indeed, Pack never testified that the representations at issue influenced or persuaded him to require the release. Pack instead stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   Mr. Norton contacted me and said, [\"][H]ey, we've got a large and substantial amount of money that's in the escrow [account] to do this project and * * * you know, we're * * * done. We can't * * * do it. I'd like you to release that escrow [deposit].[\"]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   And at that point, I said, [\"][O]kay[,] [i]f you want us to release the escrow [deposit], then * * * we need a release because you previously threatened to sue us.[\"]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   (Apr. 6, 2017 Tr. at 63-64.) While Pack broadly claimed that he was duped into requesting the release, he did not explain how or why the representations at issue induced him to make that request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   {\u00b6 51} Prior to the inception of this action, CAM had all the facts it needed to determine whether 180 induced it into the release. Under the circumstances giving rise to this action, CAM simply could not establish that 180's alleged misrepresentations were material. The trial court recognized that in its summary judgment decision, where it ruled in 180's favor because CAM failed to \"show[ ] how 180 Industrial's purported improper conduct induced it into seeking a mutual release of claims.\" (Mar. 29, 2016 Decision and Entry at 14.) We thus conclude that no reasonable attorney would initially assert or continue to pursue the theory of fraud in the inducement. Consequently, CAM and its attorneys engaged in frivolous conduct as defined in R.C. 2323.51(A)(2)(a)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   {\u00b6 52} 180 raises additional grounds for finding that CAM's and its attorneys' conduct was frivolous. However, \"a party only needs a finding of frivolousness under one of the four definitions [set forth in R.C. 2323.51(A)(2)(a) ] for an award of attorney fees.\"\n   <em>\n    Southard Supply, Inc. v. Anthem Contrs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist. No. 16AP-545,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017-Ohio-7298\">\n    2017-Ohio-7298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203602073\">\n    2017 WL 3602073\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 33. Our conclusion that CAM and its attorneys engaged in frivolous conduct under R.C. 2323.51(A)(2)(a)(ii) entitles 180 to the relief it requests on appeal: a reversal and remand of this matter for the trial court to consider whether to grant 180 reasonable attorney fees. Consequently, 180's other grounds for finding frivolousness are moot, and we do not address them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   {\u00b6 53} Next, 180 argues that the trial court erred in not addressing its argument that Alterra and its attorneys engaged in frivolous conduct under R.C. 2323.51(A)(2)(a)(ii). We agree. Although 180 raised this argument in its motion for sanctions and its objections to the magistrate's decision, the trial court did not consider it. The trial court erred in disregarding the argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   {\u00b6 54} Given our rulings, we sustain 180's second assignment of error because (1) the trial court erred in failing to find that CAM and its attorneys engaged in frivolous conduct under R.C. 2323.51(A)(2)(a)(ii), and (2) the trial court erred in failing to address 180's request for sanctions against Alterra and its attorneys. We overrule 180's third assignment of error to the extent that it challenges the denial of discovery and the imposition of a time limitation for the sanctions hearing. We find that assignment of error moot in all other respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   {\u00b6 55} For the forgoing reasons, we sustain in part and find moot in part the first assignment of error, we sustain the second assignment of error, and we overrule in part and find moot in part the third assignment of error. We reverse the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, and we remand this matter so the court may: (1) set forth its calculations and reasoning for determining the amount of reasonable attorney fees and costs owed to 180 under the fee-shifting provision of the settlement agreement and release; (2) decide whether and, if necessary, how much reasonable attorney fees and costs are due to 180 for CAM's and its attorneys' frivolous conduct; and (3) determine whether Alterra and its attorneys engaged in any frivolous conduct\n   and, if so, whether and, if necessary, how much reasonable attorney fees and costs are due to 180 for that conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <em>\n    Judgment reversed; cause remanded with instructions.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   TYACK and SADLER, JJ., concur\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    Throughout this decision, we will refer to Calypso's industrial facility as the \"Innis Road property.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    According to Pack, Norton did not mention suing CAM until CAM refused 180's proposal to restructure the transaction.
