The defendant contends that the police did not have probable cause to arrest him and that evidence seized from his vehicle and statements made to the police following his improper arrest should have been suppressed. Because the defendant's arrest was supported by probable cause, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b6 2 I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 3 The defendant was indicted on one count of unlawful possession with intent to deliver 15 grams or more but less than 100 grams of cocaine ( 720 ILCS 570/401(a)(2)(A) (West 2012) ). The defendant filed a motion to quash his arrest and suppress physical evidence and statements obtained following his arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 4 The following evidence was established at the hearing on the motion to quash and suppress. Douglas Sanborn testified that he was a police officer with the Bensenville Police Department, assigned to the Du Page Metropolitan Enforcement Group (DuMEG) and working in undercover narcotics investigations. As part of his investigations, he had participated in and witnessed hundreds of drug transactions. In about 50 of those investigations, he used information provided by individuals in police custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 5 On September 16, 2013, Officer Sanborn was working with an individual who\n   was in custody for having possessed drugs with the intent to deliver. This confidential informant identified a person named \"Chilango,\" who was later identified as the defendant, as someone who could provide cocaine. At about 4 p.m., at Officer Sanborn's direction, the informant placed a phone call to Chilango. Officer Sanborn was able to hear both sides of the conversation. Although the conversation was in Spanish, Officer Sanborn testified that he spoke fluent Spanish. The informant asked Chilango for five ounces of cocaine. Chilango stated that he could provide only two ounces right away or five ounces later. A short time later, the informant called Chilango again and stated that he could wait to get five ounces. They also discussed meeting at a BP gas station at 149 East Ogden Avenue in Hinsdale to conduct the drug sale. Chilango stated that he would call when he had the cocaine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 6 Officer Sanborn testified that he then met with other officers involved in the investigation to go over the phone conversation and make surveillance plans. Later, Officer Sanborn directed the informant to call Chilango again. Officer Sanborn again heard both sides of the conversation. Chilango told the informant that he was waiting to get the cocaine but that they could meet at the gas station in about an hour. About a half-hour later, Chilango called the informant and Officer Sanborn overheard him say that he was on the way to the gas station. At about 7 p.m., the informant received another call from Chilango, who asked for directions to the gas station. Chilango called again for more directions a few minutes later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 7 Shortly after 7 p.m., the informant and Officer Sanborn were parked with a view of the gas station. The informant told Officer Sanborn that he saw Chilango arriving at the gas station in a Toyota Rav 4. Officer Sanborn observed the defendant pull into the gas station and park at a gas pump. Officer Sanborn identified the defendant in court as the person he saw in the vehicle at the gas station. The defendant had not committed any traffic violations when he pulled into the gas station. Officer Sanborn believed that the defendant was bringing cocaine to the gas station. After parking, the defendant exited his vehicle and went into the gas station. The informant received another call from Chilango at about 7:10 p.m. Chilango stated that he was at the gas station. At that point, Officer Sanborn alerted surveillance officers, who went into the station and placed the defendant in custody. Officer Sanborn then had the informant call Chilango's phone number, and one of the surveillance officers answered the defendant's phone. The defendant was transported to the police station. At the police station, Officer Sanborn overheard the defendant talking and recognized the defendant's voice as the voice of Chilango.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 8 Andrew Anselm testified that he was a sergeant with the Illinois State Police and was on assignment to the North Central Narcotics Task Force. Before that, he was assigned to DuMEG. In that capacity, on September 16, 2013, Officer Sanborn had informed him about the phone conversations between the informant and Chilango. Thereafter, Sergeant Anselm and other surveillance officers went to the BP gas station at 149 East Ogden Avenue in Hinsdale and parked by the gas station building. Sergeant Anselm was in communication with Officer Sanborn during this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 9 At about 7 p.m., Sergeant Anselm saw a silver Toyota Rav 4 pull into the gas station and park. Officer Sanborn told Sergeant Anselm that the informant had identified the driver of the Rav 4 as Chilango. Sergeant Anselm saw the defendant park his vehicle at a pump and walk into the gas station. Sergeant Anselm then gave a signal,\n   and he and other surveillance officers placed the defendant in custody. The defendant was searched at the time of his arrest but the officers did not find any contraband on the defendant's person. Officer Sanborn had the informant call Chilango's phone. After that, the defendant's cell phone began to ring. Sergeant Anselm answered the phone and spoke to Officer Sanborn. About 30 seconds later, Sergeant Anselm walked to the defendant's vehicle, where he saw a clear plastic bag, containing a white chalky substance, on the front passenger seat. Based on his training and experience, Sergeant Anselm knew that it was cocaine, so he opened the door and confiscated it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 10 Following argument, the trial court found that the defendant was placed under arrest inside the gas station. The trial court further found that there was probable cause to arrest the defendant because the police knew of the specific agreement between the informant and the defendant for the delivery of five ounces of cocaine at a specific location. Thus, when the defendant arrived at the prearranged location, there was probable cause to arrest him. After the arrest, Sergeant Anselm found the cocaine in plain view in the defendant's vehicle, which was parked 20 to 30 feet away. The trial court acknowledged that a mere arrest does not authorize a search of any property at any location. However, the vehicle was close by and the cocaine was in plain view. The trial court found that this was no different than if the defendant had been arrested standing outside his vehicle. The trial court found that the cocaine was lawfully seized from the defendant's vehicle. The trial court thus denied the defendant's motion to quash and suppress. The trial court also denied the defendant's motion to reconsider.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 11 The case proceeded to a bench trial. At trial, Officer Sanborn and Sergeant Anselm testified consistently with their testimony at the suppression hearing. The parties stipulated that the substance retrieved from the defendant's vehicle tested positive for 67.191 grams of cocaine. Detective Vicente Roman testified that he interviewed the defendant at the police station following his arrest. The defendant told Detective Roman that he agreed to sell the cocaine to the informant because he was unemployed and needed to make some money. In a written statement, the defendant indicated that he \"[w]as grabbed trying to give reduced drugs for money but [he] was unable to do it because the police recognized [him] and took [him] into the police station * * * [he] was going to profit $750.\" Following the bench trial, the trial court found the defendant guilty of possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance. The trial court denied the defendant's motion for a new trial or for an acquittal. The trial court sentenced the defendant to six years' imprisonment. The defendant filed a timely notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 12 II. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 13 On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to quash and suppress. The defendant argues that the police did not have probable cause to arrest him. The defendant further argues that, because his arrest was not valid, the evidence seized from his vehicle and the subsequent statements to the police should have been suppressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 14 In reviewing a ruling on a motion to quash and suppress, we apply a two-part standard.\n   <em>\n    People v.

Those cases are distinguishable from the present case. Although in those cases the informants' track records of providing information were critical to establishing the informants' reliability or lack of it, those cases did not involve an arranged purchase of narcotics of which the police had first-hand knowledge.\n   <em>\n    Chavez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"79338\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-app-3d/327/18/\">\n    327 Ill.

In this case, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Chavez\n   </em>\n   , Officer Sanborn listened as the informant and the defendant set up a specific drug transaction, and, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Halmon\n   </em>\n   , the informant was not anonymous and much of the information was corroborated prior to the defendant's arrest. As there were other factors supporting the informant's reliability, a track record of supplying reliable information was not critical.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 21 The defendant also argues that the informant was unreliable because he did not know the defendant's real name.

However, the defendant's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Crespo\n   </em>\n   is unpersuasive. In that case, the informant was not found unreliable because he did not know the perpetrator's last name. Rather, the informant's reliability was weakened by the fact that he was supplying information in exchange\n   for lessened punishment and because he was uncertain of whether the events observed by the police were actually the drug transaction that he was predicting or something different. In this case, there was no such uncertainty. The informant and the defendant reached a very specific agreement for the delivery of five ounces of cocaine, and the defendant arrived at the prearranged location. Further, there was no evidence that the informant was receiving any lessened punishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 22 The defendant also argues that the police lacked probable cause because, in the later phone calls, the defendant did not specifically state that he would have cocaine with him when he arrived at the gas station. However, a finding of probable cause is not based on each of the phone calls viewed in isolation. Rather, it is based on the totality of the circumstances. As noted, the informant and the defendant reached a very specific agreement for the delivery of five ounces of cocaine. In dealing with probable cause, \"we deal with probabilities,\" not certainties.
