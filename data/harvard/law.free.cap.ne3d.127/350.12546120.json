According to Isaac, the trial court erred in refusing to take judicial notice of the exact location of the boundary line between Ohio and West Virginia on the Ravenswood Bridge, in denying Isaac's motion to suppress, and in imposing a fine of $20,000. The State argues that Isaac failed to provide the information necessary for the trial court to take judicial notice, that the trial court did not err in denying Isaac's motion to suppress, and that Isaac failed to demonstrate that he is indigent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   {\u00b62} Upon careful review, although we find that the trial court did not err in refusing to take judicial notice, we do find that the trial court did err in denying Isaac's motion to suppress. Accordingly, we overrule Isaac's first assignment of error; but we sustain his second assignment of error. Isaac's third assignment of error is moot. Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand this matter for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b63} On June 17, 2017, Isaac was driving down W.Va. Route 68 in Ravenswood, Jackson County, West Virginia. That day, Officer Andrew R. Boggess (\"Officer Boggess\") of the Ravenswood Police Department was parked in Ravenswood, West Virginia, where W.Va. Route 68 joins with U.S. Route 33. Officer Boggess testified that he observed Isaac as he drove past. According to Officer Boggess, Isaac had an \"adrenaline rush look to his face,\" which, based on his training and experience, was a criminal indicator. At that point, Officer Boggess pulled out onto W.Va. Route 68 and followed Isaac as he made his way onto U.S. Route 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b64} Once behind Isaac, Officer Boggess observed that the license bracket on Isaac's vehicle obscured his license plate. In West Virginia, license plate obstruction is a citable offense. Officer Boggess continued to follow Isaac as he made his way onto the William M. Ritchie, Jr. Bridge (\"Ravenswood Bridge\"), which crosses the Ohio River and connects Jackson County, West Virginia to Meigs County, Ohio. Officer Boggess testified that he observed Isaac commit a second traffic violation while turning onto the bridge. According to Officer Boggess, Isaac's vehicle went left of center and crossed the double yellow line. Thereafter, while both vehicles were still on the bridge, Officer Boggess activated his emergency lights and sirens. Isaac complied and safely pulled his vehicle\n   over on the right-hand shoulder once he had exited the bridge into Meigs County, Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b65} After approaching Isaac's vehicle, Officer Boggess asked Isaac for his license, registration, and proof of insurance. Isaac provided those materials to Officer Boggess. During this exchange, Officer Boggess observed that Isaac was presenting criminal indicators, such as shaking and avoiding eye contact. By that time, a back-up officer had arrived on the scene. Boggess asked the officer to run a license check, an insurance check, a registration check, and a warrant check.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b66} Officer Boggess returned to the passenger side of Isaac's vehicle and asked him to step out. Isaac complied and exited the vehicle. Officer Boggess then conducted a pat-down of Isaac and determined that he was not carrying any weapons. Officer Boggess testified that next he asked Isaac for consent to search the vehicle. According to Officer Boggess, Isaac consented to the search and was advised that he could stop the search at any time. Officer Boggess then proceeded to search the vehicle and found what he suspected to be heroin. that time, Officer Boggess contacted the Meigs County Sheriff's Office, who subsequently took Isaac into custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b67} On July 12, 2017, the Meigs County Grand Jury issued a two-count indictment charging Isaac with Count 1: Possession of Drugs, a first degree felony in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A) &amp; (C)(6)(f) ; and Count 2: Trafficking in Drugs, a first degree felony in violation of R.C. 2925.03(A)(2) &amp; (C)(6)(g). Isaac was arraigned on the charges on July 19, 2017, where he was appointed counsel and entered not guilty pleas.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b68} On August 7, 2017, Isaac filed a motion to suppress evidence followed by a motion for judicial notice of adjudicative facts filed on September 14, 2017. The trial court issued an order on October 10, 2017, which overruled Isaac's motion to suppress and denied his motion for judicial notice. According to the trial court, Officer Boggess had statutory authority under R.C. 2935.03(D) and (E)(3) to arrest Isaac in Ohio. Additionally, the trial court found that West Virginia's jurisdiction extends to the low water mark on the Ohio side of the Ohio River.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b69} On November 13, 2017, Isaac withdrew his not guilty pleas and entered a plea of no contest to both counts. Isaac also provided an affidavit of indigency on November 13, 2017. Thereafter, the trial court sentenced Isaac to eleven years of incarceration and ordered him to pay a $20,000 fine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Assignments of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b610} On appeal, Isaac assigns the following errors for our review:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Assignment of Error I:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The trial court erred as a matter of law when it determined that West Virginia's \"jurisdiction extends to the low water mark of Ohio's shore.\" (October 10, 2017 Order, p.2).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Assignment of Error II:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   The trial court erred in overruling Isaac's motion to suppress.

Isaac alleges that the trial court should have held that the \"Sand Creek Bar\" marks the Ohio-West Virginia boundary on the Ravenswood Bridge. The State argues that Isaac failed to supply sufficient information for the trial court to take judicial notice of the exact location of the boundary line between Ohio and West Virginia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b612} Evid.R. 201 governs judicial notice of \"adjudicative facts,\" i.e., the facts of the case.

A court must take judicial notice if requested by a party and supplied with the necessary information that would allow it to do so. Evid.R. 201(D).

Attached to his motion for judicial notice of adjudicative facts, Isaac also provided the trial court with maps from a 2001 contract between the Ohio Department of Transportation (\"ODOT\") and the West Virginia Department of Transportation. Based on these documents, Isaac alleges that the state boundary line between Ohio and West Virginia is approximately one quarter of the way through the Ravenswood Bridge, heading west. Isaac also argues that the boundary line follows the contour of the Sand Creek Bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b615} The trial court refused to specify the Ohio-West Virginia boundary line in relation to the Ravenswood Bridge based on the maps Isaac provided. Instead, the trial court simply held that the true boundary line between Ohio and West Virginia was \"the low water mark on the northwest or Ohio side of the Ohio River.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In support\n   of its finding, the trial court relied upon longstanding case law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Handly's Lessee v.

The boundary line depicted in the Google map at one point runs through Ohio soil. This is irreconcilable with the established case law, which holds that Ohio's jurisdiction reaches to the low water mark on the Ohio side of the Ohio River. Additionally, it is uncertain whether the maps attached to the ODOT contract contain the actual boundary line between Ohio and West Virginia or a boundary with coordinates established solely for the purposes of this contract. The contract only states that the depicted boundary line \"\n   <em>\n    shall be considered\n   </em>\n   as the boundary line between the States of West Virginia and Ohio.\" (Emphasis added.) Further, even if the ODOT contract accurately reflected the low water mark as it was in 2001, Isaac has failed to provide any proof that the low water mark had not changed from 2001 until the time of the offense in 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Al Johnson Const.

Isaac argues, in pertinent part, that (1) Officer Boggess did not have the statutory authority to conduct an extraterritorial traffic stop for a misdemeanor offense; and (2) the State failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that Isaac consented to the search of his vehicle. Consequently, Isaac argues that Officer Boggess violated his right under Article I, Section 14 of the Ohio Constitution to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b620} In response to Isaac's arguments, the State asserts that (1) the trial court\n   correctly found that Officer Boggess had statutory authority under R.C. 2935.03(D) and (E)(3) to conduct a traffic stop outside his jurisdiction; and (2) it established by clear and convincing evidence that Isaac's consent was freely and voluntarily given.

R.C. 2935.03(D) enlarges that arrest power, stating in pertinent part that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   If a * * * peace officer * * * is authorized by division (A) or (B) of this section to arrest and detain, within the limits of the political subdivision * * * in which the officer is * * * employed * * *, a person until a warrant can be obtained, the peace officer, outside the limits of that territory, may pursue, arrest, and detain that person until a warrant can be obtained if all of the following apply:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (1) The pursuit takes place without unreasonable delay after the offense is committed;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (2) The pursuit is initiated within the limits of the political subdivision * * * of the peace officer;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (3) The offense involved is * * * [an] offense for which points are chargeable pursuant to section 4510.036 of the Revised Code.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   R.C. 2935.03(E)(3) also enlarges the arrest power of certain peace officers, who \"may arrest and detain, until a warrant can be obtained, any person found violating any\n   section or chapter of the Revised Code listed in division (E)(1) of this section on the portion of any street or highway that is located immediately adjacent to the boundaries of the municipal corporation in which the * * *officer * * * is * * * employed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b625} A \"peace officer,\" under this chapter of the Revised Code, includes \"a sheriff; deputy sheriff; marshal; deputy marshal; member of the organized police department of any municipal corporation,\n   <em>\n    including a member of the organized police department of a municipal corporation in an adjoining state serving in Ohio under a contract pursuant to section 737.04 of the Revised Code\n   </em>\n   ; * * *\" (Emphasis added.) R.C. 2935.01(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b626} Because R.C. 2935.01(B) contains no ambiguity, we must give effect to the statute as written. Although the definition of \"peace officer\" includes a \"member of the organized police department of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   municipal corporation,\" that language cannot be read in isolation. (Emphasis added.) R.C. 2935.01(B). The plain language of R.C. 2935.01(B) excludes members of police departments from adjoining states from the definition of \"peace officer,\" as used in Chapter 2935 of the Revised Code, unless they are \"member[s] of the organized police department of a municipal corporation in an adjoining state\n   <em>\n    serving in Ohio under a contract pursuant to section 737.04 of the Revised Code\n   </em>\n   [.]\" (Emphasis added.) R.C. 2935.01(B). Therefore, the only foreign police officers that have jurisdiction under R.C. 2935.03(D) and R.C. 2935.03(E)(3) to make an arrest in Ohio are peace officers of municipal corporations in adjoining states serving in Ohio under a contract pursuant to R.C. 737.04.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b627} Here, because there is no evidence in the record that Officer Boggess was serving in Ohio under a contract pursuant to R.C. 737.04, we cannot find that Officer Boggess was a \"peace officer\" under R.C. 2935.01(B). Furthermore, we can find no other section of the Revised Code that grants him the statutory authority to pursue and stop Isaac's vehicle in Ohio. Thus, we conclude that Officer Boggess did not have the statutory authority to conduct an extraterritorial traffic stop for a misdemeanor offense in Ohio.

Prater\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012-Ohio-5105\">\n    2012-Ohio-5105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=984%20N.E.2d%2036\">\n    984 N.E.2d 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 21-22 (2d Dist.). Under\n   these circumstances, any reasonable person would have felt compelled to submit to the officer's search, rather than consent as a voluntary act of free will.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b644} Since we found that Isaac did not voluntarily consent to the illegal detention, we now return to the\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   balancing test. After weighing the competing interests, we find, like the Court in\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   , that the stop and search of Isaac's vehicle was unreasonable and violated his rights under Article I, Section 14 of the Ohio Constitution. The intrusion upon Isaac's liberty outweighed the government's interest in allowing an officer without statutory authority to make a traffic stop for misdemeanor offenses. Even though now we are aware that Isaac was transporting contraband which would result in a felony charge, our constitutional analysis is limited to the facts known by Officer Boggess prior to the stop and search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b645} We do not reach this decision lightly. As judges we took an oath to support the constitutions of Ohio and of the United States. Therefore, we must uphold the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution's protection of individuals against unreasonable governmental searches and seizures. Likewise, we must also follow Article I, Section 14 of the Ohio Constitution, which affords even greater protection than the Fourth Amendment against searches and seizures conducted by members of law enforcement who lack authority to make an arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b646} Given the facts and circumstances of this case, we find that the trial court erred in denying Isaac's motion to suppress. Consequently, we sustain Isaac's second assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b647} Based on the foregoing reasons, we overrule Isaac's first assignment of error and sustain Isaac's second assignment of error. Our resolution of Isaac's second assignment of error renders his third assignment of error moot. Hence, we need not address Isaac's remaining assignment of error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   App.R. 12(A)(1)(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   {\u00b648} Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand this matter for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   JUDGMENT REVERSED AND CAUSE REMANDED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Abele, J., concurring in judgment only with opinion:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   {\u00b649} I concur in the judgment as I believe the opinion reaches the correct result, albeit an unfortunate result in view of the controlled substance found in appellant's vehicle. It is unfortunate that the West Virginia law enforcement officer did not solicit assistance from Ohio law enforcement officers to assist in the investigation, but I completely understand that in rural areas it is difficult, if not impossible, to summon assistance at a moment's notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   {\u00b650} I write separately to point out that the Ohio Revised Code contains several statutes, in addition to those cited in the principal opinion, that speak to this issue. As part of a multi-state \"Uniform Act on Close Pursuit,\" the Ohio General Assembly enacted several statutory provisions. R.C. 2935.29 defines fresh pursuit as the pursuit of a person reasonably suspected of committing a felony. R.C. 2935.30 speaks to the authority of foreign police to enter Ohio and provides that any officer from another state who enters the state of Ohio in fresh pursuit of a person believed to have committed a felony has the same authority to arrest and hold the person as has any Ohio law enforcement officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   {\u00b651} In the case sub judice, the West Virginia law enforcement officer (affiliated with the Ravenswood, West Virginia Police Department) observed appellant's vehicle display a partially obscured license plate, a minor misdemeanor violation. The officer then pursued appellant across the Ohio River bridge into Ohio. If the officer had reason to believe that appellant had committed a felony violation in West Virginia, R.C. 2935.29 and 2935.30 would have provided the officer the authority to pursue, arrest and detain appellant. Here, however, it appears that the minor misdemeanor traffic violation is the only violation that came to light prior to the investigative pursuit and stop. Consequently, in addition to the reasons cited in the principal opinion, it appears that, based upon the foregoing reasons, the West Virginia officer did not have the authority to pursue, detain and arrest appellant in the state of Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Harsha, J.: Concurs in Judgment and Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Abele, J.: Concurs in Judgment Only with Concurring Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    At the arraignment, the trial court found Isaac to be \"not indigent\" but still appointed counsel.
