For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 On January 27, 2017, Midland Funding LLC filed a small claims complaint against Jean, alleging that Jean was the holder of a credit card (usable only for the purchase of goods at Home Depot), that Midland Funding LLC was the successor in interest of the credit card account from Citibank, N.A., that Jean made purchases against the account but failed to make the monthly payments, that there was a balance of $ 3151.21 due and owing on the account, and that Jean was in default on the account. Midland Funding LLC requested judgment against Jean in the amount of $ 3151.21 plus costs. An affidavit appended to the complaint stated that the last payment posted to the account was on July 12, 2012. Accordingly, the complaint was filed more than four years but less than five years after the default.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 On June 30, 2017, Jean filed a motion for class certification along with a three-count class action counterclaim against Midland Funding LLC and Midland Credit Management, Inc. (Midland). The counterclaim alleged,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that because a Home Depot store credit card can only be used to purchase goods at a Home Depot store, the action was one to enforce a contract for the sale of goods and the applicable statute of limitations is four years under section 2-725 of the UCC (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ). The counterclaim further alleged that Midland's collection complaint was time-barred and, accordingly, the filing violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (2012) ), the Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act ( 815 ILCS 505/1\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (West 2016) ), and the Collection Agency Act ( 225 ILCS 425/1\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (West 2016) ). The allegation underlying all counts of the counterclaim was that Midland had a practice of suing customers on time-barred store credit card debts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 On September 19, 2017, Midland filed a motion to dismiss Jean's counterclaim. The motion alleged,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that Midland's complaint was timely filed because Jean's credit card agreement is governed by the five-year statute of limitations that applies to credit card agreements, pursuant to section 13-205 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Code) ( 735 ILCS 5/13-205 (West 2016) ), rather than the\n   four-year statute of limitations under the UCC that governs the sale of goods, as Jean alleged in her counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 A hearing was conducted on February 20, 2018, where counsel offered respective arguments concerning,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , which statute of limitations applied. The circuit court entered an order on February 22, 2018, granting Midland's motion to dismiss, holding that the five-year statute of limitations applied, and dismissing Jean's counterclaim with prejudice. Jean filed a timely notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8 Our issue on appeal is whether the circuit court erred by granting Midland's motion to dismiss Jean's counterclaim, on the basis of the five-year statute of limitations applying to Midland's underlying complaint, rather than the four-year statute of limitations, as argued by Jean in her counterclaim.

That is not the case here, where a tripartite relationship exists between the bank, the cardholder, and the merchant and where the payments made by the bank to the merchant pursuant to the cardholder agreement constitute a loan, just as in\n   <em>\n    Harris Trust\n   </em>\n   . See\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5377120\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-app-3d/21/605/\">\n    21 Ill.

Accordingly, we find the holding in\n   <em>\n    Citizen's\n   </em>\n   does not apply to the instant case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 17 Jean cites an additional Illinois case-\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. Sears Roebuck &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2682125\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-app-3d/14/838/#p851\">\n    14 Ill. App. 3d 838\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 851,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=303%20N.E.2d%20627\">\n    303 N.E.2d 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1973) -in which the court held that a store credit card was not subject to usury laws because the sale of goods on credit and allowing payments over time do not constitute a loan. However, again, like\n   <em>\n    Citizen's\n   </em>\n   , the\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   case did not involve a tripartite system where the bank paid the merchant for goods that were purchased by a cardholder who agreed to repay the bank instead of the merchant, but a bipartite relationship directly between a retail seller and a buyer. See\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2682125\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-app-3d/14/838/#p851\">\n    14 Ill. App. 3d at 839\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=303%20N.E.2d%20627\">\n    303 N.E.2d 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, we find the ruling in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   also inapplicable here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 18 Finally, we note that Jean concedes that litigation involving general purpose bank credit cards is subject to a five-year statute of limitations pursuant to section 13-205 of the Code ( 735 ILCS 5/13-205 (West 2016) ). On that note, she contends that\n   <em>\n    Harris Trust\n   </em>\n   is distinguished from the instant case, because in that case, a general purpose credit card was used that could be used at multiple retailers as well as used for cash advances and services, whereas here, the credit card originated with Home Depot, was issued through Citibank, and could only be used to purchase goods at a single retailer-Home Depot-therefore making it subject to the UCC as a part of a sale of goods. We disagree. The type of credit card is immaterial. The determining factor in\n   <em>\n    Harris Trust\n   </em>\n   was not that the credit card was general purpose or usable only at a single establishment, but that a tripartite relationship and a loan of money were involved. The same principles apply to this case, and we find the distinction Jean raises regarding the type of credit card to be of no consequence to established law in Illinois.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 19 CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 20 For the foregoing reasons, the February 22, 2018, order of the circuit court of Clinton County is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 21 Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Presiding Justice Overstreet and Justice Chapman concurred in the judgment and opinion.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
