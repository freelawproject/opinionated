Co. (\"Fireman's Fund\"), may withdraw its defense of Hyster-Yale in asbestos lawsuits where there is indisputable, reliable evidence that the date of injury clearly occurred outside of the policy term (i.e., 1957 to 1969). Hyster-Yale assigns the following three errors for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   I. The trial court erred in holding that Ohio law permits [Fireman's Fund] to terminate its duty to defend based on information extrinsic to the operative complaints developed during the course of the underlying asbestos lawsuits.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   II. The trial court erred in holding that Oregon law permits [Fireman's Fund] to terminate its duty to defend based on information extrinsic to the operative complaints developed during the course of the underlying asbestos lawsuits.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   III. To the extent Oregon and Ohio law conflict with respect to the standard governing an insurer's duty to defend, Oregon law has the most significant relationship to the policies and its law must therefore apply.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b62} Having reviewed the record and pertinent law, we affirm the judgment of the trial court granting partial summary judgment to Fireman's Fund and denying Hyster-Yale's motion for summary judgment. The apposite facts follow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b63} Hyster-Yale Group is a national subsidiary of Hyster-Yale Materials Handling, a Delaware company. At all relevant times, Hyster-Yale manufactured \"powered industrial trucks,\" or forklifts. Fireman's Fund is one of Hyster-Yale's insurers, and it issued various general liability policies with policy periods from February 1, 1957, through February 1, 1969. During this time period, Hyster-Yale was headquartered in Oregon, and the policies were negotiated with an Oregon broker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b64} In relevant part, the Fireman's Fund policies state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   I. Coverage Bodily Injury Liability Automobile:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Coverage Bodily Injury Liability Except Automobiles: to pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury, sickness, or disease, including death at any time resulting therefrom, sustained by any person and caused by accident;\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   II.

Policy Period, Territory, Purposes of Use: this policy applies only to accidents which\n   <em>\n    occurred during the policy period\n   </em>\n   within the United States of America, its territories or possessions[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b65} The policies were not limited to the Oregon area, and by 1990, Hyster-Yale moved its headquarters to Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b66} Some of the component parts of Hyster-Yale's products are alleged to contain asbestos, and Hyster-Yale is a defendant in various asbestos-injury actions, including claims filed by Robert Chamberland (\"Chamberland\") in California, Ruben Groskreutz (\"Groskreutz\") in Illinois, and Raymond Parker (\"Parker\") in Michigan. Hyster-Yale sought defense and indemnity from Fireman's Fund in connection with the policies in effect during the relevant time periods. Fireman's Fund defended the cases. However, by 2015, it gave notice that it was withdrawing from the defense of the Chamberland, Groskreutz, and Parker claims. Fireman's Fund maintained that it learned through discovery that the plaintiffs' exposure to Hyster-Yale products occurred after the 1958-1969 policy periods. It maintained that Chamberland's asbestos exposure to Hyster-Yale forklifts began \"no earlier than July 1978,\" or nine years past the 1969 policy period, Groskreutz's asbestos exposure began \"[i]n the early 1990s,\" and Parker's exposure began in 1974. However, the record suggests that Fireman's Fund subsequently recommended funding a portion of the defense of these lawsuits under a reservation of rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b67} Following these disputes, Fireman's Fund filed this declaratory judgment action against Hyster-Yale and its other insurers, Great American Insurance Company, and Travelers Indemnity Company. Fireman's Fund sought declarations: (1) that it has no duty to defend Hyster-Yale in asbestos lawsuits when there is \"compelling evidence\" that the plaintiff was not exposed to Hyster-Yale's products during the time periods of the Fireman's Fund insurance policies; (2) allocating defense costs in those asbestos lawsuits where the plaintiff's asbestos exposure occurred only during a portion of the duration of the Fireman's Fund insurance policies; and (3) allocating equitable contribution from other insurers. In opposition, Hyster-Yale maintained that the defense obligation applies even if the allegations of the plaintiff's complaint are \"groundless, false, or fraudulent.\" It sought a declaration that Fireman's Fund has a duty to defend, and it also filed\n   counterclaims for breach of contract and breach of duty of good faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b68} Fireman's Fund filed a motion for partial summary judgment, arguing that Ohio law applies, but that under both Ohio law and Oregon law, there is no duty to defend where extrinsic evidence shows that alleged exposure occurred outside of the policy time periods. In opposition, Hyster-Yale argued that Oregon law applies to the dispute because the insurance was obtained in Oregon, and Hyster-Yale was headquartered in Oregon during the period that the policies were in effect. Hyster-Yale also argued that extrinsic evidence cannot be considered in determining the duty to defend, and that this issue is governed solely by the allegations of the complaint and the policy language requiring Fireman's Fund to provide a defense \"even if such suit is groundless, false or fraudulent.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b69} The trial court held a hearing on the motion. Thereafter, on February 12, 2018, the trial court granted Fireman's Fund's motion for partial summary judgment on the duty to defend, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   [T]he law of both [Ohio and Oregon provides] that (1) an insurer's duty to defend will attach if the allegations in the underlying complaint fall under the policy coverage and that (2) court in certain, limited circumstances may look to extrinsic evidence outside of the complaint. As result, the Court need not engage in choice of law analysis and shall apply Ohio law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   II. Contractual Interpretation\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   [T]he policy applies only to accidents which occurred during the policy period. * * * [I]f exposure to asbestos in groundless, false or fraudulent suits temporally occurred in actuality between February 1, 1957 to February 1, 1969, then insurance coverage has been triggered and there is duty to defend. It logically follows in the alternative that if exposure to asbestos in groundless, false or fraudulent suits did not temporally occur in actuality between February 1, 1957 to February 1, 1969, then no insurance coverage has been triggered and thus there is no duty to defend. * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   III. Duty to Defend\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [I]t is proper to look at extrinsic evidence after duty to defend has attached to determine whether that duty may be terminated when indisputable, reliable evidence establishes that insurance coverage has not been contractually triggered under policy effective time period. * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [T]he Court accordingly declares that [Fireman's Fund] has the right to withdraw its duty to defend [Hyster-Yale] in asbestos lawsuits in cases in which there is indisputable, reliable evidence via sworn affidavit or sworn testimony that the date of an underlying asbestos injury clearly occurred outside of Plaintiffs['] effective policy term between February of 1, 1957 to February 1, 1969[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Duty to Defend\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b610} Hyster-Yale's three assigned errors are interrelated and assert that this dispute is governed by Oregon law, not Ohio law, and that the duty to defend may not be terminated by application of extrinsic evidence obtained during discovery. Rather, the duty is determined solely with reference to the policy language and the allegations of the injury plaintiff's complaint. Because the policies require Fireman's Fund to defend even \"groundless, false, and fraudulent\" claims, and the complaints allege liability against Hyster-Yale, the duty to defend is \"absolute.\" Therefore, according to Hyster-Yale, the duty continues until the asbestos plaintiffs amend their complaints, or there are judicial\n   determinations of the actual dates of asbestos exposure due to Hyster-Yale. In opposition, Fireman's Fund maintains that Hyster-Yale invited any error on the application of Ohio law to this dispute. It further argues that the trial court correctly applied Ohio law, but under the law of both Oregon and Ohio, the duty to defend may be terminated, following a declaratory judgment action, where extrinsic facts show that a claim is not within policy coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Summary Judgment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b611} This court reviews a trial court's grant of summary judgment under the de novo standard.\n   <em>\n    Grafton v.
