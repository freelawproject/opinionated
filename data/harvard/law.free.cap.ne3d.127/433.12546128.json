(\"Concrete Designs\") (collectively \"appellants\") bring this appeal challenging the trial court's denial of appellants' motion for a new trial, the trial court's denial of their motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the stipulation regarding the \"permanent\n   and substantial physical deformity\" interrogatory, and the award of noneconomic damages greater than $350,000. After a thorough review of the record and law, this court affirms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b62} In the early morning hours of November 15, 2010, plaintiffs-appellees, Kiara Torres (\"Torres\") and Joshua Rojas (\"Rojas\") were passengers in a car driven by Jovanny Martinez (\"Martinez\") (collectively \"appellees\"). Rojas was seated in the front passenger seat, Torres was seated in the rear passenger seat, and a third passenger, Yareline Santiago, was seated in the rear driver's seat. Martinez's car was involved in an accident with a dump truck driven by English. As a result of the accident, Rojas and Torres suffered severe injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b63} Torres and Rojas filed an action against Martinez, English, and Concrete Designs. The separate complaints\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   alleged negligence against English and negligent entrustment against Concrete Designs. Rojas and Torres alleged that English cut off Martinez's car as English was changing lanes, ultimately causing the accident. Martinez also alleged that English caused the accident. English alleged that Martinez's car rear-ended his dump truck, failing to keep the assured clear distance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b64} The case proceeded to a jury trial on September 18, 2014. The jury, on October 1, 2014, returned verdicts in favor of Rojas and Torres. The jury found that appellants were solely at fault in the collision - Martinez was found to have no liability. The jury awarded Rojas $8.2 million in economic damages and $26.4 million in noneconomic damages for a total of $34.6 million in compensatory damages. The jury awarded Torres $1.8 million in economic damages and $6 million in noneconomic damages for a total of $7.8 million in compensatory damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b65} Thereafter, on November 11, 2014, appellants filed a motion for a new trial. A hearing on appellants' motion was held on April 20, 2015. On May 1, 2015, Westfield Insurance Company (\"Westfield\") filed a motion to intervene pursuant to Civ.R. 24, which was granted on May 14, 2015. On May 27, 2015, the court denied appellants' motion for a new trial. On August 20, 2015, appellants appealed from the trial court's denial of their motion for a new trial to this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b66} In\n   <em>\n    Rojas v.

The trial court found that all parties were in agreement that the negligent entrustment claims were not pursued by Rojas and Torres. On April 25, 2017, the trial court issued a judgment entry dismissing the negligent entrustment claims without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b68} On May 23, 2017, appellants filed a second motion for a new trial and a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict as to the finding that Torres had sustained a \"permanent and substantial physical deformity.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The trial court held a hearing on appellants' motions on October 16, 2017.

In fact, I think she's very plainly not telling the truth about the law. You're going to receive the interrogatories, which is nothing more than a fancy word for questions.

First, we note the following charge to the jury on this topic: \"what percentage of fault should be assigned to each defendant.\" (Tr. 1460.) Considering these particular remarks in context with appellants' counsel's remarks, we do not agree that these remarks cast appellants' counsel as a liar especially when taken in context of the entirety of the parties' closing arguments. These remarks illustrate an attempt by Rojas's counsel to clarify the law as to the parties' theories regarding liability for the accident. Thus, these remarks did not prejudice appellants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b622} Appellants also contend that Rojas's and Torres's counsel made improper remarks that were offered as evidence of appellants' liability. Here, appellants contend that these remarks suggested that English's cooperation with the police on the night of the accident and his retention of counsel demonstrated his liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Specifically, we note the following comments made during opening statements:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   [Rojas's counsel]: [Martinez] does not have an attorney that's involved at this time. [Martinez is] going to testify during that time he didn't have an attorney involved, he did not have a law firm helping, he did not have an accident reconstructionist talking to the police or really explaining what happened in the accident so that the police have both sides of the story without jumping to conclusions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   (Tr. 409.)\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   [Rojas's counsel]: [Martinez] comes up with a plea because he's worried about two things. You're going to hear his testimony. He's worried about going to jail, so he pleads guilty to a negligent assault on this. And you're going to hear about that. He's defended by a public defender. He didn't have the resources that we're all going to have here today, all the accident reconstructionists to evaluate everything. So he comes up with a plea. And he was also - he was told that he can't see his friends while the prosecution was pending. So he just wanted to be able to convalesce and be with this friends; so that when [Rojas] came out of the coma, he could be there to comfort his friends and be part of that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   (Tr. 411-412.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b623} In addition, we note the following remarks during closing arguments:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   [Rojas's counsel]: While [Torres] and [Rojas] were in the hospital, * * * [English] got a jump strategically maneuvering in this case and what happened here in this courtroom. * * * [W]ithin three weeks of this particular accident, [English] had formulated his troops and started working towards strategically defending this case. If this is truly just an automobile rear-end accident or an assured clear distance case, why do you need to hire an attorney? Why do you need to hire an accident reconstructionist? Why do you need to defend just a simple auto rear-ender? Why do you have to go to the great expense that they have gone to in order to defend this case by hiring a firm and an accident reconstructionist? * * * If this is a simple rear-end accident case, then you don't need to create this defense and create this group of folks to come in and defend this particular case. * * * [English] didn't understand what he saw [when he changed lanes]. He didn't move when it was safe and he became the hazard, and he knows that he became the hazard. That's why the attorneys and everybody were involved so early in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   (Tr. 1480-1483.)\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   [Rojas's counsel]: We had to file a lawsuit in order to find out what was truly behind all of the issues and statements that were raised in the police report, because some statements didn't make sense, some statements made sense, so we filed a lawsuit against both [English] and [Martinez] in order to understand truly what happened, and the only way we can understand truly what happened in this case is by filing that lawsuit and then talking with the various parties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   (Tr. 1484.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b624} In support of appellants' arguments here, appellants direct our attention to\n   <em>\n    Sizemore v.

In\n   <em>\n    Sizemore\n   </em>\n   , the Sixth District noted in particular the \"frequency and deliberateness\" of the prosecutor's comments regarding the defendant consulting with counsel. The prosecutor made statements that suggested to the jury that the defendant\n   hired an attorney to create an alibi, or to \"take[ ] care of everything\" or \"get ... [his] story straight.\"\n   <em>\n    Sizemore\n   </em>\n   at 671. The court went on to note that \"[s]uch statements strike at the core of the right to counsel, and must not be permitted.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10545349\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/921/667/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , citing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The court further noted that \"the trial transcript reveals intentional and repeated attempts by the prosecutor to question Sizemore's motives for consulting with counsel, and she clearly invited the jurors to view Sizemore's ability to hire several attorneys with suspicion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1372512\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/620/559/#p564\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b625} To the extent that appellants rely upon\n   <em>\n    Sizemore,\n   </em>\n   we note that it concerned a writ of habeas corpus based upon prosecutorial misconduct. The prosecutor's remarks in\n   <em>\n    Sizemore\n   </em>\n   amounted to misconduct because the prosecutor commented on the right of the accused to retain counsel pursuant to the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. However, the instant matter is not a criminal matter and there exists no constitutional protections in civil matters akin to the constitutional protections that so prejudiced Sizemore. Indeed, the remarks in\n   <em>\n    Sizemore\n   </em>\n   amounted to prosecutorial misconduct because the remarks struck at the core of constitutional protections afforded to defendants in criminal matters. Thus, even if we were to agree with appellants that these remarks prejudiced them, it would not require us to reverse the trial court's denial of appellants' motion for a new trial. Lastly, these remarks were made in opening statements and closing arguments, and therefore, were not evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b626} Appellants also contend that Rojas's and Torres's counsel vouched for the \"justness\" of Rojas's and Torres's cause and vouched for the credibility of their witnesses. Appellants take issue with the following remarks:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   [Rojas's counsel]: If you play a movie in your mind of [English's] version of the accident versus [Martinez's] version of the accident, [Martinez's] version starts and finishes completely. [English's] version has holes in it, a lot of holes in it, to make it very difficult to determine where [English is] at.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   (Tr. 1499.)\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   [Rojas's counsel]: You have to look at the credibility of the witnesses too. Who was [English] staying with? * * * Where was [English] going? He couldn't tell us even the last name of the gentleman he was staying with on the morning - on that Sunday morning. His route from Brecksville to the supposed job estimate on East 55th Street is unusual, and then he doesn't even know what the job is and can't articulated [sic] what that job is that he wants to go to.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   All these things go his credibility and his believability at the end of the day. Who was he staying with? What route was he taking? Who was he meeting up with thereafter?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   (Tr. 1497-1498.)\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   [Torres's counsel]: It really comes down to credibility. That's what it comes down to, credibility. Who do you believe? What expert do you believe? * * * I think the evidence shows that the version by Martinez is just more credible and more believable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   (Tr. 1522.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   {\u00b627} We do not find these comments to be improperly vouching for the credibility of a witness. Indeed, these comments relate to what counsel argued the evidence showed and what reasonable inferences they argued should be drawn therefrom. The accident occurred in the early morning hours at approximately 5:00 a.m. At trial, English stated that he was in route to do an estimate on a concrete job. Therefore,\n   Rojas's and Torres's counsel's above statement references evidence that was adduced at trial and what reasonable inferences the jury could have drawn from that evidence. We find no prejudice in these remarks; these remarks represent legitimate arguments regarding the credibility of various witnesses based on evidence introduced at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   {\u00b628} Appellants take issue with the following remarks:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   [Rojas's counsel]: [Rojas is] a sweetheart of a guy. I think you're going to really like him. I hope that he's in good spirits and in a good mood because that's how I've come to know him, and I hope you come to know him in the same way.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   (Tr. 387.)\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   [Torres's counsel]: I can tell you, when I first heard the circumstances of this accident, and again, it's been four years, my first assumption was that it was probably the kids' fault,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   because there's four kids, and [English] is a guy that looks just like me, he's my age. I assumed the kids must have done something wrong. But I have had the benefit now of four years of my life involved in this case, four years of learning the facts, taking depositions. And I no longer think that. I think that [English] is responsible for this accident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   [Appellants' counsel]: Objection to his personal -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   THE COURT: Keep going.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   [Torres's counsel]: I believe that because you're going to hear testimony[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   (Tr. 418-419.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   {\u00b629} The remark from Rojas's counsel is not a comment on Rojas's credibility as a witness. Indeed, Rojas did not testify at trial. Additionally, with regards to Rojas's counsel's remark that he thought the evidence was going to show English was liable was simply his obvious theory on the case. It certainly is not impermissible for a plaintiff's counsel to remark in opening statements that a defendant is responsible or liable for an accident. In the instant matter, this was a permissible topic during opening statements, although it could have been stated in a more proper way, i.e., \"the evidence will show that English is responsible for the accident.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   {\u00b630} However, the remarks by Torres's counsel stating that he thought \"English [was] responsible for this accident\" and that he \"believe[d] that because [the jury is] going to hear the testimony\" are impermissibly vouching for the culpability of a litigant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Furthermore, although we find the remarks concerning appellants' retention of counsel impermissible, we find that these remarks were not so reprehensible or heinous that they compelled the jury's verdict. In denying appellants' new trial motion, the trial court noted that these remarks amounted to \"trial strategy.\" In this regard, we defer to the trial court because the judge was in a better position to determine if the remarks prejudiced appellants as to require a new trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lupica\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 55.

More specifically, appellants contend that the damages award was the result of the improper consideration of English's wealth and the damages award was excessive compared to similar cases. R.C. 2315.19(A) provides that a defendant may file a post-judgment motion requesting \"a trial court in a tort action shall review the evidence supporting an award of compensatory damages for noneconomic loss that the defendant has challenged as excessive.\" \"An appellate court shall use a de novo standard of review when considering an appeal of an\n   award of compensatory damages for noneconomic loss on the grounds that the award is inadequate or excessive.\" R.C. 2315.19(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   {\u00b641} First, we note that appellants argue here, as they did in the trial court, that a new trial should have been granted pursuant to Civ.R. 59(A) and R.C. 2315.19. However, R.C. 2315.19 is not a mechanism for a motion for a new trial, contrary to what appellants contend. R.C. 2315.19 provides a statutory mechanism for a party to file a post-judgment motion challenging an excessive award of compensatory damages. Nevertheless, we address appellants' arguments below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   {\u00b642} Appellants argue that these particular remarks \"disingenuously cast English as a businessman who deployed great resources - at 'great expense' - to influence liability-determining events.\" Appellants' brief at 27. The particular remarks that appellants take issue with here have been previously highlighted above. Appellants take issue with similar statements that either portrayed English and his defense team as having expended vast financial resources or portrayed Martinez as having little to no financial resources. Appellants argue that these statements were offered to establish liability on the part of English and reduce Martinez's liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   {\u00b643} Having reviewed these remarks, and having considered the entirety of the proceedings, we find no basis to reverse the trial court's judgment. Further, appellants did not object to any of these particular remarks at the trial court level.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   {\u00b644} Appellants also argue that pursuant to R.C. 2315.19(A)(2), the verdict was excessive compared to similar cases. R.C. 2315.19(A)(2) affords a defendant the ability to challenge a jury's award based upon \"[w]hether the verdict is in excess of verdicts involving comparable injuries to similarly situated plaintiffs.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   {\u00b645} Appellants specifically argue here that the jury's award of noneconomic damages to both Rojas and Torres \"dwarfs\" national and Ohio noneconomic damages awards for such brain injuries. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   {\u00b646} We note, as the trial court did, the following recent Cuyahoga County verdicts: (1) $27,500,000 in compensatory damages in a mesothelioma case, (2) $23,018,790 in compensatory damages to a plaintiff, in his early forties, who was a passenger on a Greyhound bus and sustained a severed lower limb extremity, a severed urethra, and had a lower limb amputated, and (3) $19,000,000 in compensatory damages in a wrongful death suit of a 41-year-old construction worker struck and killed by a motorist in a construction zone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   {\u00b647} This court's standard of review under R.C. 2315.19 is de novo. \"De novo review encompasses an independent examination of the record and law without deference to the underlying decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Gateway Consultants Group, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist.

Dr. Pickle opined that Torres will never be able to work or live independently, and she does not possess the cognitive capacity to appreciate the severity of her brain injury.

Pursuant to R.C. 2315.18(B)(2), if a plaintiff fails to prove a \"permanent and substantial physical deformity,\" damages are capped at $350,000.

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   {\u00b698} Based on the foregoing analysis, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in denying appellants' motion for a new trial. Nor can we say the trial court erred in denying appellants' post-judgment motion pursuant to R.C. 2315.19. The awards of damages were not excessive given the severity of the injuries to both Rojas and Torres. Moreover, there existed sufficient evidence for the jury to determine that Torres's injuries amounted to a \"permanent and substantial physical deformity,\" the parties clearly stipulated that Rojas's injuries amounted to a \"permanent and substantial physical deformity,\" and Torres's and Rojas's damages awards were not capped at $350,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   {\u00b699} Judgment affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   ANITA LASTER MAYS, J., CONCURS;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   SEAN C. GALLAGHER, P.J., CONCURS IN JUDGMENT ONLY IN PART AND DISSENTS IN PART WITH SEPARATE OPINION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   SEAN C. GALLAGHER, J., CONCURRING IN JUDGMENT ONLY IN PART AND DISSENTING IN PART:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   {\u00b6100} I respectfully concur in judgment only with the majority opinion in paragraphs 1-59. I do not believe it was proper for plaintiffs' counsel to argue that defense counsel was misstating the law on liability. Defense counsel had every right to present a theory of the case, and the defense's theory - that liability is an either/or proposition\n   based on the facts of the case, in that either Martinez or English was responsible for the accident - is not a misstatement of the law. In fact, the jury agreed that it was an all-or-nothing proposition. The defense had a firm basis for advancing such a theory. Martinez was indicted on two counts of aggravated vehicular assault and pled guilty to a reduced charge of negligent assault for his conduct in causing the collision. English was not cited or charged by police. Nevertheless, because the trial court gave a cautionary instruction on counsel's comments that the jury is presumed to have followed, I concur in judgment only with the majority's outcome on the first two assigned errors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-257\">\n   {\u00b6101} On the third assigned error, I respectfully dissent. Torres was awarded $1.8 million for economic damages stemming from her lost earning capacity and past medical expenses. Torres provided no other basis to support the economic damages sought. Although the majority concludes that other economic damages could have been considered by the jury, the jury was not provided any other measure of damages or any other method of calculating economic damages. Tort recovery may not be had for damages that are speculative, and thus we must limit the review to the damages actually sought.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   {\u00b6102} Torres asked the jury to consider her $168,000 of past medical expenses as economic damages (Tr. 1523:9-16) but failed to present evidence of lost earning capacity sufficient to justify the remaining portion of the damages award. Torres also argued in closing that the jury could assume a minimum wage income in absence of expert evidence demonstrating her vocational opportunities and lost earning capacity. Tr. 1524:1-7. Even if that was an appropriate method of seeking lost earnings or wages, the jury was not provided any means to calculate the present value of the lost earnings over Torres's lifetime. The only economic damages demonstrated through the record were her medical expenses. I am constrained by my prior position from\n   <em>\n    MADFAN, Inc. v.

Neither Torres nor Rojas filed a responsive briefing to address this issue. App.R. 16(A)(7).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the majority notes, defense counsel specifically stated that she was not on record to a stipulation, but she conceded there was sufficient evidence to put the issue to the jury for consideration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   After that discussion, Rojas asked the trial court to include a jury interrogatory as it related to Rojas. The trial court denied Rojas's request without explanation. Rojas's counsel attempted to clarify by stating that there is no question that Rojas has a \"substantial physical deformity,\" to which the court stated \"that is correct.\" That is not a stipulation, but instead is the court taking judicial notice of what is actually a triable issue of fact.\n   <em>\n    Arbino v.

It is the plaintiffs' burden to demonstrate that the limitations set forth under R.C. 2315.18(B) do not apply. If anything, Rojas should have renewed his objection to the trial court's failure to provide the requested interrogatory as it pertained to his case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   {\u00b6105} For the foregoing reasons, I cannot fully join the majority's decision and respectfully dissent.
