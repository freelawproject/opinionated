This Court affirms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b62} One afternoon, B.H. agreed to meet Mr. Robinson-Bey, her ex-boyfriend, at a store not far from her home. She walked to the store and, when Mr. Robinson-Bey arrived, she got into his car. The two rode around and conversed peaceably for some time. When Mr. Robinson-Bey began asking about B.H.'s current boyfriend, however, she became uncomfortable. She informed Mr. Robinson-Bey that his questions were inappropriate, and the two began arguing. She then repeatedly asked Mr. Robinson-Bey to let her out of the car. Each time she asked, he refused to stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b63} As the car approached a four-way stop, B.H. decided that she would simply jump from the car when Mr. Robinson-Bey slowed. She gathered her things and, as the car slowed, she opened the door and jumped out. Her left leg was still inside the car when she heard a gunshot. Not realizing that she had been struck, she ran a moderate distance before she was forced to stop. She then looked down and saw a bullet wound in her leg. Before she could react, Mr. Robinson-Bey arrived on foot. With a gun held down to his side, he grabbed B.H. and walked her back to his car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b64} Mr. Robinson-Bey kept B.H. in his car until later that evening. The two drove to various locations and, at one point, stopped at store to obtain peroxide for her leg. B.H. eventually convinced Mr. Robinson-Bey to take her to her cousin's house and managed to elude him once they were inside. After hiding for a brief period of time, she slipped outside, walked to a gas station, and called her boyfriend for help. Her boyfriend then took her to the hospital, where she received treatment for the gunshot wound to her leg.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b65} Mr. Robinson-Bey was indicted on charges of kidnapping, felonious assault, and having a weapon under disability. His kidnapping and felonious assault counts both carried a firearm specification and a repeat violent offender (\"RVO\") specification. To minimize the jury's exposure to his prior convictions, Mr. Robinson-Bey elected to try his RVO specifications to the bench. He also agreed to stipulate, for purposes of his weapon under disability count, that he had a prior conviction for a felony offense of violence. Both parties agreed that the jury would hear their stipulation, but would not receive a certified copy of Mr. Robinson-Bey's prior conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b66} The trial commenced, and, near the conclusion of the State's case, the lead detective testified that Mr. Robinson-Bey had been \"arrested for bank robbery a couple times.\" Mr. Robinson-Bey objected, and the court immediately sustained the objection, struck that testimony from the record, and issued a curative instruction. The parties then approached the bench, and Mr. Robinson-Bey moved for a mistrial. After hearing arguments from both parties, the court denied the motion for a mistrial. It also denied the motion when Mr. Robinson-Bey renewed it at the close of the State's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b67} At the conclusion of trial, the parties presented their exhibits for admission. One of the State's exhibits was a copy of a certified conviction for armed bank robbery that Mr. Robinson-Bey committed in 1992. Another was a copy of his computerized criminal history (\"CCH\"), listing all of his arrests and convictions from 1981 to present. The parties agreed that neither of the foregoing exhibits (collectively, \"the non-jury exhibits\") would be presented to the jury. The certified conviction was admitted strictly for purposes of the record as the basis for the weapon under disability charge. Meanwhile, the CCH was admitted strictly for purposes of the court's decision on the RVO specifications. The court accepted both the non-jury exhibits\n   as being offered for those limited purposes. In accordance with the parties' stipulation, it instructed the jury that Mr. Robinson-Bey had been convicted \"of a felony offense of violence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b68} The jury found Mr. Robinson-Bey not guilty of kidnapping, guilty of the lesser-included offense of abduction, and guilty of his remaining counts and firearm specifications. After the court excused the jury, the parties discovered that the non-jury exhibits had inadvertently been given to the jury along with the other exhibits. Mr. Robinson-Bey then filed a Crim.R. 29(C) motion for acquittal. In his motion, he argued that the State had set forth insufficient evidence, the non-jury exhibits had influenced the jury's decision, and, but for those exhibits, the jury would not have convicted him. The State filed a response in opposition to Mr. Robinson-Bey's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b69} The court held a hearing on Mr. Robinson-Bey's motion. While the court acknowledged that the non-jury exhibits had inadvertently been given to the jury, it deemed the error harmless. It also found that the State had presented sufficient evidence on each of Mr. Robinson-Bey's counts. Accordingly, it denied Mr. Robinson-Bey's motion. As to the RVO specifications, the court dismissed the one linked to the kidnapping count and found Mr. Robinson-Bey guilty of the remaining specification. The court sentenced him to a total of 18 years in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b610} Mr. Robinson-Bey now appeals from his convictions and raises five assignments of error for our review. For ease of analysis, we rearrange several of the assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR FIVE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED WAS INSUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT MR.

A person commits felonious assault if he knowingly \"[c]ause[s] or attempt[s] to cause physical harm to another * * * by means of a deadly weapon or dangerous ordnance.\" R.C. 2903.11(A)(2). Finally, a person is guilty of having a weapon under disability if he has been convicted of \"any felony offense of violence\" and \"knowingly acquire[s], [has], carr[ies], or use[s] any firearm or dangerous ordnance * * *.\" R.C. 2923.13(A)(2). \"A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is aware that the person's conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably be of a certain nature.\" R.C. 2901.22(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b614} Mr. Robinson-Bey argues that his convictions are based on insufficient evidence for two reasons. The first is that the State failed to set forth any evidence that the gun he allegedly used to shoot B.H. was operable. The second is that the State failed to set forth any evidence that he acted knowingly. He argues that the police never test-fired the gun they linked to his crimes and B.H. never saw him fire the gun. Because his alleged use of the gun formed the bases of his felonious assault charge, his weapon under disability charge, and his firearm specifications, he argues that those convictions must be reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b615} B.H., the victim in this matter, testified that she and Mr. Robinson-Bey used to be romantically involved, but that she ended their relationship. One afternoon, she spoke with him on the phone and agreed to meet him at a neighborhood store. B.H. walked to the store and, when Mr. Robinson-Bey arrived, got into his car. The two then drove around for some length of time, chatting about various topics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b616} At some point, Mr. Robinson-Bey began asking B.H. about her new boyfriend. She indicated that she was uncomfortable with his questions, and the two began arguing. B.H. testified that she asked Mr. Robinson-Bey to let her out of the car several times, but he refused. When she saw that they were approaching a four-way stop in a residential area, she decided that she would simply jump out of the car. She held her purse, waited until the car slowed, and then opened the door to jump out.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b617} B.H. testified that her right leg was clear of the car, but her left leg was still partially inside when she heard a gunshot. She stated that she did not initially feel any pain, so she began running through the neighborhood. After about two blocks, however, her speed decreased and she found herself unable to continue. She then looked down at her left leg for the first time and saw a hole in her pants and blood. At that point, she realized that Mr. Robinson-Bey had shot her in the leg. She testified that, by the time she looked up, Mr. Robinson-Bey was there. He had a gun in his right hand and held it down to his side as he grabbed her and walked her back to his car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b618} B.H. testified that she began rambling and making promises to Mr. Robinson-Bey because she was afraid he might kill her. She could no longer run because she was in a lot of pain, so she got into his car when he held the door open. The two continued to drive around, and B.H. expressed that she needed to go to the hospital. She testified that Mr. Robinson-Bey repeatedly refused to take her there, so she eventually suggested that they go to Family Dollar to buy peroxide. He agreed to do so, but did not get out of the car when they arrived. Instead, he called a stranger over to the car, gave the stranger money, and asked him to go inside the store and buy the peroxide. The stranger obliged and, once Mr. Robinson-Bey had\n   the peroxide in hand, he began driving around again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b619} According to B.H., she ultimately convinced Mr. Robinson-Bey to drive her to her cousin's house, emphasizing that she needed to use the restroom. Though he relented, he did not want to let her out of the car when they arrived. B.H.'s cousin was having a birthday party, and Mr. Robinson-Bey believed that she would tell her family members what had happened once inside. B.H. then told Mr. Robinson-Bey to come inside with her so that she could just use the restroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b620} Once they were inside the house, Mr. Robinson-Bey followed B.H. everywhere with his gun in his pocket. Although her cousin saw her leg and B.H. indicated that Mr. Robinson-Bey had shot her, she testified that none of her family members took her seriously and believed that she had been struck by a B.B. Even so, several of them eventually confronted Mr. Robinson-Bey, and B.H. took that opportunity to elude him. She then hid in the basement for some time before leaving on foot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b621} After leaving her cousin's house, B.H. walked to a gas station and called her boyfriend for help. She indicated that she did not call the police from her cousin's house or ask her family for help because she was not sure where Mr. Robinson-Bey had gone and believed he was still searching for her. Likewise, she never used her cell phone to call for help while in his car because she feared he would harm her if she tried. She later discovered that she had accidentally pocket-dialed her boyfriend while in the car with Mr. Robinson-Bey. She testified, however, that she never actually spoke with her boyfriend until she called him from the gas station. Once he came to the gas station, he took her to the hospital where she was treated for a gunshot wound to her left leg. There was evidence that the bullet entered through the back of her leg and exited the front without striking any bones or major arteries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b622} B.H.'s boyfriend testified that B.H. called him that evening, told him she had been shot, and asked him to pick her up from a gas station. He immediately drove there and, when he arrived, B.H. showed him her gunshot wound. She told him that she had been in Mr. Robinson-Bey's car, that he had refused to let her out, and that he had shot her. B.H.'s boyfriend then drove her to the hospital for treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b623} B.H.'s boyfriend indicated that he had received a call from B.H.'s phone earlier in the day, but, when he answered, all he heard was \"rustling, and a lot of scuffling and stuff like that.\" He stated that he could hear B.H.'s voice in the background, as well as a faint male voice. When he repeatedly called out to her, however, she would not respond. He ended the call after a few minutes and tried calling back, but there was no answer. Aware that B.H. had planned to be at home alone that day and concerned for her safety, he decided to call 911. He testified that he ultimately met a police officer at B.H.'s house and looked around, but no one was there. He then returned home and received B.H.'s call from the gas station later that evening.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b624} Officer Kevin Rybka spoke with B.H. at the hospital. B.H. told him that she had been riding in Mr. Robinson-Bey's car when they began to argue about her new boyfriend. She told him that Mr. Robinson-Bey would not let her out of the car, so she attempted to flee when they came to a stop sign. As she attempted to climb out, however, Mr. Robinson-Bey shot her in the leg, chased after her, and brought her back to the car. Consistent with her testimony, B.H. told Officer Rybka that Mr. Robinson-Bey continued to drive them around and eventually took her to Family\n   Dollar, where he convinced a stranger to go inside and purchase peroxide for him. She also told the officer that she ultimately escaped when Mr. Robinson-Bey brought her to her cousin's house and she managed to elude him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b625}\n   </strong>\n   After leaving the hospital, B.H. was transported to the police station and spoke with Detective Leonard Stephens. The State played the recording of her interview for the jury, and, in it, B.H. once again described how Mr. Robinson-Bey had kept her in his car and had shot her in the leg. Following her interview, the police arrested Mr. Robinson-Bey, and Detective Stephens interviewed him. The State also played the recording of his interview for the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b626} During his recorded interview, Mr. Robinson-Bey stated that he had picked up B.H. the previous afternoon because she had called him for help. He repeatedly referred to her being involved in some kind of \"situation,\" but did not elaborate other than to imply that it involved drugs and that she was asking him for money. He denied that he held B.H. against her will or shot her. According to Mr. Robinson-Bey, B.H. was already injured when he picked her up, and she did not want to go to the hospital because she had drugs in her system. He acknowledged that they drove around most of the evening, stopping at Family Dollar to purchase peroxide, and eventually stopping at her cousin's house. When Detective Stephens asked Mr. Robinson-Bey why B.H. would accuse him of shooting her, he suggested that she might be lying to protect someone else, such as a drug dealer. He denied that he owned a gun or had access to a gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b627} Detectives Kelly Johnson and Daniel Gump searched Mr. Robinson-Bey's car following his arrest. Inside the car, they found a .38 caliber revolver wedged between the driver's seat and center console, as well as a pill bottle full of .38 caliber bullets in the rear pouch of the front passenger's seat. The revolver was empty upon recovery, but Detective Johnson testified that they were able to extract a bullet from the inside of the front passenger's door, in the area below the arm rest. Inside the car, the detectives also found a bottle of peroxide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b628} Lindsey Rausch, a forensic scientist from the Bureau of Criminal Investigation (\"BCI\"), conducted DNA testing on the gun that the police found inside Mr. Robinson-Bey's car, as well as a swab they took from the passenger's seat of the car. She testified that the DNA she found on the swab from the passenger's seat was consistent with B.H.'s DNA. Additionally, she testified that DNA she found on the gun was consistent with Mr. Robinson-Bey's DNA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b629} Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the State, a rational trier of fact could have concluded that the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the .38 caliber gun found inside Mr. Robinson-Bey's car was operable and that he knowingly shot B.H.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jenks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1708870\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/61/259/\">\n    61 Ohio St.3d 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=574%20N.E.2d%20492\">\n    574 N.E.2d 492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at paragraph two of the syllabus. The jury heard testimony that the police found a gun in Mr. Robinson-Bey's car, that B.H. was shot from behind while attempting to flee the car, and that a bullet was extracted from the inside the front passenger's door. Further, the jury heard testimony that the two had been arguing, that Mr. Robinson-Bey had refused to let B.H. out of the car, and that he was carrying the gun when he grabbed her and walked her back to the car. Though no one test-fired the gun found in his car, a jury may infer a firearm's operability based on the totality of the circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Ware\n   </em>\n   , 9th Dist.

The totality of the circumstances herein support the inference that Mr. Robinson-Bey shot B.H. to prevent her from leaving and, thus, acted knowingly and had possession of an operable firearm.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%201487053\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; R.C. 2901.22(B).

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b631} Initially, we note that Mr. Robinson-Bey has not framed his argument in terms of any particular ruling on the part of the trial court. Notably, after learning that the non-jury exhibits had inadvertently been given to the jury, Mr. Robinson-Bey chose to file a Crim.R. 29(C) motion for acquittal and requested relief strictly within the context of that motion. On appeal, however, he has not directly challenged the trial court's denial of his motion. Instead, he has framed his argument in terms of a general due process violation. He has made no attempt to comport with Loc.R. 7(B)(7) or to explain why this Court ought to review his argument outside of the only context in which it was raised, i.e., in a Crim.R. 29(C) motion for acquittal. Even assuming that his argument is properly before us, however, we conclude that it lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b632} \"The existence of a prior offense is such an inflammatory fact that ordinarily it should not be revealed to the jury unless specifically permitted under statute or rule.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

They further agreed that only the court would receive the non-jury exhibits, i.e., (1) the certified copy of his prior conviction, and (2) the CCH that the State intended to submit to prove his RVO specifications. It is undisputed that the non-jury exhibits were inadvertently given to the jury during deliberations. Further, when Detective Stephens testified, he told the jury that Mr. Robinson-Bey had been \"arrested for bank robbery a couple times.\" Though the latter drew an objection and resulted in a curative instruction, the court was unable to address the problem of the non-jury exhibits with the jury. The parties did not learn that the non-jury exhibits had gone to the jury until after the verdicts had been returned and the jury had been excused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b634} Mr. Robinson-Bey does not dispute the fact that, due to his weapon under disability charge, the jury had to be told that he had at least one prior conviction for a felony offense of violence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2929.13(A)(2). It is his argument that he was prejudiced when the jury learned the\n   <em>\n    extent\n   </em>\n   of his criminal history. He argues that, absent that information, the jury would not have been aware that he had a lengthy record, that his convictions spanned the course of over thirty years, and that many of them involved the use of a firearm. According to Mr. Robinson-Bey, the inadvertent introduction of his entire criminal history \"had an undeniably prejudicial impact.\" Additionally, he argues that it deprived him of due process because he premised his decision to waive certain rights (i.e., his right to testify and to have the jury decide his RVO specifications) upon the parties' stipulation that the jury would receive only limited information about one of his prior convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b635} Having reviewed the record, we cannot conclude that Mr. Robinson-Bey has established material prejudice as a result of either the submission of the non-jury exhibits to the jury or Detective Stephens' testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1412073\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/38/346/#p351\">\n    38 Ohio St.3d at 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=528%20N.E.2d%20910\">\n    528 N.E.2d 910\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . First, the State set forth a wealth of evidence against him. The police found a .38 caliber revolver tucked between the driver's seat of his car and his center console, and the DNA they found on the gun was consistent with his DNA. Mr. Robinson-Bey stipulated that he had a prior conviction for a felony offense of violence, so his mere possession of the gun warranted a conviction for having a weapon under disability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2929.13(A)(2). As to his convictions for abduction and felonious assault, B.H. testified that Mr. Robinson-Bey held her captive in his car, shot her when she tried to flee, and forced her back into the car at gun point. There was evidence that she did, in fact, sustain a gunshot wound to the leg, and a bullet was extracted from the inside of the front passenger's door of Mr. Robinson-Bey's car. The bullet penetrated the inside of the door at a height that supported B.H.'s claim that she was shot as she jumped from the car and her left leg was still inside. Further, Mr. Robinson-Bey admitted that he was with B.H. that day/evening and drove her to several of the same places she mentioned (e.g., Family Dollar and her cousin's house). Though he claimed that B.H. was already injured when the two first met, her testimony, her injury, and the physical evidence the police found inside his car all belied his claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b636} Second, this Court finds specious Mr. Robinson-Bey's assertion that he only waived certain rights because he believed that, if he did, the majority of his criminal history would be kept from the jury. The decisions whether to testify and whether to waive one's right to a jury trial are highly tactical in nature, and any number of factors could have influenced his decision to waive those rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Had Mr. Robinson-Bey chosen to testify or to present his RVO specifications to the jury, many, if not all, of his criminal convictions would have been admitted on cross-examination or during the State's case-in-chief. If his goal was to minimize the jury's exposure to his prior record, then testifying or trying his RVO specifications to the jury would have been inconsistent with that goal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b637} While it is unfortunate that the jury was exposed to Mr. Robinson-Bey's entire criminal history, this Court cannot conclude that he was materially prejudiced thereby. The State's evidence against him was overwhelming. In light of that overwhelming evidence, we must conclude that the errors that occurred here were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   at 351,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=528%20N.E.2d%20910\">\n    528 N.E.2d 910\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The State opposed both requests, noting that there was no evidence he had acted negligently or had restrained B.H. without using force or causing her fear. The State stressed that Mr. Robinson-Bey had physically harmed B.H., had employed force, and had induced fear when he shot her in the leg and dragged her back to his car at gunpoint.

The court honored his request, so a \"hybrid jury and bench trial\" occurred with the court and jury deciding different counts involving the same set of operative facts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 4, 22. At the conclusion of trial, the jury acquitted the defendant, but the court withheld its verdict.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 27-37. The court then spoke with the jurors outside the presence of counsel and, two weeks later, issued a guilty verdict.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Eighth District determined that a structural error occurred when the trial court, still in the process of deliberating, had ex parte communications with the jurors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 42. In reaching its decision, however, the Eighth District noted that the record supported the conclusion that the trial court had engaged the jury in \"substantive discussions\" about the case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38. It further noted that the case had come before it upon a \"peculiar procedural posture\" that had to be \"taken into consideration in examining the propriety of the discussions held between the trial court and the jury and outside of appellant's presence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   {\u00b657} Unlike\n   <em>\n    Marzett\n   </em>\n   , it is unclear from the record here whether the trial court spoke to the jury outside the presence of counsel. The court's actual conversation with the jury is not a part of the record, and the court indicated that the attorneys spoke with the jurors once it finished with them. Even assuming the court spoke with the jurors ex parte, however, there also is no indication in the record that it engaged them in substantive discussions about the case.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38.

His RVO specification only required the court to find that he had previously been convicted of a violent felony of the type enumerated within R.C. 2929.01(CC)(1)(a)-(b). Accordingly, unlike\n   <em>\n    Marzett\n   </em>\n   , there was no danger that the court's exchange with the jury might affect its deliberative process.\n   <em>\n    Compare id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   {\u00b658} Upon review, Mr. Robinson-Bey has not shown that the court committed a constitutional violation, much less structural error, when it spoke to the jurors before is issued a decision on his RVO specification.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012-Ohio-5873\">\n    2012-Ohio-5873\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 7.
