On appeal, Mr. Lewis argues that his right to confront witnesses was violated when the State presented the conclusions of one firearms identification expert through the testimony of another expert, who did not do the testing that led to those conclusions. Mr. Lewis did not object to the testimony at trial but asks us to reverse for plain error. We agree with Mr. Lewis that this testimony was improper but agree with the State that an objection to this testimony was required, and therefore, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b6 2 I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 3 At trial, the State presented two occurrence witnesses-Chicago police officers Israel Gamez and John Gregoire-and several forensic witnesses. Although the confrontation issue turns solely on the firearms identification testimony, Mr. Lewis's claim requires us to consider the strength of the other evidence as well. We will therefore summarize all of the testimony presented at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 4 A. Testimony of the Arresting Officers\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 5 Officers Gamez and Gregoire were on routine patrol on April 30, 2008, at approximately 12:30 a.m. in the area of 12334 South Lowe Avenue when they saw a man, whom they identified at trial as Mr. Lewis, walking eastbound on 124th Street. Officer Gregoire, who was driving, made a U-turn and pulled up beside Mr. Lewis. Officer Gamez testified that he called out to Mr. Lewis from the passenger seat of the car, but Mr. Lewis continued walking. Officer Gamez opened the passenger-side door of the car, Mr. Lewis looked in the officers' direction, turned around to run, and pulled a handgun out of his jacket pocket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 6 Officer Gregoire similarly recalled Officer Gamez asking Mr. Lewis for identification, through the open window, at which point Mr. Lewis pulled a \"blue steel handgun\" from his hoodie and began to run. Officer Gregoire followed Mr. Lewis in the patrol car, driving onto the sidewalk and between buildings, until a set of pylons blocked his way. Officer Gamez jumped out of the car and pursued Mr. Lewis on foot, keeping Mr. Lewis in his line of sight. Officer Gregoire exited the car and ran in the other direction, hoping to intercept Mr. Lewis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 7 Officer Gamez testified that he followed 15 to 20 feet behind Mr. Lewis as Mr. Lewis ran around a building, into a parking lot, and eventually across the street and in between two houses. At this point, Officer Gamez could still see Mr. Lewis and continued to announce his office and tell Mr. Lewis to drop his gun. Officer Gamez testified that he was 10 to 15 feet behind Mr. Lewis when Mr. Lewis ran between 12334 and 12338 South Lowe Avenue and into the gangway of 12334 South Lowe Avenue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 8 The two officers' accounts varied slightly as to what occurred next. Officer Gamez testified that Mr. Lewis \"was mid-way into the gangway [when] he turned his body halfway around and pointed a gun\" and shot at Officer Gamez. Officer Gamez\n   reported that he was being shot at over his radio. After firing the first shot, Mr. Lewis kept running to the end of the gangway and into the backyard of the building, where he turned around, pointed the gun over his right shoulder, and shot at Officer Gamez again and then \"immediately went behind the frame of the house.\" Officer Gamez lost sight of Mr. Lewis for \"less [than] a second,\" slowed down, then slowly moved around the frame of the house. He then saw Mr. Lewis running toward the backyard's exit, still with the gun in his hand. Mr. Lewis turned and pointed the gun at Officer Gamez once more, and in response Officer Gamez fired six or seven times at Mr. Lewis. Officer Gamez believed he had hit Mr. Lewis because Mr. Lewis \"went down and he hit this pole exiting the backyard and then he rolled into the alley.\" Officer Gamez said he saw Mr. Lewis's body \"spin.\" He did not see Mr. Lewis throw the gun away. Both officers approached Mr. Lewis with their guns drawn and ordered him to show his hands. Mr. Lewis eventually complied, rolling over to show the officers his hands, and Mr. Lewis was arrested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 9 Officer Gregoire's account was that, once he exited the car, he ran around to the front of a building and saw Officer Gamez and Mr. Lewis already running past him. He heard Officer Gamez say, \"police, drop the gun,\" and then saw the two run across Lowe Avenue and into a gangway between two houses. Officer Gregoire then crossed the street and saw Mr. Lewis, while in the gangway, turn and fire a shot. Officer Gregoire testified that Officer Gamez fired a shot in return. Mr. Lewis disappeared out of Officer Gregoire's sight briefly, reappeared, and then went behind the house. At that point, Officer Gamez slowed down. Officer Gregoire testified that as he approached the gangway, he radioed to report that shots had been fired both at them and by them. Officer Gregoire stated that \"Mr. Lewis popped back out,\" he (Officer Gregoire) heard another shot, Officer Gamez fired another shot in return, and then Mr. Lewis \"hit, like a post and landed in an alley.\" Officer Gregoire thought Mr. Lewis had been shot, but when the officers approached him they learned this was not the case. The officers rolled Mr. Lewis over but his gun was not on him. They eventually found it approximately 20 feet away. Officer Gregoire also testified that he did not see Mr. Lewis throw a weapon but also testified that everything happened very quickly and Officer Gamez was closer to Mr. Lewis in the backyard than he was.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 10 B. The Physical Evidence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 11 Officers David Ryan and Brian Smith, forensic investigators for the Chicago Police Department, testified that on April 30, 2008, they performed a gunshot residue (GSR) test on Mr. Lewis's hands and jacket at approximately 2:15 a.m., at the police station. At the scene of the shooting, at approximately 2:40 a.m., the officers recovered from Officer Gamez his service weapon, a Beretta model 8000 \"D,\" with eight live rounds in the magazine and one live round in the chamber.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 12 Officer Ryan testified that he and Officer Smith also recovered a gun near a pole in the alley at approximately 12338 South Lowe Avenue-a black Glock model 19 that he said was \"upside down leaning up against the fence\" with its barrel in the dirt. Officer Ryan did not know how long that gun had been there. He testified that \"the slide [was] partially back and there was a malfunction to the weapon\"; it had experienced a \"double feed\" or a jam that \"render[ed] th[e] weapon incapable of being fired.\" Because the Glock also had a capacity of 16 live rounds and they recovered only 14 live rounds from the gun,\n   Officer Ryan concluded that two shots had been fired from that weapon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 13 Officer Ryan testified that a fired Win (Winchester) 9-millimeter Luger\n   <em>\n    plus \"P\"\n   </em>\n   cartridge case was found \"not far from th[e] gun on the alley pavement.\" Six additional Win (Winchester) 9-millimeter Luger plus \"P\" cartridge cases were found in the backyard area of 12334 South Lowe Avenue. Officer Ryan testified that because this type of ammunition is used by police officers, Officer Ryan believed that these seven cartridges had been fired from Officer Gamez's Beretta.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 14 After raking underneath some bushes the officers found one additional fired cartridge case in the gangway-a S &amp; B (Sellier &amp; Bellot) 9-millimeter Luger. Officer Ryan could not say how long that cartridge case had been under the bushes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 15 Robert Berk, a trace evidence analyst for the Illinois State Police, examined the GSR tests from Mr. Lewis's hands and the jacket that he was wearing when he was arrested. Mr. Berk explained that GSR particles have three elements-lead, barium, and antimony-that are only found together when a firearm is discharged. A \"consistent particle,\" in contrast, \"has one or two of the elements present\" and can result not only when a firearm is discharged but also from \"an environmental or occupational source.\" The samples collected from Mr. Lewis's hands were negative for the presence of GSR but were positive for the presence of \"consistent particles.\" The cuffs of the brown jacket, however, were positive for GSR, which indicated that the cuffs had either \"contacted an item that had primer [GSR] on it, or that they were in the environment of a discharged firearm.\" According to Mr. Berk, these results were consistent with someone firing a gun while wearing the jacket. Mr. Berk acknowledged on cross-examination that it was possible that Officer Gamez, who fired multiple shots, could have transferred the residue to Mr. Lewis during the arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 16 C. The Firearms Identification Testimony\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 17 Kurt Zielinski, a forensic scientist with the Illinois State Police and an expert in firearms identification, testified that another state forensic scientist, Leah Kane, completed the firearms identification examination in this case but that, at the time of trial, she had been on \"medical leave for a number of years already.\" Mr. Zielinski explained that the state police laboratory's quality assurance program requires each firearms identification to be verified by a second examiner. Mr. Zielinski also testified that a \"quality review coordinator reviews case files randomly as well as completely reanalyzes cases to ensure similar findings of the original report.\" Mr. Zielinski testified that here, he reviewed Ms. Kane's results, and also did \"some of the verification\" as well as reviewing the case file. When asked whether he \"agree[d] with the conclusions\" in Ms. Kane's report, Mr. Zielinski stated: \"Yes. I've seen that she has followed all procedures in a proper manner.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 18 Mr. Zielinski first testified that the nine unfired cartridge cases recovered from Officer Gamez's Beretta were Winchester 9-millimeter Lugers. Mr. Zielinski also testified that he agreed with Ms. Kane's conclusion that the seven fired Winchester 9-millimeter cartridge cases all came from the Beretta.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 19 Mr. Zielinski then testified about the Glock and the 14 unfired cartridge cases in that gun. According to Mr. Zielinski's testimony, the Glock model 19 9-millimeter firearm had a total capacity of 16 cartridge cases. Mr. Zielinksi said that \"[a]ccording to Leah's\" report, an examination was done on the Glock and she \"noted that the firearm was inoperable as\n   received.\" The following exchange took place during the State's direct examination of Mr. Zielinski:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \"[MR. ZIELINSKI]: She says that during a dry fire-which is a standard procedure to first do-she noted a muted sound, and that a pull of the slide showed that it slowly came back in the forward position.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   She then field stripped the firearm and found debris in the firing pin channel as well as in the slide. It was then cleaned-no parts were missing, no parts were broken-but it was very dirty, and after the cleaning, the firearm operated correctly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   [THE STATE]: Okay. And when you say that she saw that there was debris and that she had to clean it, if a firearm was found with-would that be consistent with a firearm that has a * * * stovepipe cartridge case in it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   A. It could be, yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Q. And you said that when she examined it, initially, she saw that the slide was the part of the gun that was-had the debris; is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   A. The slide and the firing pin channel, yes.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 20 Mr. Zielinski testified about what it meant for a cartridge case to be \"stovepiped,\" essentially jammed. Using the recovered firearm, Mr. Zielinski then demonstrated what a stovepipe looks like, after which the State inquired:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \"Q. And that stovepipe is consistent with what Leah Kane found when she first examined the gun having the slide with debris and also the firing pin; is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   A. Well, this slide not moving freely, it has since been cleaned by Leah, according to her notes. When this slide doesn't move this freely, if it were to require extra force, then yes, that would be consistent with why a stovepipe might happen.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Q. Okay. Now, what did-after Leah Kane cleaned the gun and did it then operate correctly?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   A. It then operated correctly.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 21 On cross-examination with respect to the Glock, Mr. Zielinski had the following exchange:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \"[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And it's clear that the slide was not operating correctly at the time of that bullet or casing being stovepiped, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   [MR. ZIELINSKI]: It was locked open. I can't tell from the picture if, at the time the picture was taken, what the condition was. I can just go by Ms. Kane's notes at the time she started her examination that the slide and the fire pin channel had debris inside and it was not functioning correctly when she examined it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Q. And had you seen that gun-you, specifically, seen that gun Ms. Kane examined and cleaned-did you see the debris that was cleaned out of that gun?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   A. No, I did not see the debris.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Q. So you do not know * * * what the debris was?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   A. No. No, I do not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Q. And you don't know where the debris came from?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   A. No.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 22 Mr. Zielinski testified that Ms. Kane's \"examination concluded\" that the fired Sellier &amp; Bellot 9-millimeter Luger cartridge case recovered from the gangway was fired from the Glock.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 23 D. The Trial Court's Findings\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 24 In finding Mr. Lewis guilty, the trial court found Officers Gamez and Gregoire credible and stated that \"their testimony\n   [wa]s confirmed by not only the testimony of the forensic investigator who marshaled the evidence that was presented to the Court\" and \"by the forensic experts who testified and examined and concluded and explained the importance of that physical evidence,\" but also \"by virtue of the nature of the circumstances in this instance.\" The court found that Mr. Lewis's gunfire was confirmed by the fired cartridge that was raked from the debris underneath the bush in the gangway, \"confirming Officer Gamez's testimony and Officer Gregoire's testimony that the gun was fired by Mr. Lewis there.\" The court also observed that there was no reason for the officers to \"manufacture a claim of a second shot in the backyard that ends up not being able to be confirmed by the existence of the second cartridge. It's not conceivable to me that they would manufacture that claim in that manner, under those circumstances.\" In addition, the court did not believe the officers had planted the gun recovered 20 feet away from Mr. Lewis, finding that the fact that the gun was jammed was consistent with the officers' testimony and\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   \"to presuppose or conclude that either Officer Gamez or Officer Gregoire-or any other Chicago Police Officer-can manipulate this drop gun-which I would have concluded it was a drop gun dropped by the police to implicate Mr. Lewis-I would have to conclude that they also manipulated the gun in such a manner that they had this unfired or misfired or stovepiped-it's really not stovepiped because it was never actually fired-cartridge cases that's found inside the slide of the gun from loading this next bullet inside the magazine as set forth in the exhibits that both sides have put forth to the Court.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The court also found it significant that the gun was jammed, explaining that \"nobody walks around with a jammed gun\" and that the jammed gun was \"pretty conclusive proof that it was just sought to be fired, and the fact that it was just sought to be fired is consistent with the testimony of Officer Gamez and Officer Gregoire.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 25 The court found Mr. Lewis guilty of two counts of aggravated discharge of a firearm-one with respect to each officer. The court also found Mr. Lewis guilty of attempted first degree murder but changed that finding to not guilty on Mr. Lewis's motion to reconsider. The trial court sentenced Mr. Lewis to concurrent sentences of 16 years on each of the aggravated discharge convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 26 II. JURISDICTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 27 Mr. Lewis was sentenced on February 19, 2016, and timely filed his notice of appeal on March 3, 2016. This court has jurisdiction pursuant to article VI, section 6 of the Illinois Constitution ( Ill. Const. 1970, art. VI, \u00a7 6 ), and Illinois Supreme Court Rules 603 and 606, governing appeals from final judgments of conviction in criminal cases ( Ill. S. Ct. R. 603 (eff. Feb. 6, 2013); R. 606 (eff. Dec. 11, 2014)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 28 III. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 29 Mr. Lewis's sole claim on appeal is that the State violated his right to confront witnesses against him by calling Mr. Zielinski to testify about Ms. Kane's conclusions, leaving him with no opportunity to cross-examine Ms. Kane, who was the real witness against him. Whether a defendant's sixth amendment right to confrontation was violated is a question of law that we review\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    People v.

Ms. Kane's report was prepared after Mr. Lewis was arrested and for the primary purpose of obtaining evidence to be used against Mr. Lewis to prove his guilt at trial. During Mr. Zielinski's testimony, it was clear he was presenting Ms. Kane's conclusions and that all that he could offer was that he agreed with them and had done \"some of the verification.\" Mr. Zielinski never saw the dirty, jammed Glock handgun that Ms. Kane analyzed. Instead, he testified that \"[a]ccording to [her] reports and notes,\" it was \"inoperable as received\" because there was \"debris\" in the weapon. He also never analyzed the fit between that gun and the Sellier &amp; Bellot cartridge case that was recovered but instead testified that Ms. Kane's \"examination concluded that\" the cartridge case recovered from the gangway was fired from the Glock.

At times during his testimony, Mr. Zielinski did state his own opinions based on his own expertise-for example, he testified about the Illinois State Police laboratory's quality assurance program and demonstrated what a stovepiped weapon looks like. But the crux of Mr. Zielinski's testimony-and the State's primary reason for calling him to testify-was to present the conclusions of the firearms identification report as to the condition of the Glock and the fact that one of the recovered cartridge cases was fired from it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 39 The State also argues that under United States Supreme Court precedent there is no confrontation clause violation because the lab report and case file were \"informal.\" This \"informality\" argument relies almost entirely on Justice Thomas's specially concurring opinion in\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   , which is not controlling authority.

Giving the State an opportunity to correct an error before evidence is presented at trial is one of the reasons that an objection is generally required to preserve an evidentiary issue on appeal.\n   <em>\n    People v.

Officers Gamez's and Gregoire's accounts of their interactions with Mr. Lewis were generally consistent-both officers identified Mr. Lewis as the individual they chased, who fired a gun in their direction, and whom they eventually arrested-and the court specifically found their testimony to be credible. Even after excluding Mr. Zielinski's improper testimonial hearsay, the remaining physical evidence corroborates the officers' testimony: GSR was recovered from both sleeves of Mr. Lewis's jacket; a gun was found 20 feet away from where Mr. Lewis had fallen; seven fired Winchester 9-millimeter Luger cartridge cases, the type used by police officers, were found around the crime scene-six in the backyard and another in the alley-corroborating Officer Gamez's testimony that he fired at Mr. Lewis six or seven times; and a fired cartridge case of a different brand-a Sellier &amp; Bellot 9-millimeter Luger-was found in the gangway where the officers testified Mr. Lewis fired his gun. In addition, Officer Ryan, who recovered the Glock, provided first-hand testimony about his examination of the Glock, saying that it had experienced a \"doublefeed\" and that it was jammed. Although this testimony was not as technical as the hearsay provided by Mr. Zielinski, it overlapped some of the significant details.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b6 50 Mr. Lewis claims that Officers Gamez and Gregoire \"contradicted one another on crucial facts\"-specifically, who shot at whom and in what order, noting that Officer Gregoire testified \"that after [Mr.] Lewis fired the first time, [Officer] Gamez immediately fired a shot back,\" while Officer Gamez testified that he only fired at Mr. Lewis when Mr. Lewis was preparing to fire at him for the third time. We find this to be, at most, a minor inconsistency, and understandable considering the intense circumstances of the chase and the officers' differing vantage points; Officer Gamez chased Mr. Lewis the entire time while Officer Gregoire took a different route in an attempt to intercept Mr. Lewis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b6 51 Mr. Lewis also draws our attention to Officer Gregoire's description of Mr. Lewis's gun as \"blue steel,\" noting that the recovered weapon that was shown at trial was black.

However, we think more recent and controlling case law makes clear that these decisions do not control here.
