The juvenile court denied the motion, adjudicated M.C. a delinquent, and entered a dispositional order placing M.C. on non-reporting probation. M.C. appeals, presenting one issue for our review which we restate as whether the juvenile court had subject matter jurisdiction over the proceedings. Concluding it did not, we reverse the judgment of the juvenile court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Facts and Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   [2] On October 5, 2017, the State filed a delinquency petition alleging that M.C. had committed acts that, if committed by an adult, would be child molesting, a Class C felony,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   between October 10, 2011 and January 5, 2013, during which time M.C. was over the age of fourteen but under eighteen years old. However, M.C. was twenty-two years old at the time the delinquency petition was filed with the juvenile court. Pursuant to Indiana Code section 31-30-3-2, the State filed a motion to waive jurisdiction to criminal court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [3] M.C. subsequently filed a motion to dismiss the petition and a supporting memorandum arguing that the juvenile court lacked jurisdiction pursuant to Indiana Code sections 31-9-2-13 and 31-30-1-1. He contended that when the statutes are read together, the juvenile courts do not have jurisdiction over a person who is twenty-one or older. Therefore, because he was not charged until he was twenty-two, he argued the juvenile court did not have jurisdiction over him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [4] On July 13, 2018, the juvenile court denied M.C.'s motion to dismiss and concluded, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   [M.C.] raises issue with the definition of \"child\" for purposes of Title 31-37 outlined in IC 31-9-2-13 and IC 31-30-1-1 which outlines where a juvenile court has exclusive original jurisdiction. While the Court understands [M.C.'s] contention, this Court notes there are numerous definitions of \"child\" which appear elsewhere, and furthermore, for purposes of Title 31-37, this definition of \"child\" must be interpreted in conformity with the totality of cases which could appear before the juvenile court, including\n   crimes committed by individuals under the age of eighteen (18) with no upper age limit as contemplated by IC 31-30-1-11.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Appellant's Appendix, Volume 2 at 27. A hearing on the State's motion for waiver was held on October 2, 2018 and the juvenile court also denied that motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [5] On October 10, 2018, the juvenile court entered an order accepting M.C.'s admission to the allegations set forth in the delinquency petition and M.C. was adjudicated a delinquent. In November 2018, the juvenile court entered a dispositional order placing M.C. on non-reporting probation. M.C. was also ordered to continue with outpatient therapy, provide verification of such participation, maintain full-time employment, pay an administrative fee, and was prohibited from direct or indirect contact with the victim of the crime. M.C. now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Discussion and Decision\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I. Standard of Review\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [6] Indiana courts must possess subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction to adjudicate a case.\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

Applied here, M.C. was not under the age of eighteen at the time the petition was filed; although the delinquent act was committed when M.C. was under eighteen, he was not eighteen, nineteen, or twenty years old when the petition was filed; and he is alleged to have committed the crime of child molesting, not murder.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2031-9-2-13\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Although the alleged delinquent act occurred when M.C. was seventeen, he was twenty-two at the time the petition was filed and cannot be considered a \"child\" under Indiana Code section 31-9-2-13.
