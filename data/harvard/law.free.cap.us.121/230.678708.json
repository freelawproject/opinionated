The tax in question is valid for the following reasons.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-7\">I. The tax is on business done in the exercise of corporate franchises, introduced by permission of the state of Michigan. The tax is' on such business done by means of the complainant\u2019s permanently established local agents and offices in Michigan, with every facility for carrying on business between places within the state, whenever profitable. The-tax is necessary to the safety of the state\u2019s revenue from railroad companies and express companies. ' The tax is upon railroad business so affecting and controlling .public interests of the people of the state of. Michigan that such business ought not to escape taxation in the state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-8\">' II. The opinion of the Supreme Court of Michigan in this suit states a claim by the complainant\u2019s counsel that the .tax in question is void if it is laid \u201c upon the gross earnings of the company within th\u00e9 state, as specific property, because the earnings or assets! are. not within the jurisdiction of the state.\u201d Here is presented a statement of a matter of fact \u2014 the place of the earnings. The complainant ought not to escape taxation in Michigan merely because the final receipt of its earnings in Michigan was at its chief office in the city of New York. The business, by which all right to such earnings accrued, was completed within the state, of Michigan, and, according to the ordinary course of. such business, any suit to collect such earnings must be brought in Michigan, where the contracts therefor were made and fulfilled. And, according to the \u25a0 ordinary course of such business, the payments of the freight charges, in which the' complainant was part owner, were made in Michigan, although the. railroad companies or other common carriers may have carried the money to New York before final. division thereof, and the real collec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>tion of the earnings in Michigan was in Michigan continuously. <em>Railroad Co. </em>v. Collector, 100 U. S. 595, 598; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Erie Railway </em>Co., 106 U. S. 327, 330.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-4\">If final receipt at the home office in New York, of earnings in Michigan, must deprive the latter state of all power to tax such earnings, then all insurance companies and express companies can claim for their earnings in Michigan, immunity from taxation there, if such earnings be not finally receipted for until they arrive in a foreign state. If the Supreme Court of Michigan has decided that the -claim of the complainant\u2019s counsel was wrong, and that the earnings in question were taxable in Michigan, where they were bargained for and collected, it is difficult to understand what statutory or constitutional provision of the United States was thereby infringed upon. The transcript certainly specifies none so infringed upon. And it is difficult to understand why the decision of the Supreme Court of Michigan, on this matter shall not be final.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-5\">III. If the plaintiff could use, in Michigan, its located agencies, its corporate franchises, or its control of the freighting business, so that the Supreme Court of Michigan might in this case rightfully adjudge that the complainant\u2019s business was taxable there, then the adjudication of such Supreme Court in this suit, that such business was so taxable, is final, and no Federal question is of any importance in this suit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-6\">In <em>Murdoch </em>v. <em>City of </em>Memphis, 20 Wall. 590, it is said at p. 636, \u201c If it \u201d [the Federal questi\u00f3n] \u201c was erroneously decided against plaintiff in error,.then this court must /further inquire whether there is any other* matter or issue adjudged by the state court, which is sufficiently broad to maintain the judgment of that court, notwithstanding the error in deciding the issue raised by the Federal question. If this is found to be the case, the judgment must be affirmed without inquiring into the soundness of the decision on such other matter or issue.\u201d <em>Bonaparte </em>v. <em>Tax </em>Court, 104 U.

Art. 1, \u00a7 8, clause 3. It will be observed that the bill shows that the tax finally assessed by7 the auditor of state against the transportation company was for the $28,890.01 of the gross receipts which the company had returned to the commissioner as money received for the transportation of freight from points without to points within the state .of Michigan, and from points within to points without that state, and that no tax was assessed on the $95,714.50 received for transportation, passing entirely through the state to and from other states.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>There is nothing in the opinion of the Supreme Court of the state, which is found in the transcript of the record, to explain this discrimination. There is nothing in the statute of the state on\" which this .tax rests Avhich makes such a distinction, nor is there anything in the commissioner\u2019s requirement for a report which suggests it. It must have been, therefore, upon some idea of the authorities of the state that the one was interstate commerce and the other was not, which we are at a loss to comprehend. Freight carried from a point without the state to some point within the state of Michigan as the end of its voyage, and freight carried from some point within that state to other states, is as much commerce among the states as that which passes entirely through the state from its point of original shipment to its destination. This is clearly stated and decided in the case of <em>The Reading Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>commonly called the <em>Case of the State Freight Tax, </em>15 Wall. 232, in which it is held that a tax upon freight taken up within the state and carried out of it, or taken up without the state and brought within it, is a burden on interstate commerce, and therefore a violation of the constitutional provision that Congress shall have power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states. And in <em>Wabash Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>118 U. S. 557, it is held that a statute attempting to regulate the rates of compensation for transportation of freight from New York to Peoria, in the state of Illinois, or from Peoria to New York, is a regulation of commerce among the states. The same principle is established in <em>Crandall </em>v. <em>State of Nevada, </em>6 Wall, 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">The statute of the state of Michigan of 1883, under which this tax.is imposed, is entitled \u201c An act to provide for the taxr ation of persons, copartnerships, associations, car-loaning companies, corporations, and fast freight lines engaged in the business of running cars over'any of the railroads of this state, and hot being exclusively the property of any railroad company paying taxes on their gross receipts.\u201d Sections 1 and 2 require \"reports to be made to the Commissioner of Railroads of the gross amount of their receipts for freight earned within the limits of the state from all persons and corporations run<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>ning railroad cars within thq state. The commissioner is by \u00a7 4 \"required to make and file with the Auditor General, on the first d\u00e1y of June of each year, a computation of the. amount -of tax which would become due on the first day of July next succeeding from each person, association, or corporation liable to pay such taxes. Each one of these is by \u00a7 5 required to pay to the State Treasurer, upon the statement of the Auditor General, an annual tax of two and one-half per cent, upon its gross receipts, as computed' by the commissioner of railroads.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">It will thus be seen that the act imposed a tax upon all the. gross receipts of the Merchants\u2019 Dispatch Transportation Company, a corporation under the laws of the state ol New York, and with its principal place of business in that state, on account of -goods transported by it in the state of Michigan;. and th.e bill states that the \"company carried no freight the transportation of which was between points exclusively within that state.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">The subject of the attempts by the states to impose burdens upon what has come to be known as interstate commerce or traffic,- and which is called in the Constitution of the United ^States \u201ccommerce among1 the states,\u201d by statutes which endeavor to regulate the exercise of that commerce, as to the mode bywhich.it shall be conducted, or by .the imposition of taxes upon the articles of commerce, or upon the transportation of those articles, fias been very\" much agitated of late years. It has received .the attentive consideration of this court in many cases, and especially within the last five years, and has occupied Congress for \u00e1 time quite as long. The recent act, approved February' 4, 1887, entitled \u201c An act to regulate commerce,\u201d passed after many years of effort in that body, is evidence that Congress has at last undertaken a duty imposed upon it by the Constitution of the United States, in the declaration that it shall have power \u201cto regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states, and with the Indian tribes.\u201d Congress has freely exercised this power so far as relates to commerce With foreign nations and with the Indian tribes but in regard to commerce among the several states it has, until this act, refrained from the passage' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>of any very important regulation upon .this subject, except perhaps the statutes regulating steamboats and their occupation upon the navigable waters of the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">\"With reference to the utterances of this court until within a very short time past, as to what constitutes commerce among tbe several states, and also as to what enactments by the state legislatures are in violation of the constitutional provision on that subject, it may be admitted that the court has not always employed the same language, and that all of the judges of the court who have written opinions for it may not have meant precisely the same thing. Still we think the more recent opinions of the court have pretty clearly established principles upon that subject which can be readily applied to most cases requiring the construction of the constitutional provision, and that these recent decisions leave no room to doubt that the statute of Michigan, as interpreted by its Supreme Court in the present case, is forbidden as a regulation of commerce among the states, the power to make which is withheld from the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">The whole question has been so fully considered in these decisions, and the cases themselves so carefully reviewed, that it would be doing little more than repeating the language of the arguments used in them to go over the ground again. The cases of the <em>State Freight Tax </em>and <em>State Tax on Railway Gross </em>Receipts, which were considered together and decided at the December term, 1812, and reported in 15 Wallace, pp. 232-328, present the points in the case now before us perhaps as clearly as any which have' been before this court. A statute of the state of Pennsylvania imposed upon all the railroad corporations doing business within that state, as well as steamboat companies and others engaged in the carrying trade, a specific tax on each two thousand pounds of freight carried, graduated according to' the articles transported. These were arranged into three classes, on the first of which a tax of two cents per ton was laid, upon the second three cents, and upon \u2022 the third five cents. The Beading Bailroad Company, a party to the suit, in making its report under this statute, divided its freight on which the tax was to be levied into two classes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>namely, freight transported between points within the state and freight which either passed from within the state out of it or from without the state into it. The .Supreme Court of the state of Pennsylvania decided that all the freight carried without regard to its destination, was liable to the tax imposed by the statute. This court, however, held that freight carried entirely through the state from without, and the other class of freight brought into the state from without or carried from within to points without, all came under the description of \u201ccommerce among the States,\u201d within the meaning of the Constitution of the United States; and it held also that freight transported from and to. points exclusively within the limits of the state, was internal commerce and not commerce among the states. . The taxing law of the state was, therefore, valid as to the latter class of transportation, but with regard to the others it was invalid, because it was interstate commerce and the state could lay no tax upon it. In that case which was very thoroughly argued and .very fully considered, the case of <em>Crandall </em>v. <em>Nevada, </em>6 Wall. 35, was cited as showing, in regard to transportation, what was strictly internal commerce of a .state and what was interstate commerce. The' court, said: <em>\u201c </em>Nor is it at all material that the tax is levied upon all. freight, as well that which is wholly internal as that embarked in interstate trade. We are not at this moment inquiring further than whether taxing goods carried because, they <em>are </em>carried, is a regulation of carriage; The state may tax-its internal commerce, but if an act to tax interstate or-foreign commerce is unconstitutional, it is not cured by including in its provisions subjects within the domain of the state-. Nor is a rule prescribed for carriage of goods through, out of,, or into a state any the less a regulation of transportation, because the same rule may be applied to carriage which is wholly internal. Doubtless a state may regulate its internal commerce. as it pleases. If a state chooses,to exact.conditions for- allowing the passage or carriage of persons or freight through it, into another state the nature of the exaction is not changed: by adding to it similar conditions for allowing transportation wholly within the state.\u201d pp. 276, 277.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>In the case of the <em>Erie Railway Company </em>(a corporation of the state of New York) v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>15 Wall. 282, decided at the same time, it appeared that the road of that company was constructed for a short distance through a part of the state of Pennsylvania, and that a similar tax was levied upon- it for freight carried over its road. This was held to he invalid for the reasons given in the case of the Reading road.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">In the other case of <em>State Tax on Railway Gross Receipts, </em>15 Wall. 284, which was also a suit between the Reading Railway Company and the state of Pennsylvania, an act of the legislature of that state was relied on which declared that \u201c In addition to the taxes now provided by law, every railroad, canal, ahd transportation company incorporated under the laws of this Commonwealth, and not liable to the tax upon income under existing laws, shall pay to the Commonwealth a tax of three-fourths of one per centum upon the gross receipts of said company; the said tax shall be paid semiannually upon the first days\u2019 of July and January,, commencing on the first day of July, 1866.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">This tax was held to be valid. The grounds upon which it was distinguished from the one in the preceding case upon freight' were, that the corporation, being a creation of the legislature of Pennsylvania and holding and enjoying all its franchises under the authority of that state, this was a tax upon the franchises which it derived from the state, and was for that reason within the power of the-state, and that, in determining the mode in which the state could tax the franchises which it had conferred, it was not limited to a fixed sum upon the value of them, but it could be graduated by and proportioned to either the value of the privileges granted, on the extent or results of their exercise. \u201cYery manifestly,\u201d said the court, \u201c it is a tax upon the railroad company, measured in amount by the extent of its business, or the degree to which its franchise is exercised,\u201d p. 234. Another reason given for the distinction is that \u201c the tax is not levied, and, indeed, such a tax cannot be, until the expiration of each half-year, and until the money received for. freights, and .from other sources of income, has actually come into the company\u2019s hands. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>Then it has lost its distinctive character as freight earned, by having become incorporated into the \u25a0 general mass of the company\u2019s property. While it must'be conceded that a tax upon interstate transportation is invalid, there seems to be no stronger reason for denying the power of a state to tax the fruits of such transportation after they have become intermingled with the general property of the carrier, than there is for denying her power to tax goods which have been imported, after their original packages have been broxen,- and after they have been mixed with the mass of personal property in the country.\u201d pp. 294, 295, citing <em>Brown </em>v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The-distinction between that case, which is -mainly relied upon by the Supreme Court of Michigan in support of its decree, and the one which we now have before us, is very obvious, and is twofold: First. The corporation which was the subject of. that taxation was a Pennsylvania corporation, having the <em>situs </em>of -its business within the state which created it and endowed it with its franchises. IJpon these franchises thus conferred by the state, it was asserted, the' state had a right to levy a .tax. Second. This tax was levied upon money in the treasury of the corporation, upon property within the limits of the state, which-had passed beyond the stage of compensation for freight and had become like any other property or money hable t\u00f3 taxation by the state. The case before us has neither of these qualities. The corporation upon which this tax is levied is not a corporation of the state of Michigan, and has never been organized \u00f3r acknowledged as a corporation of that state. The money which it received for freight carried within the state probably never was within the state, being paid to the company either at the beginning or the end of its route, and certainly at the time the tax was levied it was neither money nor property of the corporation within the state of Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">The proposition that the states can, by way of a-tax upon business transacted within their limits, or upon the franchises of corporations which they have chartered, regulate such business or the affairs of such corporations, has often been set up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>as a defence to the allegation that the taxation was such an interference with commerce as violated the constitutional provision now under consideration. But where the business so taxed is commerce itself, and is commerce among the states or Avith foreign nations, the constitutional provision cannot thereby be evaded; nor can the states, by granting franchises to corporations engaged in the business of the transportation of persons or merchandise among them, which is itself interstate commerce, acquire the right to regulate that commerce, either by taxation or in any other Avay.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">This is illustrated in the case of <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>97 U. S. 566. The state of Pennsylvania, by her laws, had laid a tax upon the amount of sales of goods made by auctioneers, and had so modified and amended this class of taxes that in the end it remained a. discriminating tax upon goods so sold imported from abroad. This court held that the tax Avhich the auctioneer Avas required to pay into the treasury was a tax upon the goods sold, and as this tax Avas three-quarters.of one per cent, upon foreign drugs, glass, earthenAvare, hides, marble Avork and dyeAAroods, that it Avas a tax upon the goods so described for the privilege of selling them at auction. The. argument Avas made that this Av\u00e1s a tax exclusively upon the business of the auctioneer Avhich the state had a right to levy. In that case, as in others, it was claimed that the privilege of being an auctioneer derived from the state by license, Avas subject to such taxation as the state chose to impose, but the proposition'Avas overruled; and this court held that the tax Avas a regulation of commerce Avith foreign nations, and\" that the fact that it Avas a tax upon the business of an auctioneer did. not relieve it from the objection arising from the constitutional provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The same question arose in the case of <em>The Gloucester Ferry Co. </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>114 U. S. 196. That company was <em>ft </em>corporation chartered by the state Of New -Jersey to run a .ferry carrying passengers and freight between the toAATi of Q-loucester, in that state, and the city of Philadelphia, in the state of Pennsylvania. - It had no property within the state of Pennsylvania, but it leased a landing-place or wharf <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>in that city for its business. The Auditor General and Treasurer of the state of Pennsylvania assessed a tax upon the capital stock of this corporation under the laws of that state, which the company refused to pay. Its validity was sustained by the state Supreme Court, and the question was brought to this court by a writ of error. It was insisted that the tax was justified as a tax upon the business of the corporation, which, it was claimed, was largely transacted in the city of Philadelphia. The Supreme Court of the state, in giving its decision, stated that the single question presented for consideration was, whether the company did business within the state of Pennsylvania within the period for which the taxes were imposed; and it held that it did, because it received and landed passengers and freight at its wharf in the city of Philadelphia. The argument was very much urged in this court that the licensing of ferries across navigable rivers, whether dividing two states or otherwise, had always been within the control of the states, and that this, being a mere tax upon the business of that corporation carried on largely within the state of Pennsylvania, was within the power of that state to regulate. But this court held, after an \u00e9xtensive review of. the previous cases, that the business of ferrying across a navigable stream between two states was necessarily commerce among the states, and could not be taxed as was attempted in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">In the case of <em>Pickard </em>v. <em>Pullman Southern Car </em>Co., 117 U. S. 84, decided at the last term of the court, it was shown that the legislature of Tennessee had imposed what it called a privilege tax under the constitution of that state of fifty dollars per annum upon every sleeping-car or coach run or used upon a railroad in that state, not owned, by the rail-. road company so running or rising it. This, it will be perceived, is very much like the tax in the case, before us, except that it is a specific tax of fifty dollars per annum upon the car instead of a tax upon the gross receipts arising from the use of the car by its owner. In that case, after an exhaustive review of the previous decisions in this class of cases by Mr. Justice Blatchford, who delivered the opinion of the court, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>was held that, as these cars were not property located within the state, it was a tax for the privilege of carrying passengers in that class of cars through, the state, which was interstate commerce, and for that reason the tax could not be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">Two cases have been decided at the present term of the court in which these. questions- have been considered, .one of them at least.involving the subject now under consideration, namely,- that of <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>Taxing District of Shelby County, </em>120 U. S. 489, A statute of that state, declared that \u201call drummers, and all persons not having ar regular licensed house of business .in the taxing district, offering for -sale or selling goods, wares, or merchandise, therein by sample, shall be required to pay to the county trustee .the sum of ten dollars per week, or twenty-five dollars per month, for such privilege.\u201d Robbins was prosecuted for a violation of this law, and on the. trial it appeared that he was a resident and \u25a0 a citizen of Cincinnati, Ohio,, who transacted the business of drumming in. the taxing district .of Shelby County, that is, soliciting .trade %. the use of samples, for the firm by which he was employed, whose place of business was in Cincinnati, and all the members of which were residents and citizens of that city. It was argued in that case, as in the others we have just considered, that the state had a right to. tax the-business of selling by samples goods to be afterwards delivered, and to impose a tax upon the persons called drummers engaged in that business. It was further insisted that, since, the license tax applied.to persons residing within -the state as well as to those who might come from other states to engage in that business, that it was not a tax discriminating against other states, or the products of other states, and was valid as a tax upon- that class of business done within the state. The whole subject is reconsidered again in this case by Mr. Justice Bradley, who delivered the opinion of the court, in which it is held that the business in .which Bobbins, was engaged, namely, that of, selling goods by sample, which were in the state of Ohio at the tim\u00e9 and were to be delivered in the city of Memphis, Tennessee, constituted interstate commerce, and that, so far as this tax was to.be imposed upon Bobbins for doing.that kind of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>business, it was a tax upon interstate commerce, and therefore not within the power of the state to enforce.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">In the case of <em>Wabash Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>118 U. S. 557, the question presented related to a statutory regulation of that state as to compensation for carrying freight., it was held by the Supreme Court of Illinois to embrace all contracts for transportation by railroad which came into or went out of the state, as well as that which was wholly within its limits, and although the controversy did not arise in regard to a <em>tdx </em>upon interstate commerce, yet the general question was fully considered as to what was interstate commerce and what was commerce exclusively within the' state, and how far the former could be thus regulated by a statute of a state. This court held in that case that no statute of a state in regard to the transportation of goods over railroads within its borders, which was a part of a continuous voyage to or from points outside of that state, and thus properly interstate commerce, could regulate the compensation to be paid for such transportation; that the carriage of passengers or freight between different points is commerce, and except where that is wholly and exclusively within the limits of a state it is not subject in its material features to be regulated by the state legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">In many other cases, indeed, in the three last cases- mentioned, the whole subject has been fully examined and considered with all the authorities, and especially decisions of this court relating thereto. -The result is so clearly against the statute of Michigan, as applied by its Supreme Court, that we think the judgment of that court cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\"><em>The decree of the Supreme Court of 'Michigam, is reversed, with directions for further proceedings in' accordance with this </em>opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
