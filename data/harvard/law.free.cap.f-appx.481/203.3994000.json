Garcia, Justice Rose Vela, Justice Nelda Rodriguez, Justice Dori Contreras Garza, Harley Lappin, Prosecutor Norman, Warden Monroe, and Rick Thaler. In his brief, Perez fails to include any discussion, either by name or title, of Santana, Jasso, Valdez, Vela, Rodriguez, Garza, Lappin, Monroe, and Thaler. He has, therefore, abandoned any challenge to the dismissal of his claims against these defendants. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">As to the United States, the district court dismissed Perez\u2019s claims pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction based on the ground that the United States had not waived sovereign immunity. This court reviews such dismissals de novo. <em>Meyers ex rel. Benzing v. Texas, </em>410 F.3d 236, 240 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-15\">\u201c\u2018[T]he United States is a sovereign, and, as such, is immune from suit unless it has expressly waived such immunity and consented to be sued.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith v. Booth, </em>823 F.2d 94, 96 (5th Cir.1987) (citation omitted). The burden of establishing a waiver of sovereign immunity rests with the party attempting to sue the United States. <em>See Taylor-Callahan-Coleman Counties Dist. Adult Prob. Dep't v. Dole, </em>948 F.2d 953, 956 (5th Cir.1991). Perez does not seek relief under the Federal Tort Claims Act and has not identified any other applicable provision waiving sovereign immunity. He has not established a waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-16\">As to Judge Jack, the district court dismissed Perez\u2019s claims pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim based on judicial immunity. This court reviews such dismissals de novo. <em>Amacker v. Renaissance Asset Mgmt. LLC, </em>657 F.3d 252, 254 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-17\">\u201c[Jjudicial immunity is an immunity from suit, not just from the ultimate assessment of damages.\u201d <em>Mireles v. Waco, </em>502 U.S. 9, 11, 112 S.Ct. 286, 116 L.Ed.2d 9 (1991). Such immunity is not overcome by allegations of bad faith and \u201capplies even when the judge is accused of acting maliciously and corruptly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The actions taken by Judge Jack took place during Perez\u2019s revocation proceedings and thus were judicial in nature; moreover, Perez has alleged no facts to support a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>finding that Judge Jack took any actions outside of her jurisdiction. <em>See id. </em>at 11-12, 112 S.Ct. 286. Although absolute immunity does not extend to suits for injunc-tive or declaratory relief, <em>see Chrissy F. by Medley v. Miss. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare, </em>925 F.2d 844, 849 (5th Cir.1991), Perez has failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, and his claim is frivolous. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i), (ii); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">As to Judge Sandra Watts and the defendant prosecutors, the district court dismissed Perez\u2019s claims pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(iii) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(2) based on judicial immunity. Following a de novo review, we find no error in the district court\u2019s dismissal of Judge Watts, <em>see Mireles, </em>502 U.S. at 11-12, 112 S.Ct. 286, and the prosecutors, <em>Esteves v. Brock, </em>106 F.3d 674, 677 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">We next consider Perez\u2019s argument that <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), should not bar his claim that Detective Ralph Lee seized his Cadillac without a warrant and never gave it back. The unauthorized intentional deprivation of property does not constitute a constitutional violation as long as the state provides a meaningful post deprivation remedy. <em>Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 533, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984). The complainant bears the burden of establishing that the state\u2019s post deprivation remedy is inadequate. <em>Myers v. Klevenhagen, </em>97 F.3d 91, 94 (5th Cir.1996). In Texas, the tort remedy of conversion is available for a complainant to seek redress for any alleged property loss. <em>Murphy v. Collins, </em>26 F.3d 541, 543 (5th Cir.1994). Perez has not asserted that he attempted to seek redress in state court or that the state remedy was inadequate; thus, his claim is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"AgC\">Perez\u2019s allegations that the Nueces County Sheriff and the jail librarian denied him access to the library and to the courts do not implicate the validity of his conviction. Prisoners have a constitutional right under the First Amendment to access the courts. <em>Bounds v. Smith, </em>430 U.S. 817, 821, 97 S.Ct. 1491, 52 L.Ed.2d 72 (1977). This right includes access to a law library or other legal assistance. <em>Id. </em>at 828, 97 S.Ct. 1491. To prevail, a prisoner must demonstrate an actual legal injury stemming from the defendants\u2019s conduct. <em>See Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 351-52, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996). Perez has not made this showing. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">As to the remaining defendants, we conduct a de novo review of the district court\u2019s dismissals under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and \u00a7 1915A(b). <em>Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005). Because a judgment in Perez\u2019s favor would necessarily imply the invalidity of his state murder and gun possession convictions and the judgment in his federal revocation proceeding, his claims are barred by <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, and <em>Stephenson v. Reno, </em>28 F.3d 26, 27-28 &amp; n. 1 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">Perez also raises several claims of district court error, which are unavailing. First, his claim that the district court did not conduct a hearing pursuant to <em>Spears v. McCotter, </em>766 F.2d 179, 181-82 (5th Cir.1985), fails. A district court is not required to hold a <em>Spears </em>hearing prior to dismissing a prisoner\u2019s civil rights action; moreover, not \u201call or even most prisoner claims require or deserve a <em>Spears </em>hearing.\u201d <em>Green v. McKaskle, </em>788 F.2d 1116, 1120 (5th Cir.1986); <em>Eason v. Thaler, </em>14 F.3d 8, 9 n. 5 (5th Cir.1994). Based on our review of the record, including Perez\u2019s initial complaint and his subsequent filings, we find no error in the district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>decision to proceed without a <em>Spears </em>hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Perez\u2019s claims that the district court dismissed his civil rights action without first issuing service of process, conducting discovery, and waiting for a decision in his federal habeas proceeding are likewise unavailing. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(e)(2); \u00a7 1915A; <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 489-90, 114 S.Ct. 2364; <em>In re Jacobs, </em>213 F.3d 289, 290 (5th Cir.2000). His argument that the district court improperly decided an issue of fact by concluding that his indictment was a true bill rather than a fraud also fails. This claim implicates the validity of his convictions. Because there is no evidence that Perez\u2019s convictions have been overturned, expunged, or otherwise invalidated, any claim that his indictment was obtained by fi-aud is barred by <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364. Accordingly, the district court did not make an improper fact determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Perez has also shown no error as to his assertions that the district court failed to address his claims for declaratory and injunctive relief. Even assuming that Perez did, in fact, request declaratory and injunctive relief in the district court, the requests briefed in this court are either fatally vague or relate to his state murder conviction. Because there is no evidence that Perez\u2019s state convictions and revocation judgment have been invalidated, he has not shown that he was entitled to the injunctive and declaratory relief he sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Finally, Perez argues that \u201cmost, if not all, of the defendants in this lawsuit have bootstrapped the state court\u2019s jurisdiction over him to include jurisdiction over his federal conviction on drug charges.\u201d His briefing is vague, and he has failed to provide adequate citation to the record. By failing to provide adequate briefing, he has abandoned this issue. <em>See Yohey, </em>985 F.2d at 224-25; Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b231-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
