The district court imposed concurrent 108-month prison terms for these two offenses and ordered the terms to run consecutively to the sentence not yet imposed in Sosa\u2019s pending state case. Sosa now raises arguments that he concedes are foreclosed by <em>United States v. Brown, </em>920 F.2d 1212, 1216-17 (5th Cir.1991), <em>abrogated on other grounds by United States v. Candia, </em>454 F.3d 468, 472-73 (5th Cir.2006), which held that a district court has the discretion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584 to order a federal sentence to run consecutively to a yet-to-be-imposed state sentence. <em>See Setser v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1463, 1466-73, 182 L.Ed.2d 455 (2012). Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b264-17\"> Pursuant to. 5th Cir.
