Invoking 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, he sued to challenge his convictions and sentence, and the district court dismissed the suit after determining that it should be construed as an unauthorized, successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-8\">This court is now presented with Metz\u2019s request for a certificate of appeala-bility (\u201cCOA\u201d), but one is not needed, because he sought relief under \u00a7 2241. <em>See Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 425 (5th Cir.2005). The motion for a COA is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-9\">Because Metz\u2019s claims do not relate to the execution of his sentence, the district court did not err by recharacteriz-ing his putative \u00a7 2241 petition as a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See id.; Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877-78 (5th Cir.2000). Insofar as Metz argues that he should be permitted to proceed under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255 because of his reliance on <em>DePierre v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2225, 180 L.Ed.2d 114 (2011), and <em>Richardson v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 813, 119 S.Ct. 1707, 143 L.Ed.2d 985 (1999), that argument is unavailing, because those decisions do not show that he was convicted of a nonexistent offense. <em>See Wilson v. Roy, </em>643 F.3d 433, 434-35 (5th Cir.2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1062, 181 L.Ed.2d 779 (2012); <em>Christopher v. Miles, </em>342 F.3d 378, 382 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830-31 (5th Cir.2001); \u00a7 2255(e)</p>\n<p id=\"b987-16\">The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b987-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
