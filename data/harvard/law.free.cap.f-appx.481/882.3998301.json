Postley now appeals the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>court\u2019s denial of her motion for reconsideration filed pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6). We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of Postley\u2019s Rule 60(b)(6) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-4\">On June 19, 2008, Kyomi Postley (\u201cPost-ley\u201d), proceeding pro se, filed a personal injury lawsuit in federal district court on behalf of herself and her two minor children. She alleged that, in June 2005, she and her children were in a car accident involving a 2005 Pontiac Grand Am manufactured by General Motors and rented from National Car Rental. She alleged that a defective air bag in the car caused her injuries. General Motors was the only defendant named in the caption of Post-ley\u2019s complaint. However, in Postley\u2019s application to proceed <em>in forma pauperis, </em>she listed General Motors and National Car Rental as defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">On August 6, 2008, General Motors filed a motion to dismiss Postley\u2019s claims on two grounds: (1) that her action was prescribed pursuant to Louisiana law; and (2) that Postley failed to comply with the requirements of Rules 8(a) and 10(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. On September 17, 2008, in an order entitled \u201cJudgment,\u201d the district court granted General Motors\u2019 motion, dismissing Post-ley\u2019s claims with prejudice. Postley filed an untimely notice of appeal from the district court\u2019s judgment on October 31, 2008. We dismissed Postley\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">On December 30, 2008, Postley filed a motion for relief from the district court\u2019s judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6). Postley argued that she was under heavy medication as a result of the car accident, which constituted \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d warranting relief under Rule 60(b)(6). On January 8, 2009, Postley filed an Affidavit of Service requesting the clerk to enter a default judgment against National Car Rental for failure to answer. That same day, the clerk issued a notice of entry of default against National Car Rental. National Car Rental then filed a motion to set aside the entry of default and a motion to dismiss Postley\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-11\">On March 6, 2009, the district court denied Postley\u2019s Rule 60(b)(6) motion, concluding that she had not demonstrated any ground for relief. On March 9, 2009, in an order entitled \u201cFinal Judgment,\u201d the district court granted National Car Rental\u2019s motions, concluding that Postley\u2019s suit, \u201cin its entirety,\u201d was dismissed with prejudice. In a footnote, the court noted that it had \u201cintended the September 17, 2008 Judgment to dismiss all claims by [Postley] against any and all proposed defendants.\u201d Nevertheless, because Postley and the clerk of the court \u201cdid not construe the judgment as such,\u201d the district court decided to rule on and grant National Car Rental\u2019s motions. Postley did not file a notice of appeal from the district court\u2019s March 9, 2009 final judgment. On April 6, 2009, Postley appealed the district court\u2019s denial of her Rule 60(b)(6) motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b909-12\">We must first decide whether we have jurisdiction over this appeal. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we have jurisdiction over \u201cappeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the United States.\u201d General Motors argues that we do not have jurisdiction under \u00a7 1291 because Postley \u201cdid not appeal from a final judgment of the district court or any other order or judgment from which a proper appeal could be taken.\u201d General Motors contends that the district court\u2019s denial of the Rule 60(b)(6) motion \u201cwas not an appealable final judgment because National Car Rent<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>al remained a defendant\u201d in the lawsuit until the court entered its final judgment on March 9, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">We conclude that General Motors\u2019 argument is without merit. In the instant case, the district court denied Postley\u2019s Rule 60(b)(6) motion on March 6, 2009. Three days later, on March 9, 2009, the court entered final judgment dismissing Postley\u2019s suit in its entirety. Then, on April 6, 2009, Postley timely appealed the district court\u2019s denial of her Rule 60(b)(6) motion. Because Postley appealed the denial of her Rule 60(b)(6) motion after the district court\u2019s entry of final judgment, the court\u2019s order denying her Rule 60(b)(6) motion was a final, appealable order under \u00a7 1291. <em>See Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>517 U.S. 706, 712, 116 S.Ct. 1712, 135 L.Ed.2d 1 (1996) (\u201cThe general rule is that \u2018a party is entitled to a single appeal, to be deferred until final judgment has been entered, in which claims of district court error at any stage of the litigation may be ventilated.\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted); 15A CHARLES Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practioe and Procedure \u00a7 3905.1 (2d ed.) (\u201cWhen a district court enters its final order terminating a litigation, orders previously entered during the course of the action can be reviewed by [an appellate court] if so requested by an aggrieved party.\u201d) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Dickinson v. Auto Ctr. Mfg. Co., </em>733 F.2d 1092, 1102 (5th Cir.1983) (\u201cUnder the final judgment appealability rule, a party may obtain review of prejudicial adverse interlocutory rulings upon his appeal from adverse final judgment, at which time the interlocutory rulings (nonreviewable until then) are regarded as merged into the final judgment terminating the action.\u201d) (citations omitted). Therefore, we conclude that we have jurisdiction over Postley\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">We review the denial of a Rule 60(b) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>See Warfield v. Byron, </em>436 F.3d 551, 555 (5th Cir.2006) (citation omitted). Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6), a court may reopen a judgment when a party shows \u201cany other reason that justifies relief.\u201d We have stated that the \u201c \u2018any other reason\u2019 language refers to any other reason than those contained in the five enumerated grounds on which a court may grant a Rule 60(b) motion.\u201d <em>Batts v. Tow-Motor Forklift Co., </em>66 F.3d 743, 747 (5th Cir.1995) (citation omitted). While we have recognized that \u201cRule 60(b)(6) is a grand reservoir of equitable power to do justice in a particular case,\u201d we have also stated that Rule 60(b)(6) relief \u201cwill be granted only if extraordinary circumstances are present.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">In her Rule 60(b)(6) motion, Postley contended that relief from the dismissal of her claims was warranted because she was under heavy medication as a result of the car accident, which prevented her from complying with Rules 8(a) and 10(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The district court denied Postley\u2019s Rule 60(b)(6) motion, reasoning that \u201ceven if the [cjourt were to find that [Postley\u2019s] medication condition is an \u2018extraordinary circumstance\u2019 excusing .her failure to comply with Rules 8(a) and 10(a),\u201d Postley\u2019s claims prescribed two years prior to the commencement of the action. The court stated that \u201c[r]eopening the case will not \u2018turn back time\u2019 and would only cause the parties undue expense and result in a waste of time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b910-8\">We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Postley\u2019s Rule 60(b)(6) motion. The court was correct to note that, even assuming Postley\u2019s medical condition was an \u201cextraordinary circumstance\u201d that excused her lack of compliance with Rules 8(a) and 10(a), her claims prescribed two years be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>fore the filing of her lawsuit. Under Louisiana law, delictual actions are subject to a one-year prescriptive period, which begins to run from the date of injury. La. Crv. Code ANN. art. 3492. In her complaint, Postley alleged that the accident that caused her injuries occurred in June 2005. However, Postley did not file her complaint until June 2008, which was two years, after the prescriptive period had ended.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, Postley\u2019s claims had prescribed under Louisiana law, and Postley pointed to no \u201cextraordinary circumstance\u201d that warranted relief from the district court\u2019s dismissal of her claims based on prescription. Therefore, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Postley\u2019s Rule 60(b)(6) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of Postley\u2019s Rule 60(b)(6) motion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b908-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b909-7\">. On March 11, 2010, we granted National Car Rental\u2019s motion to dismiss Postley\u2019s appeal, but only as to National Car Rental. Postley\u2019s appeal as to General Motors was not resolved because of a bankruptcy stay. The bankruptcy stay was lifted in February 2012.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b911-16\">. Postley has not argued to the district court or to this court that there is a basis for the interruption or suspension of the prescriptive period. <em>See Kling Realty Co. v. Chevron USA, Inc., </em>575 F.3d 510, 517 (5th Cir.2009) (stating that where plaintiff\u2019s claims are facially prescribed, plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating that prescription was interrupted or suspended).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
