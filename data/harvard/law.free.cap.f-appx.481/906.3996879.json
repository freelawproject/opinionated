Patel pleaded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>guilty pursuant to a written plea agreement in 1992 to a superseding information that charged him with conspiracy to import heroin (Count One) and also charged him with witness tampering in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(b)(1) (Count Two). The district court determined Patel\u2019s offense level for the witness tampering count using the aggravated assault guideline in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A2.2 and sentenced Patel within the resulting guideline range to 293 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">Section 3582(c)(2) \u201cpermits a district court to reduce a term of imprisonment when it is based upon a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by an amendment to the Guidelines, if such a reduction is consistent with the policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d We review the district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion, its interpretation of the guidelines de novo, and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">Amendment 591 clarified that a sentencing court should select the applicable offense conduct guideline in Chapter Two of the Guidelines based on only the offense charged in the indictment for which the defendant was convicted (or on an offense stipulated as part of a plea agreement), assisted by the Statutory Index in Appendix A of the Guidelines. U.S.S.G.App. C, amend. 591, at 29-32 (Supp. Nov. 1, 2000); see <em>also </em>U.S.S.G.App. C., amend. 607, at 85 (Supp. Nov. 1, 2000) (making Amendment 591 retroactive). Patel argues that retroactive application of Amendment 591 would lower his sentencing range because the Statutory Index in Appendix A specifies only one Chapter Two offense guideline for his witness tampering offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(b). However, the Statutory Index in the 1991 Guidelines Manual lists three offense conduct guidelines for \u00a7 1512(b): \u201c2A1.2, 2A2.2, 2J1.2.\u201d As the subsequent amendment of this list was not retroactive, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c), p.s., the changes to the Statutory Index do not benefit Patel under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), <em>see </em>\u00a7 1B1.10, p.s., comment. (n.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">Patel also contends that the district court improperly relied on his relevant conduct when it selected the aggravated assault guideline in \u00a7 2A2.2 rather than the obstruction of justice guideline in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2J1.2. However, he fails to show that his offense conduct charged in Count Two did not meet the Guidelines\u2019 definition of aggravated assault, see \u00a7 2A2.2, comment. (n.l) (1991), and he fails to show that the aggravated assault guideline in \u00a7 2A2.2 was not the \u201cmost appropriate\u201d of the three offense conduct guidelines listed in the 1991 Statutory Index to apply in his case, U.S.S.GApp. C, amend. 591, at 30. Thus, Patel fails to show that his sentencing range has been lowered by the retroactive application of Amendment 591.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b932-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
