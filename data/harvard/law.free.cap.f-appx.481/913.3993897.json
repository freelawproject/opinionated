The district court determined that Robinson was not eligible for a reduction of his sentence under the FSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-25\">The Sentencing Commission has amended the drug quantity table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, effective November 1, 2011. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Commission, <em>Guidelines Manual, Supp. to Appendix C-Vol. III, </em>Amendment 750, at 391-98 (Nov. 1, 2011) (Amend.750). Amendment 750, Part A, re-promulgated portions of temporary emergency Amendment 748, which altered the base offense levels for various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>crack cocaine quantities in the drug quantity tables of \u00a7 2D1.1(c) to conform with the new statutory sentences set out in the FSA. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b940-2\">The record reflects that Robinson\u2019s offense involved 3.67 kilograms of crack cocaine and 1.73 kilograms of cocaine, resulting in a total marihuana equivalency of 24,955.08 kilograms. Although Amendment 750, Part A, has been made retroactively applicable, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c), it did not lower base offense levels for offenses such as Robinson\u2019s. <em>See </em>Amend. 750, at 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-3\">Because Robinson was not eligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 750, he cannot show that he will present a nonfrivolous issue with respect to the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010); <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). The request for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED and the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 &amp; n. 24 (5th Cir.1997); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b939-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
