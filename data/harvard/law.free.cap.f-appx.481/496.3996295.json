At sentencing, the district court classified Stephens as a career offender, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(a), and sentenced him as such to a prison term of 188 months<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because he was over 18 years of age, the instant conviction was for a controlled substance offense, and he previously had been convicted of two controlled substance offenses in the Broward County, Florida Circuit Court; to-wit, a 1999 conviction for trafficking cocaine and a 2008 conviction for delivery of cocaine, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13. Stephens now appeals his sentence, claiming that the district court erred in classifying him as a career offender. We find no error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\"> Stephens argues that the court erred in treating his 2008 offense as predicate career offender offense because a judge of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida and a judge of the Twelfth Judicial Circuit of Florida have declared \u00a7 893.13 unconstitutional, and the Florida Supreme Court has accepted jurisdiction in the latter case, <em>Florida v. Adkins, </em>No. SC11-1878, 71 So.3d 117, 2011 WL 4925888 (Fla. Oct. 12, 2011). Neither trial court decision is controlling here; hence, the district court did not err in using the 2008 offense as a predicate offense under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Stephens argues that the court erred in using his 1999 conviction as a predicate offense because he was sentenced as a youthful offender. The problem with this argument is that his lawyer conceded at sentencing that the conviction qualified as a predicate career offender offense. Stephens is bound by that concession. His sentence is, accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b523-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b523-11\">. The sentence was at the bottom of the Guidelines sentence range of 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b523-25\">. Because Stephens did not present this argument to the district court we review it under the plain error standard. There could be no plain error here because no error occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
