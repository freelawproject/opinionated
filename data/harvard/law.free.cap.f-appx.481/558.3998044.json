United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1229, 179 L.Ed.2d 196 (2011). <em>United States v. Harkness, </em>449 Fed.Appx. 858 (11th Cir.2011). Harkness filed a petition for rehearing. We grant the petition, vacate the December 21 opinion, and substitute this opinion in its place.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">Harkness was convicted of possession of a firearm and ammunition by a convicted felon and possession of body armor by a convicted felon in 2007 and sentenced to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment as a career criminal. On appeal, this court vacated and remanded for resentencing after concluding that the district court erred by applying that sentencing enhancement. <em>United States v. Harkness, </em>305 Fed.Appx. 578 (11th Cir.2008) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">At resentencing, the court noted that Harkness\u2019s guidelines range without the enhancement was 110 to 137 months\u2019 imprisonment. Harkness urged the district court to consider a downward departure or variance based on his \u201cextraordinary rehabilitation while in prison,\u201d including teaching nutrition and fitness classes, and a lack of disciplinary infractions. The district court concluded that no variance or departure was warranted because Eleventh Circuit precedent did not permit a district court to consider post-sentencing rehabilitation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But the court stated that it found Harkness\u2019s conduct to be relevant to the sentence imposed under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). After considering and discussing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the court sentenced Harkness to 110 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-14\">On appeal, we affirmed Harkness\u2019s sentence, rejected Harkness\u2019s argument that the district court erred by not considering his post-sentencing rehabilitation at resen-tencing, and concluded that we were bound by prior precedent. <em>United States v. Harkness, </em>367 Fed.Appx. 973 (11th Cir.2010). On <em>certiorari </em>review, the Supreme Court vacated and remanded our decision for reconsideration in light of its recent decision in <em>Pepper v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1229, 1236, 179 L.Ed.2d 196 (2011) (holding that \u201cwhen a defendant\u2019s sentence has been set aside on appeal, a district court at resentencing may consider evidence of a defendant\u2019s postsentencing rehabilitation and such evidence may, in appropriate cases, support a downward variance from the now-advisory Federal Sentencing Guidelines range.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-17\">On remand, we affirmed the sentence imposed, concluding that the district court did consider Harkness\u2019s rehabilitative conduct under the sentencing factors in \u00a7 3553(a), and that this was sufficient under <em>Pepper. </em>449 Fed.Appx. at 859. Harkness then filed a petition for rehearing that is now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-18\">Having reconsidered our December 21 opinion, we grant the petition for rehearing and vacate and remand for resentenc-ing. A thorough review of the record shows that the district court\u2019s statements regarding Harkness\u2019s rehabilitative conduct were ambiguous. Although the court considered Harkness\u2019s conduct when evaluating the appropriate sentence under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the court also stated that under our precedent it could not consider such conduct in determining the advisory guideline range. Thus, we cannot determine whether Harkness would have faced a lower sentence had the court known it could consider a downward variance based on rehabilitative conduct. For these reasons, we vacate and remand for resentencing so that the district court may consider Harkness\u2019s post-sentence rehabilitative conduct under <em>Pepper.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b585-19\">. <em>See United States v.
