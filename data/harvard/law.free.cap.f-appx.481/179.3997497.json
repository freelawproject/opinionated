He contends that the district court\u2019s explanation of the sentence was inadequate and that the sentence was substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">Because he did not object on this basis in the district court, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361-64 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007). To show plain error, Acevedo must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b206-15\">The sentencing transcript reveals that the sentencing judge reviewed the presen-tence report, listened to the parties\u2019 sentencing arguments, expressed concern about Acevedo\u2019s criminal history, and stated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, yet refused to depart below the guideline range or sentence Acevedo to less than 21 months of imprisonment. Thus, the district court\u2019s statement of reasons for the sentence was adequate. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 359, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 564-65 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-16\">To the extent that Acevedo contends that the district court denied his motion for a downward departure under Application Note 8 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 based on cultural assimilation, we lack jurisdiction to review his claim. <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>457 F.3d 416, 424 (5th Cir.2006). In addition, we afford Acevedo\u2019s within-guidelines sentence a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). Even where the plain error standard does not apply to the substantive reasonableness of a sentence, \u201c[t]he fact that the appellate court might reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Acevedo cannot show that his within-guidelines sentence was substantively unreasonable under the more exact<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>ing plain error standard. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b206-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
