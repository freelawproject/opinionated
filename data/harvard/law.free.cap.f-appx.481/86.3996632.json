Finding no error, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-10\">1. Keller first argues that the plan administrator erred by denying her short-term disability benefits under the Plan. However, we agree with the district court that the physician reports in the record provide sufficient evidence to support the administrator\u2019s decision. Moreover, Appellant\u2019s evidence considered with the extensive medical evidence before the administrator do not necessarily show that her condition prevented her from performing her job duties. The administrator\u2019s decision is entitled to deference. <em>See Meditrust Fin. Servs. Corp. v. Sterling Chems., Inc., </em>168 F.3d 211, 215 (5th Cir.1999).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-16\">2. Appellant also argues that she was denied \u201ca full and fair review\u201d of her disability claims in violation of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1133(2). Specifically, Keller argues that the administrator changed its grounds for denying benefits based on new evidence introduced after the denial but before appeal. The introduction of new evidence after a denial of claims does not restart the review process. <em>See Cooper v. Hewlett-Packard Co., </em>592 F.3d 645, 654 (5th Cir.2009). Moreover, an administrator does not unlawfully change the basis of its review if it concludes that the new evidence fails to contradict or merely supports its original assessment. <em>Id. </em>In the instant case, it was not the plan administrator, but Keller, who changed her grounds for seeking benefits on appeal by introducing evidence of an intervening accident. After considering Keller\u2019s additional evidence and the reports of the reviewing physicians, the administrator affirmed its original determination that Keller remained capable of performing her job duties, despite the intervening accident. We there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>fore hold that the administrator has substantially complied with ERISA, and \u201cthe purpose of \u00a7 1133 has been fulfilled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(cite and quotation marks omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b113-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
