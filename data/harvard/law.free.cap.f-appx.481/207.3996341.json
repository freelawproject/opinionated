The district court imposed sentences of 24-months of imprisonment on each of two counts and ordered that the sentences run consecutively to each other and to the 15-year sentence imposed by a Texas state court for the robbery offense that resulted in the revocation. On appeal, Mielnieki challenges only the substantive reasonableness of his revocation sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"AqG\">Mielnieki argues that revocation sentences should be reviewed for \u201creasonableness\u201d in light of <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), but he raises the argument to preserve it for further review. As he acknowledges, we review revocation sentences under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(4)\u2019s \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d standard, <em>United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 843 (5th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 496, 181 L.Ed.2d 345 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-17\">Although Mielnieki asserts that his challenge to the substantive reasonableness of his sentence has been preserved, he lodged only a general objection to the substantive reasonableness of his sentence. He did not assert that his sentence was substantively unreasonable on the grounds he now raises on appeal. Accordingly, our review is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Dunigan, </em>555 F.3d 501, 506 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-18\">As for Mielnicki\u2019s argument that the district court focused upon an improper factor, the Texas robbery, in sentencing him, we find the argument is not supported by the record. Further, even though the district court noted Mielnicki\u2019s criminal history before imposing sentence, the district court was not prohibited from considering \u201cthe history and characteristics of the defendant.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). Moreover, the district court clearly stated that the sentence addressed \u201cthe factors [it] should consider in a revocation context under\u201d \u00a7 3553(a). Accordingly, Mielnieki has failed to show that the district court considered an improper fac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>tor in imposing the revocation sentence. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A); <em>Miller, </em>634 F.3d at 844.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">He also argues that in ordering that the revocation sentences run consecutively to each other as well as to the 15-year sentence imposed by the state court, the district court imposed an excessive sentence and disregarded the state court\u2019s intention that the state sentence run concurrently with the revocation sentence. We disagree. The district court was \u201cwithin its authority to impose consecutive terms of imprisonment following the revocation of ... concurrent terms of supervised release.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>250 F.3d 923, 929 (5th Cir.2001). Further, the district court exercised its discretion to order that the revocation sentence be served consecutively to the sentence imposed by the state court. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7131.3(f). The district court\u2019s decision was authorized by statute and preferred under the Guidelines, and it did not constitute plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Finally, although the 48-month sentence is greater than the recommended sentencing range, it does not exceed the statutory maximum term of imprisonment allowed upon revocation. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3583(e)(3). Accordingly, the sentence is not plainly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 265 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b234-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
