Duran argues that the district court erred when it enhanced his offense level pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) for unlawfully remaining in the United States after a crime of violence conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b994-12\">Duran contends that the 16-level enhancement should not apply because there was no removal order issued \u201cafter\u201d his crime of violence conviction and the prior removal order was not reinstated until after his arrest for illegal reentry.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-13\">In our intervening decision in <em>United States v. Nevares-Bustamante, </em>669 F.3d 209 (5th Cir.2012), as the parties forthrightly acknowledged, we held \u201cthat a defendant alleged to have unlawfully remained in the United States following a qualifying conviction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A) is subject to the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A) enhancement only when a removal order is issued or reinstated after that conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 213. The government acknowledges that its position that \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A) does not require a new or reinstated removal order to issue after the qualifying conviction was rejected by this court in <em>Nevares-Bustamante. </em>The government also acknowledges that Duran\u2019s removal order was reinstated after his arrest and, as a result, he had not \u201cremained\u201d in the United States after the issuance of the reinstated order.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-14\">In light of <em>Nevares-Bustamante, </em>and the government\u2019s concessions, we VACATE Duran\u2019s sentence and REMAND for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b994-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b994-11\">. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1) provides that \"If the defendant previously was deported, or unlawfully remained in the United States after \u2014 (A) a conviction for a felony that is ... (ii) a crime of violence\u201d the offense level shall \"increase by 16 levels if the conviction receives criminal history points under Chapter Four.\u201d In turn, the application notes to \u00a7 2LI.2 explain that \"[a] defendant shall be considered to have unlawfully remained in the United States if the defendant remained in the United States following a removal order issued after a conviction, regardless of whether the removal order was in response to the conviction.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. 1(A)(iii). The Supreme Court has held that application notes are authoritative. <em>Stinson v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 36, 38, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
