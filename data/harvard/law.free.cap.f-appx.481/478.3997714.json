The Government appeals, claiming that Wiwo procedurally defaulted his claim. We agree. We vacate both orders and remand to the district court with instructions to reinstate Wiwo\u2019s original sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">In 2007, Wiwo pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm. The district court sentenced him to serve 84 months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by 2 years of supervised release. Wiwo did not appeal. In 2009, Wiwo filed a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate his sentence, relying on both <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), and <em>United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347 (11th Cir.2008) to argue that his sentence was illegal. The district court, citing <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236 (11th Cir.1999), granted relief and resentenced Wiwo to a term of 58 months\u2019 imprisonment and 2 years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-11\">The parties agree on appeal that the district court erroneously applied <em>Wofford, see Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293, 1319-23 (11th Cir.2011), that Wiwo procedurally defaulted his claim by failing to file a direct appeal, and that our precedent precludes Wiwo from overcoming this procedural default. <em>See McKay v. United States, </em>657 F.3d 1190, 1196 (11th Cir.2011), <em>pet. for cert. filed </em>(Apr. 23, 2012) (U.S. No. 11-9985). Nevertheless, Wiwo urges us to affirm the district court\u2019s erroneous order.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-14\">Generally, we review a \u00a7 2255 proceeding under a mixed standard, reviewing factual findings for clear error and legal issues de novo. <em>Lynn v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1225, 1232 (11th Cir.2004). However, Wiwo claims we are entirely precluded from reviewing the district court\u2019s error because the Government invited that error. Alternatively, Wiwo claims a plain error standard should apply because the Government waived the procedural default claim by failing to \u201cobject\u201d that Wiwo was not actually innocent.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-15\">A party may not challenge as error a ruling invited by that party. <em>United States v. Love, </em>449 F.3d 1154, 1157 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cThe doctrine of invited error is implicated when a party induces or invites the district court into making an error.\u201d <em>United States v. Stone, </em>139 F.3d 822, 838 (11th Cir.1998) (quotation omitted). Invited error most frequently occurs when a party introduces otherwise inadmissible evidence at trial or submits incorrect jury instructions with which the court charges the jury. <em>Id. </em>When a party\u2019s words or actions expressly accept the position challenged on appeal, that party invited the error. <em>See United States v. Silvestri, </em>409 F.3d 1311, 1337 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-16\">The Government never accepted the district court\u2019s erroneous legal position. In fact, the Government consistently claimed Wiwo procedurally defaulted his claim. The Government did not propose, accept, or adopt the erroneous legal con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>elusion reached by the district court. The invited error doctrine is inapposite to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">Wiwo describes the Government\u2019s argument in favor of procedural default as a new \u201cobjection\u201d that should have been raised before the district court, and insists plain-error review is appropriate. Although a party may waive an objection in district court by not clearly articulating it, <em>see United States v. Zinn, </em>321 F.3d 1084, 1087-88 (11th Cir.2003), once a <em>claim </em>has been properly raised, any argument may be advanced in support of that claim on appeal. <em>Pugliese v. Pukka Dev., Inc., </em>550 F.3d 1299, 1304 n. 3 (11th Cir.2008). The Government has consistently claimed procedural default precludes Wiwo\u2019s requested relief. We therefore reject Wiwo\u2019s proposed plain-error standard, and review the district court\u2019s legal conclusions de novo.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Wiwo confesses the district court committed legal error, and concedes his claim is procedurally defaulted. Our precedent dictates the same result. <em>See McKay, </em>657 F.3d at 1196; <em>Gilbert, </em>640 F.3d at 1319-23. We vacate the district court\u2019s order and its amended judgment, and remand to the district court with instructions to reinstate the original sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
