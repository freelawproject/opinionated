At the beginning of Pineda\u2019s sentencing hearing, he moved to allow an attorney retained by him to substitute for his appointed counsel and for a continuance of the sentencing hearing to allow the new attorney time to prepare. Pineda first contends that the district court\u2019s denial of those motions violated his right to counsel of choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">The Sixth Amendment right to counsel has \u201clong been construed to include a criminal defendant\u2019s qualified right to retain counsel of the defendant\u2019s own choosing.\u201d <em>United States v. Hughey, </em>147 F.3d 423, 428 (5th Cir.1998). The right to counsel of choice is not absolute, and a court retains wide latitude in balancing that right against the needs of fairness and the demands of its calendar. <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>548 U.S. 140, 151-52, 126 S.Ct. 2557, 165 L.Ed.2d 409 (2006); <em>Morris v. Slappy, </em>461 U.S. 1, 11-12, 103 S.Ct. 1610, 75 L.Ed.2d 610 (1983); <em>Hughey, </em>147 F.3d at 429-32. \u201c[T]rial courts must necessarily be wary of last minute requests to change counsel lest they impede the prompt and efficient administration of justice.\u201d <em>McQueen v. Blackburn, </em>755 F.2d 1174, 1178 (5th Cir.1985) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). A district court\u2019s erroneous deprivation of the right to counsel of choice constitutes structural error that is not subject to harmless-error analysis. <em>Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>548 U.S. at 150-52, 126 S.Ct. 2557.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-14\">In denying Pineda\u2019s motions, the district court reasoned that they were not made until the day of the sentencing hearing, the newly retained attorney was not prepared to proceed without a continuance, the case had been going on for \u201ca very long time\u201d already, Pineda presented no basis why his appointed counsel would not be suitable to proceed at the sentencing hearing, there would be a disruption to the Government given its arrangements for the appearance of witnesses and preparation for the hearing, and there would be a disruption to the court\u2019s docket given that the court had set aside the entire afternoon in preparation for the lengthy sentencing hearing. Based on our review of the record, the district court did not exceed the wide latitude afforded to it in balancing Pineda\u2019s limited right to counsel of his choice against the burdens of a continuance. <em>See Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>548 U.S. at 151-52, 126 S.Ct. 2557; <em>Slappy, </em>461 U.S. at 11-12, 103 S.Ct. 1610; <em>Hughey, </em>147 F.3d at 429-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-15\">Pineda also challenges the assessment of the three-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(b). After hearing the testimony of four witnesses at Pineda\u2019s sentencing hearing, the district court imposed the enhancement based on its finding that Pineda was a manager or supervi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>sor in a criminal activity that involved five or more participants. That finding is reviewed for clear error. <em>See United States v. Rose, </em>449 F.3d 627, 633 (5th Cir.2006). Based on the record as a whole, such a finding was plausible and therefore not clearly erroneous. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b238-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
