Plaintiffs problem is that she has not brought to the court evidence required by law to meet the statutory terms for the legal action. She has not shown evidence of disability, because that means to suffer the limitation of a major life activity; and her sleeping and thinking is not that disabling. Nor has she shown that she is qualified to perform her employment or that she suffered an adverse employment action, even assuming her as-sistantship qualifies as that employment. She fails to present material evidence of denial of accommodation, or any evidence of discrimination or intent to inflict emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b266-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
