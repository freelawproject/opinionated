He argues that the district court erred in assessing criminal history points based on his prior misdemean- or conviction for displaying a fictitious or counterfeit inspection certificate in violation of Tex. TraNSp. Code Ann. \u00a7 548.603(a)(1). Under that section, a person commits an offense if he \u201cdisplays or causes or permits to be displayed an inspection certificate ... knowing that the certificate is counterfeit, tampered with, altered, fictitious, issued for another vehicle, issued for a vehicle failing to meet all emissions inspection requirements, or [otherwise issued in violation of law].\u201d \u00a7 548.603(a)(1). Alvarez was convicted of the offense after being stopped for speeding while driving a car with an inspection sticker issued for a different vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-16\">In determining a defendant\u2019s criminal history score, \u201c[sjentences for misdemean- or and petty offenses are counted,\u201d except for offenses listed under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1) and \u201coffenses similar to them.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 4A1.2(e)(1). In determining whether a prior offense is \u201csimilar\u201d to a listed offense in \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1), this court employs a \u201ccommon sense approach which relies on all possible factors of similarity.\u201d <em>United States v. Hardeman, </em>933 F.2d 278, 281 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-17\">Alvarez argues that the fictitious inspection certificate offense is similar to the offenses of driving without a license or with an invalid license and giving false information to a police officer, which are listed offenses excludable from a defendant\u2019s criminal history under \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1). He acknowledges that we have held that a misdemeanor conviction for violating \u00a7 548.603 counts as a conviction for criminal history purposes. <em>See United States v. Guajardo, </em>218 Fed.Appx. 294 (5th Cir.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>2007).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">To commit the offense of displaying a fictitious or counterfeit inspection certif\u00ed-cate, Alvarez had to knowingly display a fictitious or counterfeit certif\u00edcate or cause or permit such certificate to be displayed. <em>See </em>\u00a7 548.603(a)(1). The district court did not err in determining that the conviction should be counted in determining his criminal history because displaying a counterfeit inspection certificate requires affirmative and knowing activity and, thus, involves a greater level of culpability than the offenses of omission listed in \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1). <em>See Hardeman, </em>933 F.2d at 281. Accordingly, the district court did not err in assessing criminal history points based on Alvarez\u2019s conviction for displaying a fictitious or counterfeit inspection certif\u00edcate. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b245-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
