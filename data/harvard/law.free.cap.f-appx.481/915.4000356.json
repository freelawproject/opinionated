Willard pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute more than 50 grams of cocaine base (crack cocaine) and was sentenced to 188 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-10\">The district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, while the court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009). Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o).\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-15\">As an initial matter, the record refutes Willard\u2019s assertions that the Government failed to determine whether he was eligible for a sentencing reduction and that the Government and the district court, in finding that he was not entitled to a reduction, incorrectly determined that he was a career offender. The district court agreed with the Government that, although Willard was eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief based on Amendment 750, the court should not exercise its discretion to grant such relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-16\">We also find without merit Willard\u2019s arguments that the district court, in denying him a reduction under Amendment 750, accorded too much weight to his post-conviction disciplinary record, failed to accord proper weight to his post-conviction rehabilitative conduct, and failed to properly consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The sentencing court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence is informed by the applicable \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the pertinent guideline policy statements. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The district court may also consider Willard\u2019s post-sentencing conduct occurring after imposition of the original term of imprisonment. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>542 F.3d 1045, 1052 (5th Cir.2008). The record reflects sufficient consideration of Willard\u2019s post-sentencing con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>duct and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 672-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">Willard\u2019s argument that he is entitled to relief under the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (FSA) is without merit. A \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding is not a full resen-tencing, <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2689-94, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010), and is limited to the consideration only of retroactive amendments to the Guidelines. Thus, although the FSA led to Amendment 750, the FSA, standing alone, has no implications for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-8\">Lastly, Willard has not shown that the interests of justice required the appointment of counsel as the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion did not involve complicated or unresolved issues. <em>See Robinson, </em>542 F.3d at 1052. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b942-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
