Edelmann, federal prisoner # 10316-064, appeals the dismissal of a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7. 2241 petition alleging that her conviction for wire fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343 is invalid in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Skilling v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2896, 2907, 177 L.Ed.2d 619 (2010), that the honest services fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346, criminalizes only conduct involving bribery and kickback schemes. The district court determined that Edel-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>mann\u2019s claims failed to satisfy the \u201csavings clause\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The Government has moved for summary affirmance, a dismissal of the appeal as frivolous, or alternatively, an extension of time to brief the merits. We deny the Government\u2019s motions and AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-4\">Under \u00a7 2241, we review factual findings for clear error and conclusions of law de novo. <em>Christopher v. Miles, </em>342 F.3d 378, 381 (5th Cir.2003). We may affirm the district court\u2019s judgment on any basis supported by the record. <em>Berry v. Brady, </em>192 F.3d 504, 507 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">A \u00a7 2241 petition that attacks custody resulting from a federally imposed sentence may be entertained under the \u201csavings clause\u201d of \u00a7 2255 if the petitioner establishes that the remedy provided under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d to test the legality of his detention. <em>Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 878 (5th Cir.2000); <em>see also Christopher, </em>342 F.3d at 381-82. The savings clause is applicable only to a claim that (i) \u201cis based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense\u201d and that (ii) \u201cwas foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). The petitioner bears the \u201cstringent\u201d burden of affirmatively showing that the \u00a7 2255 remedy is inadequate or ineffective and that she is entitled to avail herself of the \u201climited exception\u201d found in the savings clause. <em>Christopher, </em>342 F.3d at 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">Edelmann has not made this showing. She has failed to show that the district court erred in holding that <em>Skilling </em>is irrelevant because she was not charged with or convicted of honest services fraud. Consequently, we need not decide whether <em>Skilling </em>applies retroactively to cases on collateral review or whether Edelmann\u2019s purported claim was previously foreclosed by circuit precedent because she cannot meet her burden regardless. <em>See Christopher, </em>342 F.3d at 382; <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-9\">AFFIRMED; MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b992-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
