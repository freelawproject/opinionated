He reentered the United States in 1998 through Miami, Florida. In 2011 he was arrested by deportation officers and indicted by a federal grand jury for illegally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>reentering the United States after deportation for an aggravated felony. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), (b)(2). He pleaded guilty to that charge without a written plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">The presentence investigation report recommended a base offense level of 8 under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2L1.2(a) (Nov.2010). It added 16 levels under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A) because Villatoro-Reyes was deported after being convicted of a drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded 13 months, and it subtracted 3 levels for acceptance of responsibility under \u00a7 3E1.1. The result was a recommended total offense level of 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">The PSR reviewed Villatoro-Reyes\u2019 extensive criminal history, which included convictions for driving under the influence, battery, sale or transportation of a controlled substance (twice), possession for sale of cocaine base (twice), prison escape without force, driving without a valid driver\u2019s license (three times), and resisting an officer without violence. His criminal history also included additional arrests for burglary of an occupied conveyance, driving without a valid driver\u2019s license, DUI, and possession of a controlled substance. The PSR calculated a total of 11 criminal history points and recommended a criminal history category of V.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">With a total offense level of 21 and a criminal history category of V, the applicable guidelines range was 70-87 months imprisonment. The statutory maximum sentence for reentering the United States after deportation for an aggravated felony is 20 years. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Villatoro-Reyes did not object to the calculation of the guidelines range, but he asked for a below-the-guidelines sentence of 30 months. He argued that his conviction of possession for sale of cocaine base was \u201cgetting double scored\u201d because it was used for the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A) enhancement and also counted toward his criminal history points. He argued that, based on the nature and circumstances of his offense, his history and characteristics, his lack of \u201cscorable\u201d offenses since the mid-1990s, the \u201cflawed nature\u201d of \u00a7 2L1.2, and the other 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, a sentence of 30 months was reasonable. The government requested a sentence at the bottom of the guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">The district court pointed out that Villa-toro-Reyes had recent arrests, one for a controlled substance violation in 2001 and one for a burglary violation in 2007. It then said: \u201cIf he is committing crimes, some of them pretty serious, I have a little difficulty with a variance.\u201d The court also stated that \u201cunder the circumstances, the provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553, in consideration of those factors and the argument of counsel, the briefs and memorandum ... that a sentence within the guidelines is the appropriate sentence to effectuate a fair and just sentence.\u201d It sentenced Villato-ro-Reyes to 70 months imprisonment and 3 years supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-12\">Villatoro-Reyes contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court did not properly weigh the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. We apply an abuse of discretion standard in reviewing a sentence. <em>United States v. White, </em>663 F.3d 1207, 1215 (11th Cir.2011). Our substantive reasonableness review is guided by the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>at 1217. The district court is required to impose a sentence that is \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in that statutory provision. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Those purposes include the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>respect for the law, provide just punishment of the offense, deter criminal conduct, protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct, and provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2). Among other factors, the district court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the applicable guidelines range, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (4), (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">The burden of establishing that a sentence is unreasonable lies with the party challenging it. <em>White, </em>663 F.3d at 1217. We will vacate a sentence for substantive unreasonableness \u201cif, but only if, we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Villatoro-Reyes has not demonstrated that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. His 70-month sentence is inside the guidelines range, and \u201calthough we do not automatically presume a sentence within the guidelines range is reasonable, we ordinarily expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008) (alteration and quotation marks omitted). His sentence is also well below the statutory maximum prison term of 20 years, <em>see United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that a defendant\u2019s sentence was reasonable in part because it was well below the statutory maximum), and the record shows that the court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and Villatoro-Reyes\u2019 argument for a below-the-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that a district court is not required \u201cto state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b546-6\">. To the extent Villatoro-Reyes argues that the district court engaged in double counting by using a prior conviction for both the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 enhancement and for calculating his criminal history category, we reject that argument. Double counting is permitted if the Sentencing Commission intended that result and the two guidelines sections serve different purposes. <em>United States v. Adeleke, </em>968 F.2d 1159, 1161 (11th Cir.1992). Criminal history categories punish recidivists, and \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A) deters aliens from reentering the country after committing felonies. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
