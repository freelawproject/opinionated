Two of the cases thus remanded were originally filed in the district court pursuant to the Class Action Fairness Act (\u201cCAFA\u201d);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the rest were initially filed in that state court and were thereafter removed to the district court by the common defendants, who asserted federal jurisdiction based on CAFA and, alternatively, on diversity of citizenship<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and supplemental jurisdiction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b886-13\">The orders of the district court appealed herein held that federal jurisdiction was lacking under both CAFA and diversity jurisdiction. We do not have jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s decision to remand for lack of diversity jurisdiction,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but we may review its decision to remand for lack of CAFA jurisdiction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b886-14\">CAFA authorizes federal jurisdiction over class actions that allege (1) the class of plaintiffs would exceed 100 persons, (2) at least one member of the class is diverse in citizenship from at least one of the defendants, and (3) the aggregate quantum of damages suffered by members of the plaintiff class exceeds $5 million (exclusive of interest or costs).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The parties do not contest the presence of the first two re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>quirements, but the plaintiffs challenged the adequacy of the defendants\u2019 showing with regard to the amount-in-controversy requirement. The district court agreed with the plaintiffs that the requisite aggregate quantum of damages was lacking and remanded the case to state court. The defendants appealed. For the reasons outlined below, we affirm the district court\u2019s remand orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">\n<em>I. Facts And Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A-F\">Defendant-Appellant Union Carbide Corporation (\u201cUCC\u201d), a wholly owned corporate subsidiary of The Dow Chemical Company (\u201cDow\u201d), maintains and operates a facility in Taft, Louisiana, a few miles West North West of Hahnville, in St. Charles Parish, Louisiana. On the morning of July 7, 2009, a tank at that facility experienced a sudden release of ethyl acrylate (\u201cEA\u201d), a potentially noxious chemical. Shortly thereafter, the St. Charles Parish Department of Emergency Preparedness (\u201cDEP\u201d) closed some roads and evacuated residents and businesses from an area stretching some two miles eastward from the UCC facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">The DEP was not the only \u201cfirst responder\u201d to this sudden, isolated, and relatively limited chemical release: At least two of plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys or law firms managed to file class action petitions in state district court on the very day of the release. (Others of their colleagues were only marginally slower to respond; they filed their complaints only days or weeks later.) Here, the \u201crace to the courthouse\u201d cannot be explained by any concern that the claims would be untimely, given Louisiana\u2019s prescriptive period of one year within which to file such actions following the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-9\">The five state court lawsuits implicated in this consolidated appeal were removed to federal court by Defendants-Appellants pursuant to CAFA. They urged that when the class plaintiffs\u2019 allegations about the numerosity of class members, the geographical area affected, and the types and extent of the EA-caused injuries incurred by the members of the class are compared to the range of damages previously recovered in the similar class actions cited to the court by Defendants-Appellants, it becomes clear that CAFA\u2019s jurisdictional threshold of $5 million was likely to be met or exceeded. In three detailed orders, however, the district court carefully analyzed its jurisdiction over these cases and then remanded them to state court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> After considering the allegations in the various pleadings as to the geographical reach of the chemicals, the number of persons affected, the seriousness and extent of injuries suffered, and the potential monetary value of the damages incurred by the affected class members for present compensatory damages as well as for pain and suffering, psychological and longterm future damages, and even punitive damages, the district court concluded that the Defendants-Appellants had failed to carry their burden of establishing that it was facially apparent from the allegations in the class plaintiffs\u2019 petitions that the aggregate recovery by the class members would likely exceed $5 million. Inasmuch as, on appeal, there is no question about CAFA\u2019s other threshold requirements, the issue of remand turns solely on the element of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>\n<em>II. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">A. Standard Of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s remand of a state court action previously-removed under CAFA.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Specific to today\u2019s ruling is our <em>de novo </em>review of the district court\u2019s holding that CAFA\u2019s threshold amount in controversy was not met.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">B. CAFA Jurisdictional Amount</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">All recognize that Louisiana law prohibits allegations by tort plaintiffs of the quantum of the damages to which they are entitled.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Even though the removing party (or party resisting remand) has the burden of establishing the existence of federal jurisdiction,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> we have specified a different standard of proof when the quantity of damages is not alleged by the plaintiff class: The removing defendant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the amount in controversy equals or exceeds the jurisdictional amount.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In proceeding from that point, a defendant seeking to sustain removal may follow either of two tracks: (1) Adduce summary judgment evidence of the amount in controversy, or (2) demonstrate that, from the class plaintiffs\u2019 pleadings alone, it is \u201cfacially apparent\u201d that CAFA\u2019s amount in controversy is met.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">Here, the Defendants-Appellants elected to follow the facially-apparent path. Doing so requires examination of the petitions and complaints of the Plaintiffs-Ap-pellees to determine if the resulting amount in controversy is likely to equal or exceed the jurisdictional amount.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We agree with Defendants-Appellants that the proper test for facial apparency is the one recently articulated by the Seventh Circuit in <em>Spivey v. Vertrue, Inc.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-17\">The removing party, as the proponent of federal jurisdiction, bears the burden of describing how the controversy exceeds $5 million. This is a pleading requirement, not a demand for proof. Discovery and trial come later. A removing defendant need not confess liability in order to show that the controversy exceeds the threshold. The removing party\u2019s burden is to show not only what the stakes of the litigation <em>could be, </em>but also what they <em>are </em>given the plaintiffs actual demands_ The demonstration concerns what the plaintiff is claiming (and thus the amount in controversy between the parties), not whether the plaintiff is likely to win or be awarded everything he seeks. Once the proponent of federal jurisdiction has explained plausibly how the stakes exceed $5 million, then the case belongs in federal court unless it is legally impossible for the plaintiff to recover that much.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b888-19\">Moreover, as the district court aptly noted, even under the facial-apparency test \u201c[r]e-moval ... cannot be based simply upon conclusory allegations,\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and \u201cdoubts re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>garding whether removal jurisdiction is proper should be resolved against federal jurisdiction.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">Defendants-Appellants insist on appeal that they established, to a \u201creasonable probability,\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> that the several class pleadings make it facially apparent that CAFA\u2019s required amount in controversy is satisfied. In the district court, Defendants-Appellants relied on census data of the various geographical areas referred to in the several pleadings and complaints, and compared the quantum of recovery in previously reported cases that involved occurrences and injuries similar to the kinds about which the instant class plaintiffs complain.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">As the Defendants-Appellants assert, the district court might have misspoken when it stated that neither party claimed that the jurisdictional minimum was apparent from the faces of the petitions. Nevertheless, after conducting our <em>de novo </em>review, we are satisfied that the district court reached the correct result despite any error that might have been contained in that statement. This becomes evident, we conclude, when Defendants-Appellants\u2019 proffered analysis of the pleadings is tested for whether it is facially apparent therefrom that the jurisdictional minimum is satisfied. Here, Defendants-Appellants\u2019 bald exposure extrapolations are insufficient to establish the likely number of persons affected by the release or, for those affected, the severity of their harm. When we examine the several pleadings here at issue under that standard, we conclude, as did the district court, that, even when properly aggregated, the nature, timing, geographical extent, numerosity of the affected population, and nature of damage allegedly caused by this isolated, quickly controlled, and geographically limited EA escape, as pleaded in the several state court petitions, does not make it facially apparent that the stakes plausibly exceed $5 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-11\">Given the generalized and conclusional nature of the allegations of the several petitions and complaints (not surprising considering the fact that they were filed within hours or, at the most, within days following the release), we cannot say that, under the Seventh Circuit\u2019s <em>Spivey </em>standard, the Defendants-Appellants carried their burden of showing not only what the stakes of the litigation <em>could </em>be, but what they <em>are </em>in light of the plaintiffs\u2019 demands. Like the district court, we conclude that the Defendants-Appellants have failed to present a plausible explanation of how the claims of the class plaintiffs could equal or exceed $5 million. The Defendants-Appellants\u2019 methodology is speculative and unconvincing. They overstate the reach of the plaintiffs\u2019 petitions by improperly equating the geographic areas in which potential plaintiffs might reside with the population of the plaintiff class itself. Further, the comparisons that the Defendants-Appellants make to damage recov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>ery in similar cases is too attenuated to satisfy their burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">In our <em>de novo </em>review, we have aggregated the allegations of all seven consolidated cases, taking care, however, to avoid double counting and repetition in our effort to discern the alleged geographic and temporal reach of the EA release, the likely population of the affected class, and the effect of the release on the limited number of potentially affected plaintiffs. As a result, we cannot say that Defendants-Appellants have satisfied their burden under their chosen path of facial ap-parency.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">In so concluding, we acknowledge that the state court petitions of the class plaintiffs that were so hastily filed in St. Charles Parish present an oxymoronic picture. On the one hand, the pleadings of the class plaintiffs present an expansive view of the geographical reach of the chemicals, the number of persons likely affected, the seriousness and extent of the injuries caused by contact with the rapidly diluting EA, and the potential monetary value of the damages incurred by the affected parties, including not just compensatory damages but also those for pain and suffering, psychological and longterm future damages, and even punitive or exemplary damages. On the other hand, those pleadings also contain minimizing allegations, such as the fact that the road closure and evacuation of residents implemented by the DEP covered only a two mile stretch to the east of the Taft facility, as well as implications and deductions that in reality the release was quickly contained, atmospherically diluted, and relatively minor and temporary in its deleterious effects, and that the incident was short lived, with normalcy being restored in short order.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">\n<em>III. CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we are convinced that the district court\u2019s CAFA-based remand of the consolidated cases should be affirmed. From the factual allegations contained in the pleadings under examination, we conclude that Defendants-Appellants have not met their burden of demonstrating plausibly that the $5 million amount in controversy is apparent. Neither shall we succumb to the siren song of CAFA\u2019s legislative history to err in favor of federal jurisdiction, especially when, as here, we do not see the answer to the question of threshold quantum as an uncertain one. We need not address the issue of the local-controversy exception, and the district court\u2019s rulings on diversity jurisdiction and fraudulent join-der are not implicated in this interlocutory appeal under CAFA. Therefore, we neither address them nor imply either the propriety or impropriety of their handling in the district court. Rather, our judgment is limited to the rulings over which we have appellate jurisdiction, <em>viz, </em>remand of the subject cases to state court for failure of the proponents of CAFA jurisdiction to demonstrate that statute\u2019s amount-in-controversy requirement is met. Those orders are, in all respects,</p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b886-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
