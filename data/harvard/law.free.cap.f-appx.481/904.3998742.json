The Government alleged in the factual basis for his plea that Pav\u00f3n was previously removed following a 1999 Texas conviction for delivery of less than one gram of cocaine by actual transfer. Pav\u00f3n admitted the fact of the 1999 conviction during the plea hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">First, Pav\u00f3n contends that he received ineffective assistance of counsel from the attorney who represented him in the district court. This court rarely reviews such claims raised for the first time on direct appeal, and we decline to do so here. <em>See United States v. Kizzee, </em>150 F.3d 497, 502 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-9\">Second, Pav\u00f3n contends for the first time on appeal that the district court erred by accepting his guilty plea under \u00a7 1326(b)(2) and by imposing a sentence greater than two years, repeating an ineffectiveness claim that he had no prior conviction for an aggravated felony. Pav\u00f3n contends that his 1999 cocaine offense was not an aggravated felony because Texas does not classify it as such and because his offense was treated as a Class A misdemeanor as part of a plea agreement in the case. However, the Texas offense of delivery of cocaine by actual transfer, in any amount, is an aggravated felony for purposes of \u00a7 1326(b)(2). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B) (defining \u201caggravated felony\u201d to include \u201ca drug trafficking crime\u201d as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)); \u00a7 924(c)(2) (defining \u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d as \u201cany felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act\u201d); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 802(8) &amp; (11), 841(a)(1) (criminalizing delivery of a controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA)); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c) (identifying cocaine as a Schedule II narcotic); \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) (providing punishment of up to 20 years for distribution of cocaine in any amount). Federal law controls whether an offense is punishable as a felony under the CSA. <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>549 U.S. 47, 55, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006). Pav\u00f3n admitted the fact of the 1999 Texas conviction during his rearraignment. We find no error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-14\">Third, Pav\u00f3n asserts for the first time on appeal that the district court erred in relying on the PSR during sentencing. He asserts that the PSR was insufficient \u201cto base a sentence on unless the defendant specifically stipulated to each and every alleged fact in the reports.\u201d Pav\u00f3n was not required to admit the sentencing facts; the district court was entitled to find them by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>648 F.3d 273, 277 (5th Cir.2011) (noting that due process requires only that sentencing facts be established by a preponderance of the evidence); <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>633 F.3d 370, 374 (5th Cir.) (holding that a sentence within the statutory maximum based upon judge-found facts by a preponderance of the evidence does not violate the Sixth Amendment), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 3006, 180 L.Ed.2d 832 (2011). The court was entitled to adopt the findings in the PSR unless Pavon showed them to be materially unreliable. <em>See United States v. Ford, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>558 F.3d 371, 377 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>274 F.3d 230, 239 (5th Cir.2001) (holding that a district court is entitled to rely on the presentence report and to adopt its facts \u201cwithout further inquiry\u201d if they had \u201can adequate eviden-tiary basis\u201d and the defendant did \u201cnot present rebuttal evidence\u201d). The existing sentencing record shows no rebuttal of the evidence in the PSR or that it was materially unreliable. We find no error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b931-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
