On appeal, Pasha first argues that he was not removable pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(3)(D) because he derived no cognizable benefit by misrepresenting that he was a citizen and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>did not have the requisite mens rea when he signed the voter application. Second, Pasha contends that he was not removable pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(6)(A) because he did not understand that he was ineligible to vote when he did. Third, Pasha contends that he was eligible for cancellation of removal because the agency should have imputed his father\u2019s time spent in the United States as a lawful permanent resident (\u201cLPR\u201d) to Pasha himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">We review the BIA\u2019s decision as the final judgment, except to the extent it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion or reasoning. <em>Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Insofar as the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">We review the BIA\u2019s factual determinations under the \u201chighly deferential substantial evidence test.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1026-27 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc). In applying this highly deferential test, we will \u201cview the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1027. We must affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by \u201creasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">We review questions of law <em>de novo, </em>giving appropriate deference to the BIA\u2019s reasonable interpretation of the INA. <em>Assa\u2019ad v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1326 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(3)(D)(i), \u201c[a]ny alien who falsely represents, or has falsely represented, himself to be a citizen of the United States for any purpose or benefit under this chapter ... or any Federal or State law is deportable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">Despite Pasha\u2019s assertions to the contrary, the right to vote in elections in North Carolina is a \u201cbenefit\u201d reserved for citizens. <em>See </em>N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 163-55(a) (listing individuals eligible to vote); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 163-82.19(a) (stating that \u201cit is a felony for a person who is not a citizen of the United States to apply to register to vote\u201d in North Carolina); <em>see also Mathews v. Diaz, </em>426 U.S. 67, 78 <em>&amp; </em>n. 12, 96 S.Ct. 1883, 1890 &amp; n. 12, 48 L.Ed.2d 478 (1976) (noting that \u201ca host of constitutional and statutory provisions rest on the premise that a legitimate distinction between citizens and aliens may justify attributes and benefits [such as the right to vote] for one class not accorded to the other\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">We disagree with Pasha\u2019s argument that he cannot be deported under \u00a7 1227(a)(3)(D)(i) unless he fully understood the consequences of his false representation. To affirm the BIA\u2019s decision, there need only be substantial evidence showing that Pasha \u201cfalsely represented ... himself to be a citizen of the United States\u201d to obtain the \u201cbenefit\u201d of the right to vote. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1227(a)(3)(D)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-11\">According to North Carolina election law regarding voter registration, the DMV shall</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-12\">modify its forms so that any eligible person who applies for ... a drivers license ... may, on a part of the form, complete an application to register to vote, or ... to preregister to vote. The person taking the application shall ask if the applicant is a citizen of the United States. If the applicant states that the applicant is not a citizen of the United States, or declines to answer the question, the person taking the application shall inform the applicant that it is a felony for a person who is not a citizen of the United States to apply to register to vote. Any person who willfully and knowingly and with fraudulent intent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>gives false information on the application is guilty of a Class I felony. The application shall state in clear language the penalty for violation of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Afn\">N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 163-82.19(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Under penalty of perjury, Pasha signed one of these DMV forms and indicated that he was a United States citizen, even though he knew that he was not. This false representation gave him the benefit of the right to vote. After he falsely filled out the application, he further acted on the misrepresentation by actually voting in the 2004 general elections.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Given these facts, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Pasha is removable under \u00a7 1227(a)(3)(D)(i) because he \u201cfalsely represented ... himself to be a citizen of the United States\u201d to obtain the \u201cbenefit\u201d of the right to vote. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1227(a)(3)(D)(i).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">Because we find that Pasha is de-portable under \u00a7 1227(a)(3)(D)(i), we need not address whether he is also deportable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(6)(A), which states that \u201c[a]ny alien who has voted in violation of any Federal, State, or local constitutional provision, statute, ordinance, or regulation is deportable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a), the Attorney General may cancel removal in the case of an alien who is deportable from the United States if the alien (1) has been lawfully admitted for permanent residence for not less than five years, (2) has resided in the United States continuously for seven years after having been admitted in any status, and (3) has not been convicted of any aggravated felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-13\">It is undisputed that Pasha does not personally meet the requirements of \u00a7 1229b(a), but he contends that his father\u2019s years of continuous residence should be imputed to Pasha\u2019s status. The BIA has previously construed \u00a7 1229b(a) not to allow imputation of a parent\u2019s years of continuous residence or lawful permanent resident status to his or her child. The Supreme Court recently concluded that the BIA\u2019s construction is reasonable and thus entitled to our deference. <em>Holder v. Martinez Gutierrez, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 132 S.Ct. 2011, 2017, 182 L.Ed.2d 922 (2012). Because Pasha does not \u201csatisfy \u00a7 1229b(a)\u2019s requirements on his own, without counting [his] parent\u2019s years of continuous residence or LPR status,\u201d <em>id., </em>we find that the BIA did not err by preter-mitting Pasha\u2019s application for cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-16\">PETITION DENIED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b623-11\">. In the portion of his brief dealing with \u00a7 1227(a)(3)(D)(i), Pasha cites the Ninth Circuit decision in <em>McDonald v. Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 684 (9th Cir.2005), for the proposition that he can be deported only if the government shows that he knowingly voted when he was not entitled to do so. However, <em>McDonald </em>involved a deportation under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(6)(A), which requires courts to determine whether an alien's acts constituted a violation of a particular federal, state, or local voting law. In <em>McDonald, </em>the court looked to Hawaii\u2019s voting laws, which required that the person \"knowingly\u201d vote when she was not entitled to do so. 400 F.3d at 687. However, under \u00a7 1227(a)(3)(D)(i), the provision at issue here, Pasha need not have violated any particular voting law or criminal statute; he need only have falsely represented that he was a citizen for any purpose or benefit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b623-19\">.
