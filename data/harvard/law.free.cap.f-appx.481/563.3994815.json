After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-11\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b590-12\">A. Mells\u2019s Guilty Plea</p>\n<p id=\"b590-13\">In February 2009, Mells pled guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846. In his plea agreement, Mells agreed to cooperate with the government in the investigation and prosecution of other persons. If Mells cooperated, the government agreed \u201cto consider whether such cooperation qualifies as \u2018substantial assistance\u2019 ... warranting the filing of a motion for a reduction of sentence within one year of the imposition of sentence pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b).\u201d Mells agreed that he understood that (1) \u201cthe determination as to whether \u2018substantial assistance\u2019 has been provided or what type of motion related thereto will be filed, if any, rests solely with the United States Attorney for the Middle District of Florida\u201d and (2) he could not and would not \u201cchallenge that determination, whether by appeal, collateral attack, or otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-15\">In July 2009, the district court sentenced Mells to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment. The government appealed the sentence, and this Court vacated the sentence and remanded with instructions to re-sentence Mells \u201cin accordance with the mandatory ten-year minimum sentence.\u201d <em>See United States v. Mells, </em>383 Fed.Appx. 832, 835 (11th Cir.2010). On December 21, 2010, the district court entered judgment sentencing Mells to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. Mells did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-16\">B. Petition for Writ of Mandamus</p>\n<p id=\"b590-17\">Instead, in August 2011, Mells filed the present <em>pro se </em>petition for a writ of mandamus to compel the government to file a Rule 35(b) motion for reduction of sentence. Mells claimed that he qualified for a sentence reduction under Rule 35(b) because he provided substantial information that led to the arrest and conviction of his brother, Elliot Mack, for the shooting death of William Sancho, III. Mells claimed that, after finding out that Mack committed the crime, he convinced Mack to plead guilty. Mells attached to his petition correspondence between his attorney, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>Ronald Fox, and the assistant state attorney who prosecuted Mack. The assistant state attorney stated his opinion that the Sancho murder would not have been solved without Mells\u2019s convincing Mack to confess.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The government responded to the petition and asserted that a Rule 35(b) motion was unwarranted because Mells never actually talked to federal or state authorities; Mells\u2019s attorney told the assistant state attorney that Mells was responsible for convincing his brother to confess to the murder, but Mells himself never actually talked to any state official.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">On October 7, 2011, the district, court denied Mells\u2019s petition for mandamus relief. The district court noted that, although the government may file a Rule 35(b) motion to reward substantial assistance, it may also refuse to exercise this power for any reason except for a constitutionally impermissible reason. The district court found that Mells failed to allege, much less make a substantial showing, that the government declined to file a Rule 35(b) motion for an unconstitutional motive. Mells timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">On appeal, Mells argues that the district court abused its discretion because the government was required, under the terms of his plea agreement, to file a Rule 35(b) motion based on his cooperation in the Sancho murder investigation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b), the district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence if \u201cthe defendant, after sentencing, provided substantial assistance in investigating or prosecuting another person\u201d and the government files a motion requesting such relief. Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b). The government has the power, but not the duty, to file a substantial-assistance motion. <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 1843, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992) (involving substantial-assistance motion under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e)); <em>United States v. McNeese, </em>547 F.3d 1307, 1308-09 (11th Cir.2008) (applying <em>Wade </em>to a Rule 35(b) motion). Although the government enjoys broad discretion, the district court may review the government\u2019s refusal to file a Rule 35(b) motion if the defendant first makes a \u201csubstantial threshold showing\u201d that the refusal was based upon an unconstitutional motive, such as race or religion. <em>Wade, </em>504 U.S. at 185-86, 112 S.Ct. at 1843-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-12\">Under the Mandamus Act, a district court may \u201ccompel an officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof to perform a duty owed to the plaintiff.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361. \u201cMandamus is an extraordinary remedy which should be utilized only in the clearest and most compelling of cases.\u201d <em>Cash v. Barnhart, </em>327 F.3d 1252, 1257 (11th Cir.2003) (quotation marks and alteration omitted). The party seeking mandamus must demonstrate that \u201chis right to issuance of the writ is clear and indisputable.\u201d <em>In re BellSouth Corp., </em>334 F.3d 941, 953 (11th Cir.2003) (quotation marks omitted). Mandamus relief is appropriate only if: \u201c(1) the plaintiff has a clear right to the relief requested; (2) the defendant has a clear duty to act; and (3) no other adequate remedy is available.\u201d <em>Cash, </em>327 F.3d at 1258 (quotation marks and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-13\">Here, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Mells\u2019s petition for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>mandamus relief. As noted above, the law imposes no duty on the government to file a substantial-assistance motion. <em>See Wade, </em>504 U.S. at 185, 112 S.Ct. at 1843. And, because Mells did not allege (much less make a \u201csubstantial showing\u201d) that the government refused to file a Rule 35(b) motion due to a constitutionally impermissible motive, the district court had no basis for granting the writ. <em>See id. </em>at 185-86, 112 S.Ct. at 1843\u201444.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">Furthermore, Mells\u2019s plea agreement does not require the government to file a substantial-assistance motion. Rather, the government agreed only to \u201cconsider\u201d whether Mells\u2019s cooperation constituted substantial assistance. Given the plea agreement\u2019s language \u2014 which gave the government discretion to file a Rule 35(b) motion and prohibited Mells from challenging that discretion \u2014 Mells can demonstrate neither that he had a clear right to relief nor that the government had a clear, nondiscretionary duty to file a substantial-assistance motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b591-10\">. We review for abuse of discretion the district court's denial of a petition for a writ of mandamus. <em>Kerr v. U.S. Dist. Ct. for the N. Dist. of Cal., </em>426 U.S. 394, 403, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 2124, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b592-7\">. In any event, even if the government had somehow breached the plea agreement, Mells would still not be entitled to mandamus relief because he had an adequate alternative remedy \u2014 namely, a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate his sentence. <em>See United States v. Al-Arian, </em>514 F.3d 1184, 1191 (11th Cir.2008) (stating that a \u00a7 2255 motion \"may be used to enforce promises made in a plea agreement\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b592-20\">. On appeal, Mells also argues that the district court abused its discretion by (1) failing to liberally construe Mells\u2019s <em>pro se </em>filings, (2) striking his reply brief in support of his petition, (3) refusing to hold an evidentiary hearing on the petition, and (4) denying as moot his motion to expand the record. These arguments wholly lack merit, and we decline to address them further.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
