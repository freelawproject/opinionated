No reversible error has been shown; we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">Moreno-Silva entered the United States without inspection. In 2006 \u2014 after the Department of Homeland Security charged him as removable \u2014 Moreno-Silva filed an application for cancellation of removal and adjustment of status. In support of his application, he argued that his United States citizen wife and children would experience exceptional hardship if he was removed to Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">The IJ denied Moreno-Silva\u2019s application, concluding that \u2014 although he had established that his family would suffer exceptional hardship \u2014 his 2005 conviction for fraudulent use of a social security number, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 408(a)(7)(B), constituted a crime involving moral turpitude, rendering him ineligible for a grant of cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The BIA affirmed, concluding that a violation of section 408(a)(7)(B) is categorically a crime involving moral turpitude because it involves deception and dishonesty as essential elements.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-12\">We review the BIA\u2019s decision in this case because the BIA did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Hernandez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>513 F.3d 1336, 1338-39 (11th Cir.2008) (noting that \u201c[wjhen the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision.\u201d). When an alien seeking review of a removal order has been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude, our jurisdiction to review the petition is limited to review of constitutional claims or questions of law. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), (D). Although we review whether a crime involves moral turpitude \u2014 and other questions of <em>law </em>\u2014 de <em>novo, </em>we will defer to the BIA\u2019s interpretation if it is reasonable. <em>Sosa-Martinez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>420 F.3d 1338, 1341 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-13\">A crime of moral turpitude involves \u201c \u2018an act of baseness, vileness, or depravity in the private and social duties which a man owes to his fellow men, or to society in general, contrary to the accepted and customary rule of right and duty between man and man.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1341. To determine whether a petitioner\u2019s conviction constitutes a crime involving moral turpitude, we look to \u201cthe inherent nature of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>offense, as defined in the relevant statute, rather than the circumstances surrounding a defendant\u2019s particular conduct.\u201d <em>Itani v. Ashcroft, </em>298 F.3d 1213, 1215-16 (11th Cir.2002). Crimes involving dishonesty or false statement are considered generally to involve moral turpitude. <em>Id. </em>at 1215.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7_\">Section 408(a)(7)(B) provides that a person commits a felony when he for the purpose of obtaining ... any other benefit to which he ... is not entitled, ... or for any other purpose \u2014 ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-5\">(B) with intent to deceive, falsely represents a number to be the social security account number assigned by the Commissioner of Social Security to him ..., when in fact such number is not the social security account number assigned by the Commission of Social Security to him....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Thus, the essential elements of Moreno-Silva\u2019s offense \u201care (1) false representation of a Social Security number, (2) with intent to deceive, (8) for any purpose.\u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>376 F.3d 1282, 1291 (11th Cir.2004). Because Moreno-Silva\u2019s offense involved both dishonesty and the making of a false statement, the BIA\u2019s interpretation of that crime as one involving moral turpitude is reasonable. <em>See Itani, </em>298 F.3d at 1215.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b638-10\">. Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(1), the Attorney General has discretion to cancel the removal of a non-permanent resident who establishes these four things: (1) he has had continuous physical presence in the United States for ten years; (2) he has been a person of good moral character during those ten years; (3) he has not been convicted of one of several specified offenses; and (4) his citizen spouse or child will suffer \"exceptional and extremely unusual\u201d hardship as a result of his removal. A person fails to establish that he is a person of good moral character if he has been convicted a of a crime involving moral turpitude. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(f)(3); 1182(a)(2)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b638-15\">.
