He argues on appeal that the district court clearly erred in determining the amount of loss on which it based his sentence. He suggests that he is responsible only for items that he personally stole and that he could not reasonably foresee that other items that passed through the chop shop were in fact stolen by his co-conspirators. We review for clear error the sentencing court\u2019s factual determination of relevant conduct. <em>United States v. Ekanem, </em>555 F.3d 172, 175 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-4\">The district court may properly consider acts beyond the individual defendant\u2019s criminal activity \u201cso long as those acts were in furtherance of the same course or conduct or common scheme or plan as the conspiracy.\u201d <em>United States v. Longstreet, </em>603 F.3d 273, 278 (5th Cir.2010). In this case, Boyd offered no evidence to rebut the probation officer\u2019s report that the conspiracy involved specific stolen motorcycles and motorcycle parts and accessories valued at $47,135. His \u201cmere objection\u201d to the amount of loss failed to meet his burden of establishing that the sentencing evidence was unreliable or that his co-conspirators\u2019 acts in this case were not reasonably foreseeable to him. <em>United States v. Ford, </em>558 F.3d 371, 377 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Parker, </em>133 F.3d 322, 329 (5th Cir.1998); <em>United States v.
