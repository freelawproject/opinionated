Amendment 750 took effect on November 1, 2011, and repromul-gated as permanent the temporary emergency Amendment 748, which, among other things, lowered the base offense levels for particular crack cocaine quantities listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c), pursuant to the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (\u201cFSA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amends. 748, 750. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-23\">Raiford pleaded guilty to one count of distributing a quantity of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). In compiling the presentence investigation report, the probation officer calculated Raiford\u2019s sentence using the 2001 version of the Sentencing Guidelines. Raiford\u2019s offense involved less than 250 milligrams (0.25 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>grams) of crack cocaine, which qualified him for a base offense level of 12 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c). However, because Raiford had at least two prior felony convictions for a crime of violence or a drug offense, the probation officer classified him as a career offender and assigned him a base offense level of 32, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. After a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, Raiford\u2019s total offense level became 29. His status as a career offender automatically placed him into criminal history category VI, which, combined with the offense level of 29, yielded a guideline range of 151 to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court sentenced Raiford to 188 months in prison, to be followed by 3 years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Subsequently, Raiford filed the instant \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce his sentence, predicated on Amendment 750 and the FSA. The district court denied his motion, reasoning that he was sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1, and, as such, Amendment 750 did not affect his guideline range. Raiford now appeals, arguing that his sentence was unreasonable because it was higher than those of other defendants who had received sentence reductions pursuant to the FSA, He also contends that the district court erred by failing to calculate a new base offense level under the amended Guidelines and then determine the proper sentence reduction under the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">We review a district court\u2019s decision not to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.2005). The district court\u2019s \u201clegal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines\u201d are reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008). Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), where a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment was based on a guideline range \u201cthat has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission,\u201d a district court has the discretion to reduce the sentence, after considering the pertinent \u00a7 3553(a) factors, \u201cif such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements\u201d of the Guidelines. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The applicable policy statement, found in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, lists those guideline amendments that may apply retroactively to reduce a sentence, and Amendment 750 (parts A and C only) is included in that list. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c). However, a sentence reduction is not authorized if the listed amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">In <em>Moore, </em>we faced the question of whether defendants who were sentenced as career offenders under \u00a7 4B1.1 were eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief in light of Amendment 706, which, like Amendment 750, lowered the base offense levels for certain quantities of crack cocaine under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(e). <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1325-27. We held that the defendants did not qualify for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief because Amendment 706 had no effect on their guideline ranges, which were calculated under \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>Id. </em>at 1327-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">In this case, Raiford was sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1, and Amendment 750 had no effect on his guideline range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 750; <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327-30. Therefore, the district court had no authority to modify his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), regardless of whether his original sentence was unreasonable, and the court did not need to calculate a new base offense level or determine an appropriate sentence under the \u00a7 3553(a) fac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>tors. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Raiford\u2019s \u00a7 8582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
