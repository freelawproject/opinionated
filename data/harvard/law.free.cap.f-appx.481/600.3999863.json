On appeal, Shuck argues that, because he pled guilty to bank robbery \u201cby means of intimidation\u201d and not by \u201cforce and violence,\u201d the instant offense should not qualify as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of applying the career offender enhancement in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Shuck also argues that his sentence was substantively unreasonable because, <em>inter alia, </em>the district court failed to consider the abusive nature of his upbringing and his controlled substance addiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"A52\">Whether a particular offense is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the career offender provision of the Sentencing Guidelines is a question of law we review <em>de novo. United States v. Pantle, </em>637 F.3d 1172, 1174 (11th Cir.2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1091, 181 L.Ed.2d 976 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-15\">Under the career-offender provisions of the Sentencing Guidelines, a defendant is a career offender if (1) he is 18 years old at the time of the instant offense of conviction, (2) the instant offense is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense, and (3) he has two prior felony convictions for either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(a). If applicable, the career offender enhancement generally increases the guideline imprisonment range. <em>See </em>\u00a7 4B 1.1(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-16\">The Guidelines define the term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-17\">(a) The term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d means any offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-18\">(1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-19\">(2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-20\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a). The commentary to section \u00a7 4B1.2 provides that the term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d \u201cincludes murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated assault, forcible sexual offenses, robbery, arson, extortion, extortionate extension of credit, and burglary of a dwelling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4B 1.2, comment, (n.l).</p>\n<p id=\"AuG\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>In determining whether an offense is a crime of violence for \u00a7 4B 1.1 enhancement purposes, we apply a categorical approach, generally looking no further than the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the offense. <em>United States v. Lockley, </em>632 F.3d 1238, 1240 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 257, 181 L.Ed.2d 150 (2011). An offense qualifies as a crime of violence if any of the following are true: (1) the defendant committed an enumerated offense; (2) \u201cthe use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against another was an element of the offense\u201d [\u201celements clause\u201d] or (3) \u201cthe conduct for which the defendant was convicted presented a serious risk of physical injury to another person\u201d [\u201cresidual clause\u201d]. <em>Id. </em>at 1241.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Section 2113(a) of Title 18 of the U.S.Code provides that bank robbery may be committed \u201cby force and violence, or by intimidation.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a). \u201cUnder section 2113(a), intimidation occurs when an ordinary person in the teller\u2019s position reasonably could infer a threat of bodily harm from the defendant\u2019s acts.\u201d <em>United States v. Kelley, </em>412 F.3d 1240, 1244 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">Where the Guidelines specifically enumerate a certain offense as a crime of violence, \u201cwe compare the elements of the crime of conviction to the generic form of the offense.\u201d <em>Lockley, </em>632 F.3d at 1242. The Guidelines commentary provides that robbery is enumerated as a crime of violence. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2 comment, (n.l). In <em>Lockley, </em>we stated the generic definition of robbery as follows: \u201cthe taking of property from another person or from the immediate presence of another person by force or intimidation.\u201d 632 F.3d at 1244 (internal quotation marks omitted). Intimidation \u201cin nearly all instances is the fear of bodily harm.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b628-10\">As to the elements clause, a crime qualifies for the \u00a7 4B 1.1 career offender enhancement when it \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(1). The phrase \u201cphysical force\u201d must be understood as \u201cviolent force,\u201d or \u201cforce capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.\u201d <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>559 U.S. -, -, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 1271, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010) (interpreting the ACCA).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The word \u201cviolent\u201d \u201cconnotes a substantial degree of force.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b628-13\">As to the residual clause, we apply a three-step analysis and ask: (1) \u201cwhat is the relevant category of crime, determined by looking to how the crime is ordinarily committed?\u201d; (2) \u201cdoes that crime pose a \u2018serious potential risk of physical injury\u2019 that is similar in degree to the risks posed by the enumerated crimes?\u201d; and (3) \u201cis that crime similar in kind to the enumerated crimes?\u201d <em>Lockley, </em>632 F.3d at 1245 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-14\">Finally, if an offense is ambiguous as to whether it qualifies on its face as a crime of violence, the district court may \u201cbase its factual findings on undisputed statements\u201d in the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) to determine whether the \u00a7 4B 1.1 career-offender enhancement applies, because the defendant has been deemed to admit those facts for sentencing purposes. <em>United States v. Beckles, </em>565 F.3d 832, 842-44 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>Bank robbery by intimidation, in violation of \u00a7 2113(a), qualifies as a crime of violence under all three avenues identified in <em>Lockley. </em>Shuck\u2019s attempt to differentiate two categorically different crimes from this statute, one of which is a crime of violence (\u201cforce and violence\u201d) and the other of which is not (\u201cintimidation\u201d), is unconvincing. As defined by \u00a7 2113(a), bank robbery, a natural equivalent of generic robbery, has as an element the threatened use of physical force, and poses a risk of substantial physical injury similar in kind and degree to other enumerated offenses. Even assuming the statute was ambiguous as to whether it qualifies as a crime of violence, the factual statements in the PSI show that Shuck threatened a bank teller with death or bodily harm. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court properly found Shuck\u2019s instant offense of bank robbery \u201cby means of intimidation\u201d to be a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 674, 178 L.Ed.2d 502 (2010). The district court must impose a procedurally and substantively reasonable sentence. The party challenging the reasonableness of a sentence bears the burden of showing that it is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">We first review for procedural error, \u201csuch as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence-including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Once we determine that a sentence is procedurally sound, we examine whether the sentence was substantively reasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances. <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1237 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-11\">The review for substantive unreasonableness involves examining the totality of the circumstances and whether the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors support the sentence in question. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008). We will generally \u201cdefer to the district court\u2019s judgment regarding the weight given to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We will not vacate a sentence unless \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en </em>banc) (internal quotation marks omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1813, 179 L.Ed.2d 772 (2011). Although we do not automatically presume a sentence falling within the guideline range to be reasonable, we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008). The reasonableness of a sentence may also be indicated when the sentence imposed was well below the statutory maximum sentence. <em>Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-14\">According to \u00a7 3553, the district court must impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in \u00a7 3553(a)(2), including the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, and protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>duct. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The sentencing court must also consider, among other factors, the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, and the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission. <em>See generally id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7). The district court need not state or discuss each factor explicitly. <em>Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324. It is enough for the court to acknowledge that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">We conclude from the record that Shuck\u2019s sentence was substantively reasonable. The district court acknowledged that it had considered the defendant\u2019s arguments in mitigation and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The sentence imposed was not outside the range of reasonable sentences. Accordingly, we affirm Shuck\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b628-8\">. We look to opinions defining \"violent felony\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) (\"ACCA\u201d), for guidance in considering whether an offense qualifies as a crime of violence under the Guidelines, because the definitions are \"virtually identical.\u201d <em>United States v.
