For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-12\">The record shows that Lopez, a citizen of Mexico, illegally entered the United States in 2000 on three separate occasions, but each time he encountered law enforcement agents and voluntarily returned to Mexico. Subsequently, Lopez again entered the United States illegally and, in 2006, was convicted in state court for marijuana trafficking after a police officer discovered 41 pounds of marijuana in the trunk of his car. Lopez was sentenced to 85 months in prison for that offense and was deported after being released on parole. In 2011, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201cICE\u201d) officers discovered Lopez in a county jail, following his arrest for possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, and determined that he was in the country illegally, which led to the instant conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-13\">In compiling the presentence investigation report, the probation officer calculated Lopez\u2019s guideline range and assigned him a base offense level of 8, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a). The officer added 16 levels under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(i) because Lopez was previously deported after being convicted of a drug trafficking offense for which the sentence exceeded 13 months. Lopez qualified for a 3-level reduction under \u00a7 3E1.1 for acceptance of responsibility, yielding an offense level of 21. Based on Lopez\u2019s marijuana trafficking conviction, the probation officer assigned him 3 criminal history points and placed him into a criminal history category of II, which, combined with the offense level of 21, resulted in a guideline range of 41 to 51 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-14\">At the sentencing hearing, Lopez requested a sentence of 18 months, emphasizing the fact that his guideline range was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>dramatically increased solely because of his one prior conviction. However, the district court sentenced Lopez to 44 months in prison, explaining that he was previously convicted of a serious drug offense, that he had been deported multiple times, and that he lacked a verifiable work history while in the United States. The court stated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and was \u201cparticularly focused on deterrence,\u201d given that the previous 85-month sentence failed to deter him. On appeal, Lopez argues that his sentence was substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a \u201cdeferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201cThe review for substantive unreasonableness involves examining the totality of the circumstances, including an inquiry into whether the statutory factors in \u00a7 3553(a) support the sentence in question.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We do not apply \u201ca presumption of reasonableness\u201d to sentences within the guideline range. <em>United States v. Phaknikone, </em>605 F.3d 1099, 1107 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 643, 178 L.Ed.2d 486 (2010). However, we will \u201cordinarily expect\u201d a within-guideline sentence to be reasonable, and will only remand for re-sentencing if the district court committed a \u201cclear error of judgment\u201d in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">In this case, the district court\u2019s sentence of 44 months in prison fell near the low end of the guideline range of 41 to 51 months, and we would ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>See id. </em>In addition, the sentence of 44 months (or 3.67 years) was well below the 20-year statutory maximum for Lopez\u2019s offense. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2); <em>Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324 (concluding that the sentence was reasonable in part because it was well below the statutory maximum).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-12\">Lopez argues that his sentence was unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals of \u00a7 3553(a), thereby violating the \u201cparsimony principle.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We disagree. In light of Lopez\u2019s prior conviction for marijuana trafficking, for which he received a sentence of 85 months, and his prior repeated illegal entries, the district court could reasonably determine that nothing less than 44 months would suffice to deter him from committing future crimes and that a within-guideline sentence was necessary to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment, and protect the public. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)-(C). Notably, the \u201cweight to be accorded any given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>\u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">Lopez also argues that the court failed to consider the sentencing disparity under \u00a7 3553(a)(6), given that his drug conviction was treated in the same way as much more serious offenses, such as murder or rape. However, the Sentencing Commission determined that a drug trafficking offense for which the sentence exceeded 13 months was \u201cserious enough\u201d to warrant a 16-level enhancement for illegal reentry. <em>United States v. Ortega, </em>358 F.3d 1278, 1280 (11th Cir.2003); <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(i). We see no reason for rejecting the Sentencing Commission\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Finally, Lopez contends that this Court has affirmed downward variances in other cases dealing with less compelling defendants charged with more serious crimes. While that may be so, such cases do not imply that a downward variance was warranted in this particular case, as the district court had broad discretion to impose an individualized sentence that lay within \u201cthe range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324; <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1241 (11th Cir.2009) (stating that this Court\u2019s affirmance of lesser variances in other cases did not warrant a reversal of a greater variance in the instant case).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">In sum, the district court did not commit a clear error of judgment in determining that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors warranted a within-guideline sentence of 44 months. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1)-(2); <em>Clay, </em>483 F.3d at 743. Because Lopez\u2019s sentence was substantively reasonable, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b511-9\">. Under \u00a7 3553(a), a sentencing court must impose a sentence that is \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary\u201d to comply with the purposes of sentencing set forth in \u00a7 3553(a)(2), which include the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, and protect the public from the defendant's further crimes. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). Other factors to be considered in imposing a sentence include the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the available sentences, the applicable guideline range, the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b511-14\">.
