In 2002, a jury convicted Richardson of conspiracy to possess a controlled substance, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846; conspiracy to interfere with commerce by threats and violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a); conspiracy to use a firearm during a crime of violence and a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(o); and possession with intent to distribute marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). The district court sentenced Richardson to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Prior to filing this petition, Richardson had previously filed a motion to vacate under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The district court denied Richardson\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion on the merits. On appeal, Richardson reasserts the substantive challenges to his convictions that he made in his initial \u00a7 2255 motion and his petition for a writ of <em>audita querela. </em>Those challenges relate to allegedly false testimony presented at Richardson\u2019s 2002 trial. Richardson argues that a petition for a writ of <em>audita querela </em>was his only avenue for challenging his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether a prisoner may challenge his sentence by filing a petition for a writ of <em>audita querela. United States v. Holt, </em>417 F.3d 1172, 1174 (11th Cir.2005). We review <em>de novo </em>questions concerning jurisdiction. <em>Williams v. Chatman, </em>510 F.3d 1290, 1293 (11th Cir.2007). <em>\u201cPro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1160 (11th Cir.2003) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">A petition for a writ of <em>audita querela </em>may not be granted when relief is cognizable under \u00a7 2255. <em>Holt, </em>417 F.3d at 1175. Under \u00a7 2255,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-8\">[a] prisoner in custody under sentence of a court ... claiming the right to be released upon the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, or that the court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence, or that the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law, or is otherwise subject to collateral attack, may move the court which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside or correct the sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(a). We may liberally construe a petition for a writ of <em>audita querela </em>as a motion under \u00a7 2255. <em>Holt, </em>417 F.3d at 1175.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">Rule 60(b) provides a limited basis for a party to seek relief from a final judgment in a habeas case. <em>Williams, </em>510 F.3d at 1293. When, in a purported Rule 60(b) motion, a defendant challenges the validity of his conviction by seeking to add a new ground for relief not previously raised or attacking the merits of a district court\u2019s previous resolution of a claim on the merits, the motion is properly construed as a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See id. </em>at 1293-94; <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293, 1323 (11th Cir.2011) <em>(en banc), cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1001, 181 L.Ed.2d 743 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-13\">A prisoner may not file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion without prior certification from this Court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h); <em>United States v. Diaz-Clark, </em>292 F.3d 1310, 1316 (11th Cir.2002). Absent such permission, the district court lacks jurisdiction to address the \u00a7 2255 motion and must dismiss it. <em>See Williams, </em>510 F.3d at 1294-95; <em>Holt, </em>417 F.3d at 1175.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-14\">Richardson\u2019s claim in his petition for a writ of <em>audita querela </em>is cognizable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, and thus, his claim was not properly raised in a petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>for a writ of <em>audita querela. </em>Even if Richardson\u2019s petition was construed as a \u00a7 2255 motion, it would have been a second or successive motion. The district court lacked jurisdiction to consider the merits of a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion because Richardson did not obtain authorization from this Court prior to filing. Similarly, to the extent Richardson sought relief under Rule 60(b), he was not entitled to it. Richardson\u2019s petition challenged the validity of his conviction, rather than a defect in the integrity of his earlier \u00a7 2255 motion proceeding. <em>Gilbert, </em>640 F.3d at 1323. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Richardson\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
