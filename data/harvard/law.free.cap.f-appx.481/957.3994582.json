Driver sought a modification of his sentence based on Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines. By moving to proceed IFP, Driver is challenging the district court\u2019s certification decision that his appeal was not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-24\">Driver argues that the district court erred in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because the district court determined that he posed no danger to society when the court granted his prior \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and that the court is bound by this determination. He also contends that the district court\u2019s determination that he poses a danger to society is clearly erroneous and further asserts that the district court failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-25\">We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009). In determin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>ing whether to reduce a sentence, the district court first determines whether the defendant is eligible for a reduction and the extent of the reduction authorized. <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). Next, the court must consider any applicable \u00a7 3553(a) factors and determine whether a reduction is warranted in whole are in part under the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 2692.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">The district court was not under any obligation to reduce Driver\u2019s sentence at all. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 673. In the instant case, the record shows that the district court gave due consideration to the motion as a whole and considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors; thus, there is no abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-7\">Driver has failed to show that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, his IFP motion is DENIED.- Because the appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b983-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
