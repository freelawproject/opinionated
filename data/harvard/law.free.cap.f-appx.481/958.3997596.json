Namer argues that the money judgment dated November 8, 1991 became invalid and unenforceable ten years later on November 8, 2001, as it was never revived within ten years after it was rendered as required by Louisiana Civil Code Article 8501. This argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">Although Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 69(a)(1) provides that the federal government\u2019s enforcement by writ of execution \u201cmust accord with the procedures of the state where the court is located,\u201d that Rule goes on to provide that notwithstanding this directive, \u201ca federal statute governs to the extent it applies.\u201d Fed R. Civ. P. 69(a)(1). The Federal Debt Collection Procedures Act of 1990 (\u201cFDCPA\u201d) is such a statute. The FDCPA provides that, with the exception of conflicting federal law, it \u201cprovides the exclusive civil procedures for the United States to ... recover a judgment on a debt.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 3001. The judgment liens at issue in this case are \u201cdebts\u201d within the meaning of the FDCPA. <em>Federal Trade Commission v. National Business Consultants, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 317 (5th Cir.2004) (an earlier proceeding in this case). The FDCPA further Provides that it \u201cshall preempt State law to the extent such law is inconsistent.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 3003(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">The Louisiana state law Namer relies on, Louisiana Civil Code Article 3501, clearly conflicts with the provisions of the FDCPA. It provides that a money judgment \u201cis prescribed by the lapse of ten years from its signing\u201d although any party having an interest in the judgment may have it revived before it prescribes, as provided in Article 2031 of the Code of Civil Procedure. <em>Id. </em>In contrast, the FDCPA provides for the duration of liens as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b985-10\">(c) Duration of lien; renewal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b985-11\">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), a lien created under subsection (a) is effective, unless satisfied, for a period of 20 years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b985-12\">(2) Such lien may be renewed for one additional period of 20 years upon filing a notice of renewal in the same manner as the judgment is filed and shall relate back to the date the judgment is filed if\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b985-13\">(A) the notice of renewal is filed before the expiration of the 20-year period to prevent the expiration of the lien; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b985-14\">(B) the court approves the renewal of such lien under this paragraph.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b985-15\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 3201 (emphasis added). Louisiana Civil Code Article 3501, which would preclude enforcement of the judgment after ten years from the entry of that judgment unless timely revived, is such an inconsistent state law and is, therefore, preempted. The FDCPA allows twenty years for renewal of judgments. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 3201.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b985-16\">Further, because the purpose of the FDCPA \u201cis to create a comprehensive statutory framework for the collection of debts owed to the United States government [and to] improve the efficiency and speed in collecting those debts,\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 101-736, at 32 (1990), a state law limiting such collection is inconsistent with the purpose of the act and is, therefore, preempted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b985-17\"><em>United States v. Gianelli, </em>543 F.3d 1178, 1183 (9th Cir.2008) (dealing with California law precluding enforcement of a judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>when 10 years has passed since the judgment was entered). We agree with <em>Gia-nelli </em>on the following point as well.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AsV\">Although not binding upon us, the reasoning of <em>United States v. Pierce, </em>231 B.R. 890, 893 (E.D.N.C.1998) supports our conclusion. In <em>Pierce, </em>the district court rejected the argument that where the government proceeded to enforce a judgment under the FDCPA, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 69(a)(1) incorporated a state law limitation prohibiting enforcement after ten years. <em>Id. </em>That court reasoned that, in light of the legislative history underlying the FDCPA and the language of the statute itself, binding the federal government to state law limitations on enforcement \u201cwould completely thwart the FDCPA\u2019s stated purpose of the creation of uniform federal procedures for the collection of debts to the federal government.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AdF\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b984-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
