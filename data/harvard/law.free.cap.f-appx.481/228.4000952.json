The district court sentenced him to serve 120 months in prison and a five-year term of supervised release. In this proceeding, Rush challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his requests for relief under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) and Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33. He has not briefed, and has thus abandoned, any challenge he may have had to the district court\u2019s denial of his motion under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 48.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">Rush now requests a certif\u00edcate of ap-pealability (COA) to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his Rule 60(b) motion as well as authorization to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal. He maintains that the Government acted improperly by failing to disclose certain items to him and by prosecuting him when venue and jurisdiction were lacking. Rush has not shown error in connection with the district court\u2019s conclusion that his alleged Rule 60(b) motion was best construed as an unauthorized successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion over which it lacked jurisdiction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Consequently, he has not shown that he should be allowed to pursue these claims.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">Our review of the record shows no error in connection with the district court\u2019s rejection of Rush\u2019s request for relief under Rule 33 based on newly discovered evidence. This motion was untimely.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-13\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court denying Rush\u2019s Rule 33 motion is AFFIRMED, and Rush\u2019s request for a COA to appeal the denial of his Rule 60(b) motion and motion to proceed IFP are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b255-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
