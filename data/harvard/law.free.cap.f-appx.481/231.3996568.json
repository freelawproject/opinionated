The seventy-one-month sentence was within the properly calculated guidelines range and is presumed reasonable. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). Torres-Duenas\u2019s contention that the presumption of reasonableness should not apply because the applicable guideline is not founded on empirical data is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009). His disagreement with the district court\u2019s weighing of the sentencing factors does not rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010). His contention that a federal court may not order a sentence to run consecutively to a yet-to-be-determined state sentence is foreclosed by <em>Setser v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1463, 1466-73, 182 L.Ed.2d 455 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-23\">The district court imposed a reasonable sentence. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Because there was no error, plain or otherwise, with regard to the sentence, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b257-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
