A stipulated factual basis established that Ingram attempted to shoot one man in the head, but the gun failed to fire. On a second attempt, Ingram missed the intended victim but shot another man. While in jail, Ingram urged his associates to persuade or coerce the shooting victim to deny that Ingram had shot him. At sentencing, Ingram attempted to deny the accuracy of the factual basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Ingram contends that the district court erred by increasing the sentence for obstruction of justice and by failing to reduce the sentence for acceptance of responsibility. Ingram\u2019s attempts to cause the victim to exonerate him amounted to obstruction with respect to the relevant conduct and sentencing for the offense of conviction. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 &amp; comment. (n.4(A)). Ingram has shown no \u201cextraordinary\u201d circumstances warranting a reduction for acceptance of responsibility in light of the increase for obstruction of justice. <em>See United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 211 (5th Cir.2008); \u00a7 3E1.1, comment. (n.4). Ingram\u2019s timely guilty plea alone did not entitle him to the reduction for acceptance of responsibility. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.3). Moreover, in contradiction of the factual basis, he attempted to avoid responsibility by telling the court at sentencing that he never did what the Government accused him of doing. The district court committed no error, plain or otherwise, by denying credit for acceptance of responsibility and increasing the sentence for obstruction of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">We need not resolve Ingram\u2019s assertion that the district court erred by denying a motion to continue sentencing, by allowing the Government\u2019s late objection to the PSR, and by applying the attempted-murder guideline. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52; <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 134-35, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). Any error did not affect Ingram\u2019s substantial rights and was therefore harmless because the court emphatically stated that, based on the stipulated facts, it would h\u00e1ve imposed the same sentence under \u00a7 3553(a) regardless of the Government\u2019s objection and arguments about the sentence. <em>See United States v. Richardson, </em>676 F.3d 491, 511 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b253-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
