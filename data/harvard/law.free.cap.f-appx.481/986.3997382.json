The district court construed the petition as raising only \u00a7 2254 claims arising out of Thomas\u2019s prison disciplinary procedures and denied it on the basis that Thomas did not have a liberty interest at stake. Thomas has not shown error in the district court\u2019s decision that his disciplinary punishment did not implicate a protected liberty interest. Instead, he argues that the district court failed to consider his claim that prison officials violated his right under the First Amendment by retaliating against him for his use of the prison grievance process. He also asks for leave to attach an exhibit to his brief filed in support of his COA request. We construe Thomas\u2019s request for a COA as both a request for a COA on any \u00a7 2254 claims and an appeal of the dismissal of his civil rights claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-20\">The title a prisoner gives to pro se pleadings is not controlling; rather, courts look at the content of the pleading. <em>United States v. Santora, </em>711 F.2d 41, 42 n. 1 (5th Cir.1983). Thomas\u2019s retaliation claim is potentially cognizable under 42 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>\u00a7 1983. The district court, however, did not address whether Thomas stated cognizable claims under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Serio v. Member of La. State Bd. of Pardons, </em>821 F.2d 1112, 1119 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">Thomas\u2019s request to attach an exhibit to his brief is GRANTED, and his request for a COA to appeal the dismissal of his \u00a7 2254 claims is DENIED. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Thomas\u2019s civil rights claims is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED for the district court to consider whether Thomas has alleged any civil rights claims cognizable under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1012-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
