After his appeal was dismissed pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), Marroquin brought a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion challenging, inter alia, the district court\u2019s conversion of cash to its equivalent in methamphetamine for sentencing purposes. The district court denied relief, a judge of this court denied a certif\u00edcate of appealability (COA), and this court denied Marroquin\u2019s subsequent request to raise this claim in a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. Marroquin returned to the district court seeking relief by way of a petition for writ of coram nobis and now appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">It is well established that the writ of coram nobis is available to a petitioner who is no longer in custody and who seeks to vacate a conviction because he is suffering civil disabilities. <em>United States v. Esogbue, </em>357 F.3d 532, 534 (5th Cir.2004); <em>United States v. Dyer, </em>136 F.3d 417, 422 (5th Cir.1998). Marroquin is still in custody; therefore, the district court correctly determined that a writ of coram nobis is unavailable to him. <em>See United States v. Hatten, </em>167 F.3d 884, 887 n. 6 (5th Cir.1999). Rather, the relief Marroquin seeks is available only under \u00a7 2255. <em>See Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877-78 (5th Cir.2000). Because Marroquin did not obtain authorization from this court to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court properly concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain his motion. <em>See United States v. Key, </em>205 F.3d 773, 774 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-12\">Marroquin also cites 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) as authority for the court to modify his sentence. We ordinarily do not consider issues raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Leggett v. Fleming, </em>380 F.3d 232, 236 &amp; n. 16 (5th Cir.2004). In any ease, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is inapplicable as it provides only for a reduction of a sentence based on retroactive amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2690-91, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). Marroquin\u2019s characterization of his petition as a \u201c\u00a7 2241 motion coram nobis\u201d \u2014 also asserted for the first time on appeal \u2014 is likewise unavailing. A \u00a7 2241 petition is distinct from a coram nobis petition, and Marroquin\u2019s sentencing claims do not provide a basis for relief under \u00a7 2241. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 900-04 (5th Cir.2001). In short, Mar-roquin\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit, and we dismiss it as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-15\">As noted, Marroquin\u2019s claims regarding the cash-to-drugs conversion were previously raised and rejected in an initial \u00a7 2255 proceeding, and this court denied Marroquin permission to raise his claims in a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. Marroquin then brought a meritless petition for writ of coram nobis seeking to raise the same claims and filed a frivolous appeal. We caution Marroquin that future repetitive, frivolous, or abusive filings will result in the imposition of sanctions, including dismissal, monetary sanctions, and restrictions on his ability to file pleadings in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>court and any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b262-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
