He contends that he was improperly convicted under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) instead of \u00a7 1326(b)(1) because his 2003 Florida conviction for aggravated battery was not an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). Reyes-Gutierrez argues that the error may have affected his sentence because it raised the statutory maximum from ten to twenty years, which may have influenced the district court\u2019s decision to sentence him to 46 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-13\">Because Reyes-Gutierrez did not raise this argument in the district court, our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 360-61 (5th Cir.2009). To show plain error, Reyes-Gutierrez must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 134-35, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-14\">Reyes-Gutierrez\u2019s 2003 Florida conviction for aggravated battery was not an aggravated felony under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F) because it carried a term of imprisonment of less than one year. <em>See Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 368-69; <em>see also Singh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>561 F.3d 1275, 1280 (11th Cir.2009) (holding that aggravated felony did not exist until alien\u2019s sentence to community control was revoked and term of imprisonment imposed). Thus, it was error to convict and sentence Reyes-Gutierrez under \u00a7 1326(b)(2). However, as Reyes-Gutierrez so concedes, the record does not indicate that the district court\u2019s error affected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>his substantial rights. Whether the Florida conviction was a felony or an aggravated felony did not affect the guideline range, and the district court, after a discussion at the sentencing hearing about the seriousness of his prior offense and his inability to abide by the conditions of his lenient sentence, sentenced him to the lowest sentence in the advisory guideline sentencing range after denying his request for a downward variance. There is no indication in the record that the statutory maximum played any role in the district court\u2019s decision. Therefore, Reyes-Gutierrez has failed to demonstrate reversible plain error. <em>See Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 369.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Reyes-Gutierrez argues, and the government agrees, that the judgment should be reformed to reflect that he was convicted and sentenced under \u00a7 1326(b)(1). Accordingly, we REFORM the district court\u2019s judgment to reflect conviction and sentencing under \u00a7 1326(b)(1), and AFFIRM the judgment as reformed. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b236-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
