On appeal, Osorio argues that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court: (1) considered only one 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factor\u2014 his guideline range; and (2) did not consider the fact that, in Florida, Osorio would have been subject to a maximum sentence of five years\u2019 imprisonment for his crime. He argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because a 180-month sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>tence would have been sufficient given the nature of the offense. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm Osorio\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">In June 2011, Osorio\u2019s wife discovered a digital camera hidden in the bathroom she shared with Osorio and her 14-year-old daughter (Osorio\u2019s stepdaughter). After viewing the video recordings and seeing video of her daughter completely naked, Osorio\u2019s wife contacted the police. The police discovered four video recordings, and in each, Osorio was seen setting up the camera in the bathroom so that it would record the area in front of the shower. In each video, Osorio\u2019s stepdaughter was completely naked. A few days later, the police found an additional memory card in Osorio\u2019s truck. This memory card contained five videos of Osorio setting up the camera in the bathroom and then his stepdaughter undressing. His stepdaughter was completely naked in the videos.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Osorio pleaded guilty to production of child pornography, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(a). His base offense level was 32, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.1. He received a two-level increase, under \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(1)(B), because his stepdaughter was between the ages of 12 and 16 years, and he received a two-level increase, under \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(5), due to his custodial relationship with the minor victim. Under \u00a7 4B1.5(b)(1), Osorio received a five-level enhancement because his offense was a covered sex crime, \u00a7\u00a7 4B1.1 and 4B1.5(a) did not apply, and he engaged in a pattern of activity involving prohibited sexual conduct. After receiving a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, under \u00a7 3E1.1(a), (b), Osorio\u2019s total offense level was 38. Based on an offense level of 38 and a criminal history category of I, Oso-rio\u2019s guideline range was 235 to 293 months\u2019 imprisonment. The statutory sentencing range was 180 to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment. Osorio did not object to the PSI, but he did submit a letter in which some of his friends indicated that he was a dedicated and hard-working individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court stated that it had reviewed the factual basis for the guilty plea, the plea agreement, the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), and the letter submitted on Oso-rio\u2019s behalf. Osorio stated, through counsel, that his offense was \u201cvery serious,\u201d but he noted that he had pleaded guilty and taken responsibility for his actions. He asked the court to impose the statutory minimum sentence of 180 months\u2019 imprisonment, which he argued, was sufficient under the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Nothing in Osorio\u2019s case warranted imposing a longer sentence than the statutory minimum sentence. Osorio noted that he received enhancements to his base offense level due to the victim\u2019s age and Osorio\u2019s custodial relationship with the minor victim. Nonetheless, were it not for \u00a7 4B 1.5, Osorio\u2019s total offense level would have been 33, and his guideline range would have been 135 to 168 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court stated that it had considered the parties\u2019 statements; the PSI, which contained the advisory guideline range; and the statutory factors. The court found that a low-end guideline range was sufficient to deter Osorio from future criminal conduct, and the court imposed a 235-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Under the abuse of discretion standard, we will affirm a sentence \u201cunless we find that the district court has made a clear error of judgment.\u201d <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number><em>Frazier, </em>387 F.3d 1244, 1259 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en banc). </em>\u201c[W]e will not second guess the weight (or lack thereof) that the [district court] accorded to a given factor ... as long as the sentence ultimately imposed is reasonable in light of <em>all </em>the circumstances presented.\u201d <em>United States v. Snipes, </em>611 F.3d 855, 872 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2962, 180 L.Ed.2d 245 (2011). The party challenging a sentence bears the burden of establishing that it is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">In reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence, we conduct a two-step review, first ensuring that the sentence was procedurally reasonable, meaning that the district court properly calculated the guideline range, treated the guideline range as advisory, considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, did not select a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, and \u201cadequately explained] the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. At the time of sentencing, the court must state its reasons for imposing a particular sentence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c). However, the court is not required \u201cto state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). Rather, it is within the district court\u2019s \u201cown professional judgment\u201d to determine the detail necessary in its statement of reasons. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). It may be clear from the circumstances of the case that the district court rests its \u201cdecision upon the [U.S. Sentencing] Commission\u2019s own reasoning that the Guidelines sentence is a proper sentence (in terms of \u00a7 3553(a) and other congressional mandates) in the typical case, and that the [court] has found that the case before [it] is typical.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 357, 127 S.Ct. at 2468. \u2018Where the defendant or prosecutor presents nonfrivolous reasons for imposing a different sentence, however, the judge will normally go further and explain why he has rejected those arguments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Where the circumstances allow for it, the court may provide a brief explanation as to why it has rejected a request for a variance. <em>Id. </em>Thus, the court\u2019s acknowledgment that it has considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors together with the parties\u2019 arguments is sufficient. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">Once we determine that a sentence is procedurally sound, we must examine whether the sentence was substantively reasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id. </em>at 788. The district court is required to \u201cimpose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set forth in\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). These purposes include the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, and protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2). The court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the defendant\u2019s history and characteristics, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7). The need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities \u201cis concerned with unwarranted disparities in sentences among federal defendants.\u201d <em>United States v. Docampo, </em>573 F.3d 1091, 1102 (11th Cir.2009). Thus, \u201cdisparate federal and state sentences\u201d are not a concern under \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b578-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>\u201cWe ordinarily expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008). The reasonableness of a sentence may also be indicated when the sentence imposed is well below the statutory maximum sentence. <em>See id. </em>The goal of sentencing \u201cis to lock in a sentence that is not too short and not too long, but just right to serve the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1197. We have criticized the use of the term \u201cparsimony principle\u201d because \u201cit tends to slant the discussion toward shorter sentences by emphasizing only\u201d the need to avoid sentences that are too long. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">Osorio\u2019s sentence is both procedurally and substantively reasonable. As to procedural reasonableness, the court properly calculated the guideline range, treated that range as advisory, stated that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and explained that a 235-month sentence was sufficient to deter Osorio from future criminal conduct. As the court explicitly stated that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and mentioned deterrence specifically, Osorio\u2019s argument that the court only considered the guideline range is without merit. Moreover, given the circumstances of the case, the court provided sufficient detail to explain its decision to impose a sentence within the guideline range. <em>See Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 356-57, 127 S.Ct. at 2468. The court stated that it had considered the parties\u2019 statements. In his request for a variance, Osorio acknowledged that his crime was very serious and that the guideline range was greater than the statutory minimum sentence due to the victim\u2019s age, Osorio\u2019s custodial role, and the \u00a7 4B 1.5 enhancement. Although Osorio argued that such factors did not warrant a 235-month sentence, it is clear that the court considered and rejected that argument and determined that the Commission correctly relied on those factors in establishing the guideline range. <em>See Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 356-57, 127 S.Ct. at 2468. Because the court acknowledged that it considered both the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the parties\u2019 arguments, its explanation of the sentence was sufficient. <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Further, Osorio\u2019s argument that the court should have considered Florida\u2019s maximum sentence for his conduct is incorrect. One of the goals of sentencing is to avoid unwarranted disparities in federal sentences. <em>See Docampo, </em>573 F.3d at 1102. This sentencing goal does not address \u201cdisparate federal and state sentences,\u201d and the court, therefore, did not need to consider what Osorio\u2019s sentence might have been in state court. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Osorio\u2019s sentence is also substantively reasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The court\u2019s sentence of 235 months was within the applicable guideline range, and we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324. Osorio\u2019s sentence was also well below the 360-month statutory maximum penalty, further indicating that it was a reasonable sentence. <em>See id. </em>The sentence, moreover, met the goals encompassed within \u00a7 3553(a). Osorio made nine video recordings of his 14-year-old stepdaughter undressing. Considering Osorio\u2019s disregard for the law, a sentence within the guideline range was necessary to promote respect for the law, provide just punishment, deter Osorio from further criminal activity, and protect the public. Due to the serious nature of his crime, a lower sentence was not warranted, and Osorio\u2019s parsimony principle argument must fail. <em>See Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1197. Based on the above, Osorio\u2019s ultimate sentence was reasonable, and we will not re-weigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Snipes, </em>611 F.3d at 872.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Osorio\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
