J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A5O\">Plaintiff, a business invitee of defendant, sought damages for personal injuries sustained on October 24, 1958, when he walked into and shattered a large panel of clear plate glass, one quarter of an inch in thickness, which formed part of one of the \"interior and exterior walls\u201d of a showroom of defendant Lubik Oldsmobile, Inc. (Lubik), in Bordentown. Plaintiff had entered defendant\u2019s showroom to make inquiry concerning the purchase of a new car. Plaintiff contended that the transparency of the glass panel with no \"railing\u201d or \u201cmarkings\u201d thereon, created a hazardous condition, its danger heightened by the fact that the same type of artificial fluorescent lighting used in the ceiling of the showroom was installed in the ceiling of a roof which extended over an outside, adjacent \u201cbay.\u201d Plaintiff, in the act of leaving the showroom, failed to note the existence of a glass door located in the southeast corner of the showroom (opening on the roofed \u201cbay\u201d and intended for entrance and exit to and from the showroom) and crashed into the adjacent glass wall, the presence of which he did not observe. The parties agree that the weather was clear on the day of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">In his amended complaint in the Superior Court, Law Division, as amplified in the pretrial order, plaintiff asserted a right to recover damages against State Motors Company (Motors), owner of the land on which the building was erected, and against Lubik, the tenant which had designed and constructed the building with Motors\u2019 approval. In support of his right of recovery he asserted (a) that his injuries were caused by reason of the fact that the \"showroom building and in particular the glass door and window panels\u201d were not erected in accordance with the \"accepted standard of construction\u201d and that the resultant structure, combined with \u201cimproper lighting,\u201d constituted a \"nuisance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>and hazard\u201d; and (b) that his injuries were caused by the fact that defendants \u201cso negligently constructed\u201d and \u201cmaintained\u201d the building in the particulars aforesaid that \u201cthe presence of window panel was indistinguishable\u201d and the \u201cwindow\u201d which he struck was \u201cindistinguishable\u201d from the door.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s suit resulted in a judgment in favor of both defendants entered on a jury verdict of no cause for action. No appeal is taken from the judgment in favor of Motors and plaintiff has now on appeal abandoned the count charging nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">In seeking to reverse the aforesaid judgment in favor of Lubik plaintiff asserts: (1) error in the court\u2019s action in striking certain testimony given by plaintiff, quoting a statement alleged to have been made by the president of Lubik and which, plaintiff contended, constituted a relevant admission \u201cagainst\u201d defendant\u2019s \u201cinterest\u201d; (2) error in the court\u2019s admission of an exhibit, received in evidence under the circumstances hereinafter set forth; and (3) numerous errors in the court\u2019s charge to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">The record before us reveals the following. The building occupied by defendant\u2019s showroom was described by plaintiff\u2019s architectural expert as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-8\">\u201cThe building consists of two principal units, the show room in the front along Route 130 and the service facilities to the rear. It consists of five bays in length, four of which are enclosed in glass on three sides, and the rear service portion is masonry. The rear portion has a flat roof on it and the showroom has a pitched roof running from high in front to meet the other roof in the rear. The fifth bay is access to the service station or service room in the rear, and that\u2019s on the south side. The showroom is all glass with a terrazzo floor, lighted with fluorescent lights in the ceiling, strips, built up roof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">Entrance and exit to and from the showroom, the architect explained, might be made through double glass doors at the front thereof on the west or highway side or by a glass door which opened on the aforesaid bay on the south side.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>Continuing Ms description of the showroom, plaintiff\u2019s witness testified that the southeast door was \u201cabout three feet wide and seven feet high\u201d and that the glass panel \u201cimmediately adjacent\u201d to and west of the door (which panel plaintiff struck) \u201cwas approximately four feet wide and eight feet * * * high,\u201d that its top varied by reason of the roof\u2019s \u201cslope\u201d from \u201cthe low side at the service facility * * * up to a high point at the highway side.\u201d The glass panel was bordered \u201con the inside with the frame of the door and on the right side a standard mutton, as used in most store front construction, the bottom resting on the adjacent terrazzo floor. The top was similar standard sash construction with the metal moldings, and was parallel with and against the ceiling construction.\u201d The next westerly glass panel on the same side was approximately eight feet wide and nine to ten feet high. The witness further said the door in the southeast corner of the showroom was a \u201cstock aluminum door full glazed in a standard store front type of frame running from the floor to the ceiling, the transom above the door.\u201d The door was \u201chinged on the right-hand side swinging in with a small pull on the left-hand side on the inside and a push bar on the exterior of the door.\u201d lie added that a small red sign was on the inside of the door with the word \u201cpull\u201d on it in white letters and a comparable sign on the door\u2019s exterior marked \u201cpush.\u201d Photographs of the exterior and interior of the building showing the scene of the accident and the glass wall and door on the south side of the building were received in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Testimony by plaintiff and by Lubik\u2019s president, the only witnesses in addition to plaintiff\u2019s architect whose testimony is contained in the appendices presented on this appeal, was in substantial agreement as to the circumstances surrounding the accident. The only substantial variance in their testimony was that plaintiff testified that on entering the showroom about 1:00 I?. m. on the day in question he had used the front or west doorway, while the president said plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>had entered through the aforesaid southeast door. They are in accord that just before the happening of the accident plaintiff examined cars on the showroom floor and then conferred with the president as they sat on a couch a few feet from the south glass well. As the conference ended the two men stood, concluded their conversation,- the president turned north toward his office, plaintiff turn\u00e9d south, and, according to his own testimony, \u201clooking straight ahead,\u201d took \u201cthree or four or five steps\u201d and \u201ccollided\u201d with the glass panel located, as above stated, \u201cimmediately next\u201d to the door. His only explanation was that he didn\u2019t \u201csee the glass.\u201d He suffered a severe injury. The first person to reach him was defendant\u2019s president. The court\u2019s ruling with reference to a remark which plaintiff alleges the president then made to him forms the basis of the first ground urged as aforesaid by plaintiff for reversal of the judgment against him. <em>We </em>initially consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">On direct examination, over objection made by defendant\u2019s counsel in the presence of the jury, plaintiff testified that \u201cless than a minute\u201d after the accident and as soon as the president reached him, the latter said: \u201cDon\u2019t feel badly about it, there was a woman almost busted right through this window a few days ago.\u201d Defendant\u2019s counsel rested his aforesaid objection on the ground that the alleged statement was \u201cnot part of the <em>res </em>gestae, and furthermore, anything that Mr. Lubik may say would not have any legal binding effect on the corporate defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">In overruling defendant\u2019s objection to the aforesaid testimony the trial court made the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-7\">\u201cI am going to permit it, and if I have to strike it I want to tell the jury the practicalities of striking it. You [the jurors] see, when the court tells you to strike it, you are supposed to remove it from your minds. It\u2019s almost an impossibility because it has made some imprint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-8\">I want to say this, if I strike it, you must rise to the occasion to literally remove' it from your recollection, so to speak, even though you recall it; it shall not take place, it\u2019s closed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>I am going to permit it. There is an exception on the record and I will entertain a motion to strike it if it resolves in the court\u2019s mind it\u2019s not res <em>gestae. * * </em>*\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Defendant\u2019s president later testified that he had no recollection of making \u201cany such statement\u201d as above set forth and specifically denied that there had been \u201cany such experience\u201d as related by plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">The record reveals that thereafter, when the testimony had been completed and both parties had rested, the jury was excused for the balance of that day and, out of the presence of the jury, defendant\u2019s counsel renewed his motion to strike the aforesaid evidence. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel, resisting the motion, asserted that the testimony had not been offered as part of the <em>\u201cres gestae\u201d </em>but as \u201can admission against interest,\u201d made by the defendant\u2019s president, binding on the corporation, and \u201cshowing knowledge on the part of the defendant that there was something of a danger.\u201d After argument the court granted defendant\u2019s motion, stating: \u201cI will strike that because he was not an agent for that purpose and I find it\u2019s not <em>res gestae.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Oil resumption of the trial the following day, the court made no reference whatever to the fact that the aforesaid testimony had been stricken by it in the jury\u2019s absence. Furthermore, despite the court\u2019s above quoted prior statement made to the jurors on the admission of the testimony, the court did not at any time thereafter advise the jury that the testimony had been excised from the case. As a consequence the jurors received the case for decision completely unaware of the court\u2019s action and the testimony in question, together with all of the other evidence, remained before the jury for assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">However, on appeal, plaintiff, completely ignoring the \u25a0foregoing record, seeks reversal of the judgment on the ground that the trial court\u2019s ineffectual action in striking the aforesaid testimony was prejudicially erroneous. He reasserts the competency of the alleged statement by defendant\u2019s president on the ground that it \u201crepresented an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>admission against interest.\u201d It is clear that plaintiff\u2019s contention that \u201creversible error\u201d was committed by the aforesaid inconclusive action of the court in striking the testimony in question is completely without merit. Manifestly plaintiff may not be heard to assert that the trial court erroneously withdrew testimony from the jury\u2019s consideration when the very record he presents for our review shows that no such action occurred. Under these circumstances we find it unnecessary to resolve or even discuss the respective contentions of counsel as to the propriety of the court\u2019s original admission of the testimony or the court\u2019s abortive action in striking it. No inconsistency with \u201csubstantial justice\u201d exists. No \u201csubstantial rights\u201d of the plaintiff were \u201cadversely affected.\u201d No prejudice is present. <em>R. R. </em>1:5-3(5), 2:5; <em>Miller v. Trans Oil </em>Co., 18 <em>N. J. </em>407, 413-414 (1955). Moreover, in view of our hereinafter expressed conviction as to the complete lack of merit in plaintiff\u2019s case, the retention or exclusion of the testimony in question is immaterial. Plaintiff\u2019s aforesaid challenge of the judgment is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">In advancing the remaining grounds for reversal of the aforesaid judgment, plaintiff, in each instance, asks that we afford him relief on the basis of the plain error rule. <em>B. B. </em>1:5-3(6), 2:5.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\"> Plaintiff contends that prejudicial error was committed by the trial court in admitting as an exhibit the aforesaid door which, at the time of the accident, was located on the south side of defendant\u2019s showroom. Plaintiff asserts that the exhibit \u201cvery likely was given undue weight by the jury and unduly excited antipathy to plaintiff\u2019s case.\u201d In passing, we express the view that the door clearly constituted relevant evidence. Plaintiff\u2019s alleged contributory negligence, as well as the claimed negligence of defendant, was at issue. The door was located a few feet from the place where plaintiff collided with the glass wall. If the door\u2019s construction were such as to make it readily visible, as defendant claims, its production as an exhibit was proper as the jury reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>might infer that plaintiff was negligent in not observing it. Of greater importance, however, is the fact that plaintiff consented io the admission of the door as an exhibit. The record discloses the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-5\">\u201cAir. Orlando: Your Honor please, at this time I should like the door be offered in evidence and marked as an exhibit on behalf of the defendant, Lubik Oldsmobile.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-6\">The Court: Any objection to its offer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-7\">Air. Magazzu: Your Honor, I have no objection to the admission, but I would prefer to reserve a decision on the question of retaining Lsicj at least until the end of the day.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">Furthermore, at the end of that particular day\u2019s session of the court, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-9\">\u201cThe Court: * * * What about the door, gentlemen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-10\">Air. Orlando: Would you have any objection to the taking of the door?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-12\">The Court: I think it ought to be here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-13\">Air. Alagazzu: I would prefer it be here also. I have to inconvenience you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-14\">The Court: All right, we will leave the door here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-15\">Under these circumstances, apart from the relevancy of the door as an exhibit, plaintiff may not invoke the plain error rule. Where an allegedly aggrieved party not only does not object at trial but by his own conduct endorses the action taken, he may not be heard on appeal to label that action as \"plain error.\u201d <em>Schult v. H. &amp; C. Realty Corp., </em>53 <em>N. J. Super. </em>128, 136 <em>(App. Div. </em>1958), certif. den. 29 <em>N. J. </em>279 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-16\">Wo next consider plaintiff\u2019s contention that the court\u2019s charge was erroneous \"in placing undue prominence upon the subject of contributory negligence.\u201d Our examination of the charge discloses that the contention is without merit. Moreover, it is to be noted that plaintiff\u2019s brief states that tiie \u201cportion of the Trial Court\u2019s charge [dealing with contributory negligence] represented a correct proposition of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>Plaintiff\u2019s final attack on the judgment is based on his contention that, although- the trial court charged certain requests as submitted by him, prejudicial error arose from the court\u2019s prefatory and supplemental comments to the jury with reference to the content of the requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s requests to charge, as submitted by him, dealt respectively with principles of law relating to: (a) the duty owing to an invitee by \u201cthe proprietor of a store\u201d; (b) \u201cstandards of construction or custom\u201d; (c) the policy justifying the standard to- be observed in the care and maintenance of the property to which the general public is invited; and (d) incorporating the following quotation from <em>Buccafusco v. Public Service Electric &amp; Gas Co., </em>49 <em>N. J. Super. </em>385, 394 <em>(App. Div.), </em>certif. den. 27 <em>N. J. </em>74 (1958):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-5\">\u201c \u2018The general custom of the industry, although evidential as to what is the reasonable standard\u2019 of the \u2018industry, does not conclusively establish the care <em>a pubtte utility </em>must exercise in performance of its operations. Adherence to an industry standard is not necessarily conclusive as to the issue of negligence and does not of itself absolve the defendant from liability.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Passing the fact that it is to be noted that plaintiff included reference, in his last quoted request, to a \u201cpublic utility\u201d with which we dealt in <em>Buccafusco, supra, </em>and which, of course, had no relationship to the structure here involved, we turn to the trial court\u2019s statements to the jury in connection with its charge encompassing plaintiff\u2019s aforesaid requests. Immediately preceding its deliverance of plaintiff\u2019s requests as part of its charge to the jury the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-7\">\u201cNow I will charge you what the plaintiff, Venuto, through his attorney has asked me to charge you as the general law, and I so charge you that is the general law, except that while this may be academic and may be properly equated matters of law, just because that\u2019s the law doesn\u2019t of itself give rise to any violation of the law, that you will have to associate the facts to the law as I read it to you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Immediately following its deliverance of plaintiff\u2019s requests to charge, the court made the following further statement to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-5\">\u201cNow, ladies and gentlemen, I charge you that generally this is the law generally. Now, insofar as this case, I am going to give you additional law which you will have to associate the facts and the proof. In other words, it may be the situation in this case, and you will be the judges of that, but in other words, there are various provinces of law and there are various rules of law, but they may be academic law. What we have in cases is not guessing and not hoping and not wishing, but what we have in cases is the sworn testimony that you heard.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Following protest by Motors\u2019 attorney that there should be no reference to a \u201cpublic utility\u201d in a charge dealing with the facts of the case at bar, the court made the following further statement to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-7\">\u201cThat was general law and it was <em>correct </em>law. Whether it fits this case or not I didn\u2019t say, you will have to determine it, because general laws can only be associated to facts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">The above quoted portions of the court\u2019s charge were patently erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">In <em>Hoffman v. Trenton Times, </em>125 <em>N. J. L. </em>450, 452 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1940), the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-10\">\u201cGenerally the office or purpose of instructions by the court is to inform the jury as to the law of the case applicable to the facts in such a manner that the jury may not be misled; in other words, to advise the jury as to what is the law applicable to a certain set of facts, if they find the existence of such facts from the evidence. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-11\">In <em>Gabriel v. Auf Der Heide-Aragona, Inc., </em>14 <em>N. J. Super. </em>558, 565 <em>(App. Div. </em>1951), this court noted that: \u201cThe jury should not be left by the court \u2018without \u201cguide or compass. * * *\u201d \u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-12\">In <em>Phillips v. Scrimente, </em>66 <em>N. J. Super. </em>157, 162 <em>(App. Div. </em>1961), we said: \u201cIt is the obligation of the court to instruct the jury clearly in the rules of law by which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>evidence is to be examined and upon which the jury is to determine the issues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">It is clear that the aforesaid criticized portions of the court\u2019s charge in the instant case could have no effect other than to confuse and mislead the jury. However, as above stated and hereinafter reiterated, we find no justification fox-reversing the judgment herein and directing a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"AME\">It is noted that the trial court reserved decision, <em>R. R. </em>4:51-2(a), on a motion by defendant for a judgment of dismissal made at the end of the entire case, <em>R. R. </em>4:51-1, based, as then stated by defendant\u2019s counsel, on (a) plaintiff\u2019s failure \u201cto prove any actionable negligence against the defendant\u201d and (b) the contention that plaintiff \u201cwas guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law.\u201d In view of the jury verdict in favor of defendant the court did not resolve-the motion. We think it might well have been granted when made. Compare, <em>Bowman v. Central R. Co. of N. J., </em>27 <em>N. J. Super. </em>370, 373 <em>(App. Div. </em>1953); <em>George Siegler Co. v. Norton, </em>8 <em>N. J. </em>374, 385 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Justice dictates that this case be resolved on the principle enunciated in <em>VenDerbeek v. Conlon, </em>41 <em>N. J. Super. </em>574, 580, 581 <em>(App. Div. </em>1956), in which we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-7\">\u201cAssuredly an error in instructions of law as against an unsuccessful plaintiff is not prejudicial where he manifestly fails basically to support his alleged cause of action by the facts. <em>Fannick v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>34 <em>N. J. Super. </em>556, 562 <em>(App. Div. </em>1955); <em>Osborne v. Tunis, </em>25 <em>N. J. L. </em>633, 649 <em>(B. &amp; A. </em>1856); <em>Wyckcoff v. Runyon, </em>33 <em>N. J. L. </em>107, 109 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1868). <em>Cf. Leport v. Todd, </em>32 <em>N. J. L. </em>124, 133 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1866).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-8\">In the existing state of the evidence in the present action we are not persuaded that the plaintiffs experienced any denial of substantial justice by reason of any of the errors claimed. <em>R. R. </em>1:5-3(5); 2:5.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">See also, <em>Bush v. N. J. and N. Y. Transit Co., Inc., </em>30 <em>N. J. </em>345, 352 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">In resolving this appeal we have analyzed the entire transcript of the testimony. (Portions thereof were omitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>in the appendices presented.) It is abundantly clear that the proofs failed to show any negligence on the part of defendant. Plaintiff\u2019s proofs, in support of his contention that defendant\u2019s negligence proximately caused his injuries, were (to adopt the expression used by Judge Jayne in <em>VanDerbeck, supra, </em>41 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>p. </em>578) \u201cat most microscopic.\u201d It is equally apparent that plaintiff\u2019s own negligence proximately caused the accident on which ho bases his claim for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Extended direct and cross-examination of plaintiff\u2019s expert, who examined defendant\u2019s showroom on November 30, 1959, developed that he considered the building to be \u201cin conformance with accepted standards of construction\u201d but, after attempting to testify as to what he might have advised had he been the architect, voiced the opinion that a \u201chazard\u201d existed. He said that he entertained this opinion because on the aforesaid glass panels \u201cthere is nothing here to warn people against the glass through which they can walk.\u201d He added that there were \u201cseveral ways this could be accomplished, has been in many instances, by the cutting or sandblasting a narrow stripe or stripes across the glass, by the use of a small rail * * * or by painted stripes * *</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">The expert admitted on cross-examination that he personally had no difficulty on his tour of inspection of the building of noting the presence of the glass door and handle thereon at a distance of five feet, and that the place where the \u201cpinkish terrazzo\u201d floor ended was where it was intersected by the perpendicular glass walls. He answered affirmatively the inquiry whether one \u201clooking at the floor\u201d would have \u201cno trouble\u201d discerning the line of demarcation between the wall and the floor surface. His precise viewpoint was expressed in the following interrogation on cross-examination :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-7\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Then as I understand, your testimony, Mr. BTidy, is that generally speaking the construction here is all right as far as frames, glass, excepting you think in some places you think the glass should have been not as wide? <em>A. </em>That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>Q. But that wasn\u2019t south at the door and the panel next to the door? A. No, the door is conventional and the panel next to it is about a foot wider than the door.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-4\">Q. And you find no fault with that? A. No except if I were to do it I might do it a little differently.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-5\">Q. But you are not critical of that if somebody else entertained a different view. Is that right? A. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">Q. What you are saying then had you been the architect on this job, particularly having the knowledge of the facts as you do in this case, you would have suggested that something be painted or something be done with the glass? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-7\">Q. So as to alert someone walking toward it of the presence of the glass? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-8\">Q. Does the bar on that door do that very thing? A. It does it as far as the door goes, but I think that\u2019s a small portion of the room as a whole and the door is probably less subject to breakage than any of the panels in the show room.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-9\">sfi <em>* </em>* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-10\">Q. So you had no difficulty in ascertaining where the door was, you had no difficulty in seeing the sign that was marked pull, you had no difficulty in seeing the pull, the door pull, and of course the crossbar on the door. Is that correct? A. That\u2019s right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-11\">The proofs reveal no reasonable basis upon which a verdict in favor of plaintiff would have been justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-12\">The judgment of the Law Division in favor of defendant is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
