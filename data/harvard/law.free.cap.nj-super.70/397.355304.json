J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"ALu\">Plaintiff appeals from a final judgment of the district court, entered on defendant\u2019s motion for dismissal at the close of plaintiff\u2019s case. <em>R. R. </em>4:42-2(b). Plaintiff claims damages from defendant Sehering Corporation (hereinafter Sehering) for personal injuries allegedly sustained as the result of his use of \u201cSebizon,\u201d a pharmaceutical product manufactured by defendant for the treatment of dandruff. Plaintiff asserts that defendant: (a) was negligent in failing adequately to warn the public of dangers inherent in the use of \u201cSebizon\u201d; (b) breached express warranties that \u201cSebizon\u201d was safe to use; and (c) breached an implied warranty of merchantability.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>We consider plaintiff\u2019s proofs. He testified that, entering a pharmacy in March 1959, he \u201casked the druggist for something for\u201d his (plaintiff\u2019s) \u201cdandruff.\u201d The druggist suggested a shampoo, but upon plaintiff\u2019s inquiry \u201cif he had something better,\u201d the druggist \u201cwent behind the counter and brought out\u201d a \u201cbottle\u201d of \u201cSebizon.\u201d In response to plaintiff\u2019s request \u201cfor instructions\u201d as to how the medication \u201cshould be used,\u201d the druggist read the directions printed on the bottle and informed plaintiff of the procedure there indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">The bottle, received in evidence, is made of plastic. The label appearing on the front thereof includes the following warning: \u201cCaution: Federal law prohibits dispensing without prescription.\u201d Printed directly upon the plastic on the reverse side of the bottle are four numbered instructions for use entitled \u201cDirections to the Patient.\u201d The fourth such direction is: \u201cEepeat applications as directed by physician.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Plaintiff testified that before he made the purchase he saw the above mentioned inscription on the bottle label and because thereof made specific inquiry of the druggist with reference to the \u201cprescription\u201d requirement, to which the druggist replied \u201cthat was all right\u201d and that plaintiff had \u201cnothing to worry about * * *.\u201d In response to interrogation by his own counsel on direct examination, plaintiff stated that in making the purchase he relied on the aforesaid statement by the druggist. On cross-examination of plaintiff the following appears in the record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-7\">\u201cQ. Despite the fact that the bottle said it should not be dispensed without a prescription, you went ahead and applied it to your hair, did you not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-8\">A. After the druggist\u2019s assurance to me it was all right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">Kaspirowitz testified that he applied the \u201cSebizon\u201d to his scalp on the evening of March 19, 1959. The following night his scalp started \u201cto itch\u201d and he noticed an eruption on his forehead which he described as \u201cpimples.\u201d He returned to the druggist the next morning, informed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>druggist of his condition, and asked him whether he should see a doctor; the druggist replied that \u201cthere was nothing to worry about\u201d and gave him a \u201ctube of cream\u201d which he used without beneficial result. That evening his \u201chead started to swell\u201d and a liquid, \u201clike pus,\u201d was emitted from the \u201cpimples.\u201d He again returned to the druggist who suggested that he should go to a hospital clinic for examination. He did so and thereafter was treated by a dermatologist who testified on his behalf at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">At the trial plaintiff testified that he suffered headaches, loss of hair, swelling of the face, head and eyes, and inflammation of the skin, all of which persisted for a substantial period and required extensive medical treatment. The dermatologist who treated plaintiff testified that he diagnosed plaintiff\u2019s condition as \u201ccontact dermatitis * * *, dermatitis venenata.\u201d He expressed the opinion that \u201cwith reasonable certainty\u201d there was a \u201cdirect relationship,\u201d a \u201ccausal connection,\u201d between plaintiff\u2019s use of the \u201cSebizon lotion\u201d and plaintiff\u2019s condition as observed by the doctor on examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">The record before us reveals that plaintiff originally instituted his action on June 10, 1959, in the Superior Court for damages against the druggist as well as against Schering. The pretrial order, dated March 8, 1960, reveals that plaintiff based his action against the druggist on several grounds, including a claim that the latter \u201cwas negligent in selling\u201d the product \u201cto plaintiff without a doctor\u2019s prescription,\u201d and that the druggist was also obliged to respond to plaintiff on the basis of an \u201cexpress or implied warranty that the product was fit for the purpose for which it was to be used.\u201d The record further reveals that plaintiff thereafter consummated a settlement of his claim against the defendant druggist and, by court order dated November 4, 1960, the suit against that defendant was, on motion of plaintiff\u2019s counsel, dismissed with prejudice and the action transferred to the district court, there to be prosecuted against defendant Schering only.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>As above stated, plaintiff initially claims that Schering was negligent in failing adequately to warn prospective purchasers that the use of \u201cSebizon\u201d might have deleterious effects. Neither at trial nor here does plaintiff contend that defendant, in labeling the bottle as aforesaid, failed to comply with the mandate of the Federal Food and Drugs Act, 21 <em>U. S. O. A. </em>\u00a7 353(b) (1), but he contends that compliance with that act does not satisfy the common-law duty owing by defendant to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">Enlarging upon his claim that defendant breached its common-law duty, plaintiff stresses defendant\u2019s employment of the word \u201cdispense\u201d instead of the word \u201cuse\u201d on the bottle label. He asserts that such choice of word constitutes an \u201cinadequate and insufficient warning\u201d to the public as to the possible danger in \u201cSebizon\u201d; that the word \u201cdispense\u201d fails to inform purchasers of the product of the possible risk inherent in its \u201cuse.\u201d Specifically, he asserts that the word \u201cdispense\u201d is simply a warning to the vendor (in this case the druggist) and fails adequately to alert the purchaser (in this case himself) to possible danger in the product\u2019s use. He contends that it is \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d that the product \u201cwill be sold on the open market to an ultimate consumer without a prescription\u201d despite the aforesaid label warning. From this premise he concludes that there is presented for resolution by the jury, and not by the court, the question whether defendant \u201cmet its duty to warn and caution\u201d users of the product.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Such contention ignores the factual situation revealed by the record before us. Apart from plaintiff\u2019s criticism of the adequacy of the word \u201cdispense\u201d on the label, plaintiff concedes that he realized that defendant had stated categorically, through the medium of the label, that a physician\u2019s prescription was required. He was aware that the manufacturer intended that the product was not to be sold without a prescription. Plaintiff\u2019s contention, that notice that a purchaser should not obtain a product from a dispensing druggist without a prescription is an insufficient warning that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>purchaser should not use the product without a prescription, is devoid of merit. Plaintiff\u2019s argument, in reality, is that he has a cause of action against the manufacturer stemming from his use of the medication made possible by the druggist\u2019s defiance of the aforesaid federal act. Plaintiff admits that he was alerted by the cautionary label, his concern was aroused, his resultant inquiry of the druggist followed, and the latter\u2019s response furnished the assurance on which plaintiff relied in purchasing and using the product.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">The instructions on the reverse side of the bottle, to which reference has heretofore been made, are not without significance in assessing the quality of plaintiff\u2019s case. Those instructions are captioned \u201cDirections to the patient.\u201d The use of the word patient connotes that the user is to act under the guidance of a physician, and the fourth direction, to which reference has also heretofore been made, <em>viz., </em>\u201cRepeat applications as directed by physician,\u201d conclusively shows the professional guidance required in the use of the product.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">All of these warnings plaintiff ignored and elected to rest on the druggist\u2019s voiced opinion. It is clear that he later concluded that the druggist\u2019s advice was negligently given and sued him for damages. Our examination of the record demonstrates conclusively that the trial judge not only was justified in dismissing the action on the ground of plaintiff\u2019s failure to prove common-law negligence against the defendant Schering, but makes equally clear to us that plaintiff\u2019s own negligence proximately caused the injuries for which he now seeks damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">We next consider plaintiff\u2019s claim to damages based on the asserted breach of alleged express and implied warranties. His contention that express warranties existed is based on statements contained in a printed leaflet (offered in evidence on plaintiff\u2019s case), describing the content of \u201cSebizon\u201d and directions for its use. The leaflet was included in defendant\u2019s package in which the bottle was originally sent to the druggist. The druggist removed the bottle from the package while showing it to plaintiff and failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>to reinsert the bottle in the package and deliver it, so enclosed, to plaintiff on the completion of the purchase. Plaintiff did not see the aforesaid leaflet at the time of purchase and, as heretofore stated, relied solely on the druggist\u2019s representation. His counsel, however, suggests that plaintiff is entitled to judgment against <em>defendant </em>on the basis of a breach of an express warranty on the authority of <em>Henningsen v. Bloomfield Motors, Inc., </em>32 <em>N. J. </em>358 (1960). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">It is uncontradicted in the case at bar that plaintiff placed his entire reliance on the aforesaid statement and representation of the druggist. In <em>Henningsen </em>the court recognized (at <em>p. </em>371) that \u201cany affirmation of fact relating to the goods is an express warranty if the natural tendency of the statement is to induce the buyer to make the purchase. <em>R. S. </em>46:30-18.\u201d No such inducement by the defendant manufacturer in the case at bar motivated plaintiff\u2019s purchase and use of \u201cSebizon.\u201d Moreover, in <em>Henningsen, </em>reliance on an express warranty, allegedly breached, was not the basis of the decision (32 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>p. </em>384). The court affirmed a judgment based on the verdict of a jury to which the cause had been \u201csubmitted * * * for determination solely on the issues of implied warranty of merchantability.\u201d (32 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>p. </em>365.) The cited case affords plaintiff no support whatever for his alternative suggestion that he is entitled to a verdict against defendant on the theory of a breach of an express warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s final contention, as above noted, is that a jury question was presented regarding defendant\u2019s alleged breach of an implied warranty of merchantability. Again reliance is placed on <em>Henningsen, supra, </em>once more without justification. The facts in the instant case bear not the slightest resemblance to those on which the <em>Henningsen </em>opinion was based. Here we have no evidence of the product\u2019s promotion through advertising to the public, a factor which casts doubt on the very existence of an implied warranty of merchantability running from the defendant to the plaintiff. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>(Henningsen, supra, 32 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>pp. </em>379, 384.) Moreover, in the instant case we are not dealing with a <em>defective </em>product on the sale of which a claim of breach of an implied warranty of merchantability must necessarily rest.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
