A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Avu\">Plaintiff, David R. Smith, an honorably discharged veteran of the First World War was appointed tax assessor of the City of Hackensack on October 8, 1959, by resolution of the city council which also provided that he was to serve at the pleasure of - the council. The City of Hackensack is a municipality operating under the municipal manager form of government. Its governing body <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>is a city council. At the time of Smith\u2019s appointment there was an ordinance in effect adopted on October 16, 1933, which established, <em>inter alia, </em>the office of city assessor but did not set forth the nature and scope of his duties or the amount of compensation to be paid. <em>Cf. Wagner v. Lodi, </em>56 <em>N. J. Super. </em>204 <em>(App. Div. </em>1959) certif. denied 30 <em>N. J. </em>599 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">On January 19, 1960 the City Council of Hackensack adopted an ordinance establishing the office of tax assessor, outlining the duties thereof and fixing the compensation therefor. Said ordinance also purported to fix a four-year term for said office \u201cas provided by <em>B. S. </em>40:46-6.2.\u201d Thereafter the city council by resolution, adopted February 2, 1960, appointed Smith as tax assessor of the City of Hackensack \u201cfor the term prescribed by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">On June 21, 1960 the city council repealed the ordinance adopted on January 19, 1960, and on August 16, 1960 the. council adopted a resolution discharging Smith as tax assessor and naming the defendant Harold McKenzie as acting tax assessor. McKenzie served in that capacity until October-24, 1960, when Ealph T. Meloro was appointed tax assessor by resolution of the city council.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">As a result of the foregoing, three actions were commenced and were consolidated for trial. Basically, these actions, raise two issues. One\u2014does the tax assessor of a municipality operating under the municipal manager form of government, <em>B. S. </em>40 \u00a1Y 9\u20141 <em>et seq., </em>serve at the pleasure of the council in accordance with <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:81-11 (a section of the Municipal Manager Form of Government Act),, or can he be given a four-year term of office in accordance-with the provisions of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40 :46-6.2 (an act relating to municipalities generally) ? Two\u2014does the Veterans'\" Tenure Act, <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>38 :16-1 <em>et seq., </em>apply to the tax assessor of a municipality operating under the municipal manager form of government?</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">For convenience the statutory provisions herein considered are reproduced as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b230-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>\n<em>Municipal Manager Form of Government Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Afr\"><em>N.

J. S. A. </em>40:81-11 hnd that the provisions of <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>40:46-6.2 did not govern, so that such assessor could not be given a 4-year term of office. The trial court also held that plaintiff as such tax assessor was not protected by the provisions of the Veterans\u2019 Tenure Act, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>38:16\u20141. Smith\u2019s dismissal was therefore upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">We are in accord with the ruling that the office of tax assessor herein is governed by <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40 :81\u201411 and that he holds office during the pleasure of the council. Smith\u2019s contention that <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:46\u20146.2 and <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:46\u20146.3, being later enactments, prevail over the tax assessor provisions of <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>40 :81-11 is not correct. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:81-11 was amended in 1942, in 1953 and again in 1957, so that it is the later expression of legislative purpose. On each occasion the Legislature has seen fit to retain the provision that assessors (in municipalities operating under the municipal manager form of government) shall hold office during the pleasure of the council. <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>40 :80\u201412 was also amended in 1953 and it retains the provision that \u201cno law * * * inconsistent with the provisions\u201d of the municipal manager form of government act \u201cshall apply\u201d to municipalities operating under said act. Thus any suggestion that <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>40 :46-6.2 controls is untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">We also agree with the ruling that the Veterans\u2019 Tenure Act <em>N. J. S. A. </em>38:16-1 does not apply to Smith\u2019s appointment as tax assessor of the City of Hackensack.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>It is well settled that the general terms of the Veterans\u2019 Tenure Act, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>38:16-1, adopted in 1907 may not properly be applied to employments under later specific enactments which adequately evidence a legislative purpose of excluding them from its tenure protection. <em>Brennan v. Byrne, </em>31 <em>N. J. </em>333 (1960), and eases therein cited; <em>Gobac v. Davis, </em>62 <em>N. J. Super. </em>148, 160 <em>(Law Div. </em>1960). See Annotation, <em>\u201cRights of non-civil service public employees, with respect to discharge or dismissal, under state veterans\u2019 tenure statutes,\u201d 58 A. L. R. 2d </em>960.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Here we are dealing with the Municipal Manager Eorm of Government Law adopted in 1923. The section of this law with which we are concerned provides that the city council shall appoint a municipal manager, an assessor, an auditor, a treasurer, a clerk, and an attorney, and that such officers shall hold office during the pleasure of the council. <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>40:81-11. As has been noted, this section of the law was amended in 1942, 1953, and again in 1957. On each occasion the law has retained the provision that these officers shall hold office \u201cduring the pleasure of the council.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The officers whose appointments and terms of office are provided for by <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:81-11 are not subordinate employees. On the contrary, they are the key administrative personnel of the particular form of government. They have the direct responsibility of administering the policy established by the city council, the members of which are elected every four years. Plainly, the statute indicates that, except as therein provided, these sensitive administrative posts are to be subject to the control of the city council at all times. Thus we discern a legislative intent to exclude these offices from the general terms of the Veterans\u2019 Tenure Act. <em>Brennan v. Byrne, supra, </em>and cases therein cited; <em>Gobac v. Davis, supra. Cf. Talty v. Board of Education, </em>10 <em>N. J. </em>69 (1952); <em>Burke v. Kenny, </em>9 <em>N. J. Super. </em>160 <em>(App. Div. </em>1950). If this were not so, despite the provision that \u201call such officers appointed by the council shall hold office during the pleasure of the council,\u201d the council could not appoint a veteran to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>any of the enumerated offices without conferring tenure on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
