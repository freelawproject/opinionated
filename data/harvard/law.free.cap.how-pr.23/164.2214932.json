The verdict was silent as to the question of damages. The defendant had his costs taxed, and entered up a judgment in his favor for such costs ; directing the $40 deducted from the costs, and awarding execution for the balance. On motion, the judgment was set aside as irregular, <em>(ante p. </em>44,) and from the order setting it aside the defendant appealed to the general term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b168-11\">W.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAn\">Section 304, sub. 2 of the Code enacts that \u201c costs shall be allowed of course to the plaintiff upon a recovery\u201d (\u00a7 304) \u201c in an action to recover the possession of personal property,\u201d <em>(sub. </em>2 <em>of \u00a7 </em>304.)</p>\n<p id=\"b168-14\">So long as this provision continues in force, a defendant cannot have the costs of such an action when the plaintiff recovers therein. The plaintiff has recovered in this action, and the plaintiff is entitled to costs. But subdivision 4 of \u00a7 304 contains a provision which affects the question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>of the <em>amount </em>of costs recoverable, but not the <em>right </em>to costs. That provision is, that the plaintiff shall \u201c recover no more costs than damages,\u201d (when his damages are less than $50,) \u201c unless he also recovers property the value of which, with the damages, amounts to fifty dollars.\u201d The plaintiff recovered property of the value of $40, but the jury assessed no damages in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">The legislature undoubtedly intended to permit a plaintiff to sue for and recover the possession of personal property, even though its value, with the damages for its detention, might not amount to $50, and even in that case to recover as much costs as damages. And it may be stated as a rule, without an exception, that wherever a plaintiff recovers property unjustly detained, he is entitled, as a matter of course, and as a strict legal right, to recover at least nominal damages. But whether he recovers six cents damages and only six cents costs, or recovers no damages and collects no costs, is a matter of only twelve cents consequence so long as he cannot in any event be compelled to pay costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The order vacating the judgment is correct. But if the plaintiff desires a judgment of six cents damages and six cents costs, he must apply for leave to amend the verdict so as to give him six cents damages. <em>Beemus </em>agt. <em>Beekman </em>(3 <em>Wend., </em>667, <em>and </em>7 <em>Cow., </em>30,) is an authority that the court may amend the verdict, where the amendment made follows the finding as a necessary legal consequence of such finding. <em>(Burhans </em>agt. <em>Tibbits, </em>7 <em>How. Pr. R., </em>21.) The order appealed from declares \u201c that the motion to set aside the judgment entered in this action in favor of the defendants and against the plaintiff, * * be and the same is hereby granted, with seven dollars costs to be paid by defendants to plaintiff\u2019s attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">If the verdict is to be amended, it should be done at special term on a motion for the purpose. The order appealed from does not purport to touch that question, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>defendant, alone, appeals from it. On this appeal, all that can regularly be done is to affirm the order, with $10 costs.</p>\n<author id=\"b170-5\">Barbour, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AOv\">did not concur in this opinion, but was in favor of affirming the order on the ground that the verdict settled the plaintiff\u2019s right to nominal damages, and that the court, on this appeal, could amend the verdict accordingly, or might treat it as having been amended in form to correspond with its legal effect, and affirm the order..</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
