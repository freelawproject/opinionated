The suit in which the attachment issued was commenced to enforce defendants\u2019 liability as guarantors of the bonds and coupons of the Columbus, Piqua and Indiana Railroad Company, now insolvent. The defendants moved to set aside i he summons and attachment, on the ground that the parties are foreign corporations, and the cause of action did not arise in this state. The plaintiffs contended that the cause of action arose in this state, the bonds and coupons being payable at the office of the Ohio Life Insurance and Trust Company, in this city; that the defendants, by a general appearance, waive any irregularity of service, and that, irrespective of any state law, a corporation created <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>in another state was entitled to all the rights and remedies of any citizen of another state in our courts.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-5\">The following opinion, at special term, was delivered by Leonard, J. : There is such a diversity of authority upon the question, viz., where does the cause of action arise, where the contract is made out of the state, but is payable, or to be performed within it, that I find myself not at liberty to advance <em>mj </em>own views at special term, where a decision adverse to the plaintiffs may result in leaving them remediless. I feel particularly constrained by the case of <em>Burckle </em>agt. <em>Eckhart, </em>reported in 3d <em>Coms. R., </em>132. From the result to which I have arrived on this question, it is not necessary to consider the point raised in relation to the effect of the notice served with the order to show cause. I think, however, jurisdiction could not be claimed in consequence of the notice, if allowed the construction claimed for it by the plaintiffs, unless the cause of action arose in this state. The object of section 427 of the Code was not to confer a privilege upon foreign corporations, but creates a rule i f policy which is independent of any action of the corporation or parties. Defendants\u2019 motion must therefore be denied, with costs to abide the event of the suit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-6\">The defendant appealed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b185-7\">E.

The cause of action arose in this state; the coupons upon which this action is brought being all payable in this state, and the conditions precedent to their payment to be performed here, and the bonds to which they belong, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>the mortgage securing them being made to a party in this state, and the default in payment and breach of the contract having been made in New York.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-5\">This was so held, especially in the case first cited below, after a careful review of the law, and affirmed at the general term. <em>(Bank of Commerce in Boston </em>agt. <em>Rutland &amp; W.

The subsequent amendments (\u00a7\u00a7 134-5 <em>of Code) </em>modify \u00a7 427, so that a foreign corporation may be sued whenever it has property here. This was clearly the intention of the framers of the amendments, and the court intimated that they would take that view in a case where the papers disclosed property in this state belonging to a foreign corporation. <em>(Bank of Commerce in Boston </em>agt. <em>Rutland </em>&amp; <em>W.

A suit by a non-resident or a foreign corporation against a foreign corporation, can be commenced and prosecuted to judgment, when either the cause of action arose in this state, or when the corporation has property in this state subject to attachment. <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 427, 134, 135; <em>3d R.
