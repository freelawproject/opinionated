Soon after the money was passed both were arrested. After the arrival of the prisoners at the station-house, a boy came in with a roll of bills, which he said prisoner had thrown away. Cantor was convicted and sentenced to ten years and five months in the state prison.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-12\">The case came up on a writ of error, several exceptions upon matters of law having been taken on the trial by prisoner\u2019s counsel.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b247-13\">Henry L.

Although such declarations were admitted without objection on the part of the prisoner, his subsequent objection to the intro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>duction of the bills in evidence, and to proof that they were the bills said to have been picked up by the person who made the declaration, was proper and timely, and should have been sustained. These bills, in connection with proof that they were counterfeit, furnished the principal evidence of knowledge by the prisoner that the bill passed by him was counterfeit, and thus effected his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">For these reasons the conviction should be reversed and the case remanded to the court of general sessions for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
