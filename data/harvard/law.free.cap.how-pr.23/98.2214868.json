That the answer contained counter-claims, to which there was no reply, and therefore that the defendant was entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">2. That the pleadings in connection with the plaintiff\u2019s admission, as sworn to in his first verified complaint, showed that the demand prosecuted had been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">I. As to the alleged counter-claims. They are alleged to he contained in the 4th and 5th answers.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">(1.) The fourth answer in substance alleges that after the maturity of the note prosecuted, and while the plaintiff was the holder thereof, Bigham, one of the joint and several makers of said note, assigned all his estate to the plaintiff for the benefit of creditors, and preferred him as to all demands against said Bigham, including the note in question, and that plaintiff accepted and received said assignment <em>in full satisfaction and discharge of said note; </em>that the assigned estate was of greater value than the amount of plaintiff\u2019s demands against said Bigham, including said note ; that plaintiff disposed of a portion of said estate to <em>pay and satisfy </em>all said demands, including the note in question, and still retains in his hands and has converted to his use a sufficient part of said assigned estate to pay and satisfy same ; that defendant was a <em>surety </em>of said Big-ham on said note, which was known to plaintiff at the time of the assignment, and that said assignment was made and received with a view of discharging defendant from said note, and without defendant\u2019s knowledge, and in consideration thereof plaintiff agreed to <em>discharge </em>Bigham from said note.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-11\">The defendant claims that this answer presents a counterclaim entitling him to the following affirmative relief, viz :</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>1. To demand the <em>surrender </em>and <em>cancellation </em>of the note as <em>paid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">2. To demand from the plaintiff, as trustee, an <em>account </em>of the fund and an <em>appropriation </em>of it to the payment of the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">3. To demand a <em>specific performance </em>of the contract between Bigham and plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">4. To demand that upon payment of plaintiff\u2019s claim, defendant be <em>subrogated </em>to all the rights and securities of the plaintiff against Bigham.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">5. To demand that the plaintiff first resort to the fund in his hands for the payment of the note, and an <em>injunction </em>restraining the collection of the note of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">6. To demand that the assigned assets be <em>marshaled </em>so as to pay this debt and protect defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">Assuming for the present that this answer might enable defendant to claim these various remedies or modes of relief, it is also obvious that the answer substantially sets up the defence of <em>payment and satisfaction </em>of the note :</p>\n<p id=\"b105-11\">1. By accepting an assignment of property sufficient for that purpose, for the express object and upon the express understanding so to apply it.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-12\">2. By receiving a fund dedicated to such a purpose, disposing of a part expressly for that purpose, and converting to his own use a sufficient portion of the residue to effect that object.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-13\">3. By receiving the assignment thus made with the view of discharging defendant from the note, and without defendant\u2019s knowledge agreeing to discharge Bigham therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-14\">Here, then, in the view most favorable to defendant, was an answer susceptible of being construed to contain two defences\u2014one <em>o\u00ed payment, </em>the other requiring an <em>account; </em>the one requiring a reply, and the other not, in order to form an issue thereon. In which way was it to be construed ?</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>1. I still think, notwithstanding some judicial intimations to the contrary, that the old common law rule prevails in regard to matters of substance, to construe the pleading most strongly against the pleader, and hence that the plaintiff might well conclude that the answer was designed to set up only the defence of payment. <em>(Burrall </em>agt. <em>DeGroot, </em>5 <em>Duer, </em>379.)</p>\n<p id=\"A4U\">2. I think all the alleged counter-claims are liable to the objection that they are not <em>apparently </em>set up as such; that they are set up by way of <em>defence; </em>that they do not claim <em>affirmative relief; </em>and hence are not to be presumed to have desired it. I do not coincide in the view that in all cases <em>nothing </em>but a statement of facts is to be incorporated in a pleading. A <em>complaint </em>is often unintelligible without a statement of the relief asked ; and sometimes it is <em>equivocal </em>upon its statement of facts, whether it is in contract or in tort, and the fact is determined by the nature of the relief sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">So also an <em>answer </em>may be equally equivocal, or susceptible of a two-fold construction. It may be uncertain whether it intends to set up a simple <em>defence </em>or a <em>counter-claim, </em>that is, an affirmative cause of action; whether it merely aims to <em>defeat </em>the plaintiff\u2019s claim, or to obtain <em>affirmative </em>relief against the plaintiff. This must, I think, in general be determined by the fact whether it seeks this affirmative relief or not, upon the face of the answer in express terms. Take one of the illustrations presented- by the defendant\u2019s answer and argument. It is said upon such an answer, the defendant might claim to have the note as being paid, delivered up and cancelled. This is so with some qualification. But by parity of reasoning, <em>every </em>defence of <em>payment </em>to a note might be similarly construed, as equally entitling the defendant to such affirmative relief. But in the absence of any allegations in the answer that the plaintiff <em>sought </em>to use it in an illegal or inequitable way; in the absence of allegations that it had not reached maturity, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>that the party was <em>threatening </em>to dispose of it; in the absence of any expressed wish in the answer to have it <em>surrendered </em>and <em>cancelled, </em>or the plaintiff <em>enjoined </em>from <em>assigning </em>it; would not any court conclude that the defence of <em>payment </em>was all that the party intended to rely upon, and that a judgment to that effect would insure to him ample protection ? So also in an action of ejectment the defendant may interpose a legal or an equitable defence, and the equitable matter may either be set up simply for the purposes of a defence, or for the purpose of obtaining affirmative relief. This was at first doubted, <em>(Dewey </em>agt. <em>Hoag, </em>15 <em>Barb., </em>365,) but it is no longer an open question. <em>(Crary </em>agt. <em>Goodman, </em>2 <em>Kern., </em>266; <em>Dobson </em>agt. <em>Pearce, </em>2 <em>Kern., </em>156; <em>Philips </em>agt. <em>Gorham, </em>11 <em>N. Y. R., </em>275.) Now in such a case, how is the plaintiff to know whether the matter set up in the answer is intended merely to defeat the plaintiff\u2019s recovery, or to obtain affirmative relief? for example: a conveyance of the legal title founded upon the equitable right, unless if the latter is desired, a prayer or demand for such relief be incorporated in the answer. Inasmuch as a counter-claim is in effect a new cause of action by the defendant against the plaintiff, <em>(Mayor of New York </em>agt. <em>Parker Vein Steam Ship Co., </em>21 <em>How., </em>291; <em>McKenzie </em>agt. <em>Farrell, </em>4 <em>Bosw., </em>202; <em>Gleason </em>agt. <em>More, </em>2 <em>Duer, </em>642; <em>Xenia Branch Bank </em>agt. <em>Lee, </em>7 <em>Abb., </em>376,) it seems quite' as proper that it should define the nature of the relief sought, as that a complaint should name the judgment asked for. And the more so, as the answer in this case sets up the matter contained therein expressly by way of defence\u2014the words being \u201c for a further defence\u201d\u2014\u2022 and not apparently by way of counter-claim; no <em>cross-demand </em>being named as <em>such </em>in terms or in substance in any way, nor any affirmative relief sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Under these circumstances I cannot doubt that the pleader intended the matters thus interposed, to be set up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>merely as a defence, and that the judge at the circuit was right in giving that construction to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">(2.) The matters set up in the 5th answer are subject to similar criticism. That answer is in substance that the note arose out of the partnership transactions of Bigham and Rosekrans, and was given to the plaintiff, to his knowledge, for the benefit of the partnership; that afterwards Bigham assigned to the plaintiff all his interest in the partnership and the property and estate thereof, and in consideration thereof the plaintiff, then being the holder of said note, agreed with Bigham to pay Bigham\u2019s share of the partnership debts, and any balance due from him to the partnership, <em>and to cancel said note; </em>that said Bigham\u2019s share of the debts of the partnership, and also the balance owing by him to the partnership, were each greater than the amount of said note; that the plaintiff has received under said partnership, and holds, property of said partnership of greater value than the amount of said note, but has not paid any part of the partnership debts, and refuses to apply the partnership property to such payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">On this state of* facts the defendant claims that he is entitled to various kinds of equitable relief:</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">1. To an <em>account </em>of the partnership property, and the application of his interest in it against the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">2. To a judgment that the note is <em>merged </em>and should be <em>cancelled.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">3. To a <em>specific performance </em>of the plaintiff\u2019s agreement to cancel the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">4. To a decree declaring that the plaintiff is <em>subrogated </em>to Bigham\u2019s rights and answerable to his obligations, and carrying out the results of that doctrine in the decree itself.'</p>\n<p id=\"b108-11\">It must be conceded that this answer approaches nearer to the idea of a counter-claim, or cross-demand, because it contains various averments of facts, upon which a prayer for equitable relief might well be founded ; but the objection remains that no such relief is sought in express terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>or by necessary implication, and that the matters are set up only by way of defence\u2014the language of the answer being, \u201c and the defendant for a further <em>defence </em>avers,\u201d &amp;c., and are, upon a reasonable construction of the answer, susceptible of that interpretation. It is in substance an allegation that the plaintiff, in consideration of the assignment to him of Bigham\u2019s share of the partnership property, by which he received more than the amount of the note, agreed to pay Bigham\u2019s share of the partnership debts and to <em>cancel said note, </em>then held by him. This <em>agreement </em>to cancel, if made, as it appears to be, upon sufficient consideration, was as between the parties an actual cancellation or extinguishment of the note, and may be so treated. This is substantially the defence of <em>payment or satisfaction. </em>Moreover, the defendant in his argument claims that the effect of the averments in the answer is to place the plaintiff in the shoes of Bigham\u2014in the position substantially of a joint maker of the note with the defendant, and thereby to <em>merge </em>the note in the new relations of the parties\u2014to preclude an action upon it by the plaintiff, and to turn him over to his remedy, if any he has, under the partnership relations of the parties. This is in effect the defence of <em>merger </em>or <em>extinguishment, </em>and requires no reply to put it in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Susceptible as this answer is of this construction; finding in it no express allegations of counter-claim, or prayer for affirmative relief, but on the contrary an allegation that the matters are insisted on by way of <em>defence; </em>finding also in the Code (\u00a7 149) a distinction observed between a <em>defence </em>and a <em>counter-claim, </em>I feel bound to presume that the matters were intended by way of <em>defence only. </em>The language of the Code on this point is : \u201c The answer of the defendant must contain, 1. A denial, <em>&amp;o. 2. </em>A statement of any new matter constituting a defence <em>or </em>counter-claim.\u201d <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 149.) So also, \u201c the defendant may set forth by answer as many defences <em>and </em>counter-claims as he may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>have.\u201d (Code, \u00a7 150.) So also, \u201c the plaintiff may demur to one or more of such defences or counter-claims.\u201d (Code, \u00a7 153.)</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">II. It is further claimed that by the evidence in the case it was established that the principal of the note in suit, executed by both Bingham and Bosekrans, was paid by a subsequent note executed by the defendant alone to the same payees, on the 14th of January, 1852, for the same principal sum, which was indorsed by the payees and received by the plaintiff in payment. The proof relied on for this purpose was the introduction in evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s first amended complaint in this action, (not the one forming a part of the issue on the trial,) verified by the oath of the plaintiff, in which the plaintiff alleged that at about the maturity of the note in suit, of September 11, 1851, the defendant, in consideration thereof, and \u201c to provide for the payment of the principal of the same,\u201d executed and delivered to the plaintiff another note of a similar amount (of principal,) dated January 4, 1852, and payable at a future day, to the order of Bates &amp; Griffin, and by them, before maturity,' indorsed to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">I think this did not amount to a <em>payment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">1. The allegation is, that the note of 1852 was given to <em>provide </em>for the payment of the note of 1851; by which I understand the pleader to mean, not a <em>present </em>payment, but a provision for <em>future </em>payment, by the giving of the note, and to have the effect of an actual payment if paid at maturity. This future payment was not made, the allegation being that both notes are <em>unpaid. </em>Nor was the defendant prejudiced by the plaintiff retaining both notes, as the last note was surrendered by the plaintiff to the defendant at the trial\u2014the defendant receiving the same with the declaration that he did not thereby avoid or waive the defence of payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">2. Nor was it a payment in law or in legal effect. The taking of the note of the defendant alone was not in law a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>satisfaction of a joint and several note of the defendant <em>and </em>a third person; certainly not, unless expressly agreed to be taken in absolute payment. No benefit accrues to the plaintiff thereby, and no new consideration intervenes. The point is settled upon authority. (Cole agt. <em>Sackett, 1 Hill, </em>516; <em>Waydell </em>agt. <em>Luer, </em>5 <em>Hill, </em>448; <em>Elwood </em>agt. <em>Diefendorf, </em>5 <em>Barb., </em>398-408; <em>Van Eps </em>agt. <em>Dillaye, </em>6 <em>Barb., </em>244; <em>Hawley </em>agt. <em>Foote, </em>19 <em>Wend., </em>516; <em>Frisbie </em>agt. <em>Larned, </em>21 <em>Wend., </em>450-452.) Some of the cases go so far as to hold that such a note is not payment, <em>though expressly agreed </em>to be received as such. <em>(Cole </em>agt. <em>Sackett, </em>1 <em>Hill, </em>516; <em>Waydell </em>agt. <em>Luer, </em>5 <em>Hill, </em>448; <em>Elwood </em>agt. <em>Diefenendorf, </em>5 <em>Barb., </em>398-408.)</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">There was no error in the disposition of this cause at the circuit, and the judgment of that court must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
