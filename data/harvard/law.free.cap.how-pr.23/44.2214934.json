On the trial of the cause, the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff for the return of the property, assessing the value thereof at $40. No damages were found for the detention of the property. On the taxation, the clerk adjusted costs in favor of the defendants, on the ground that the verdict was for a less sum than $50, and that no damages had been awarded to the plaintiff for the detention thereof; thereupon the defendants entered up judgment against the plaintiff for costs, less $40, the value of the property as assessed by the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Alt\">This motion was to vacate the judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b48-9\">A.

The plaintiff is the prevailing party; the jury found a verdict for the return of the property to him, assessing its value at $40. This entitled the plaintiff to recover at least nominal damages; and section 304 (Code) gives to him the like amount of costs ; the plaintiff being entitled to costs of any amount, the defendant cannot recover costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-12\">The motion should be granted, with $7 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
