Section 135 of the Code provides that the order shall direct the publication for such length of time as may be deemed reasonable, fixing the shortest period at six weeks, and directing that the publication shall be made not less frequently than once a week. Section 137 declares that the service shall be deemed complete at the expiration of the time prescribed for the order of publication. That time in this case was six weeks \u2022 .and although publication was made six times in as many successive weeks in a period less than six weeks or forty-two days, the service of the summons did not become complete until that time had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">The defendant\u2019s time to answer did not begin to run until the service was complete; he then had twenty days; and as the judgment was entered before they expired, it was irregular.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The motion to vacate the judgment was denied by the city judge only because he supposed that he had no, right to entertain it, and that an appeal was necessary, as the judgment had been entered after application to the court; but as such application was <em>ex </em>parte, and the judgment irregular, no appeal was necessary or proper, .and he should have set aside the judgment on account of the irregularity.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">\u2022 The order appealed from must be reversed, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
