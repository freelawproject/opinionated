This bill book, under the name of bills payable, contained a memorandum of all the notes indorsed by the company, whether for accommodation or otherwise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-7\">The evidence here closed, and the judge, after hearing the counsel for the respective parties, rendered the following decision:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-8\">This action was brought upon a promissory note for twelve, hundred and fifty dollars, at seventy-five days, dated March 19, 1855, made by James B. Townsend, to the order of the New York and Saugerties White Lead Company, and endorsed by said company by James McCullough, the president, and also by the Spring Valley Shot and Lead Company, by its president, and discounted by the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-9\">It appears in evidence that the note was discounted by the plaintiffs, upon the application of the defendants, The Spring Valley Shot and Lead Company, and the proceeds passed to the credit of said company in the books of the bank, and drawn out upon its checks in the usual course of business. So far as the maker and the Saugerties White Lead Company are concerned, the note was, primarily, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>least, a mere accommodation note; and so far as the White Lead Company is concerned, its president had no right to make an accommodation indorsement, and such indorsement, in the hands of any person having knowledge of the facts, would not be binding. But upon the face of this note, it was in due form like ordinary commercial paper; there was nothing upon the face of the paper and otherwise to give notice to the plaintiffs that it was not an ordinary business note taken by the lead company of Townsend, and transferred to the shot company in the ordinary course of business, for value. I think the plaintiff is to be regarded as a <em>Iona fide </em>holder of the paper, and entitled as such to recover upon it, within the reasons of cases cited \u2022by Judge Selden, in <em>Farmers\u2019 </em>&amp; <em>Mechanics\u2019 Bank of Kent County </em>agt. <em>Butchers\u2019 &amp; Drovers\u2019 Bank (on pages </em>129 <em>and </em>135 <em>of the 16th N. Y. R., </em>2 <em>Smith;) and The Bank of Genesee </em>agt. <em>The Patchin Bank, </em>(3 <em>Kern., </em>315.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-5\">I think the plaintiff is entitled to recover the amount of the note, with interest and protest, and direct judgment accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-6\">The defendants, the New York and Saugerties White Lead Company, except to the finding of the court, in deciding : <em>First, </em>that the plaintiff is to be regarded as a <em>bona fide </em>holder of the note in suit; <em>second, </em>that the plaintiff is entitled to judgment; <em>third, </em>in not deciding that the defendants are entitled to judgment; and that the complaint should be dismissed, as to them, with costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-7\">Defendants appealed to the general term.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b82-8\">\n<em>New York General Term,</em>\n</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Axz\"><em>November, </em>1860.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b82-9\">Sutherland, Bonney and Hogeboom, <em>Justices.</em></p>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b82-10\">The plaintiffs sued to recover the amount of a promissory \u25a0 note drawn by James B. Townsend, and dated the 19th day of March, 1855, for the sum of twelve hundred and fifty dollars, payable seventy-five days after date,' to the order of The New\u2019 York and Saugerties White Lead Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>pany, and indorsed by them and the other defendant, and discounted by the plaintiffs in good faith before the maturity, and for value. The note was discounted at the instance of the last named defendant, who received the proceeds in whole or in part\u2014the evidence being conflicting, whether the White Lead Company did or did not receive a part of the proceeds. The cause was tried before Mr. Justice Smith, without a jury, in October, 1858, and he directed judgment for the plaintiffs. The White Lead Company appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b83-5\">Charles E. Miller, <em>for plaintiffs.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b83-6\">R. H. Bowne, <em>for defendants.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b83-7\">Hogeboom, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"A6V\">I think this judgment must be affirmed, for the reasons stated in the opinion of the learned justice who tried this cause. The authority of McCullough to sign and indorse notes for the White Lead Company is sufficiently established. Townsend was an accommodation maker of the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">The evidence leaves it doubtful whether the New York and Saugerties White Lead Company -was an accommodation or business indorser of the note; and the learned judge has not explicitly found that fact. But assuming that it was only an accommodation indorser, it appears that the note was a negotiable instrument, in the ordinary form of commercial paper, indorsed by corporations having authority in their legitimate business to indorse commercial paper, discounted by the plaintiffs, in good faith, and for value, before maturity, with no facts before them to induce a suspicion that the paper was not business paper, and having no knowledge that it was otherwise. The circumstances were such as to lead to the presumption that it was business paper, and the sole question is, whether the plaintiffs were bound explicitly to inquire and ascertain whether the indorsement of the White Lead Company was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>a mere accommodation indorsement, in which case they, as a corporation, would have no right to make the same ? I think, under the circumstances of this case, the plaintiffs were not required to institute such an investigation, and absolutely to ascertain .the fact; and therefore, that the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">The cases bearing on this point are : <em>The Farmers\u2019 and Mechanics\u2019 Bank of Kent </em>agt. <em>The Butchers\u2019 and Drovers\u2019 Bank, </em>(16 N. <em>Y.
