L. 1861, \u00a7 5, that none of the money appropriated for specified objects shall be applied to any other.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">The comptroller has no money which he can apply to the demand of the relators, without violating this law.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">The money should be appropriated and raised by law, for the payment of the relators, if the legislature \u201e deem it proper to require the comptroller to pay them. When the law has required the people to raise the money, and the tax has been levied, then the comptroller will owe to the relators a direct duty to draw his warrant and pay them.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">I think there must be further legislation before the peremptory writ of mandamus can be issued, or the relators must proceed by action to obtain and enforce the collectio\u00fa of their demand by judgment at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">The motion is denied, with $10 costs of opposing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
