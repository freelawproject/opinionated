This would be a good consideration for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>draft, if there was no fraud or misrepresentation used in obtaining it. Such is the defence set up by the answer. On the trial the judge charged \u201c that giving the check was no payment.\u201d To this the defendants excepted. There was no error in such charge. It has never been held that the check of the party bound to pay is a payment, if the check is not paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">It does not appear whether the question of fraud was submitted to the jury. W\u00e9 are to presume it was, if no request was made to submit that question to the jury by the defendants. They should have asked to have that question passed upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
