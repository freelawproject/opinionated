The first, an order of December 23, 1974, provided for his visitation (with limitations) with the three minor children of the dissolved marriage.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The second, an order of April 8, 1975, among other things, (a) awarded a counsel fee of $10,000 to the attorneys for plaintiff mother, $3,000 of which is required to be paid by defendant, and (b) denied defendant\u2019s attorneys\u2019 application for an award of a counsel fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">At oral argument counsel informed us of a further order made by the trial judge on August 6, 1975. The terms of this later order, to which the parties apparently agreed, include: permission for the mother to establish a permanent abode outside of New Jersey and to have the children reside there with her,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and amendment of the visitation schedule in the December 23, 1974 order to provide the father \u201cwith one week\u2019s visitation during the Christmas school holidays, one week\u2019s visitation during the Easter school holi-daj^s, and four weeks\u2019 visitation during the summer school vacation.\u201d The term of the August 6, 1975 order to which the parties did not agree (item numbered \u201c(4)\u201d thereof), is that which in effect continued in force the provisions of the December 23, 1974 order relating \u201cto the mode and manner in which defendant may exercise his right to visitation with\u201d the children.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This is the only aspect of the visitation order which is in issue on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>We affirm the order for visitation under review (as modified by the order of August 6, 1975) substantially for the reasons expressed by Judge Lucehi in his opinion of July 26, 1974 reported at 129 <em>N. J. Super. </em>486 (Ch. Div. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">Additionally, the order for counsel fee under review (as modified by the order of August 6, 1975 in regard to the provision relating to the mortgage on the marital home) is affirmed substantially for the reasons expressed by Judge Lucehi at the hearing of March 10, 1975. Beyond this we note that, in light of the record and counsel\u2019s certification as to services, \u201cthe amount of the allowance may be considered to be within the broad limits of the trial court\u2019s discretionary authority.\u201d <em>Schlemm v.
