Here proof of the speed limit was essential.\u201d <em>State v. Ring, </em>85 <em>N. J. Super. </em>341, 343 (App. Div. 1964), <em>certif. </em>den. 44 <em>N. J. </em>407 (1965), <em>cert. </em>den. 382 <em>U. </em>S. 812, 86 <em>S. Ct. </em>24, 15 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 60 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">No evidence of the' applicable speed limit was offered. The State\u2019s obligation was not met by the mere reference by the court to the fact that the charge was \u201cdoing forty-four in a twenty-five mile zone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">The conviction must therefore be reversed. However, the reversal does not call for a dismissal of the charges but rather for a remand for a new trial if the State desires one. <em>State v. Ring, supra, </em>85 <em>N. J. Super. </em>at 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">Since the new trial will be a:s to all issues, there is no need to resolve defendant\u2019s further \u2022 contention that the proofs offered did not sufficiently establish the accuracy of the radar set-up and the radar reading. .</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">If a retrial is had, it shall take place in the County Court, not in the municipal court. The statement in <em>State v. Ring, supra </em>at 343, in reliance on <em>State v. Morton, </em>74 <em>N. J. Super. </em>528 (App. Div. 1962), that a retrial in the circumstances here presented should be in 'the municipal court, overlooked the opinion of the Supreme Court in the <em>Morton </em>case, reported at 39 <em>N. J. </em>512 (1963). Although it affirmed the reversal of defendant\u2019s drunken driving conviction and the grant . of *a new trial, the Supreme Court disagreed with the Appellate Division\u2019s direction that the new trial should be in the municipal court, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-9\">In our view there is no need to remand the case to the Municipal Court. Since the matter must be retried <em>de novo </em>with \u201clive\u201d witnesses as distinguished from . \u00e1 trial on a stenographic record, disposition will be expedited by retrial in the County Court, [at 515]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
