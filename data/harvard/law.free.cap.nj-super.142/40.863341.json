One of the men had an arm around the manager\u2019s neck, and a revolver in his other hand was \u201cin the [manager\u2019s] back.\u201d The second man, defendant Jones, also holding a revolver, was to the manager\u2019s right.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-11\">The chief, drawing his own revolver, was able to effectuate the arrest of both men. A third armed robber, who was in the process of taking money from the cashiers, escaped.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-12\">The incident resulted in the return of indictments charging the two men with a variety of offenses. Defendant was brought to trial before a jury on counts charging (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>assault with intent to commit robbery <em>(N. J. S. A. 2A: </em>90-2), (2) while armed <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>2A:151-5), (3) unlawfully carrying a revolver after having been previously convicted,of robbery <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>2A:151-8), (4) attempt\u00e9d robbery <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>2A:141-1 and 2A:85-5), (5) while armed <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>2A:151-5), (6) carrying a firearm without a permit <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>2A:151-41) and (7) receiving stolen goods, the revolver in his possession <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>2A:139-1).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">The jury found defendant guilty on all counts except the count charging him with receiving stolen goods, as to which he was found not guilty. The trial judge thereafter ruled that the \u2022 counts charging attempted robbery while armed and the count charging possession of a revolver without a permit were lesser offenses included within the offenses of assault with intent to commit robbery while armed and so merged into the latter offenses. It thereupon molded the verdict of the jury \u201cto a judgment of conviction\u201d on the three counts charging (1) assault'with intent to commit robbery (2) while armed and (3) possession of a firearm after having previously been convicted of robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">The several other counts of the indictments returned against defendant by reason of the June 18, 1972 incident were dismissed by the judge on the prosecutor\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">On May 14, 1973 defendant was sentenced to- State Prison for consecutive terms of (1) 11 to 12 years for the assault with intent to commit robbery, (2) 9 to 10 years for being armed while committing that assault, and (3) 2 to 3 years for his possession of a revolver after having previously been convicted of robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\"> Defendant appeals, arguing two points for reversal. His first contention \u2014 as to which he asks us to invoke the plain error rule since the point was not raised in the trial court \u2014 is that the judge erred in not severing the charge \u00f3f possession of a revolver after having previously been convicted of robbery. He argues that proof of the prior conviction, \u2022 in a case where the defendant did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>take the stand, \u201cwould taint the jury\u2019s objectivity with regard to the * * * other charges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">We find no basis for reversal in defendant\u2019s argument. The joinder of the several counts for trial was authorized. <em>B. </em>3 :7-6. A defendant may, of course, move for a severance on a showing of prejudice from the joinder. <em>B. </em>3:15-2(b). However, where, as here, there has been a \u201ctrial of several charges without objection, it takes a strong showing of probable prejudice in fact to warrant a finding of \u2018plain error.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Baker, </em>49 <em>N. J. </em>103, 105 (1967), <em>cert. </em>den. 389 <em>U. S. </em>868, 88 <em>S. Ct. </em>141, 19 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 144 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Defendant has failed to make a \u201cshowing of probable prejudice in fact.\u201d Indeed \u2014 even disregarding the overwhelming proof of defendant\u2019s guilt \u2014\u2022 we are satisfied that any possibility of prejudice was eliminated by the instructions given by the judge to the jury, both when the evidence of the prior conviction was offered and in his charge at the end of the case, as to the limited purpose for which the evidence of the prior conviction could be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Defendant\u2019s second contention is that the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive and constituted an. abuse of discretion. However, we conclude from our review of the record and defendant\u2019s presentence report that in view of the circumstances of the offense and defendant\u2019s imposing prior criminal record, no abuse of discretion has been shown. <em>Cf. State v. Tyson, </em>43 <em>N. J. </em>411, 417 (1964), <em>cert. </em>den. 380 <em>U. </em>S. 987, 85 <em>S. Ct. </em>1359, 14 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 279 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
