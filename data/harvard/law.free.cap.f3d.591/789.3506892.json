We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-27\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-28\">Anderson pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five or more grams of crack cocaine, in violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 841(b)(l)(B)(iii), and 846. As a sentencing default, district courts use \u00a7 2D1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines to set the base offense level for drug criminals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The greater the quantity of drugs, the higher the base level<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u2014 and, in turn, the longer the term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">Career offenders, though, may instead fall under \u00a7 4B1.1 of the Guidelines, which can impose a lengthier sentence on recidivists.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Specifically, if the base level calculated under the career offender provision exceeds the base level calculated under the general drug crimes provision, then the career offender base level prevails. The base level calculation under the career offender provision does not depend on the amount of drugs involved in the offense. Rather, the base offense level is moored to the statutory maximum penalty of the underlying crime.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">In 2003, the district court sentenced Anderson as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1 to 147 months in prison. The court had calculated Anderson\u2019s base level under the general drug guideline \u00a7 2D1.1 as 28 \u2014 and his base level under the career offender guideline \u00a7 4B1.1 as 34. Because the career offender base level exceeded the general base level, the career offender sentencing range governed.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-11\">Five years later, Anderson filed a motion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) seeking to reduce his sentence \u2014 on the idea that a retroactive sentencing amendment applied to his conviction involving crack cocaine. Specifically, the United States Sentencing Commission \u2014 though Amendment 706\u2014 reduced the applicable base levels under \u00a7 2D1.1 for crack cocaine offenses.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Anderson argued that his base level under \u00a7 2D1.1 would have been 26 \u2014 not 28. He conceded, however, that his base level under \u00a7 4B1.1 would not change. The district court summarily denied Anderson\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-13\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-14\">Anderson urges that the district court abused its discretion by not reducing his sentence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He points to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, which states: \u201cIn a case in which a defendant is serving a term of imprisonment, and the guideline range applicable to that defendant has subsequently been lowered as a result of an amendment to the Guidelines Manual ... the court may reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment as provided by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because Amendment 706 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>lowered the guideline range applicable to crack cocaine offenders \u2014 and because Anderson pleaded guilty to a crack cocaine violation \u2014 he contends that he deserves a reduced sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">The district court, however, had not during sentencing applied the crack cocaine guideline range to Anderson. Instead, the court had calculated Anderson\u2019s guideline range pursuant to his career offender status. The sentence did not derive from the amount of crack cocaine involved in his offense. The district court, consequently, did not abuse its discretion in denying Anderson\u2019s motion for resentencing, because he \u201cwas not sentenced based on a sentencing range that was subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The crack cocaine guideline amendments do not apply to prisoners sentenced as career offenders. We note that \u2014 although this court has never published a binding decision on the issue \u2014 this year we have uniformly rejected arguments identical to Anderson\u2019s in at least 10 persuasive unpublished decisions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The claim has no merit in either law or logic.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">Anderson quizzically asserts \u2014 in the alternative \u2014 that the district court erred by treating U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 as mandatory. Section 1B1.10 states that \u201cthe court shall not reduce the ... term of imprisonment ... to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> He claims that this provision violates <em>Booker, </em>which held the sentencing guidelines to be advisory.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b817-14\">It is unclear, as a threshold matter, that the district court relied on \u00a7 1B1.10, because no \u201camended guideline range\u201d applies to Anderson. Regardless, Anderson\u2019s \u201cargument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Doublin </em>... in which we joined the nearly unanimous position of our sister circuits in holding that <em>Booker </em>does not alter the mandatory character of ... \u00a7 lBl.lO\u2019s limitations on sentence reductions. Thus, a district court cannot reduce a sentence below the minimum provided in the amended guideline range.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b817-15\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-16\">Lastly, Anderson urges that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lBl.lO\u2019s mandatory nature violates the separation of powers doctrine. Anderson did not present this argument to the district court, but tries to escape plain error review by arguing that he never had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>chance to object to the district court\u2019s summary denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">Again, it is unclear how \u00a7 1B1.10 bears on this case in which no \u201camended guideline range\u201d applies to Anderson. Notwithstanding this threshold impediment, circuit precedent would foreclose Anderson\u2019s entire argument \u2014 including that plain error should not attach. In <em>United States v. Evans, </em>the prisoner made the exact same separation of powers sentencing appeal as Anderson does here.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The prisoner in <em>Evans, </em>too, tried to avoid plain error review by suggesting that he had had no opportunity to object to the district court\u2019s summary denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This court found the prisoner\u2019s contentions wanting; reviewed for plain error; and found none. Anderson presents the same case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-5\">The mandatory nature of \u00a7 1B1.10 was an issue that [Anderson] could have anticipated .... [He] could have mentioned separation of powers in his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion brief, but, for whatever reason, he chose not to. And because he did not present it to the district court, we review it for plain error.... Given the lack of precedent suggesting a separation-of-powers problem with ... \u00a7 1B1.10, the alleged error was not obvious .... <footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b816-6\">. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b816-7\">. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b816-8\">. \"A defendant is a career offender if (1) the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time the defendant committed the instant offense of conviction; (2) the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense; and (3) the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b816-9\">. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b816-10\">. \"The Sentencing Commission amended the guidelines applicable to cocaine base (i.e., crack cocaine) offenses by raising the quantity required to trigger each base offense level, effectively lowering each respective sentencing range....
