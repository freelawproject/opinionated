Defendant Helen Gannon, a neighbor of plaintiff, reported a disturbance to defendant Margaret Diefert, the manager of the senior citizens\u2019 apartment complex where they resided, who in turn called the police. Plaintiff was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Plaintiff filed suit against each party who played a role in his arrest. He subsequently dismissed his negligence claims against Gannon and Diefert. In his complaint, he claimed that defendants falsely arrested and imprisoned him; mistreated him; improperly obtained a temporary restraining order (TRO) against him; and maliciously prosecuted him for assault. The motion judge granted summary judgment in favor of defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">On appeal, plaintiff contends the judge erred in (1) finding probable cause; (2) determining that defendants were immune under 42 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1983; (3) dismissing plaintiffs state tort claims of false arrest and false imprisonment; (4) dismissing his malicious prosecution claim under state and federal law; (5) discounting a finding by the judge who heard the domestic violence matter that the police improperly obtained the TRO against plaintiff; and (6) determining that defendants were immune under <em>N.J.S.A </em>59:9-2(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">We conclude plaintiff raised genuine issues of material facts necessary to determine whether there was probable cause for his arrest and whether defendants were protected by good faith immunity under \u00a7 1983. Because plaintiffs claims of false arrest and false imprisonment depend on whether there was probable cause for the arrest, it was error to dismiss those claims and the claim for malicious prosecution. We affirm the dismissal of the state-law claim for damages for pain and suffering against all defendants and affirm the dismissal of the claim for punitive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>damages and malicious prosecution against the Ramsey Police Department and the Borough of Ramsey.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">This case arises out of the arrest of plaintiff by Ramsey police officers Kane Zuhone and Brian O\u2019Donahue. Plaintiff and his wife Cecilia resided in a senior citizen complex in Ramsey. On September 15, 1993 Helen Gannon, a neighbor, reported to Margaret Diefert that she heard a disturbance coming from plaintiffs apartment. Gannon claimed she heard plaintiff use loud and abusive language and threaten to throw a knife at Cecilia. Diefert then called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">A short while later, Zuhone and O\u2019Donahue arrived at the complex. After speaking with Gannon and Diefert the police knocked on plaintiffs apartment door. Cecilia let the police enter. After interviewing Cecilia, the police arrested plaintiff, obtained a temporary order restraining him from going back to his home, and filed a criminal complaint against him for assault and battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">Cecilia had not sought a restraining order against plaintiff and checked the block on the Bergen County Domestic Violence Rights Form indicating that \u201cshe did not want a restraining order at this time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">The next day, at a hearing on the domestic violence complaint, the temporary restraining order was dismissed with a notation on the order that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-10\">Testimony in Court. No complaint filed by [Cecilia]. Police improperly obtained TRO.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-12\">Later, when the assault and battery complaint filed in Ramsey Municipal Court was heard, it was dismissed at the end of the State\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-13\">In September 1995, plaintiff filed his complaint against defendants alleging assault and battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, mistreatment, false arrest, false imprisonment and malicious prosecution claiming violations of both state law and 42 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number><em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1983. Plaintiff alleged he suffered mental anguish, ridicule and embarrassment, expense incurred in his defense, and deprivation of his civil rights. He sought compensatory and punitive damages, along with costs, interest, and attorney\u2019s fees. Defendants answered, denying the material allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Following discovery defendants moved for summary judgment, claiming immunity from suit because the arresting officers acted in good faith and with probable cause. In support of their motion, pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:46-2, defendants submitted, in part, the following facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">4. Officers Kane ZuHone and [Brian] O\u2019Donahue of the Ramsey Police Department were dispatched to the Woodlands Senior Homes after receiving a call from Ms. Diefert regarding the domestic situation in the Wildoner\u2019s apartment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-7\">5. Officers ZuHone and O\u2019Donahue consulted Ms. Diefert and Ms. Gannon before investigating the Wildoner\u2019s residence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-8\">6. Upon the officers\u2019 arrival, Mrs. Wildoner admitted the officers into her apartment and told them that Plaintiff had been drinking, and that she did not want him to drive the car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-9\">7. Officers ZuHone and O\u2019Donahue observed a red mark on Mrs. Wildoner\u2019s arm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-10\">8. When Mrs. Wildoner was questioned about the red mark on her arm, she pointed to Plaintiff and said, \u201cHe did it to me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-11\">9. Mrs. Wildoner reported that her husband had thrown a knife at her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-12\">10. Officers ZuHone and O\u2019Donahue observed a knife on the kitchen floor of the Wildoner\u2019s apartment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-13\">11. After being placed under arrest, Plaintiff was wheeled out of the apartment in a wheelchair, covered by a blanket.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-14\">12. Complaining of dizziness, plaintiff was driven to the Ramsey Police Station in an ambulance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-15\">13. A criminal complaint charging simple assault <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-la) was signed by Officer ZuHone against Plaintiff Wildoner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-16\">14. Plaintiff, Cecilia Wildoner, refused to sign a domestic violence complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-17\">15. Ramsey Police Officers applied to the Municipal Court Judge for a Temporary Restraining Order. Judge Leddy issued a Temporary Restraining Order for Mrs. Wildoner\u2019s protection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-18\">16. Plaintiff was released into the custody of his son, Arthur Wildoner, Jr., a police officer of 21 years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-19\">17. Mrs. Wildoner told her son that her husband threw a knife at her that evening.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-20\">18. Plaintiff never mentioned his \u201ctreatment\u201d by the Ramsey Police to his son.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>Plaintiff disputed many of the facts as alleged by defendants. He referred to Cecilia\u2019s deposition of February 11,1997 where she denied telling the police officers that she had an argument with plaintiff and denied that she had taken plaintiffs car keys from him because he had consumed too much alcohol that day. In fact she said that nothing unusual happened on September 15, 1993, but that she and plaintiff talk loud because plaintiff does not hear very well. Cecilia explained that she hurt her arm attempting to help plaintiff put his pants on after the police arrived. She did not notice the red mark on her arm until the officer pointed it out. Cecilia recalled hearing the officer say: \u201cWe\u2019ll put ... down your husband did that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Cecilia also denied telling the officers that plaintiff threw a knife at her, hit her, slapped her, verbally abused her, or that he was intoxicated. Further, she denied seeing a knife on the kitchen floor. She also noted that plaintiff needed a walker or a cane to walk, and said, \u201cI\u2019d give him a push and he\u2019d be down if he ever fought with me.\u201d She added, \u201che would never hit me. He ain\u2019t that type. We\u2019re married all these years and he couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Plaintiff also submitted his deposition of February 11, 1997, wherein he stated that he spoke in a loud voice because Cecilia had difficulty hearing but denied he ever attacked her, threw a knife at her, or bruised her. He said at one point when his wife was in the bedroom, he may have dropped his dinner knife on the floor. Plaintiff stated that when the police arrived they pushed Cecilia into the bedroom to talk to her. When they returned one officer asked him about a red mark on Cecilia\u2019s arm. Shortly, thereafter, one officer said to the other, \u201c[w]e don\u2019t have nothing here\u201d but as they were about to leave, the one officer said \u201cI\u2019m going to try something.\u201d The officer then read plaintiff his rights, handcuffed him behind his back and placed him under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">Plaintiff testified that a piece of shrapnel remained in his knee from World War II. He said he never recovered the full use of his knee and for the past eight or nine years he had difficulty bending it. He developed arthritis in his other knee and had difficulty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>putting weight on his legs. He needed a cane to walk and getting out of a chair took him ten minutes because he needed to grab onto something to pull himself up. He claimed he was physically incapable of attacking his wife on September 15, 1993, because \u201c[s]he could give me a shove and that would be the end of it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Plaintiff explained that the officers never told him why they were arresting him, and that he did not put up any resistance. He did ask them for permission to put his pants on but the police denied his request. This request was denied. He said the officers obtained a wheelchair, \u201cshoved\u201d him into it, and took him outside where the people laughed at him because he was not dressed. The officers called an ambulance to transport plaintiff to headquarters. He said that his son arrived at headquarters and took him to his home for the night.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Plaintiff claimed that his shoulders and arms were permanently injured and as a result of the officers\u2019 rough treatment, he sustained a pulled muscle and a broken blood vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">After considering the evidence and the arguments of counsel, the motion judge granted defendants\u2019 motion and dismissed plaintiffs complaint. The judge concluded that the police officers acted in good faith and had probable cause to believe that plaintiff had committed an offense. The judge held that defendants were immune from liability under 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1983 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:2-1, 3-3, and 9-2(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">Plaintiff contends the motion judge erred in finding probable cause for his arrest in view of the existence of disputed genuine issues of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">Initially, we note that summary judgment is appropriate if \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact challenged and ... the moving party is entitled to a judgment or order as a matter of law.\u201d <em>R. </em>4:46-2(c). A fact issue is genuine if \u201cthe evidence submitted by the parties on the motion, together with all legitimate inferences therefrom favoring the non-moving party, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>would require submission of the issue to the trier of fact.\u201d <em>R. </em>4:46 \u2014 2(c); <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 540, 666 A.2d 146 (1995). Thus, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiff, the non-moving party.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1983 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-7\">Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State ... subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">\u201cTo establish a claim under section 1983, a plaintiff must prove that the defendant acted under color of state law and that the defendant deprived the plaintiff of a federal statutory or constitutional right.\u201d <em>Kirk v. City of Newark, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>173, 185, 536 A.2d 229 (1988) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">Plaintiff argues that his arrest was made pursuant to the Prevention of Domestic Violence Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-17 to -33. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-21(a) authorizes a law enforcement officer to arrest an alleged offender \u201c[w]hen a person claims to be a victim of domestic violence,\u201d if there is probable cause to believe that domestic violence has occurred, and if the victim is injured, or if a weapon is involved. If the conditions of this subsection are not present, a police officer may still arrest an alleged offender \u201cwhere there is probable cause to believe that an act of domestic violence has been committed.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:25-21(b). Plaintiff contends that giving him the benefit of his favorable evidence, his wife never claimed to be a victim of domestic violence and the police lacked probable cause to believe domestic violence had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:25-22, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-11\">A law enforcement officer or a member of a domestic crisis team or any person who, in good faith, reports a possible incident of domestic violence to the police shall not be held liable in any civil action brought by any party for an arrest based on probable cause, enforcement in good faith of a court order, or any other act or omission in good faith under this aet.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>This section protects defendants from liability for an arrest only if the arrest was based on probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">In addition to establishing that defendants acted under color of state law when they arrested him, plaintiff claims a deprivation of his constitutional right to freedom from an unreasonable seizure of his person under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution. An arrest without probable cause is actionable under \u00a7 1983. <em>Kirk, supra, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>at 185, 536 A.2d 229.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">A police officer may defend a \u00a7 1983 claim \u201cby establishing either that he or she acted with probable cause, or, even if probable cause did not exist, that a reasonable police officer could have believed in its existence.\u201d <em>Kirk, supra, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>at 184, 536 A.2d 229. However, where there are disputed genuine issues of fact upon which the probable cause issue depends, then the issue of probable cause to arrest is a question for the factfinder. <em>Sharrar v. Felsing, </em>128 F.3d 810, 818 (3rd Cir.1997). (\u201cThe question is for the jury only if there is sufficient evidence whereby a jury could reasonably find that the police officers did not have reasonable cause to arrest.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">The crucial issue under both state law and \u00a7 1983 is whether defendant had probable cause to arrest plaintiff. Probable cause exists if at the time of the arrest \u201cthe facts and circumstances within [the officers\u2019] knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing that the [suspect] had committed or was committing an offense.\u201d <em>Beck v. Ohio, </em>379 <em>U.S. </em>89, 91, 85 <em>S.Ct. </em>223, 225-26, 13 L.Ed.2d 142, 145 (1964) (citations omitted); <em>see also State v. Waltz, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>83, 87, 293 A.2d 167 (1972) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>(citations omitted) (probable cause is \u201cmore than mere naked suspicion but less than legal evidence necessary to convict____ It has been described by this Court as a \u2018well grounded\u2019 suspicion that a crime has been or is being committed.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">It is clear that when an injured victim complains to the police that she was assaulted and identifies her husband as the attacker, there is probable cause to arrest the husband. <em>See Sharrar, supra, </em>128 F.3d at 818. On the other hand, if the victim does not complain but an informant who is not an eyewitness is the complainant, the informant\u2019s \u201c Veracity,\u2019 \u2018reliability,\u2019 and \u2018basis of knowledge\u2019 are all highly relevant in determining the value of his report.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 <em>U.S. </em>213, 230, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>2317, 2328, 76 L.Ed.2d 527, 543 (1983). \u201cWithout a basis for determining the reliability of informants\u2019 hearsay, there can be no probable cause finding.\u201d <em>Siligato v. State, </em>268 <em>N.J.Super. </em>21, 30, 632 A.2d 837 (App.Div.1993). The reviewing court must consider the totality of the circumstances. <em>Illinois v. Gates, supra, </em>462 <em>U.S. </em>at 238, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2332, 76 L.Ed.2d at 548.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">Accepting as true all of the evidence which supports plaintiffs position, we are satisfied that plaintiff submitted sufficient evidence from which a jury could reasonably find the police lacked probable cause to arrest plaintiff. Defendants\u2019 contention that there was probable cause to arrest plaintiff assumes that Cecilia initially reported to the police that she had argued with plaintiff, but subsequently changed her story. However, Cecilia denied she told the police plaintiff attacked her, verbally abused her, or was intoxicated. Cecilia also explained the mark on her arm was not caused by plaintiff and denied there was a knife on the floor. While plaintiff admitted there might have been a knife on the floor, he asserted that he accidentally dropped it.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">The remaining evidence was Gannon\u2019s report that she heard plaintiff threaten to throw a knife at Cecilia. This might constitute a terroristic threat. The officers investigated this complaint and attempted to confirm Gannon\u2019s account by questioning Cecilia. Again, accepting Cecilia\u2019s testimony that she denied telling the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>officers that plaintiff either threatened or attacked her, Gannon\u2019s account remained uncorroborated.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">In addition, plaintiffs poor physical condition was a circumstance which a reasonable police officer should have considered. Plaintiff, Cecilia, and their son, concurred that plaintiff was physically incapable of inflicting injury upon Cecilia.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">In short, plaintiff submitted sufficient evidence to support a finding that a reasonable police officer would not have believed probable cause existed that plaintiff had committed domestic violence. Plaintiff raised genuine issues of material fact to preclude summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Plaintiff next challenges the motion judge\u2019s determination that defendants were entitled to qualified immunity for acts done in good faith under 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1983. In finding no abuse of police power, the motion judge reasoned that public employees \u201ccharged with protection of the public\u201d must be permitted \u201cto perform their duties unfettered by the litigious whims of certain members of the public while at the same time allowing obvious abuses to be dealt with by the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">In <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 <em>U.S. </em>800, 817-18, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>2727, 2738, 73 L.Ed.2d 396, 410 (1982) (citations and footnote omitted), the Supreme Court explained the defense of qualified or good faith immunity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-9\">[W]e conclude today that bare allegations of malice should not suffice to subject government officials either to the costs of trial or to the burdens of broad-reaching discovery. We therefore hold that government officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-10\">Reliance on the objective reasonableness of an official\u2019s conduct, as measured by reference to clearly established law, should avoid excessive disruption of government and permit the resolution of many insubstantial claims on summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>In <em>Malley v. Briggs, </em>475 <em>U.S. </em>335, 341, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1092, 1096, 89 L.Ed.2d 271, 278 (1986), considering a claim that a police officer caused the arrest of plaintiff by obtaining a warrant without probable cause, the Court commented that the defense of qualified immunity</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-6\">provides ample protection to all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law____ Defendants will not be immune if, on an objective basis, it is obvious that no reasonably competent officer would have concluded that a warrant would issue; but if officers of reasonable competence could disagree on this issue, immunity should be recognized.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">In <em>Anderson v. Creighton, </em>483 <em>U.S. </em>635, 641, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>3034, 3040, 97 L.Ed.2d 523, 532 (1987), dealing with a warrantless search of plaintiffs\u2019 home, conducted because of exigent circumstances, the Court elaborated on this standard: \u201cThe relevant question ... is the objective (albeit fact-specific) question whether a reasonable officer could have believed [defendant\u2019s] warrantless search to be lawful, in light of clearly established law and the information the searching officers possessed. [Defendant\u2019s] subjective beliefs about the search are irrelevant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">Our Supreme Court adopted the federal \u201cobjective reasonableness\u201d standard when determining whether a law enforcement officer is entitled to qualified immunity. <em>Kirk v. City of Newark, supra, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>at 187, 536 A.2d 229 (a reasonable officer could have believed that defendant police detective had probable cause to arrest plaintiff for scalding his girlfriend\u2019s child); <em>see also Plummer v. Department of Corrections, </em>305 <em>N.J.Super. </em>365, 373, 702 A.2d 535 (App.Div.1997) (corrections officers\u2019 arrest of plaintiff, a former inmate, seen on or near state prison grounds, was objectively reasonable); <em>McKinney v. East Orange Mun.

Further, we noted in <em>McKinney, supra, </em>at 647, 666 A.2d 191, that \u201cthe standard of objective reasonableness is liberally construed in the officer\u2019s favor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">The question of qualified immunity is a question of law to be decided by the court as early in the proceedings as possible, because \u201c[t]he entitlement is an <em>immunity from suit </em>rather than a mere defense to liability.\u201d <em>Hunter, supra, </em>502 <em>U.S. </em>at 227, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 536, 116 L.Ed.2d at 595 (quoting <em>Mitchell v.

The court held that the issues of whether the law is clearly established and whether the actions of the officers were objectively reasonable are both to be decided by the court, but added: \u201cOnly if the historical facts material to the latter issue are in dispute ... will there be an issue for the jury.\u201d 128 <em>F.</em>3d at 828.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">We apply there principles to the case here. Neither side contends the law regarding probable cause to arrest plaintiff was not clearly established. However, as noted above, the historical facts necessary to decide whether the officers\u2019 actions were objectively reasonable are in dispute. If the officers\u2019 versions are credited there is no doubt they had probable cause to arrest plaintiff and their actions were objectively reasonable. On the other hand, if plaintiffs version is believed, the police would not have had an objectively reasonable belief there was probable cause to arrest plaintiff. Because there are essential underlying historical facts in dispute, a jury must decide the issue of qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Defendants nevertheless contend they are entitled to qualified immunity because plaintiff failed to prove \u201cconduct beyond mere negligence.\u201d <em>Vallejo v. Rahway Police Dep\u2019t, </em>292 <em>N.J.Super. </em>333, 347, 678 A.2d 1135 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>262, 686 A.2d 763 (1996). In <em>Vallejo, </em>plaintiff suffered brain damage when he attempted suicide while imprisoned by defendants. There plaintiffs claim under \u00a7 1983 was based on a failure to train officers in suicide prevention and to provide him with medical care. We held that at most this was a case of negligence and dismissed the claim. <em>Id. </em>at 348, 678 A.2d 1135.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Defendants also rely on <em>Fielder v. Stonack, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>101, 117\u201430, 661 A.2d 231 (1995), where our Supreme Court held that police officers are immune from liability under <em>N.J.S.A </em>59:5-2(b)(2), when, in pursuit of a fleeing automobile, their vehicle collides with an innocent third party\u2019s vehicle. The Court commented that defendants might still be liable on a federal due process claim if plaintiffs can show more than \u201cmere negligence\u201d on the part of the officers. <em>Id. </em>at 133, 661 A.2d 231.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">Contrary to defendants\u2019 contention, the actions of the officers could be found to be more than mere negligence which accidentally or inadvertently caused harm to plaintiff. If plaintiffs evidence is believed then the police officers intentionally arrested plaintiff knowing that they lacked probable cause to arrest him. Under these circumstances, it was error to decide the issue of qualified immunity as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">Plaintiff contends the judge erred in dismissing his claims of false arrest and false imprisonment on the ground that defendants were immune from liability under <em>N.J.SA </em>59:2-1 and 3-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:2-l(a) provides: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided by this act, a public entity is not liable for an injury, whether such injury arises out of an act or omission of the public entity or a public employee or any other person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number><em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:3-3 provides: \u201cA public employee is not liable if he acts in good faith in the execution or enforcement of any law. Nothing in this section exonerates a public employee from liability for false arrest or false imprisonment.\u201d The 1972 Task Force Comment under this section explains that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-5\">This section does not, however, immunize law enforcement officials from false arrest and false imprisonment. It is recognized that law enforcement officers are not now immune in the State of New Jersey and it is believed that existing principles of law provide sufficient protection for the officer from frivolous suits. Therefore it is the intent of this section to emphasize the importance of compensating a citizen whose freedom has been unreasonably restricted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-6\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>59:3-3 (comment).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">In <em>Hayes v. County of Mercer, </em>217 <em>N.J.Super. </em>614, 618-19, 526 A.2d 737 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>643, 532 A.2d 226 (1987), plaintiff was arrested and defendants commenced an extradition proceeding against him, but the action was dismissed when the victim could not identify plaintiff. We determined that the investigator\u2019s conduct was objectively reasonable, and he was thus entitled to qualified immunity under \u00a7 1983. <em>Id. </em>at 621, 526 A.2d 737. We further adopted \u201cthe objective good-faith standard\u201d of <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, supra, </em>for the good-faith defense set forth in the first sentence of <em>N.J.S.A </em>59:3-3. 217 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 622-23, 526 A.2d 737. However, we noted that this section \u201cwithholds the defense of subjective good faith where the claim ... is for \u2018false arrest or imprisonment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 622-23, 526 A.2d 737.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">To be sure, probable cause is a defense to claims of false arrest and false imprisonment. <em>Hayes, supra, </em>217 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 623, 526 A.2d 737. However, as noted above, the issue of whether defendants, had probable cause to arrest plaintiff must be decided by the factfinder. Therefore, it was error to conclude that defendants were immune from liability under <em>N.J.S.A </em>59:3-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">Plaintiff next contends the motion judge erred in dismissing his claim of malicious prosecution because Zuhone\u2019s complaint against him for simple assault was later dismissed at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>In an action for malicious prosecution, plaintiff \u201cmust show that the suit was brought without reasonable or probable cause, that it was actuated by malice, and that it terminated favorably to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Penwag Property Co., Inc. v. Landau, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>595, 598, 388 A.2d 1265 (1978) (citation omitted). The plaintiff must also establish a special grievance, other than counsel fees and costs necessary to the defense, which \u201cconsists of interference with one\u2019s liberty or property.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:3-8 provides: \u201cA public employee is not liable for injury caused by his instituting or prosecuting any judicial or administrative proceeding within the scope of his employment.\u201d The 1972 Task Force Comment to this section states that \u201cthe immunity does not extend to conduct ... constituting actual malice ... or willful misconduct. See \u00a7 59:3-14.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:3-14(a) provides: \u201cNothing in this act shall exonerate a public employee from liability if it is established that his conduct ... constituted ... actual malice or willful misconduct.\u201d Although a public employee is generally not liable for injury caused by his prosecuting any judicial proceeding, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:3-8, this provision does not apply if the employee\u2019s conduct constituted actual malice or willful misconduct. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:3-14(a). Here, plaintiff has raised a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the officers\u2019 acted with malice or willful misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Further, malicious prosecution is a constitutional tort actionable under \u00a7 1983. In <em>James v. Price, </em>602 <em>F.Supp. </em>843, 845 (D.N.J.1985), plaintiff alleged that malicious prosecution of a criminal offense was a deprivation of his liberty without due process. The court held that defendants were not entitled to immunity under <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, supra, </em>because, \u201cat least within the District of New Jersey, the right to be free from malicious prosecution is \u2018clearly established.\u2019 \u201d 602 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 847.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">Here, defendants do not contest plaintiffs assertion that the criminal complaint was dismissed at the close of the State\u2019s case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>Viewing the evidence favorably to plaintiff, a reasonable factfinder could conclude the officers acted with malice in arresting him without probable cause and in obtaining a temporary restraining order against the wishes of Cecilia. Consequently, we conclude that plaintiff submitted sufficient evidence to raise a material issue of fact regarding the officers\u2019 malice in prosecuting him. It was error to summarily dismiss plaintiff\u2019s claim for malicious prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Plaintiff next contends that the motion judge improperly rejected the notation on the order vacating the TRO that \u201c[pjolice improperly obtained TRO.\u201d Specifically, plaintiff contends this \u201cruling is binding on this proceeding under the principle of collateral estoppel.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">In order for collateral estoppel to apply;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-8\">the party asserting the bar must show that: (1) the issue to be precluded is identical to the issue decided in the prior proceeding; (2) the issue was actually litigated in the prior proceeding; (3) the court in the prior proceeding issued a final judgment on the merits; (4) the determination of the issue was essential to the prior judgment; and (5) the party against whom the doctrine is asserted was a party to or in privity with a party to the earlier proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-9\"><em>[In re Dawson, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>1, 20, 641 A.2d 1026 (1994) (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">Here, the prior proceeding, captioned <em>Cecilia Wildoner v. Arthur Wildoner, </em>which resulted in the vacation of the temporary restraining order apparently consisted solely of Cecilia\u2019s testimony, because the judge checked boxes on the form order indicating that he had considered plaintiffs \u201ccertification and/or affidavit\u201d and noted \u201ctestimony in court.\u201d The order of September 16,1993, is the only portion of this proceeding that is in the record. Thus, it cannot be determined whether the issue of the officers\u2019 propriety in obtaining the restraining order was litigated. In any event, none of the defendants here were parties to or in privity with parties to the domestic violence proceeding. Consequently, the motion judge properly rejected plaintiffs attempt to use collateral estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>VII</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Plaintiff finally contends the motion judge erred in determining that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:9 \u2014 2(d) precluded his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:9-2(d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-8\">No damages shall be awarded against a public entity or public employee for pain and suffering resulting from any injury; provided, however, that this limitation on the recovery of damages for pain and suffering shall not apply in cases of permanent loss of a bodily function, permanent disfigurement or dismemberment where the medical treatment expenses are in excess of $1,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">Plaintiff submitted no evidence of his medical treatment expenses and submitted no medical evidence that he suffered any permanent loss of a bodily function.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">Nevertheless, plaintiff contends that section 9-2(d) applies only to pain and suffering resulting from a physical injury and does not apply to pain and suffering resulting \u201cfrom an injustice, deprivation of constitutional rights and loss of liberty.\u201d This view has been rejected. <em>See Ayers v. Township of Jackson, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>557, 565, 525 A.2d 287 (1987), (\u201cthe subjective symptoms of depression, stress, health concerns and anxiety described by the plaintiffs and their expert witness constitute \u2018pain and suffering resulting from any injury\u2019 and the Tort Claims Act bars recovery for such damage.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b537-11\">Plaintiff also contends that he should be permitted to assert his claim of punitive damages against the officers, even in the absence of compensatory damages. Defendants argue that an award of punitive damages against the officers is barred by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:3-l(c) which bars liability of public employee where the public entity is immune from liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-12\">The case of <em>Marion v. Borough of Manasquan, </em>231 <em>N.J.Super. </em>320, 323-24, 555 A.2d 699 (App.Div.1989), is instructive. There, plaintiffs claimed they were unlawfully arrested and detained for walking on a beach without a beach badge. We determined that their claims of emotional distress amounted to pain and suffering and were barred by <em>N.J.S.A </em>59:9-2(d). <em>Id. </em>at 332, 555 A.2d 699. However, we noted that although punitive damages could not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>awarded against a public entity under <em>N.J.S.A </em>59:9-2(c), \u201cno such immunity exists for public employees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 333, 555 A.2d 699. Moreover, we noted that \u201cin a false imprisonment ease, punitive damages may be awarded even where there are no compensatory damages.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Here, a factfinder, crediting plaintiffs evidence, could conclude the officers\u2019 conduct in arresting and handcuffing plaintiff was wantonly reckless or malicious. <em>See Nappe v. Anschelewitz, Barr, Ansell &amp; Bonello, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>37, 49, 477 A.2d 1224 (1984) (\u201cTo warrant a punitive award, the defendant\u2019s conduct must have been wantonly reckless or malicious. There must be an intentional wrongdoing in the sense of an \u2018evil-minded act\u2019 or an act accompanied by a wanton and wilful disregard of the rights of another\u201d). Furthermore, counsel fees incurred in defending a false complaint are a part of the damages for a malicious prosecution claim. <em>See Penwag Property Co., supra, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>at 598, 388 A.2d 1265 (\u201c[c]ounsel fees and costs in defending the action maliciously brought may be an element of damage in a successful malicious prosecution\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Consequently, we affirm the determination that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:9\u2014 2(d) precluded an award of compensatory damages. However, plaintiff may maintain his claims for punitive damages against O\u2019Donahue and Zuhone.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">We reverse in part and remand for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b527-12\"> The version of this statute in effect in September 1993 did not contain the language \"or any person who, in good faith, reports a possible incident of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>domestic violence to the police.\" These additional words were added by L. 1994, c. 94, \u00a7 2, effective August 11, 1994. The clear intent of the amendment was to expand the immunity by enlarging the class of persons covered to include persons who report, in good faith, a possible incident of domestic violence to the police.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
