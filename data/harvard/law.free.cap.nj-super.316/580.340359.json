All claims by plaintiff for \u201clegal fraud\u201d were \u201cdismissed with prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">Defendants do not contest the order, which they requested, requiring them to \u201cbuy out\u201d plaintiffs interest in Inmar, a corporation which owned a building in Linden. Defendants challenge the $100,000 damage award for \u201cequitable fraud\u201d attributed to the overvalued purchase price. They argue that the purchase price plaintiff paid for his interest in Inmar was based on figures plaintiff claimed he never saw and, therefore, could not have relied upon, and, in any event, could have verified with his own experts. Defendants also claim that plaintiff cannot base a fraud action upon reliance on their \u201copinion\u201d of the value of the property and that money damages cannot be awarded as a remedy for equitable fraud. There is no cross appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-10\">The parties agree that the Chancery Division\u2019s findings of fact are supported by substantial credible evidence in the record. Based on those findings, we hold that the trial judge erred in reaching his legal conclusions. Accordingly, we reverse the award of damages for equitable fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Plaintiff, Dr. Daibo, brought the action against Ned and Melvin Kirsch and other defendants alleging that he was fraudulently induced to invest in Inmar after agreeing to purchase an interest in Linn Associates, a partnership in which the Kirsch brothers (defendants) had the controlling interest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Both entities owned real property in Linden. The Kirsches cross-moved to buy out plaintiffs interest in Inmar \u201cat fair value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">After a trial, the judge found defendants committed no legal fraud, but were liable based on equitable fraud because of an inflated purchase price paid by plaintiff for his share of Inmar. Plaintiffs case centered on defendants\u2019 alleged unilateral transfer of plaintiffs initial investment in Linn Associates to an interest in Inmar.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">In defending the judgment, plaintiff argues that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s findings of fact should not be overruled.\u201d He thereby acknowledges that there is substantial evidence in the record to support the trial judge\u2019s findings of fact. <em>See Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v. Investors Ins. Co., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 484, 323 A.2d 495 (1974). Accordingly, we quote the judge\u2019s material findings at length:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-9\">We have a situation in which we have Mel [Kirsch], who is much more sophisticated than Dr. Daibo, selling an interest in a corporation that owns real estate, to a doctor who, in my book, appears to be extremely careless and I used the word \u201claissez-faire,\u201d and I was trying to be kind. This is a man who appears not to be particularly careful in what he does. His credibility is seriously impugned by virtue of the various inconsistencies in his testimony and the exaggerations that I thought were rather self-evident. He\u2019s a bit impetuous. He\u2019s someone who appears to be, in my mind, opinionated. One who suffers from some kind of an idea that somehow one can be careless with one\u2019s investment, and then if something goes wrong, blame the other guy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-10\">He makes a charge that there was a switch that was perpetrated on him, in which he thought he was investing in Linn and he ended up with Inmar, which owns and controls 104 East Elizabeth Avenue, Linden, New Jersey. We have to deal in this court with reality not fantasy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>The judge found that plaintiff, after purchasing an interest in the Linn partnership, entered into an agreement which terminated that interest. The agreement provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-5\">The sale agreement is hereby terminated, declared null and void and of no further force and effect, and the parties thereto shall have no further rights or obligations thereunder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">According to the judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-7\">Simultaneously, there was a stock sale agreement, in which [plaintiff! agreed to purchase 500 shares of common stock of Inmar Associates, a whole different company, a new corporation. This time, for a different percentage of ownership; that is a third ownership as opposed to 22.3 percent. The agreement again is relatively simple, and the doctor wants me to believe that somehow only the signature page was slipped under his nose and he signed it or he didn\u2019t read it or Ned told him he doesn\u2019t have to read it. I just don\u2019t simply believe that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">Thereafter, for several years, plaintiff accepted a return on his investment from Inmar:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-9\">He knew exactly what he was signing. He then accepts all these checks, which are D-4. They specifically talk about Inmar Associates, Inc. They don\u2019t talk about Linn. And he accepts all these checks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-10\">He then, I\u2019m satisfied, got K-ls. The K-ls specifically talk about Inmar Associates, Inc. They talk about a one-third interest. Not a one-third of the Kirschs\u2019 interest as portrayed in Linn, but one-third interest, period, end of quote. One-third of the whole [for 1992,1993,1994 and 1995].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-11\">And at some point during the receipt of a financial statement that he received approximately a year later, he noted an entry that shows me that this man did in fact read financial statements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-12\">The judge noted the good faith basis for the recommended change in plaintiffs investment from Linn to Inmar, essentially because of the financing differences due to the insolvency of the Howard Savings Bank, which was financing the Linn acquisition. The judge also found that plaintiff was refunded a $7,000 difference in purchase price between his share in the Linn and Inmar investments, thus underscoring his knowledge of the ultimate investment made.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-13\">I recognize that there\u2019s certain burdens of proof, but I also recognize that there\u2019s such a thing as being honest, truthful, and straightforward. An honest person doesn\u2019t play games with facts. There\u2019s no question that the doctor got the $7,000, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>why he made an issue of it on the witness stand is probably an embarrassment to counsel. In any event, he got the seven. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-6\">The question is, was he defrauded when he invested $283,000 on a deal in which the projected profit, gross profit, was 61,000 some odd dollars \u2014 admittedly, not fully rented \u2014 versus the Linn Associates deal, in which ... he would have a gross profit of maybe $44,000 a year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-7\">Again, the doctor loses his credibility because he exaggerates. He said that Mel guaranteed this to him. The doctor knows better than that. Why do we know that he knows better than that? Because of all of his failed investments in the past. All his tax shelters, his condominiums, and all of the fancy tax shelters that he went into, all fell like a house of cards. He knows, if no one knows, he knows, that there\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch. There\u2019s no guarantee. Is there a reasonable projection; of course, there is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-8\">The real estate market, despite what the appraisers may have inferred, it was fairly steady; and, admittedly, Linden was probably fairly more steady than others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">The judge nevertheless found that equitable fraud was committed in establishing the purchase price of the Inmar investment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-10\">Now how did this affect this particular deal? I think that what happened here was [Mel] Kirsch committed an equitable fraud on Dr. Daibo. Sounds pretty strong. I don\u2019t think that Mel Kirsch is a bad guy. I think Mel Kirsch is a decent human being. But there is no way that you could possibly justify an 850,000-dollar equity in the Inmar property. Forget it. It doesn\u2019t even exist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-11\">Now Dr. Daibo, to show you how poor an investor he is, you know, knowing all of this, should have realized that you don\u2019t pay $283,000 for a projected 20,000-dollar-a-year income, when you can get a projected $44,000 for $7,000 more.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-12\">Now they\u2019ve tried to paint Mel Kirsch as some kind of a villain. I believe that Mel Kirsch realized that there was some financing problems [with the Linn property], vis-a-vis Howard Savings; that this was not the kind of a deal you wanted a medical doctor in. That if they ever had to refinance this, we would be dealing with a doctor who certainly would not have wanted to sign personally. He was an investor, not a promoter, not a developer. He\u2019s not a real estate maven or an entrepreneur. He\u2019s a medical doctor. He\u2019s a professional person. All he wants is a passive investment. He wants to get a return on his money. He doesn\u2019t want to get involved in the intricacies of managing property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-13\">So everybody is clear here. I don\u2019t believe that Mel Kirsch is the kind of person who sat down and rubbed his hands together and said, now how can I defraud Dr. Daibo. I don\u2019t believe that. I think what happened here is, <em>he committed </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number><em>equitable fraud became he had no intention of defrauding the doctor, </em>but that\u2019s the result of what happened. Because he sold him a bill of goods that even by his own appraiser could not even be substantiated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-5\">... And on paper, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question that Linn was the better investment. On the other hand, I think it\u2019s disingenuous for the doctor to not consider the fact that maybe Mel did him a favor by not putting him in Linn because I can\u2019t conceive in my wildest imagination for the doctor coming up with 120K more, plus signing personally, (emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The judge also concluded that once plaintiff \u201cfound out that Linn subsequently was not as good a deal on paper as it was projected, he didn\u2019t want Linn,\u201d and that he \u201cchanged horses in the middle of the stream ... because he knew he had to put up $120,000 and sign personally if he was going to be treated equally with the Kirsch[es].\u201d But with regard to the value of the Inmar property, the judge further noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-7\">I recognize that Mel Kirsch was not saying, hey, I had the property appraised for 2.1 million. Dr. Daibo knew that. I\u2019m not going to hold Mel Kirsch to an appraisal today of 1.650 or whatever it came to. It\u2019s so easy to Monday-morning quarterback somebody who\u2019s sitting down over lunch and saying to somebody, look, I got a deal, I think it\u2019s a good deal. We can\u2019t do that. If Dr. Daibo wasn\u2019t sure of the number, he\u2019s a big guy. He ought to say, look, Mel, tell you what, I\u2019m going to go out and have the property appraised. He didn\u2019t do that. On the other hand, <em>Mel had a concomitant obligation to Dr. Daibo not to exaggerate the value, even though one might do it without the intent, the specific intent, to defraud. </em>(emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">In essence, the judge concluded that, while there was no intentional misrepresentation or legal fraud in determining the value of plaintiff\u2019s interest in Inmar, equitable fraud was committed by defendant Melvin Kirsch because he induced plaintiff to invest in Inmar at an inflated price:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-9\">I\u2019m satisfied that the evidence is clear and convincing that Dr. Daibo obviously overpaid for his investment in Inmar. I do not believe, however, that Mel \u2014 and Ned [an attorney found not to have been plaintiffs attorney] is out of this. Ned, the doctor so exaggerated Ned\u2019s participation that it was ridiculous. I\u2019m satisfied Ned Kirsch is an honest, upright attorney, an individual. I was very impressed with his testimony. Mel, too, except that Mel \u2014 you know, Mel is a businessman. He\u2019s trying to get this guy to invest at a time when, hey, the real estate market wasn\u2019t the best. But I don\u2019t think that Mel is a dishonest person. <em>I think that he didn\u2019t commit actual fraud; and, therefore, I award no damages under that claim.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>I also find that the defendants did not fraudulently induce the plaintiff into investing in Inmar as a switch-and-bait operation. But <em>I do believe that Mel committed, equitable fraud because of the grossly inflated, equity estimate.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-6\">First of all, and this is second-guessing him, the price should not have been based upon equity, although I know some people use it. Income is the critical one. But that\u2019s an aside.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-7\">As I said, Mel claimed the property had a sales price of two million one; however, the property had, at best, giving a factor of almost $200,000 as a cushion for Mel, a maximum value of 1.8. Using that estimate as the true original sales price for the whole, the plaintiffs purchase of one-third of the equity interest in the property should have cost him $183,000 instead of $283,000 as the purchase price. That number being rounded off because the 283,000-dollar number was rounded off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-8\">Therefore, this caused Dr. Daibo to overpay $100,000 for his interest, and he\u2019s entitled to be made whole and awarded that amount as damages for the equitable fraud which I believe was proved clearly and convincingly, not only by the testimony \u2014 and not Dr. Daibo\u2019s testimony, because I agree with Mr. Snyder [defendants\u2019 attorney]; Dr. Daibo is not a credible witness in many instances. What I\u2019m going by is the clear, unequivocal proof presented by the defendants themselves.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-9\">The defendant is entitled to buy out the plaintiffs remaining shares of Inmar, and it is so ordered. Ordered for them to buy it and for Dr. Daibo to sell it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">The judge therefore concluded that plaintiff was entitled to receive a return of the excess amount paid for his investment because of the equitable fraud and that defendants were obligated to buy plaintiffs share in Inmar at the then market value of $100,000, with interest on the $100,000 overpayment \u201cbecause the defendants received the benefit of plaintiffs overpayment from January 1992\u201d to the date of decision in August 1997. The $100,000 damage award was premised on the judge\u2019s conclusion that Inmar had a real market value of $1,800,000 at the time of plaintiffs investment, not the $2,100,000 value Mel Kirsch described in the purchase proposal, and that plaintiff should have paid only $183,000 for his one-third interest in Inmar, not the $283,000 he actually paid as a result of Mel Kirseh\u2019s \u201cgrossly inflated equity estimate.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As noted, however, the judge found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>that there was no \u201cbait and switch\u201d operation and that Mel neither referred to any false or non-existent appraisal nor intended to defraud the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Based on the judge\u2019s fact-finding, we reverse the judgment awarding money damages for equitable fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">To prove legal fraud, a plaintiff must demonstrate a \u201cmaterial misrepresentation of a presently existing or past fact, made with knowledge of its falsity and with the intention that the other party rely thereon, resulting in reliance by that party to his detriment.\u201d <em>Jewish Ctr. of Sussex County v. Whale, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>619, 624, 432 A.2d 521 (1981). However, unlike legal fraud which may give rise to money damages, equitable fraud does not require proof that the representation was made with \u201cknowledge of its falsity and an intention to obtain an undue advantage therefrom.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 625, 432 A.2d 521. \u201cScienter is not at issue.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, to recover based on equitable fraud the plaintiff must prove his or her reasonable reliance on a material misrepresentation of fact. <em>Ibid. See also DSK Enter., Inc. v. United Jersey Bank, </em>189 <em>N.J.Super. </em>242, 251, 459 A.2d 1201 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>598, 468 A.2d 232 (1983). Moreover, a party claiming equitable fraud must prove the required elements by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Stochastic Decisions, Inc. v. DiDomenico, </em>236 <em>N.J.Super. </em>388, 395, 565 A.2d 1133 (App.Div.1989), <em>certif. denied </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>607, 583 A.2d 309 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">Defendants contend that the finding of equitable fraud must be reversed. They emphasize that the judge found no intent to defraud and that Mel Kirsch made only an innocent misrepresentation by asserting a sincerely believed, but mistakenly inflated value of the Inmar property. Defendants also contend that plaintiffs reliance on the Inmar proposal<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> could not be deemed \u201crea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>sonable\u201d because plaintiff was an experienced real estate investor and could have obtained his own appraisals with respect to the value of Inmar. Defendants point to the inconsistency between plaintiffs testimony, rejected by the trial judge, that defendants never showed him any information about the Inmar property and plaintiffs attempt to sustain the finding of equitable fraud which requires proof of reliance. Defendants further assert that, in any event, the proposal contained Mel\u2019s opinion as to Inmar\u2019s value and that there was no misrepresentation of any \u201cfact.\u201d In essence, defendants argue that plaintiff proved neither the \u201cmaterial misrepresentation of fact\u201d nor the \u201creasonable reliance\u201d elements required to sustain a finding of equitable fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">There is no contention that defendants misstated facts (such as the amount of the mortgage, overhead or rent) embodied in the proposal, and the judge made no such finding. To the contrary, the judge found only that \u201cMel committed equitable fraud because of the grossly inflated equity estimate.\u201d The \u201cestimate,\u201d however, was not an expression of fact but of opinion based on Mel\u2019s assessment of value.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">In <em>Garden Realty Corp. v. Hadley, </em>110 <em>N.J. Eq. </em>474, 160 <em>A. </em>385 (E. &amp; A.1932), the Court held that \u201cRepresentations by a seller as to the value of his property are not usually a basis for a claim of fraud____ Value is a matter of opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 475-76, 160 <em>A. </em>385 (citation omitted). Other jurisdictions similarly hold that fraud cannot be predicated on representations as to value. <em>See, e.g., Arnold v. Erkmann, </em>934 S.W.2d 621, 627 (Mo.Ct.App.1996) (\u201cA statement as to value of property is ordinarily considered an opinion, not a statement of fact\u201d; where a person making the representation has no \u201cspecial knowledge\u201d or expertise, the state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>ment constitutes a \u201crepresentation of value and not a false statement of existing fact\u201d); <em>Wright v. Westside Nursery, </em>787 P.2d 508, 512-13 (Utah Ct.App.1990) (\u201cmisrepresentations as to value do not ordinarily constitute fraud, as they are regarded as mere expressions of opinion or \u2018trader\u2019s talk\u2019 involving matter of judgment and estimation as to which men may differ\u201d); <em>Cravens v. Skinner, </em>626 S.W.2d 173, 177 (Tex.App.1981) (absent a confidential relationship, \u201ca representation of market value of a commodity is merely an opinion that cannot be made the basis of a recovery for fraud and deceit\u201d); <em>Clark Sanitation, Inc. v. Sun Valley Disposal Co., </em>87 <em>Nev. </em>338, 487 P.2d 337, 339 (Nev.1971) (an \u201cestimate is an opinion and an estimate of value is an opinion as to value upon which reasonable and honorable men may hold differing views. This is the basis for the frequently announced rule that a charge of fraud may not be based upon representations of value\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">There was no finding here that Mel falsely represented that he had received an appraisal of $2,100,000. Nor was there any finding that Mel did not honestly hold his opinion as to value, or possessed material information he did not convey. To the contrary, the judge expressly found Mel had no intent to defraud the plaintiff. In these circumstances, there was no basis on which to find that defendants made a misstatement of material \u201cfact.\u201d <em>Cf. Bank of America Nat\u2019l Trust &amp; Sav. </em>Assoc. <em>v. Hutchinson, </em>212 <em>Cal.App.2d </em>142, 27 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>787, 790 (1963) (developing when expressions of \u201copinion\u201d may be actionable). Accordingly, we agree with defendants that plaintiff proved no \u201cmisrepresentation of fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Defendants also contend that by accepting monthly checks for his share of Inmar investment from 1993 through the time of trial in 1997,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> plaintiff \u201caffirmed\u201d the Inmar transaction and, thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>is \u201cprecluded\u201d from \u201cany equitable relief.\u201d Defendants point out that the victim of a material misrepresentation has the choice of either rescinding or affirming the contract, <em>see Merchants Indemnity Corp. v. Eggleston, 37 N.J. </em>114, 130-31, 179 A.2d 505 (1962), and that \u201cdelay in [seeking] rescission of the contract is evidence of a waiver of the fraud and an election to treat the contract as valid.\u201d <em>Jones v. Gabrielan, </em>52 <em>N.J.Super. </em>563, 576, 146 A.2d 495 (App.Div.1958) (quoting <em>Allen v. Logan, </em>116 <em>N.J. Eq. </em>550, 552, 174 A. 561 (E. &amp; A.1934)); <em>see also Garden Realty Corp. v. Hadley, supra, </em>110 <em>N.J. Eq. </em>at 476, 160 A. 385. On the other hand, plaintiff argues that a defrauded party who chooses to \u201caffirm\u201d a transaction may still \u201csue <em>at law </em>to recover damages sustained as a result of the fraud.\u201d <em>See Bilotti v. Accurate Forming Corp., </em>39 <em>N.J. </em>184, 199-200, 188 A.2d 24 (1963) (emphasis added). A defrauded party who affirms the contract may recover \u201cthe difference between the value of what he received and the value of what he gave \u2014 an <em>ex delicto </em>recovery.\u201d <em>Id, </em>at 200, 188 A.2d 24 (quoting 5 <em>Williston, Contracts </em>\u00a7 1523, at 4265 (rev. ed.1937)).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Plaintiff commenced this action in the Chancery Division seeking relief, including the return of his interest in Linn. We need not decide if his prayers for money damages, his abandonment of the prayers for equitable relief, or his unsuccessful effort to transfer the matter to the Law Division can be considered in sustaining a money judgment had there been a finding of legal fraud. Nor need we decide if the monetary award could be deemed equitable relief incident to a rescission or reformation of the Inmar agreement had plaintiff not abandoned his prayer for equitable relief. We note only that there was no apparent rescission or reformation of the Inmar purchase agreement, as plaintiff retained his investment income from Inmar, and defendants were given the right to \u201cbuy out\u201d plaintiffs minority interest and ordered to pay $100,000 in damages as a result of the equitable fraud. But money damages cannot be awarded for an equitable fraud. \u201cIn an action for equitable fraud, the only relief that may be obtained is equitable relief, such as rescission or reformation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>an agreement and not monetary damages.\u201d <em>Enright v.

The judgment is accordingly reversed with respect thereto. The judgment is otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b613-11\"> The case against the other defendants was dismissed by consent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b617-11\"> There was a $1,250,000 mortgage on the property at the time of the proposal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b618-10\"> The proposal, based on \"gross projected inc[ome]\u201d and \"costs,\u201d was handwritten by Mel.

Plaintiff executed formal typewritten agreements terminating his interest in Linn and purchasing his interest in Inmar.
