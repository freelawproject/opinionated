(FFC) and Miguel Mattei appeal from a summary judgment dismissing their complaint against defendants New Jersey State Department of Labor (DOL), City of Trenton, Lutheran Senior Services, Inc., Circle F Urban Renewal Limited Partnership, and Costanza Contracting Company, Inc. Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint sought a declaration that the Prevailing Wage Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:11-56.25 <em>et seq. </em>(the Act), applies to a construction contract between defendants Circle F and Costanza for construction of a senior citizens housing project funded in part by a grant from the State and to be operated under an agreement between the City and Circle F, in which Lutheran Senior Services is a general partner.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">In their motions for summary judgment and/or to dismiss the complaint, the several defendants challenged plaintiffs\u2019 standing to maintain this action; the jurisdiction of the Law Division to entertain the action; and the applicability of the Act to this construction contract. The Law Division Judge erred in concluding that he had jurisdiction to hear the matter. He also concluded that neither plaintiff had standing to bring this action, but that if either plaintiff did have standing, the Act did not apply. Because we agree that the Act does not apply to this construction contract, we affirm. In light of our disposition on the merits, we need not address the standing issues raised by defendants, and will only briefly address the jurisdictional issue raised by the DOL.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">The background facts are not in dispute. The City of Trenton received a grant of over $1.3 million from the Department of Community Affairs under the Neighborhood Preservation Program, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-320,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> part of the Fair Housing Act, <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:27D-301 <em>et seq., </em>enacted in 1985. The grant was to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>finance the conversion of the Circle F factory building in Trenton into seventy affordable housing units for senior citizens with low to moderate incomes. The grant agreement between the Department of Community Affairs and the City provides for the City to comply with all \u201capplicable\u201d laws, expressly including but not limited to several federal and state financial audit requirements, as well as affirmative action and non-discrimination laws. The grant agreement does not specifically mention the Prevailing Wage Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Lutheran Senior Services, Inc., as general partner, along with several limited partners, formed Circle F Urban Renewal Limited Partnership<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as an \u201curban renewal entity\u201d pursuant to the Long Term Tax Exemption Law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:20-1 <em>et seq. </em>That law, enacted in 1991, consolidated</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-7\">the various statutes under which municipalities may agree with private entities for the private entities to undertake redevelopment projects in return for tax exemptions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-8\">This bill is part of a package of bills that provides a new partnership between the public and private sectors to redevelop and rehabilitate New Jersey\u2019s urban centers, older suburbs, and other communities that are in need of redevelopment. The bills encourage the maximum participation of the private sector in the redevelopment of the State\u2019s distressed communities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-9\">[Senate County and Municipal Govt. Comm. Statement to Senate No. 291, L.1991, c. 431.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">The legislation\u2019s express purpose is in large part \u201cto encourage private capital and participation by private enterprise\u201d in the construction, renovation and rehabilitation of low and moderate income housing. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:20-2, citing the Local Redevelopment and Housing Law, <em>N.J.S.A </em>40A:12A-1 <em>et seq., </em>and expressing the intention that these two acts be construed together.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">The City entered into a developer\u2019s agreement with Circle F for the construction of the project, with Circle F undertaking to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>\u201cdevelop, market, and rent\u201d to senior citizens at substantially less than market rates, ranging from $275 per month for an efficiency apartment to $450 for certain two-bedroom apartments. Circle F contracted with Costanza to perform as the general contractor on the Circle F project.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">FFC holds itself out as a nonprofit corporation whose stated \u201csole and exclusive purpose is to monitor public works projects for compliance with the New Jersey Prevailing Wage Act ... and other relevant state and federal statutes, thereby protecting the workers employed on such projects and the taxpayers whose money is used to finance such projects.\u201d Mattei describes himself as a \u201ccitizen\u201d and \u201ctaxpayer\u201d of the State of New Jersey, who resides in Trenton. FFC sent an investigator to the Circle F project to inquire into Costanza\u2019s compliance with the Act. Although FFC\u2019s investigator apparently was unable to determine whether Costanza was paying the workers employed on the Circle F project the prevailing wage under the Act, it is undisputed that Costanza has not paid all of its employees on this project in accordance with the Act. Costanza maintains that the project \u201cwas let as a non-Prevailing Wage Act project.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">FFC\u2019s investigator then contacted the DOL \u201cregarding defendant Costanza\u2019s obligation to pay prevailing wages to its employees working on the project.\u201d Michael McCarthy, Chief of Enforcement for the DOL\u2019s Wage and Hour Compliance Division, responded by letter, stating that the DOL had been advised by the Attorney General\u2019s office that the Prevailing Wage Act did not apply in the absence of an agreement between a public body and a contractor, and the Act therefore did not apply to the Circle F Project. The Attorney General\u2019s letter opinion cited a prior letter opinion to the DOL in 1990 to the same effect, stating that the Act did not apply to situations where developers received public funds and then entered into separate contracts with developers, notwithstanding the fact that public funds were used to pay for the work. The City of Trenton also had been advised by DOL that the Act did not apply to the project. Counsel to FFC wrote to McCarthy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>asking the DOL to reconsider its position, and McCarthy declined to do so \u201cabsent a declaratory judgment from a court of competent jurisdiction.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">The Prevailing Wage Act provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-7\">Every contract in excess of the prevailing wage contract threshold amount <em>for any public work to which any public body is a party </em>or for public work to be done on property or premises leased or to be leased by a public body shall contain a provision stating the prevailing wage rate which can be paid (as shall be designated by the commissioner) to the workers employed in the performance of the contract and the contract shall contain a stipulation that such workers shall be paid not less than such prevailing wage rate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-8\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>34:11-56.27 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">The \u201cprevailing wage contract threshold\u201d was at all relevant times $9,500. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:11-56.26(11)(a). There is no dispute that the construction contract exceeds this threshold.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">\u201cPublic work\u201d is defined under the Act, in relevant part, as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-11\">... construction, reconstruction, demolition, alteration, or repair work, or maintenance work, including painting and decorating, done under contract and paid for in whole or in part out of the funds of a public body, <em>except work performed under a rehabilitation program.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-12\"><em>[N.J.S.A </em>34:11-56.26(5) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-13\">\u201cPublic body\u201d is defined in relevant part as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay7\">the State of New Jersey, any of its political subdivisions, any authority created by the Legislature of the State of New Jersey and <em>any instrumentality </em>or agency of the State of New Jersey or of any of its political subdivisions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-14\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>34:11-56.26(4) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-15\">Plaintiffs rely on language in the Developer\u2019s Agreement between Trenton and Circle F, requiring Circle F to \u201ccomply with all applicable State, Federal and local laws, rules and regulations, whether because the Developer received the Balanced Housing Funds or otherwise, including but not limited to, any affirmative action and/or prevailing wage laws.\u201d We do not find that language determinative. First, it requires compliance with \u201capplicable\u201d laws; if the Act is not otherwise applicable, this provision does not make it so. Second, the express reference to \u201cany ... prevailing wage laws,\u201d without citing the Act and stating it to be applicable, suggests only that the drafters required Circle F to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>comply with any applicable federal or state prevailing wage law. <em>See, e.g., </em>40 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 276A <em>et seq. </em>(the Davis-Bacon Act).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">The issue presented is whether the agreement between Circle F and Costanza, to which neither the City of Trenton nor the State is literally a party, should nevertheless be construed as a \u201ccontract ... for ... public work to which any public body is a party\u201d and therefore subject to the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Richard\u2019s Auto City, Inc. v. Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>523, 531, 659 A.2d 1360 (1995):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-6\">In the enterprise of statutory construction, the first step is the examination of the provisions of the legislative enactment to ascertain whether they are expressed in plain language that, in accordance with ordinary meaning, clearly and unambiguously yields only one interpretation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">If we were to hold that the Costanza contract with Circle F is subject to the Act, our decision would render meaningless that portion of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:11-56.27 that modifies the phrase \u201c[ejvery contract ... for any public work\u201d with the phrase of limitation \u201cto which any public body is a party.\u201d Had the Legislature intended that every contract for construction of public work be subject to the Prevailing Wage Act, irrespective of the identity of the parties to the contract, there would have been no reason to include in the statute the phrase \u201cto which any public body is a party____\u201d Our Supreme Court has clearly stated that \u201c[a] construction that will render any part of a statute inoperative, superfluous, or meaningless, is to be avoided.\u201d <em>State v. Reynolds, </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>559, 564, 592 A.2d 194 (1991). <em>See also Paper Mill Playhouse v. Millburn Tp., </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>503, 521, 472 A.2d 517 (1984); <em>Central Constrn. Co. v. Horn, </em>179 <em>N.J.Super. </em>95, 101-02, 430 A.2d 939 (App.Div.1981) (\u201cThe Legislature is presumed not to employ meaningless language or to intend useless legislation.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">Any suggestion that this phrase of limitation \u2014 \u201cto which any public body is a party\u201d \u2014 is superfluous is belied by the consistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>repetition of a similar adjective phrase throughout the Act. For example, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:11-56.28 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-5\">The <em>public body </em>or lessor <em>awarding any contract for public work </em>or otherwise undertaking any public work shall ascertain from the commissioner the prevailing wage rate in the locality in which the public work is to be performed for each craft or trade needed to perform the contract____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-7\">[emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">Similarly, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:11-56.29 provides</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-9\">Every contractor and subcontractor shall keep an accurate record ... of wages paid____ The record shall be open at all reasonable hours to the inspection of <em>the public body awarding the </em>contract____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-12\">[emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-13\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:11-56.38 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-14\"><em>The public body awarding any contract for public work, </em>or otherwise undertaking any public work, or entering into a lease or agreement to lease pursuant to which public work is to be done, shall first ascertain from the commissioner the list of names of contractors or subcontractors who have failed to pay prevailing wages</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-15\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-16\">Each of these sections describes \u201cthe public body\u201d by the phrase \u201cawarding [a] contract.\u201d Obviously, a public body cannot \u201caward\u201d a contract to which it is not a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-17\">We recognize a certain ambiguity in the Act\u2019s reference to \u201cthe public body [ ] awarding any contract for public work or <em>otherwise undertaking any public work </em>...\u201d <em>See N.J.S.A </em>34:11-56.28 (requiring a public body to ascertain the prevailing wage and so specify in covered contracts). <em>See also N.J.SA </em>34:11-56.38 (requiring a public body to ascertain the identities of violators and prohibiting for three years an award of any contract for public work to a contractor who has violated the Act). The \u201cotherwise undertaking\u201d language of these sections, examined separately, is subject to the inference that some other involvement of a public body, neither as a party to the contract nor as a lessor of the subject property, could bring the contract within the Act\u2019s coverage. The legislative history does not enlighten us with respect to the phrase \u201cotherwise undertaking.\u201d However, because \u201cawarding\u201d a contract implies a contract for which bids have been received, and not every contract for public work by a public body <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>is subject to bidding, <em>see, e.g., N.J.S.A </em>40A:ll-5, we suspect that the \u201cotherwise undertaking\u201d language was intended to cover such non-bid contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">We have previously recognized that the Prevailing Wage Act is remedial legislation entitled to liberal construction to effectuate the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-5\">public policy of this State to establish a prevailing wage level for workmen engaged in public works in order to safeguard their efficiency and general well being and to protect them as well as their employers from the effects of serious and unfair competition resulting from wage levels detrimental to efficiency and well-being.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-6\">[N.J.S.A 34:11-56.25.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-7\"><em>See Horn v. Serritella Brothers, Inc., </em>190 <em>N.J.Super. </em>280, 463 A.2d 366 (App.Div.1983); <em>see also Central Construction, </em>179 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 104, 430 A.2d 939. Recognizing that purpose, however, does not permit us, much less require us, to ignore the plain language of the statute itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">The Attorney General\u2019s advice to the DOL, in response to plaintiffs\u2019 request for action against Circle F and Costanza, was to cite its 1990 opinion responding to an inquiry from the Chief of the Public Contracts Section concerning the applicability of the Act to three specific projects, each involving \u201ca grant by a public agency to a private entity to assist in the construction of housing\u201d and a construction contract between the private entity and the contractor. One of the three projects specifically involved a contract between the City of Camden and a private developer, financed by a combination of private moneys and a Department of Community Affairs grant, much like the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">In 1990 Attorney General cited the literal language of the statute, then applicable to \u201c[ejvery contract in excess of $2,000 for any public work <em>to which any public body is a </em>party____\u201d and advised:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-12\">The foregoing statutory provision clearly states that the prevailing wage must be paid only where there is a public work contract to which a public body is a party. In the situations presented here, no public body is a party to the construction contracts in question. Instead, the construction contracts are between a private entity and a general contractor. Thus, the plain language of the Prevailing Wage Act indicates that the statute does not apply to the contracts in question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>The fact that the source of the funds for the contracts is a grant from a public body is immaterial. Where the Legislature has intended that the prevailing wage be paid on projects financed by a public body that is not a party to the resulting project, it has stated such intention explicitly. For example, <em>N.J.S.A </em>55:14K-42 expressly states that a housing sponsor granted a loan from the Housing Finance Agency, or any contractor engaged by such housing sponsor, shall pay workmen on any qualified project not less than the prevailing wage rate. Similarly, the Legislature has specifically provided that where a construction contract is undertaken with the financial assistance of the Economic Development Authority, the workers must receive the prevailing wage rate. <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:1B-5.1. Thus, the Legislature has recognized that the Prevailing Wage Act does not cover contracts made between private parties for which financing has been provided by a public agency. In the absence of a clear statutory statement that prevailing wages must be paid in such a situation, there is no basis for ignoring the limitation of <em>N.J.SA </em>34:11-56.27 to contracts to which a public body is a party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">We agree with the Attorney General\u2019s interpretation, which the DOL as well as the Law Division Judge followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">We have also considered whether the chain of contracts, that is, the grant agreement between the Department of Community Affairs and the City, the developer\u2019s agreement between the City and Circle F, and Circle F\u2019s contract with Costanza, makes the construction contract one to which a public body is a party. In other words, should the combined contracts constitute one contract for purposes of applying the Prevailing Wage Act?</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">There is some facial appeal to the concept that these agreements should be viewed as a whole, and Trenton considered a \u201cparty\u201d to the Costanza contract for purposes of the Act. The Long Term Tax Exemption Law, specifically at <em>N.J.S.A </em>40A:20-4, provides in pertinent part that \u201cthe undertaking of a project by an urban renewal entity pursuant to [a redevelopment] plan ... shall be deemed a delegation of the powers of the municipality to undertake the project----\u201d The delegation does not, however, turn the developer into a public body. After careful consideration, we conclude that these contracts are not to be treated as one under current law.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-11\">If the Legislature had intended the Prevailing Wage Act, originally enacted in 1963, to apply to all public works projects without exception, it could have expressed that intention in the subsequently enacted statutes that apply to this project: the Fair Housing Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-301 <em>et seq.; </em>the Neighborhood Housing Services Grant Fund Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-366 <em>et seq.; </em>the Long Term Tax Exemption Law, <em>N.J.S.A </em>40A:20-1 <em>et seq.; </em>and the Local Redevelopment and Housing Law, <em>N.J.S.A </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>40A:12A-1, <em>et seq. </em>Indeed, the Legislature apparently recognized that the Prevailing Wage Act did not by its own terms apply where the public body \u2014 be it the state or a municipality \u2014 conveys funds by grant or loan to an independent entity, which then contracts for construction or other services. Hence the provisions in the Housing and Mortgage Finance Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>55:14K-42,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the Economic Development Act, <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:lb-5.1.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We conclude that the Legislature did not intend the Act to cover contracts such as that between Urban F and Costanza, where the public entity is a conduit for state grant moneys to subsidize the creation of low cost housing, and where higher construction costs would reduce the number of housing units created with that subsidy.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Moreover, the Prevailing Wage Act was amended by L.1990, c. 27, with respect to its scope, to \u201cprovide[] for the payment of prevailing wages for work performed on ... property ... leased or to be leased by a public body whether or not the work is paid for from public funds.\u201d <em>See </em>Sen. Labor, Industry and Professions Committee Statement, Assy No. 2895, L.1990, c.27. That amendment reflects the Legislature\u2019s reexamination and extension of the scope of the Act\u2019s coverage by adding to its definition of covered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>contracts, contracts \u201cfor public work to be done on property or premises leased or to be leased by a public body____\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:ll-56.27.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">That amendment demonstrates the Legislature\u2019s recognition that the Act as previously written would not apply to a contract for public work to which the public body is not a party. It also contributes to our conclusion that the Legislature intends only what the Act\u2019s literal language prescribes. That is, only contracts to which a public body is a party, or for public work leased by a public body, are subject to the Act, absent express legislation placing specific contracts within the Act\u2019s coverage. <em>E.g., N.J.S.A </em>55:14K-42; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:1B-5.1. \u201cThe Legislature is assumed to be thoroughly familiar with its own enactments....\u201d <em>Monaghan v. Holy Trinity Church, </em>275 <em>N.J.Super. </em>594, 602, 646 A.2d 1130 (App.Div.1994). <em>See also Thomas v. Teaneck Bd. of Educ., </em>184 <em>N.J.Super. </em>443, 446 A.2d 547 (App.Div.1982), rejecting the public employees\u2019 claim that their work on public work projects entitled them to the prevailing wage under the Act, and holding the Act applicable only to \u201ccontracts with contractors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 446, 446 A.2d 547.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">While a policy argument can be made in favor of broad application of the Act to all contracts for public works, this court is not the place for such an argument. The Legislature has apparently concluded that the goals expressed in the Fair Housing Act and the Long Term Tax Exemption Law, that is, to provide incentives to bring private developers into partnership with government to create affordable housing in communities around the state; to improve conditions in certain run-down urban areas; and to maintain strict cost controls over such projects, take precedence over the goals of the Prevailing Wage Act. We cannot interfere with that choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">Plaintiffs also contend that summary judgment was premature because plaintiffs were entitled to discovery, including \u201cwhether defendants Lutheran and Circle F Partnership are indeed legitimate entities ... [and] the relationship, if any, between defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Costanza and defendants Lutheran and Circle F Partnership.\u201d That contention is without merit, as the issue before us is solely one of statutory construction. <em>See R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(l)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">With respect to our jurisdiction or that of the Law Division, the DOL contends that its May 6, 1996, response to FFC constitutes a final action of an administrative agency. Because plaintiffs filed a complaint for declaratory judgment in the Law Division eight months after the Department\u2019s decision, instead of filing an appeal with this court, within the forty-five days permitted by <em>R. </em>2:4-1 (or the additional thirty days available pursuant to <em>R. </em>2:4-4), the DOL urges us to affirm the Law Division\u2019s dismissal, but solely for lack of jurisdiction, without addressing plaintiffs\u2019 standing or the merits of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">When FFC requested enforcement of the Act on this project, the DOL responded by letter of April 4, 1996, relating the Attorney General\u2019s advice \u201cthat construction projects being funded in whole or in part with public funds but involve [sic] no contract with any public body do not require payment of wages under the New Jersey Prevailing Wage Act.\u201d The writer suggested that FFC \u201cexplore statutory or regulatory changes that may eliminate this confusion on future publicly funded projects of this nature.\u201d The DOL then effectively invited FFC to bring a declaratory judgment action when it responded to FFC\u2019s request for reconsideration on May 6, 1996, stating that \u201c[a]bsent a declaratory judgment from a court of competent jurisdiction we have no plans to reconsider our administrative policy at this time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">We conclude that DOL\u2019s responses to FFC constituted expressions of its \u201cadministrative policy\u201d and not a final determination. <em>Compare In re Unclaimed Property Office, </em>309 <em>N.J.Super. </em>272, 275 (App.Div.), <em>certif. granted, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>381 (1998). FFC\u2019s challenge to quasi-legislative action therefore was not subject to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>time limits applicable to a final decision pursuant to <em>R. </em>2:4 \u2014 1(b). <em>See </em>Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment 2 to <em>R. </em>2:4-1 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">An appeal from administrative agency action is exclusively cognizable in the Appellate Division. <em>See R. </em>2:2-3(a)(2). Nevertheless, the Law Division Judge had the power to transfer the matter to the Appellate Division and we will regard that done <em>nunc pro tunc. See R. </em>1:13-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">We are satisfied that the substantive issue raised by this appeal is one of public importance that is likely to arise. We therefore conclude that under all the circumstances, the issue warranted our consideration on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">We affirm the dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b470-7\"> The Fair Housing Act was the Legislature's response to the Supreme Court's decisions in <em>Southern Burlington County NAACP </em>v. <em>Mt.
