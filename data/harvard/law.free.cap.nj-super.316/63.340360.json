Hanna and/or Thaer Saliba (\u201cHanna\u201d) appeals from the grant of summary judgment to plaintiff, Progressive Casualty Insurance Company (\u201cProgressive\u201d) in its declaratory judgment action which sought to void <em>ab initio </em>a commercial comprehensive liability insurance policy, wherein Hanna was the named insured.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-13\">The underlying facts raise an issue of first impression. May an insurer void <em>ab initio </em>an insurance policy for which the applicant provides full and true answers yet omits facts about which no inquiry is made when the omitted facts are material to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>the insurer\u2019s determination whether to accept the insurance risk? Stated alternatively, does New Jersey recognize the concept of \u201cconcealment\u201d which has been defined as \u201cthe designed and intentional withholding of any fact material to the risk which the insured in honesty and good faith ought to communicate to the insurer\u201d? 7 <em>Am. Jur.2d </em>\u00a7 65; 43 <em>Am.Jur.2d </em>\u00a7 1003. Although the motion judge did not specifically discuss the concept of \u201cconcealment,\u201d he implicitly implied it when he granted summary judgment to plaintiff. We disagree and reverse. We conclude that an insurer may not rescind <em>ab initio </em>a policy of comprehensive liability insurance on the basis of an applicant\u2019s failure to disclose a material fact, when the insurer fails to ask the insurance applicant questions designed to elicit a material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">Hanna resided with his family in Uniondale, Long Island, as a teenager. When he turned sixteen, Hanna, desirous of entering New York bars, purchased from a private citizen a bogus New York driver\u2019s license bearing his photograph and the name \u201cThaer Saliba,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and designating his age as twenty-one. The license was not issued by the New York Division of Motor Vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">Hanna stated in his pre-trial discovery deposition that in 1980 or 1981, after moving to New Jersey, he applied for a New Jersey driver\u2019s license, using the bogus New York driver\u2019s license to establish his entitlement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A New Jersey driver\u2019s license was issued to Hanna under the name \u201cThaer Saliba.\u201d The Division of Motor Vehicles suspended that license in 1982 or 1983 because of his numerous driving infractions and his subsequent failure to pay motor vehicle fines and motor vehicle surcharges. The \u201cSaliba\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>license was reinstated, but in 1984, it was suspended again.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Hanna testified that between 1984 and 1992 he operated a motor vehicle without a driver\u2019s license.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">On an undetermined date in 1992, Hanna, using his real name, applied for and was issued a New Jersey driver\u2019s license bearing number H0447 73572 08632 and the name \u201cThaer Hanna.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">On October 24, 1994, Hanna completed an application for comprehensive liability insurance at the offices of Hanna\u2019s insurance broker, the AAAA Insurance Agency. The broker submitted Hanna\u2019s application to the New Jersey Commercial Automobile Insurance Plan (\u201cCAIP\u201d), a program which provides coverage for owners of commercial vehicles unable to procure insurance through the voluntary market. CAIP operates pursuant to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>17:29D-1 and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3-1.1 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">Section 3 of the rules promulgated by CAIP provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>No applicant shall be qualified if the principal operator of the automobile to be insured does not hold a valid driver\u2019s license which is valid in this state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Section 9 of the CAIP rules provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-7\">A prospective insured ... shall be considered for assignment upon making application in good faith to the Plan. A prospective insured shall be considered in good faith if he reports all information of a material nature, and does not willfully make incorrect or misleading statements, in the prescribed application form, or does not within any of the prohibitions or exclusions listed below. A prospective insured shall not be entitled to automobile insurance nor shall any Service Carrier be required to afford insurance if any person who usually drives the motor vehicle does not hold or is not eligible to obtain an operator\u2019s license____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">In his application, Hanna identified himself as both \u201cApplicant\u201d and \u201cRegistered Owner,\u201d and listed his correct address and occupation. Question 3 in the application asked for \u201cOperator Information, Names of Owners, Employees and Relatives who will operate owned autos.\u201d Hanna provided his name \u2014 \u201cThaer Hanna\u201d; his date of birth \u2014 \u201c8/5/63\u201d; and his \u201cDriver\u2019s License No. &amp; State\u201d as \u201cH0447 73572 08632,\u201d the number on his \u201cHanna\u201d license. The vehicle for which insurance was requested was a 1990 Ford Eco-150 Van. Hanna requested combined single limit insurance coverage of $35,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">Above Hanna\u2019s signature was a preprinted affirmation, providing in pertinent part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-10\">I declare and certify that: ... (2) To the best of my knowledge and belief that all statements contained in this application are ture [sic] and that these statements are offered as an inducement to the servicing carrier to issue the policy for which I am applying. (3) I realize that any misleading information or failure to disclose required information will be considered lack of good faith on my part and may void the application or cause cancellation of my coverage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-11\">Hanna\u2019s insurance application was submitted to CAIP, who assigned it to Progressive as a servicing carrier. A policy of insurance was thereafter issued and was effective on May 31,1995, when Hanna was involved in an automobile accident injuring Mikolski.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> An ensuing police investigation<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> revealed that Hanna <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>had previously applied for and was issued a New Jersey driver\u2019s license under the name \u201cThaer Saliba,\u201d and that Hanna, without disclosing the revocation of the \u201cSaliba\u201d license, thereafter applied for and received a New Jersey driver\u2019s license under the name \u201cThaer Hanna.\u201d On his application to the Division of Motor Vehicles for the \u201cHanna\u201d license, he responded \u201cno\u201d to the question: \u201cIs your driving privilege now suspended in any state?\u201d In his deposition, Hanna was asked: \u201cDid you ever state verbally or in writing when you applied for your license under the name Thaer Hanna that you had previously possessed a license issued to Thaer Saliba which was suspended?\u201d Hanna responded, \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">It is apparent from the record that Progressive initially provided Hanna with a defense to an action in the Law Division commenced by Mikolski. When it learned of Hanna\u2019s driver\u2019s license status, it filed a separate declaratory judgment action to declare its policy void <em>ab initio. </em>In granting summary judgment, the motion judge concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-7\">It is undisputed that defendant Hanna possessed a suspended driver\u2019s license. Defendant Hanna argues that the insurance agent did not inquire as to whether his driver\u2019s license was suspended. Further, this defendant argues that he possessed a valid New Jersey driver\u2019s license and this license was not suspended at the time he applied for the liability insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-8\">It is irrelevant, however, that Hanna\u2019s New Jersey-issued driver\u2019s license was not suspended at the time of the accident. The central issue, which Hanna fails to state, is that the driver\u2019s license issued in the name of \"Thaer Saliba\u201d was suspended because of several driving infractions. These included citations for driving under the influence of liquor/drugs and speeding. In fact, defendant Hanna had received three previous citations for driving during his suspension period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-9\">Clearly, defendant Hanna knew that his driver\u2019s license and, thus, his driving privileges were suspended. In presenting his second driver\u2019s license to the plaintiff, defendant Hanna willfully misrepresented the fact that he was a valid New Jersey driver and as such the policy should be declared void <em>ab initio.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">Based on <em>Fisher v. New Jersey Auto. Full Ins., </em>224 <em>N.J.Super. </em>552, 558, 540 A.2d 1344 (App.Div.1988), and <em>Marotta v. NJAFIUA, </em>280 <em>N.J.Super. </em>525, 532, 656 A.2d 20 (App.Div.1995), the judge found that Progressive is obligated to the injured third parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>(the Mikolskis) to the extent of Hanna\u2019s mandatory insurance liability, or $15,000, and that Progressive is entitled to seek that amount in indemnity from Hanna. The judge added: \u201cAny claim in excess of the $15,000 is subject to the defense that the insurance policy was declared void <em>ab initio.\u201d </em>Hanna\u2019s subsequent motion for reconsideration was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">On appeal, Hanna argues that the motion judge improperly concluded that his insurance policy with Progressive was void <em>ab initio </em>because \u201cit is clear from a review of the application and from defendant\u2019s certification and exhibits ... .that [Hanna] answered all the questions on the application for insurance completely and truthfully.\u201d Hanna contends that when he applied for insurance with CAIP he was unaware of the CAIP rules and \u201cwas never asked if his driver\u2019s license was suspended\u201d or if he was ever known by a name other than \u201cThaer Hanna.\u201d He also contends that his New Jersey driver\u2019s license under the name \u201cThaer Hanna\u201d is indeed valid, regardless of the suspension of his driving privileges under the name \u201cThaer Saliba,\u201d and \u201cthat a person suspended is not necessarily an ineligible applicant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">We concede that the motion judge\u2019s conclusion on first blush correctly concluded that Hanna should not benefit from his fraudulent misrepresentation nor should Progressive be required to insure a risk it would ordinarily have rejected but for the fraudulent misrepresentation. Although not cited, it is clear that the judge was influenced by a long-recognized concept that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-8\">Broadly speaking, it has always been considered that policies of insurance are contracts of the utmost good faith, and the applicant therefore is bound to deal fairly with the disclosure of facts material to the risk,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AiQ\"><em>[Locicero v. John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>32 <em>N.J.Super. </em>300, 306, 108 A.2d 281 (App.Div.1954) (citing <em>Atlantic Casualty Ins. Co. v. Interstate Ins. Co., </em>28 <em>N.J.Super. </em>81, 85, 100 A.2d 192 (App.Div.1953)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">The Supreme Court has fully recognized this obligation and has repeatedly stated in other contexts that \u201cthe prospective insured must not misrepresent or conceal information concerning risks entailed in coverage under an insurance policy.\u201d <em>Sears Mortgage Corp. v. Rose, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>326, 347, 634 A.2d 74 (1993) (citing <em>Massachusetts Mut. v. Manzo, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>104, 584 A.2d 190 (1991); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number><em>Longobardi v. Chubb Ins. Co., </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>530, 582 A.2d 1257 (1990); Appelman, 12A Insurance <em>and Practice </em>\u00a7 7271, at 302 (1981)). Thus the Court has heretofore recognized the insured\u2019s obligation when asked a specific question in the insurance application, to respond truthfully. That is not the precise issue here, where we are confronted with a truthful answer to questions asked on an application that does not elicit material facts to guide the prospective insurer\u2019s decision to accept or reject the prospective risk.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Although the obligation of a prospective insured to truthfully answer questions posed by a prospective insurer is well-recognized, we have had occasion to deviate from this standard where a prospective insurer fails to ask an insurance applicant pertinent questions material to its decision to accept the prospective risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">In <em>Catton v. Ins. Underwriting Ass\u2019n., </em>242 <em>N.J.Super. 5, </em>576 A.2d 1 (App.Div.1990), we were called upon to determine whether an insurer could void <em>ab initio </em>an automobile liability policy where the applicant failed to disclose that the automobile which he sought to insure was not registered in New Jersey, a prerequisite to being a \u201cqualified applicant\u201d within the definitional purview of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:30E-1 <em>et seq., </em>the New Jersey Automobile Full Insurance Availability Act (commonly referred to as \u201cJUA\u201d), and specifically <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:30E-3(m). The issue in <em>Catton </em>was presented on a motion pursuant to stipulated facts. <em>Id. </em>at 8, 576 A.2d 1. The issue presented was whether the insurance company may rescind, rather than cancel, an insurance policy where the insured was not a qualified applicant. The trial court found no misrepresentation on the application as to the vehicle\u2019s registration. The parties stipulated that the vehicle was not registered in New Jersey. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">We noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-8\">[I]t is undisputed for the purpose of this opinion that any and all questions asked of plaintiffs when applying for the insurance policy were answered honestly. More<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>over, neither the JUA, State Farm nor JUA\u2019s approved broker, R.S.A. Brokerage, ever inquired into where the subject automobile was registered. In addition, the policy itself does not make any reference to the statutory definition of qualified applicant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-5\"><em>[Id. </em>at 9, 576 A.2d 1 (footnote omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Our opinion in <em>Cation </em>reviewed the legislative history of <em>N.J.S.A </em>17:30E-1 <em>et seq., </em>and we concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-7\">Clearly, the legislative statement and the statutory provision when read together place the burden on the JUA, through its servicing carriers, to ascertain whether the applicant meets the qualifying provisions of the statute. Obviously, this can only be done through the application process. The servicing carrier, State Farm, failed to make the necessary inquiry in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-8\">[7d at 10, 576 A.2d 1.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">Here, the application for insurance simply asked Hanna for his name, address, age, and driver\u2019s license number. The application did not ask if the driver\u2019s license was valid or validly obtained. Additionally, it failed to ask whether the applicant had ever been licensed in this state or any other state under another name, or whether Hanna\u2019s license issued under any name had ever been suspended or revoked. Any or all of these questions, if answered honestly, would have revealed facts material to Progressive in its determination whether to accept the insurance risk. Moreover, had Hanna answered falsely, Progressive would have been entitled, based on defendant\u2019s affirmation, <em>supra, </em>to cancel the coverage.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As noted in <em>Harr v. Allstate Ins. Co., 54 N.J. </em>287, 255 A.2d 208 (1969), an insurer must obtain</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AsC\">through its representatives all information pertinent to the risk and the desired coverage before the contract is issued; and that it is likewise its obligation to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>policy provisions, especially those related to coverage, exclusions and vital conditions, plain, clear and prominent to the laymen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 304, 255 A.2d 208].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Although Hanna failed to truthfully answer questions posed to him by the New Jersey Division of Motor Vehicles when he obtained his current license, Progressive does not cite any authority that declares a license issued pursuant to a dishonest application for licensure as void <em>per se. </em>The question as to the validity or invalidity of Hanna\u2019s current license issued to him under his legal name is not specifically before us, however, we note that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-37 deems defendant\u2019s license voidable and not void.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">We appreciate Progressive\u2019s position, that Hanna obtained insurance coverage by failing to disclose a material fact which surely would have affected Progressive\u2019s decision whether to accept the insurance risk. However, we conclude that Progressive incurred the insurance risk because it neglected to ask the pertinent questions which, if answered truthfully, would have induced it not to accept the risk or, if answered falsely, would have relieved it of its obligation to provide a defense and indemnity.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As we have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>noted, Progressive never asked Hanna if the New Jersey driver\u2019s license issued to him under his legal name was a valid license. It merely asked him for the number of his driver\u2019s license. On these facts, the motion judge clearly erred when he concluded: \u201cIn presenting his second driver\u2019s license to the plaintiff, defendant Hanna willfully misrepresented the fact that he was a <em>valid </em>New Jersey driver and as such the policy should be declared void <em>ab initio </em>\u201d (emphasis added). Defendant simply made no representation as to the validity or invalidity of his driver\u2019s license; he was not questioned about the history of his licensure.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Hanna clearly omitted material facts as to the status of his license, but did not misrepresent the fact that he was a <em>valid </em>New Jersey driver. Progressive\u2019s failure to gather all material information pertinent to its decision to accept or reject the insurance risk should not benefit plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">This view seems to be recognized in other jurisdictions. As noted in 43 <em>Am Jur. </em>2d \u00a7 1008:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-8\">If the insurer propounds questions to the applicant and he makes full and true answers, the applicant is not answerable for an omission to mention the existence of other facts about which no inquiry is made of him, although they may turn out to be material for the insurer to know in taking the risk.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-9\"><em>See National Aviation Underwriters, Inc. v. Fischer, </em>386 F.2d 582 (8th Cir.1967) (\u201cabsent fraud an applicant\u2019s failure to disclose facts about which no questions were asked will not avoid the policy\u201d); <em>H.B. Singer, Inc. v. Mission National Ins. Co., </em>223 A.D.2d 372, 636 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>316 (App.Div.1996) (assuming materiality, nondisclosure of a fact which was not asked does not ordinarily void an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>insurance policy absent intent to defraud); <em>Mulvihill v. American Annuity Life Ins. Co., </em>121 <em>Mich.App. </em>192, 328 N.W.2d 402 (Mich.Ct.App.1983) (holding insurance applicant is under no obligation to disclose health information about the insured because the insurance company did not request the information).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Our conclusion fully comports with the general principles that insurance policies are contracts of adhesion, construed favorably to the insured, and all ambiguities are resolved in favor of coverage. <em>Princeton Ins. Co. v. Chunmuang, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>80, 87-88, 698 A.2d 9 (1997) (citing <em>Sparks v. St. Paul Ins. Co., </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>325, 334-39, 495 A.2d 406 (1985)). This seems particularly so where, as here, the rights of innocent parties who have sustained injuries will be affected by recision <em>ab initio.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b94-14\"> Plaintiff's complaint also sought: (a) to disclaim any responsibility to defend Hanna or provide indemnity for a personal injury claim then pending in the Law Division, Somerset County, wherein Robert J. Mikolski and Patricia Mikolski (collectively \u201cMikolski\u201d), suing <em>per quod, </em>are plaintiffs and Hanna is defendant, and also to limit its indemnity responsibility for any sum awarded Mikolski in excess of $15,000 per person or $30,000 per accident; and (b) to require Hanna to \u201creimburse Progressive for any amount paid to [Mikolski] ... in settlement or as a result of a jury verdict within 30 days of any such payment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b95-9\"> At his deposition, Hanna indicated that the name \"Saliba\u201d was a family name which was used on his initial immigration papers and on his green card when he moved to the United States with his family.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b95-10\"> Hanna specifically denied being required to take a driving test in New Jersey and could not recall if he took a written pre-licensure test.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b96-10\"><em> </em>Hanna testified that, although he had resolved all outstanding summonses issued to him under the \u201cSaliba\u201d license, that as of the date of his deposition, he was still paying Division of Motor Vehicle surcharges levied in conjunction with numerous motor vehicle violations attributable to his use of the \"Saliba\u201d license.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b96-14\"> The record on appeal would contradict Hanna\u2019s assertion. A certified abstract of the driver\u2019s license record of Thaer Saliba indicates that Hanna, using the \"Saliba\u201d license, was issued a summons on July 26, 1990 for violating <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-40, for operating a motor vehicle with a suspended driver\u2019s license and on March 3, 1990 for a violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-98, for speeding fifty-four miles per hour in a forty miles per hour zone.

The distinction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>is obvious. In <em>Bidnick, </em>the application answered a material question falsely. In <em>Cotton, </em>the applicant was not asked any question as to the place where the automobile was registered.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b102-10\"> <em>NJ.S.A. </em>39:3-37 states that:</p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">A person who gives a fictitious name or address or makes any other intentional misstatement of a material fact in his application for registration of a motor vehicle or driver's license or in a preliminary application, examination or proceeding, or a person who knowingly sells, loans or gives an identification document to another person for the purpose of aiding that person to obtain a driver\u2019s license or registration certificate for which that person is not qualified, shall be subject to a fine of not less than $200.00 or more than $500.00, or imprisonment for not more than 6 months or both, at the discretion of the court.
