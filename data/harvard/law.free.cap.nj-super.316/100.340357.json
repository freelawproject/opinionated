The defense was expressly noted as a separate defense in the answer, answers to interrogatories, and in correspondence between defense counsel and plaintiffs former attorney.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In any event, as we will further develop, the merits of the statute of limitations defense in a case such as this, involving the discovery rule, depend upon the unique facts of the case regarding when the cause of action \u201caccrued.\u201d The factual issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>can generally be resolved only after discovery is completed. For that reason, the statute of limitations, at least if asserted as an affirmative defense, may be addressed in a \u201cdiscovery rule\u201d case just before trial \u201cat a preliminary hearing and out of the presence of the jury.\u201d <em>See Lopez v. Swyer, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>267, 275, 300 A.2d 563 (1973). <em>Cf. Williams v. Bell Tel. Lab. Inc., </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>109, 118-20, 623 A.2d 234 (1993); <em>Fees v. Trow, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>330, 335, 521 A.2d 824 (1987); <em>O\u2019Connor v. Altus, </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>106, 115-16, 335 A.2d 545 (1975) (not involving the \u201cdiscovery rule\u201d). The preferable practice, however, would be for a defendant to file a timely notice pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:46, thereby allowing the plaintiff and the court to consider whether and when a <em>Lopez </em>hearing would be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">After a <em>Lopez </em>hearing, the trial judge concluded \u201cthat the statute of limitations bars this action because the complaint was filed more than two years after the plaintiff knew of a potential cause of action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Only plaintiff testified at the hearing. According to plaintiff, she first went to defendant on January 25,1988 \u201cexperiencing pain in the upper left side of her mouth.\u201d Defendant \u201cremoved her bridge and inserted a new bridge.\u201d The next month defendant \u201cperformed root canal work on a tooth (# 15) associated with the bridge,\u201d but could not find the \u201cdistal buccal canal,\u201d and about five months later, \u201cpermanently recemented [her] bridge.\u201d Plaintiff was not referred to a specialist.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">In December 1988, as a result of plaintiffs concern \u201cthat her front tooth was starting to overlap the tooth next to it,\u201d defendant commenced orthodontic treatment on plaintiff. \u201cPlaintiff complained to Dr. Mully throughout her treatment of problems including pain in her jaw and the opening of her bite, and protruding cuspids, etc.\u201d She asserts, however, that while \u201cshe began to believe that Dr. Mully may have done something wrong or made a mistake in view of what was happening,\u201d \u201c[i]t wasn\u2019t until July-August 1990 when plaintiff finally learned that Dr. Mully indeed had maltreated her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>In June 1989, plaintiff consulted Dr. Langer because she \u201cthought [Dr. Mully] might have made a mistake and [she] wanted to see if another orthodontist thought he was making a mistake.\u201d She wanted a second opinion because defendant insisted her teeth would eventually \u201csettle back into place\u201d and she \u201chad doubts\u201d as to what defendant was saying. She even thought he \u201cwas doing something wrong\u201d in the treatment. According to plaintiff, Dr. Langer asked whether her visit related to litigation, and despite her negative response, he said \u201che did not want to get involved.\u201d According to plaintiff, Dr. Langer advised plaintiff \u201cto go back to Dr. Mully and to let him complete his job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Plaintiff subsequently visited a Dr. Halpern who gave her similar advice. Dr. Halpern, however, told plaintiff \u201che didn\u2019t handle TMJ problems\u201d and suggested she might want to see a TMJ-orthodontic specialist. Plaintiff thereafter consulted a Dr. Rosenbloom, whom she saw because she \u201cstill felt that Dr. Mully did something wrong.\u201d In her depositions, plaintiff admitted she believed defendant was \u201cgetting in deeper and deeper and he really didn\u2019t know himself what was happening.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In order to avoid producing her dental records, which would have required telling Dr. Rosenbloom she was seeking another opinion, plaintiff told Dr. Rosenbloom that her dentist had died. Dr. Rosenbloom advised plaintiff that he could not \u201chelp [her] out\u201d without seeing \u201call the molds, x-rays [and dental] records.\u201d It is not clear from the record when plaintiff visited Dr. Halpern or Dr. Rosenbloom.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">In July 1990, plaintiff visited Dr. Fisher for another \u201copinion,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> because she still felt defendant \u201chad done something wrong.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>Plaintiff admittedly lied to Dr. Fisher about the name of her dentist and additionally stated that he had been deceased for five years, so that she would not have to provide Dr. Fisher with her dental records. Plaintiff contends that it was not until meeting with Dr. Fisher that she \u201cfinally learned that Dr. Mully indeed had maltreated her.\u201d She further asserts that it was not until March of 1992, when she consulted an expert for purposes of litigation, that she learned that defendant committed \u201cmalpractice not only in the orthodontal work,\u201d but also with respect to the earlier bridge and root canal work.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">At the end of the <em>Lopez </em>hearing, the trial judge concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-7\">Prior to her going to Dr. Langer in June of 1989 she knew something was wrong. She had a feeling that he had made a mistake. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-8\">She states that she went on to seek further opinion with regard to a second opinion to help her as to the condition of her mouth. I don\u2019t believe that for one second. I believe she was looking for some support in a claim against the defendant in this case and I\u2019ll tell you why: ... She wasn\u2019t seeking reassurance that Dr. Mully was doing the right thing. She was seeking reassurance and support for her claim that he was doing the wrong thing. There is no doubt in my mind that she knew or should have known at the time in June of 1989.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-9\">She is tailoring her story after she has been advised of what the situation is with regard to the statute of limitations. ... Her testimony in her deposition is more forthright____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-10\">Under the circumstances because no one would reassure her when she says she was going for reassurance which I don\u2019t believe for one moment based upon when I saw her face-to-face on the witness stand and things like that, that wasn\u2019t what she was looking for at all. She was looking for someone who would support her in her claim against Dr. Mully at that point because of the fact that it took four tries. Reassurance doesn\u2019t take four tries. If the first one reassurfes] you to go back and do it again, that\u2019s what reassurance would be. She didn\u2019t accept that. She went to the second, she went to the third, she went to the fourth, and finally wound up lying ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-11\">Under those circumstances there\u2019s no doubt in my mind that the cause of action had accrued by June of 1989 when she knew, she actually knew, she felt in her mind that he had done it wrong, that he had made some mistakes. She said that, she said he made mistakes, she said she was aware in 1989 that he made mistakes, she certainly was aware that it was him, and she certainly was aware that she was having problems. Under those circumstances the statute ran in June of 1991. Now, the case wasn\u2019t filed until about ten months after that and the claim is barred by the statute of limitations. Complaint dismissed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Our Supreme Court recently revisited the discovery rule in the context of a medical malpractice case in <em>Baird v. American Medical Optics, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>54, 713 A.2d 1019 (1998). Much in <em>Baird </em>would appear to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">As <em>Baird </em>pointed out, \u201c[t]he discovery rule delays the accrual of a cause of action [only] until \u2018the injured party discovers, or by an exercise of reasonable diligence and intelligence should have discovered that he may have a basis for an actionable claim.\u2019\u201d <em>Baird, supra, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>at 66, 713 A.2d 1019, (quoting <em>Lopez, supra, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>at 272, 300 A.2d 563). \u201cThe discovery rule prevents the statute of limitations from running when injured parties reasonably are unaware that they have been injured, or, although aware of an injury, do not know that the injury is attributable to the fault of another.\u201d <em>Baird, supra, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>at 66, 713 A.2d 1019, (citing <em>Tevis v. Tevis, 79 N.J. </em>422, 432, 400 A.2d 1189 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">In <em>Baird </em>defendant ophthalmologist operated on plaintiff in 1983, and plaintiff left defendant\u2019s care on August 9, 1984. <em>Id. </em>at 58, 62, 713 A.2d 1019. In view of plaintiffs complaints and condition after the surgery \u201cBaird knew at least by 1985 of facts that would have alerted a reasonable person that her eye injuries were possibly, if not probably, caused by the fault of another,\u201d and attributable to the surgery. <em>Id. </em>at 68, 713 A.2d 1019. The fact that Baird\u2019s cause of action was based on a claim of informed consent, premised on learning in 1991 that the intraocular lens implanted in 1983 was an experimental device, did not permit a delay in the accrual of her cause of action because of her earlier awareness \u201cthat she had sustained damages as the result of the fault of an identifiable person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 69, 713 A.2d 1019.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">In the case before us, however, the record does not reflect precisely when plaintiff sought the opinions of Dr. Halpem and Dr. Rosenbloom, and she saw Dr. Fisher within two years of filing her complaint. Dr. Fisher rendered a report with \u201crecommendations\u201d for future orthodontic treatment dated July 30, 1990. Although the trial judge referred to plaintiffs knowledge by the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>she consulted Dr. Langer, there is no contest, for present purposes, that he told her \u201cto go back to Dr. Mully and to let him complete his job.\u201d According to plaintiff, Dr. Halpern told her the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">More significantly, it is not contested before us that defendant treated plaintiff until November 21, 1990. Defendant\u2019s treatment chart for plaintiff reflects that defendant treated plaintiff at least once every month in 1989 and eight times in 1990. This is not a case where plaintiff returned to defendant\u2019s office once or twice for purposes of elongating the statute of limitations. Rather, it is a case involving ongoing regular treatment less than two years before the complaint was filed. According to plaintiff, during the root canal treatment, defendant told her that the pain \u201ccould go away and God would take care of that.\u201d He also told her while doing the orthodontic work that \u201c[t]he teeth would settle in.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">In this case, as in <em>Abboud v. Viscomi, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>56, 543 A.2d 29 (1988), \u201c[t]he trial court treated as dispositive plaintiffs admissions that she felt something had gone wrong and promptly had questioned defendant\u2019s handling [of her case], concluding that such knowledge constituted discovery of her cause of action against defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 61, 543 A.2d 29. In <em>Abboud, </em>the Supreme Court accepted</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-7\">for purposes of [its] decision both the court\u2019s finding that while still under his care plaintiff suspected defendant had done something wrong, and its implicit judgment that such suspicion satisfied the requirement that in order for a claim to accrue, the plaintiff actually or constructively knew her injury was due to another\u2019s fault or neglect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-8\"><em>[Abboud, supra, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>at 63, 543 A.2d 29.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">However, the Supreme Court disagreed \u201cwith the conclusion that these findings precluded consideration of the relationship, if any, between defendant\u2019s representations and plaintiffs delay in commencing the action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 63, 543 A.2d 29. It emphasized that \u201c[t]he discovery rule is essentially a rule of equity\u201d and that \u201cthe decision on when a claim accrued requires \u2018more than [ ] simple factual determination[s].\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 63-64, 543 A.2d 29 (quoting <em>Lopez, supra, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>at 273, 275, 300 A.2d 563). <em>See also Savage </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number><em>v. Old Bridge-Sayreville Medical Group, P.A., </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>241, 250, 633 A.2d 514 (1993) (remanding for a hearing as to when plaintiff \u201cwas aware of or should have been aware of the facts that would suggest to a reasonable person exercising ordinary diligence that the conduct of a third party may have caused her injurious condition and that the conduct was possibly lacking in due care.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">In <em>Abboud </em>the Supreme Court remanded for further proceedings to \u201cevaluate or weigh [plaintiff\u2019s] claim that defendant\u2019s various representations reasonably induced her not to sue within the normal limitations period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 64, 543 A.2d 29. The plaintiff there \u201capparently did not consider a transient injury important enough to seek damages, despite the various uncomfortable symptoms she was experiencing,\u201d and \u201c[t]he evidence strongly implie[d] that plaintiffs assumption that she would eventually recover was inspired solely by defendant\u2019s various explanations and representations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 65, 543 A.2d 29. <em>See also Lynch v. Rubacky, </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>65, 424 A.2d 1169 (1981), in which the Supreme Court reinstated a complaint that had been dismissed because it was not filed within two years of \u201cplaintiffs initial consultation\u201d with a second orthopedic surgeon who she saw because \u201cplaintiff ... sensed that something was \u2018wrong\u2019 with her ankle and was \u2018dissatisfied\u2019 with her treatment\u201d and surgery performed by the first. <em>Id. </em>at 74-75, 424 A.2d 1169. The second surgeon \u201cdid nothing in the initial course of his treatment of [plaintiff] to discredit or cast [defendant] in a professionally unfavorable light,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 76, 424 A.2d 1169, and did not do so for another three months (after he performed another operation) which was within two years of the filing of the complaint. <em>Id. </em>at 77-78, 424 A.2d 1169.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">We do not suggest that the accrual of a cause of action must await receipt of an expert opinion that the potential defendant was negligent. <em>See Baird v. American Medical Optics, supra, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>at 68, 713 A.2d 1019; <em>Burd v. New Jersey Tel. Co., </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>284, 291-92, 386 A.2d 1310 (1978). However, like <em>Abboud </em>and <em>Lynch, </em>this case involves continued treatment after plaintiff be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>came dissatisfied with the results of a practitioner\u2019s performance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Dr. Langer told plaintiff to return to defendant\u2019s care in 1989, and the record does not suggest plaintiff was given contrary advice prior to April 29, 1990, two years before the complaint was filed. In these circumstances, the trial judge must consider the impact of plaintiffs continued treatment with the defendant in determining when the cause of action accrued.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">In <em>Abboud </em>the Supreme Court remanded for \u201ca new <em>Lopez </em>hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 58, 543 A.2d 29. In reversing the judgment of dismissal in this case, we do not preclude defendant from seeking a further <em>Lopez </em>hearing at which the timing of plaintiffs visits to Doctors Halpem and Rosenbloom may be pursued, together with the nature of plaintiffs discussions with them and with defendant. In essence, we conclude that the <em>Lopez </em>hearing may have been incomplete, perhaps because, as plaintiffs counsel insists, she \u201cwas caught by surprise\u201d by defendant\u2019s request for same \u201cright before jury selection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">The judgment is reversed, and the matter is remanded to the Law Division for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. No costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b132-11\"> Defense counsel advised plaintiff\u2019s attorney in a letter about settlement, over three years before the <em>Lopez </em>hearing, that there was a statute of limitations issue because plaintiff \"stated in her deposition that she knew the defendant did something wrong in June 1989.\u201d In response plaintiff\u2019s attorney expressed the belief \"that plaintiff will prevail on any motion you raise claiming a statute of limitations problem.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b134-7\"> Unfortunately the timing of plaintiff's visits to Doctors Halpern and Rosenbloom was not developed at the <em>Lopez </em>hearing nor in the briefs. It was understandably insignificant in the trial judge's opinion, because he concluded that the cause of action had accrued by the time she visited Dr. Langer in June 1989. According to plaintiff's deposition, she saw Dr. Halpern and Dr. Rosenbloom in the year <em>1990, </em>but no specific dates were given.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b134-8\"> The date is taken from plaintiff's deposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b139-8\"> Neither party cites <em>Abboud </em>or <em>Lynch. </em>Plaintiff, however, refers to her deposition where she testified that defendant told her \u201c[a]s soon as we\u2019re through with the retainer, your teeth will settle back into place.\u201d In her reply brief before us, plaintiff insists that \u201cdefendant's constant assurances made her unsure and she continued his treatment especially since Dr. Langer told her to return to her dentist.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
