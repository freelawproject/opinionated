Pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.1a (L. 1995, c. 126), entitled the \u201cPersistent Offenders Accountability Act\u201d and popularly known as the \u201cThree Strikes and You\u2019re In\u201d law, the court sentenced defendant to life imprisonment without eligibility for parole for first degree robbery. In addition, the court sentenced defendant to a concurrent five year term, with two-and-one-half years of parole ineligibility, for terroristic threats. The court merged defendant\u2019s other convictions into his conviction for robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">On appeal defendant makes the following arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-9\">I. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FAILING TO MERGE THE DEFENDANT\u2019S CONVICTIONS UNDER <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-3 (TERRORISTIC THREATS), WITH HIS CONVICTIONS UNDER <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2CH5-1 (ROBBERY). (Not Raised Below).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-10\">II. THE DEFENDANT\u2019S CONVICTIONS MUST BE REVERSED, SINCE THE JURY\u2019S VERDICTS WERE AGAINST THE WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE. (Not Raised Below).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-11\">III. DEFENDANT\u2019S SENTENCE WAS MANIFESTLY EXCESSIVE AND CONSTITUTIONALLY IMPERMISSIBLE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-12\">Defendant\u2019s argument that the jury\u2019s verdicts were against the weight of the evidence is without merit and does not require discussion. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-13\">We reject defendant\u2019s challenges to the constitutionality of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.1a substantially for the reasons set forth in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Judge Riva\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Oliver, </em>298 <em>N.J.Super. </em>588, 548-54, 689 A.2d 876 (Law Div.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">Finally, we agree with defendant\u2019s argument that his conviction for terroristic threats should have been merged into his conviction for first degree robbery. <em>See State v. Pyron, </em>202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>502, 505, 495 A.2d 467 (App.Div.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">We remand for the entry of an amended judgment of conviction under which defendant\u2019s conviction for terroristic threats is merged into his conviction for robbery and as thus amended we affirm defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
