On September 29, 1992, petitioner and two other police officers executed a warrant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>for the search of a motel room for drugs and drug paraphernalia. After being voluntarily admitted into the room, the officers gave a copy of the warrant to a female suspect. The suspect, who appeared to be under the influence of drugs, became very belligerent,^-yelling, calling the officers vulgar names, making threats, and refusing to sit down while the officers conducted the search. When the suspect continued this conduct for some period of time, the officers told her she was under arrest, and directed her to put her hands behind her back. However, the suspect refused. As a result, petitioner reached out to grab her, but she resisted by biting the middle finger on his left hand and locking it in her mouth. Petitioner was unable to extricate his finger from the suspect\u2019s grasp, and as he was struggling with her, he twisted his left shoulder. Petitioner then grabbed the suspect\u2019s hair and pulled himself away from her. As the petitioner yanked his finger out of the suspect\u2019s mouth, he stumbled over debris on the floor and crashed into a nearby wall, severely injuring the same shoulder he had previously twisted while struggling with the suspect. The other two officers eventually subdued the suspect and completed their search which revealed cocaine and drug paraphernalia.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Petitioner had.surgery on his left shoulder shortly after this incident and continued to work as a police officer for several more years. However, this surgery did not adequately repair the damage to his shoulder, and he had to have additional surgery in 1995.- This surgery also failed to adequately repair petitioner\u2019s shoulder, and in 1996 he filed an application for an accidental disability retirement with the Board of Trustees of the Police and Firemen\u2019s Retirement System (the Board).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">The Board initially denied petitioner\u2019s application on the grounds that the September 29, 1992 incident had not been a \u201ctraumatic event\u201d and that his disability was not the \u201cdirect result\u201d of this incident. However, the Board agreed that petitioner was permanently and totally disabled from performing the duties of a police officer. Consequently, the Board granted petitioner an ordinary disability pension.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>Petitioner appealed the denial of his application for an accidental disability pension, and the Board referred the matter to the Office of Administrative Law. At the parties\u2019 request, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) to whom the matter was assigned bifurcated the issue of whether the September 29, 1992 incident was a \u201ctraumatic event\u201d from the issue of whether petitioner\u2019s disability was a \u201cdirect result\u201d of that incident. Based on the evidence presented at a hearing, the ALJ found that \u201c[wjhile petitioner\u2019s injury to his shoulder may have been caused by his own use of great force to obtain the release of his finger, the precipitating cause of this was the violent level of force applied to petitioner by the assailant.\u201d Therefore, the ALJ concluded that \u201cpetitioner\u2019s injury should be regarded as having a traumatic origin since he was subjected to a \u2018great\u2019 external force.\u201d Accordingly, the ALJ made a \u201cpartial decision\u201d in petitioner\u2019s favor on the \u201ctraumatic event\u201d issue and submitted the matter to the Board for immediate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The Board reversed the ALJ\u2019s recommended decision. The Board concluded, contrary to its original decision, that petitioner\u2019s disability was the \u201cdirect result\u201d of the September 29, 1992 incident. However, it reaffirmed the denial of his application for an accidental disability pension on the ground that this incident was not a \u201ctraumatic event.\u201d The Board found that \u201c[t]he disabling injury occurred when [petitioner\u2019s] shoulder hit the wall,\u201d and it concluded that this occurrence was \u201cakin to a fall from ground level ... [which] is not a traumatic event.\u201d We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">To be eligible to retire on an accidental disability pension, a member of the Police and Firemen\u2019s Retirement System must establish that he is \u201cpermanently and totally disabled as a direct result of a traumatic event occurring during and as a result of the performance of his regular or assigned duties.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-7.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Board does not dispute that petitioner is \u201ctotally and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>permanently disabled,\u201d that his disability is a \u201cdirect result\u201d of the September 21, 1992 incident, and that the incident occurred \u201cduring and as a result of the performance of his regular or assigned duties.\u201d Thus, the Board\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s application rests solely on its conclusion that the incident did not constitute a \u201ctraumatic event.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">For an accident to constitute a traumatic event,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-6\">a worker must demonstrate (1) that his injuries were not induced by the stress or strain of the normal work effort; (2) that he met involuntarily with the object or matter that was the source of the <em>harm; </em>and (3) that the source of the injury itself was a great rush of force or uncontrollable power.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-7\"><em>[Kane v. Board of Trustees, Police &amp; Firemen\u2019s Retirement Sys., </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>651, 663, 498 A.2d 1252 (1985).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">Moreover, this force or power \u201cmust originate from sources other than the injured party.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">The Court has recognized that violent altercations between law enforcement officers and inmates may satisfy these tests. In <em>Gable v. Board of Trustees, Public Employees\u2019 Retirement Sys., </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>212, 224-25, 557 A.2d 1012 (1989), the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-10\">[It] is not part of the stress or strain of the \u201cnormal\u201d work effort of a corrections officer to be violently assaulted by an inmate. Corrections officers are not hired to be punching bags. Moreover, [petitioners] clearly met involuntarily with the object or matter that was the source of the harm \u2014 in this case, attacks by unruly inmates. Finally, the source of each injury was a great rush of force or uncontrollable power. Unlike slip-and-fall accidents, the source and power leading to [petitioners\u2019] injuries originated from a source other than the injured party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-11\">The Court also indicated that there were policy reasons for avoiding an unduly restrictive interpretation of the term \u201ctraumatic event\u201d in connection with incidents occurring in the performance of law enforcement duties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-12\">We do not want corrections officers to shy away from subduing unruly inmates. Nor do we want to discourage police officers from chasing criminal suspects. If law-enforcement officers act cautiously, they will <em>not </em>get injured \u2014 but they will also not be doing their jobs properly, and the public will not be as well protected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-13\"><em>[Id. </em>at 224, 557 A.2d 1012.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>In this case the Board does not deny that petitioner satisfied the first test set forth in <em>Kane </em>\u2014 that is (1) \u201chis injuries were not induced by the stress and strain of the normal work effort.\u201d However, the Board argues that petitioner failed to satisfy the second and third tests because \u201cthe force involved originated with [petitioner] and was not a \u2018great rush of force.\u2019 \u201d The Board\u2019s view of the operative facts is that the \u201csource of the harm\u201d to petitioner was his voluntary effort \u201cto extract his finger from [the suspect\u2019s] mouth\u201d and that the force he used to do this was not \u201cgreat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">The Board concedes that if the suspect had bitten off petitioner\u2019s finger, causing him to become totally and permanently disabled from performing the duties of a police officer, the incident would have constituted a traumatic event entitling him to an accidental disability pension. We discern no reason why there should be a different outcome simply because the disabling injury was not an immediate result of the suspect\u2019s assault but instead resulted from petitioner\u2019s efforts to extricate his finger from her mouth. In our view, a violent assault upon a law enforcement officer may constitute a \u201ctraumatic event\u201d within the intent of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-7, even though the officer\u2019s actions in responding to that assault are part of the overall chain of causation ultimately resulting in the disabling injury. Therefore, we conclude that under a proper application of the <em>Kane </em>tests the \u201csource of the harm\u201d should be viewed as the suspect\u2019s act of violently seizing petitioner\u2019s finger with her teeth and that that act constituted \u201ca great rush of force or uncontrollable power.\u201d <em>See Gable, supra, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>at 224-25, 557 A.2d 1012.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">We reject the Board\u2019s argument that the incident which resulted in petitioner\u2019s disabling injury was \u201cakin\u201d to a simple slip and fall case. As the Court pointed out in <em>Maynard v. Board of Trustees, Teachers\u2019 Pension &amp; Annuity Fund, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>169, 175, 549 A.2d 1213 (1988), \u201c[i]n slip and fall cases, no force or power originates anywhere except from the person falling.\u201d In contrast, petitioner was subjected to a violent external force in the form of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>an assault by a criminal suspect. We also reject the Board\u2019s attempt to analogize this case to <em>Mazza v. Board of Trustees, Police &amp; Firemen\u2019s Retirement Sys., </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>22, 667 A.2d 1052 (1995), in which the Court upheld the Board\u2019s denial of an application for accidental disability by a police officer whose horse \u201cbucked\u201d and \u201creared up,\u201d causing the officer\u2019s body to twist in the saddle. As we noted in <em>Flores v. Board of Trustees, Public Employees Retirement Sys., </em>287 <em>N.J.Super. </em>274, 279, 670 A.2d 1113 (App.Div.1996), \u201cthe accident in <em>Mazza </em>did not involve a completely external <em>force </em>but rather the interaction between a mounted policeman and his horse.\u201d In contrast, the suspect\u2019s assault upon petitioner constituted a purely external force over which he had no control. Moreover, petitioner\u2019s accident, unlike the one involved in <em>Mazza, </em>did not involve simply a \u201ctwisting\u201d of his body but rather a violent crash into the wall of the suspect\u2019s motel room.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b127-7\"> The laws governing other state pension systems contain identical provisions.
