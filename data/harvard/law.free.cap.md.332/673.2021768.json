Bruno appealed his conviction, challenging the admissibility of incriminating statements that he made to three different individuals. At a pretrial motions hearing, the trial judge denied a motion to suppress these statements, and they were included as part of the stipulated evidence. On appeal, the Court of Special Appeals ruled that the statements to two of the three individuals were inadmissible, however, it found their admission was harmless in light of the other overwhelming evidence of guilt. We granted certiorari to consider if improperly admitted statements could be deemed harmless error when a defendant, in order to preserve for appeal the trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress, has pled not guilty and agreed to a trial by stipulated evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">Bruno was charged with first degree rape and related offenses. He pled not guilty and initially elected to be tried by a jury. Prior to trial, Bruno sought to suppress several incriminating statements on the ground that they were obtained in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. The challenged evidence included (1) \u201cthe Smith statement\u201d\u2014 Bruno\u2019s admission to Norman Smith, a fellow inmate in the Harford County Detention Center, that Bruno had forcibly raped the victim after a night of partying; (2) \u201cthe Mack statement\u201d \u2014 statements made by Bruno to another inmate, Curtis Mack, expressing his desire to have the rape victim killed; and (3) \u201cthe Walters statement\u201d \u2014 Bruno\u2019s conversation with Corporal Frank Walters, an undercover officer with the Maryland State Police, in which Bruno repeated his desire to have the rape victim killed and agreed to a price for the murder. The trial court denied Bruno\u2019s motion to suppress all three of these statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">After the denial of his suppression motion, Bruno reaffirmed his not guilty plea; however, he decided to waive his right to a jury trial and agreed to a trial by stipulated evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Bruno\u2019s actions were prompted by his desire to preserve the right to appeal the denial of his suppression motion and to accept the State\u2019s offer that, if he proceeded by stipulated evidence, it would place all charges other than first degree rape on the stet docket. Bruno further benefited from the State\u2019s promise to recommend a sentence of life with all but twenty (20) years suspended, to run concurrently with any sentence Bruno received in a companion case charging him with solicitation to murder.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After the judge extensively questioned Bruno and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>determined that he freely, knowingly, and voluntarily waived his right to a jury trial and elected to stipulate to the State\u2019s evidence, the State proffered a summary of their witnesses\u2019 testimony.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The following dialogue occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-5\">\u201c[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Your Honor, in the early morning hours of March 29, 1990, a woman by the name of Kimberly W.,[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] approximate age 24, was at a bar called Lucky Spirits in Baltimore City. She met up with a group of five men, among them Michael Bruno, the Defendant. Mr. Bruno was on an, I guess bar hopping would be a good term, with the other men.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-6\">As the evening progressed, Miss W. became part of the group, and shortly before closing, Miss W. left the bar in Mr. Bruno\u2019s limousine with the five men, including Mr. Bruno. They went on a rather circuitous route, through Baltimore County, ultimately ending up in Harford County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-7\">At some point, two of the men, Chuckie and Ricky Frazier, left the group, leaving Miss W. with Michael Bruno, Robert Ambrose, and Andre Whims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-8\">There came a time when Mr. Bruno and/or his companions demanded sexual relations with Miss W. The limousine was parked at the time. Miss W. refused these advances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-9\">At that point, Mr. Ambrose and Mr. Whims held down Miss W. and Mr. Bruno started to remove her clothing forcefully. Miss W. resisted. She was kicking and pushing at them, and telling them to stop.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-10\">Mr. Bruno obtained an electronic stun gun device that delivers shocks of relatively high voltage of electricity, and shocked her with it on her bare skin numerous times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-11\">While she was being held down by his companions and after the weapon, which she perceived to be a dangerous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>and deadly weapon, was used upon her, she submitted, and Mr. Bruno engaged in forceful vaginal intercourse with her forcefully, and against her consent, while the two companions were assisting in subduing her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-5\">Other sexual acts took place, all against her will, and without her consent. There were several acts of sexual intercourse, acts of sodomy, and battery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-6\">Ultimately, when the sexual events were over, Mr. Bruno and his companions began to discuss the possibility of having breakfast. Miss W., realizing this would involve going to a place where there were other people, and a place of safety, agreed to do so. They came to Denny\u2019s in the Fallston area of Harford County. There, she was let out of the vehicle and approached a waitress.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-7\">The police were summoned. Mr. Bruno and his companions were all arrested. While in jail, in the Harford County Detention Center, under this charge, pending trial, Mr. Bruno admitted to a fellow inmate by the name of Norman Smith, that he had raped Miss W.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-8\">He also had a conversation with a fellow inmate by the name of Curtis Mack concerning killing Miss W., the State\u2019s witness. Mr. Mack made arrangements to have Mr. Bruno contact Corporal Frank Walters of the Maryland State Police, who was identified to Mr. Bruno as Tony, a professional hit man who would take care of Miss W. for him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-9\">Mr. Bruno contacted Corporal Walters and engaged in a conversation with him, which has been marked as a State\u2019s exhibit. We would ask it be included as an exhibit, the transcript of the conversation, included as an exhibit in the Statement of Facts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-10\">THE COURT: Be accepted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-11\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Thank you. In this conversation Mr. Bruno solicited the murder of Miss W. for a sum of money which was agreed for approximately $1,500.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-12\">Just to clear it up, I am not sure I precisely phrased it regarding Mr. Mack. At some point Mr. Bruno and Mr. Mack had a conversation regarding Mr. Bruno\u2019s desire to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>kill Kimberly W. Mr. Mack gave the name, phone number, and the name \u201cTony,\u201d which was Frank Walters of the Maryland State Police, which brings about the transcript we have asked to be included.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-5\">The terminating point of the transport of Miss W. in the course of the rape was, of course, Harford County, which, of course, gives us jurisdiction. That would be the Statement of Facts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-6\">&gt;\u25a04 &gt;\u00a14 \u00ed\u00a14 i{4 # 5jC</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-7\">[DEFENSE ATTORNEY]: Your Honor, in light of the agreement, if that\u2019s \u2014 if the State\u2019s witnesses were to testify in this case, that would be their testimony. Given that, we have no further additions, corrections, deletions, or modifications.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-8\">THE COURT: Argument as to whether or not the Statement of Facts is sufficient to constitute the offenses charged?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-9\">[DEFENSE ATTORNEY]: We will submit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-10\">THE COURT: Based on the Statement of Facts, I am convinced beyond a reasonable doubt and to a moral certainty the Defendant is guilty of First Degree Rape of Kimberly W., and that he had vaginal intercourse with her against her will by use of force, with assistance of others, and the use of a weapon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-11\">So, for that reason, a finding of guilty as to Count 1, First Degree Rape, will be entered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-12\">There was a further stipulation to incorporate relevant testimony from the motions hearing regarding Bruno\u2019s statements to Smith, Mack, and Walters. Bruno offered no evidence and called no witnesses to controvert the stipulated testimony, and expressly acknowledged that the credibility of the State\u2019s witnesses was not at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-13\">On appeal, the Court of Special Appeals addressed Bruno\u2019s Sixth Amendment, right-to-counsel challenge to the statements to Smith, Mack, and Walters. The intermediate appellate court determined that the Smith statement, in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>Bruno admitted the rape, was properly received because there was \u201cnothing in [the] record to indicate that Smith was in any way a State agent when that statement was made or that he had encouraged or solicited the statement, directly or indirectly, on behalf of the State.\u201d <em>Bruno v. State, </em>93 Md.App. 501, 515, 613 A.2d 440, 447 (1992). As for the statements to Mack and Walters concerning Bruno\u2019s desire to kill the rape victim, however, the intermediate appellate court concluded that these were obtained in violation of Bruno\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel, and thereby inadmissible based on its interpretation of <em>Maine v. Moulton, </em>474 U.S. 159, 106 S.Ct. 477, 88 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985), and related cases. Despite its conclusion that the Mack and Walters statements were erroneously admitted in Bruno\u2019s rape trial, the court found any error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. In light of the stipulated evidence, the Court of Special Appeals believed that the erroneously admitted evidence \u201ccould not possibly have influenced the [trial] court\u2019s verdict in any way.\u201d <em>Bruno, </em>93 Md.App. at 517, 613 A.2d at 448. Therefore, the court affirmed Bruno\u2019s rape conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Before this Court, Bruno contends that the Court of Special Appeals erred by finding the improperly admitted statements harmless error. First, Bruno asks us to analogize a not guilty plea, together with a stipulation as to the State\u2019s evidence, to a procedure permitted in some jurisdictions called a conditional guilty plea. He further contends that, if we analogize a trial by stipulated evidence to a conditional guilty plea, we should then follow cases that have refused to apply harmless error to an erroneous refusal to suppress evidence followed by a conditional guilty plea. Those courts have reasoned that there is no way to assess the impact erroneously admitted evidence had upon a defendant\u2019s decision to plead conditionally guilty. <em>See, e.g., People v. Miller, </em>33 Cal.3d 545, 555-56, 189 Cal.Rptr. 519, 526-27, 658 P.2d 1320, 1327-28 (1983); <em>People v. Grant, </em>45 N.Y.2d 366, 379-80, 408 N.Y.S.2d 429, 437, 380 N.E.2d 257, 265 (1978); <em>Jones v. Wisconsin, </em>562 F.2d 440, 445 (7th Cir. 1977); <em>People v. Hill, </em>12 Cal.3d 731, 768, 117 Cal.Rptr. 393, 421, 528 P.2d 1, 29 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>The State, however, points out that Maryland has not adopted a conditional guilty plea procedure, and further, Bruno did not plead guilty; therefore, cases dealing with conditional guilty pleas are irrelevant. The State asserts that \u201cthe focus of the harmless error analysis should not be on whether the error had any effect on Bruno\u2019s decision to enter into the particular plea, but rather should be on the effect of the erroneously admitted evidence on the decision of the fact-finder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">For reasons we will discuss below, we believe the Court of Special Appeals properly invoked the harmless error rule under the facts of this case. We emphasize that this decision only addresses the propriety of applying harmless error. Bruno does not challenge the intermediate appellate court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of \u201cthe Smith statement.\u201d In its conditional cross-petition, the State does challenge the ruling on the inadmissibility of the Mack and Walters statements. The State presents the question of \u201c[w]hether the Court of Special Appeals erred in holding that evidence that Bruno solicited the murder of the rape victim was inadmissible in his rape trial under <em>Maine v. Moulton </em>[474 U.S. 159, 106 S.Ct. 477, 88 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985) ].\u201d Because we granted certiorari to review the harmless error issue and because we find that any error would indeed be harmless, we will not address the issue raised in the conditional cross-petition. We will assume, <em>arguendo, </em>the correctness of the Court of Special Appeals with regard to the inadmissibility of Bruno\u2019s statements to Mack and Walters under the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">We begin our analysis with a discussion of conditional guilty pleas. A conditional guilty plea, where permitted by statute or rule, generally allows a defendant to plead guilty, yet still retain the right to appellate review of certain pretrial motions. As implemented by the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, a defendant must preserve, in writing, appellate review of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>adverse determination of any specified pretrial motion when entering his conditional plea of guilt, and court approval as well as the consent of the government are required. Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(a)(2). If a defendant prevails on appeal, withdrawal of the plea is permitted. <em>Id. </em>The basis for allowing such a plea is that it \u201cconserv[es] prosecutorial, defense and judicial resources ... by permitting the defendant to appeal an adverse pretrial ruling without undergoing a full trial to preserve the point.\u201d <em>United States v. Burns, </em>684 F.2d 1066, 1072 (2d Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1174, 103 S.Ct. 823, 74 L.Ed.2d 1019 (1983) (citations omitted). <em>See also </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11, Notes of Advisory Committee (pointing out that the conditional guilty plea avoids the waste of resources that occurs when \u201ca defendant who has lost one or more pretrial motions go[es] through an entire trial simply to preserve the pretrial issues for later appellate review\u201d); <em>but see Burns, </em>684 F.2d at 1072 (\u201cWhen defendants are allowed to raise on appeal a barrage of claims that are not clearly dispositive of the case, however, the balance of policy considerations is less clear. The practice is no longer likely to serve the interests of judicial economy. Assuming that the probability of reversal on at least one issue increases as the number of issues appealed increases, broad-ranging conditional guilty pleas will be more likely to lead to an elaborate sequence of plea, appeal, trial and reappeal. Such a sequence hardly conserves the judicial system\u2019s resources.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">Bruno directs our attention to cases dealing with conditional guilty pleas in light of his decision to elect an abbreviated form of trial on stipulated evidence. We recognize that several courts have determined that harmless error should not be applied where there is an improper denial of a suppression motion followed by a conditional guilty plea. For example, in <em>Hill, supra, </em>the Supreme Court of California determined that an appeal from the denial of a suppression motion, expressly authorized by statute after a guilty plea, prevented the court from invoking harmless error when some, but not all, of the evidence should have been suppressed. <em>Id., </em>12 Cal.3d at 769, 117 Cal.Rptr. at 421-22, 528 P.2d at 29-30. The court de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>dared that, with such a limited record, an \u201cunacceptable degree of appellate speculation\u201d would result if the appellate court tried to determine, based only on the evidence subject to the suppression motion, the respective strength of the prosecution\u2019s or defense\u2019s case. <em>Id., </em>12 Cal.3d at 768, 117 Cal.Rptr. at 421, 528 P.2d at 29. Unsure of whether the defendant would again plead guilty with knowledge that some of the evidence was inadmissible and based on the \u201cmagnitude of the consequences of a guilty plea,\u201d the court declined to find that the erroneous refusal to suppress part of the evidence was harmless. <em>Id., </em>12 Cal.3d at 769, 117 Cal.Rptr. at 421, 528 P.2d at 29. <em>See also Miller, </em>33 Cal.3d at 553, 189 Cal.Rptr. at 525, 658 P.2d at 1326 (following <em>Hill); Grant, </em>45 N.Y.2d 366, 408 N.Y.S.2d at 435-37, 380 N.E.2d at 263-65; <em>Jones v. Wisconsin, </em>562 F.2d at 445-46 (expressing agreement with <em>Hill).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">We first note that the <em>Hill </em>decision has not escaped criticism. In <em>People v. Salazar, </em>93 Cal.App.3d 912, 156 Cal.Rptr. 125, 127 (1979), an intermediate California appellate court questioned the soundness of <em>Hill\u2019s </em>apparently absolute rule barring harmless error analysis and applied the doctrine where it could not \u201cconceive of a rational basis for concluding that the [defendant\u2019s] guilty plea was triggered by the erroneous refusal to suppress some of the prosecution\u2019s evidence. ...\u201d <em>See also People v. Carney, </em>117 Cal.App.3d 36, 172 Cal.Rptr. 430, 439 n. 2 (1981) (Staniforth, J., concurring and dissenting) (\u201cIn certain factual situations, the blind acceptance of the <em>Hill ... </em>rule leads to an absurd, unnecessary time wasting result.... \u201d), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>34 Cal.3d 597, 194 Cal.Rptr. 500, 668 P.2d 807 (1983), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>471 U.S. 386, 105 S.Ct. 2066, 85 L.Ed.2d 406 (1985). Moreover, in <em>People v. Ingram, </em>122 Cal.App.3d 673, 176 Cal.Rptr. 199 (1981), a California appellate court acknowledged the important distinction, for harmless error purposes, between a conditional guilty plea and a not guilty plea with stipulations. The court noted that the defendant did not plead conditionally guilty as in <em>Hill </em>but \u201csubmitted the cause to the trial court on the testimony taken at the preliminary hearing,\u201d and thus the \u201cunacceptable degree of appellate speculation\u201d present in <em>Hill </em>was not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>concern in light of the more expansive record. <em>Id., </em>122 Cal.App.3d at 682, 176 Cal.Rptr. at 204. The <em>Ingram </em>court recognized that the harmless error rule would be applicable where the case was submitted based on the testimony taken at the preliminary hearing. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">Conditional guilty plea cases refusing to apply harmless error analysis after a defendant pleads guilty are inapposite to the instant case. First, and most important, Bruno <em>did not </em>plead guilty, and thus we are neither concerned with the \u201cmagnitude of the consequences of a guilty plea,\u201d nor with how an erroneous refusal to suppress evidence impacted upon a decision to plead \u201cguilty.\u201d By pleading not guilty, Bruno was convicted after a trial, albeit, one based on stipulated evidence. Bruno enjoyed the right to full appellate review, as well as benefited from the State\u2019s sentence recommendation and its decision to place other charges on the stet docket. Unlike a guilty plea, under which the State would be relieved of its burden of proof, <em>Moyer v. State, </em>225 Md. 156, 158, 169 A.2d 409, 410 (1961), Bruno\u2019s not guilty plea required the State to present stipulated evidence sufficient to constitute first degree rape or risk an acquittal by the trial judge. <em>See Barnes v. State, </em>31 Md.App. 25, 28, 354 A.2d 499, 501 (1976) (Orth, C.J.) (stating that, even in a trial based upon agreed statement of facts, accused must be acquitted if evidence is insufficient to sustain conviction). Moreover, Bruno had the right to present exculpatory or mitigating evidence. Although Bruno\u2019s counsel declined the opportunity to present a closing argument, the trial judge did ask for any \u201c[ajrgument as to whether or not the Statement of Facts is sufficient to constitute the offenses charged.\u201d As noted by the Supreme Court of California in <em>Bunnell v. Superior Court of Santa Clara County, </em>13 Cal.3d 592, 602, 119 Cal.Rptr. 302, 308, 531 P.2d 1086, 1092 (1975), \u201c[n]otwithstanding [any bargained-for agreement] or the fact that conviction is a foregone conclusion, a submission of the cause for decision on the [preliminary] transcript <em>is a trial.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Bruno\u2019s conviction, based upon stipulated evidence as well as the incorporated relevant portions of the suppression hearing\u2019s testimony, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>rendered by way of a trial. Because Bruno proceeded on a not guilty plea and preserved rights incident to a trial, we see no reason to modify the harmless error doctrine based on the manner of that trial chosen by the defendant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">We are also unpersuaded by those cases finding harmless error inappropriate in conditional guilty plea appeals because they primarily rest upon interpretations of statutes that expressly enable defendants to appeal certain rulings even after entering a guilty plea. <em>See Hill, </em>12 Cal.3d at 769, 117 Cal.Rptr. at 421-22, 528 P.2d at 29 (construing Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 1538.5(m) (West 1982, Cum.Supp.1993)); <em>Salazar, </em>93 Cal.App.3d 912, 156 Cal.Rptr. at 127 <em>(\u201cHill </em>[is], after all, merely [an] interpretation[ ] of the legislative intent behind section 1538.5, subdivision (m)....\u201d); <em>Grant, </em>45 N.Y.2d 366, 408 N.Y.S.2d at 435-37, 380 N.E.2d at 263-65 (interpreting statute now codified at N.Y.Crim.Proc.Law \u00a7 710.70(2) (Consol.1986)); <em>Jones v. Wisconsin, </em>562 F.2d at 445-46, and <em>State v. Monahan, </em>76 Wis.2d 387, 251 N.W.2d 421, 426 (1977) (discussing Wis.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 971.31(10) (West 1985)). In <em>Jones v. Wisconsin, </em>for example, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit acknowledged that Wisconsin\u2019s statute \u201cencourages guilty pleas\u201d and this objective \u201cis obtained by guaranteeing to the defendant that he will have a full trial in the event that after appeal the state\u2019s evidence is weaker than it appeared at the time of the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings.\u201d <em>Jones v. Wisconsin, </em>562 F.2d at 445-46. Similarly, the Supreme Court of California in <em>Hill </em>made clear that its \u201cdecision operates to further the Legislature\u2019s intention of encouraging a guilty plea by a defendant whose defense rests on the asserted illegality of a search and seizure.\u201d <em>Hill, </em>12 Cal.3d at 770 n. 36, 117 Cal.Rptr. at 422 n. 36, 528 P.2d at 30 n. 36. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>Those jurisdictions, \u201c[a]s a matter of state public policy, [legislatively] abandoned the guilty-plea-waiver rule.\u201d <em>State v. Riekkoff, </em>112 Wis.2d 119, 332 N.W.2d 744, 747 (1983). Maryland has not done so, <em>see </em>Md.Rule 4-242(a), and we are unwilling to judicially create such a plea by equating Bruno\u2019s not guilty plea to a guilty plea and creating an exception to the rule that a guilty plea waives all nonjurisdictional defects. In light of this choice, it is unnecessary to further the objectives of a conditional guilty plea by following those decisions that refuse to apply harmless error.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">Our conclusion that harmless error is applicable to the instant case finds further support in federal court decisions that have criticized conditional guilty pleas. Even prior to the enactment of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(a)(2), a few federal courts permitted conditional guilty pleas. See discussion in <em>United States v. DePoli, </em>628 F.2d 779, 781 n. 1 (2d Cir.1980). Others, however, refused to sanction the conditional plea fearing that, without a full record before it, an appellate court would be forced to deal with issues that \u201ccould have been avoided by invocation of the doctrine of harmless error.... \u201d <em>United States v. Cox, </em>464 F.2d 937, 945 (6th Cir.1972). In <em>Cox, </em>for instance, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit acknowledged that, based on a conditional guilty plea, \u201c[w]e are left to conjecture whether the prosecution had additional evidence to present against the defendants.\u201d <em>Id. See also </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11, Notes of Advisory Committee (stating that, \u201c[w]ith respect to the objection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>that conditional pleas circumvent application of the harmless error doctrine, it must be acknowledged that \u2018[ajbsent a full trial record, containing all the government\u2019s evidence against the defendant, invocation of the harmless error rule is arguably impossible\u2019 \u201d) (quoting Comment, <em>Conditioned Guilty Pleas: Post-Guilty Plea Appeal of Nonjurisdictional Issues, </em>26 U.C.L.A.L.Rev. 360, 380 (1978)). The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, however, recognized a distinction between a conditional guilty plea and a trial conducted pursuant to a not guilty plea together with \u201cstipulations which expressly and effectively admit sufficient facts to support an adjudication of guilty ... but explicitly reserve[ ] the right to appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Mendoza, </em>491 F.2d 534, 536 (5th Cir.1974). Unlike a conditional guilty plea, the latter case provides the \u201cvital facts\u201d upon which to review a trial court\u2019s actions. <em>See id. </em>at 538; <em>see also United States v. Lace, </em>669 F.2d 46, 58 n. 7 (2d Cir.) (Newman, J., concurring) (suggesting that, to prevent the use of conditional guilty pleas as \u201ca device to circumvent the harmless error rule ... [w]hen multiple pretrial rulings concerning evidence are to be challenged, one solution would be for the parties to stipulate, for purposes of the conditional guilty plea, to an agreed statement of the admissible evidence apart from the challenged rulings, with withdrawal of the plea permitted only upon an appellate determination that a pre-trial ruling was not only erroneous <em>but prejudicial in light of the stipulated </em>evidence\u201d (emphasis added)), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 854, 103 S.Ct. 121, 74 L.Ed.2d 106 (1982).

In <em>Weber, </em>after unsuccessfully seeking to suppress evidence, the defendants waived a jury trial and submitted to trial by agreed facts, pretrial testimony, and exhibits from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>suppression hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 562. The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit noted that \u201c[\u00bfdefendants\u2019 stipulations and waivers were made on the assumption and condition not merely that their right of appeal was preserved, but that the evidence was properly admissible against them. In fairness, this should mean <em>all </em>the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 562 (footnote omitted) (emphasis added). Influenced by conditional guilty plea eases, the <em>Weber </em>court, upon finding some of the evidence inadmissible, held that harmless error could not be applied and granted the defendants a new trial.

Ordinarily, a defendant is entitled to appellate review after a final judgment in a criminal case. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1974, 1989 Repl.Vol.), Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, \u00a7 12-301. By pleading guilty, however, a defendant forfeits any right to a direct appeal, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 12-302(e), and ordinarily waives all nonjurisdictional defects in the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>ceedings. <em>See Sutton v. State, </em>289 Md. 359, 365, 424 A.2d 755, 758-59 (1981); <em>Treadway v. Warden, </em>243 Md. 680, 682, 220 A.2d 907, 908 (1966); <em>Deyermond v.

State, </em>85 Md.App. 648, 650, 584 A.2d 1274, 1275 (1991); <em>Ward v. State, </em>52 Md.App. 664, 667, 451 A.2d 1243, 1245 (1982). As noted by Judge Joseph F. Murphy, Jr. in his handbook on Maryland evidence law, stipulations of evidence and stipulations of fact \u201care frequently used as shortcuts to formal proof.\u201d Joseph F. Murphy, Jr., Maryland Evidence Handbook \u00a7 1003, at 380 (1989). In <em>Barnes v. State, </em>31 Md.App. 25, 35, 354 A.2d 499, 505-06 (1976), Judge Orth, writing as Chief Judge for the Court of Special Appeals, explained the difference between an agreed statement of facts and stipulated evidence as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-5\">\u201cThere is a distinction between an <em>agreed </em>statement of facts and evidence offered by way of stipulation. Under an agreed statement of facts both [the] State and the defense agree as to the ultimate facts. Then the facts are not in dispute, and there can be, by definition, no factual conflict. The trier of fact is not called upon to determine the facts as the agreement is to the truth of the ultimate facts themselves. There is no fact-finding function left to perform. To render judgment, the court simply applies the law to the facts agreed upon. If there is agreement as to the facts, there is no dispute; if there is dispute, there is no agreement. It would be well, to avoid confusion, that when the parties are in agreement on the facts, the statement of them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>begin with language to the effect, \u2018It is agreed that the following facts are true.... \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-5\">On the other hand, when evidence is offered by way of stipulation, there is no agreement as to the facts which the evidence seeks to establish. Such a stipulation only goes to the content of the testimony of a particular witness if he were to appear and testify. The agreement is to what the evidence will be, not to what the facts are. Thus, the evidence adduced by such a stipulation may well be in conflict with other evidence received. For the trier of fact to determine the ultimate facts on such conflicting evidence, there must be some basis on which to judge the credibility of the witness whose testimony is the subject of the stipulation, or to ascertain the reliability of that testimony, to the end that the evidence obtained by stipulation may be weighed against other relevant evidence adduced____ We note that the usual way of introducing such a stipulation\u2014 \u2018If John Doe were to testify, he would testify as follows .... \u2019 \u2014 makes clear the status of the evidence so offered.\u201d (Emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">In the instant case, Bruno pled not guilty, as emphasized by his counsel.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although the court, prosecutor, and defense counsel referred to Bruno\u2019s plea as a \u201cNot Guilty Statement of Facts,\u201d it is also clear that the parties <em>did not </em>have an agreement as to <em>ultimate </em>fact, but merely an agreement as to what the State\u2019s witnesses would attest to if they were called to testify. Recognizing that conflicts in stipulated testimony may make such a form of trial inappropriate, <em>see Atkinson v. State, </em>331 Md. 199, 203 n. 3, 627 A.2d 1019, 1020-21 n. 3 (1993); <em>Polk, </em>85 Md.App. at 656-57, 584 A.2d at 1278; <em>Barnes, </em>31 Md.App. at 36, 354 A.2d at 506, the trial judge emphasized that he couldn\u2019t \u201cresolve conflicts\u201d based on the stipulation. Whereupon, Bruno\u2019s attorney indicated no intent to contradict the State\u2019s proffer, and stated (and later reiterated) that, \u201cwe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>agree if the State\u2019s witnesses were to testify, that would be their testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\">Because he pled not guilty and in effect had a trial, Bruno retained his right to full appellate review. Bruno, however, now suggests that the harmless error doctrine should not be applicable to his appeal and he is entitled to a new trial because of insignificant errors. He contends that, because he proceeded by stipulating to the State\u2019s evidence rather than undergoing a full, adversarial trial, he retains the benefit of full appellate review, but the State forfeits the benefit of the harmless error rule. We refuse to allow Bruno to \u201chave his cake and eat it too.\u201d <em>Jones v. State, </em>77 Md.App. 193, 199, 549 A.2d 1150, 1153 (1988) (Bell, Robert M., J.) (rejecting defendant\u2019s contention that his conviction should be reversed because he was not granted procedural requirements associated with a guilty plea after defendant obtained a direct appeal based on his not guilty plea with an agreed statement of facts).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">Guiding this decision is our belief that a defendant should not be able to circumvent the application of the harmless error rule because he or she opts to proceed to trial by stipulated evidence or an agreed statement of facts. The harmless error doctrine is based on \u201cappellate judgments that a retrial is not justified if the error has not affected the rights of the parties,\u201d <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 647, 350 A.2d 665, 671 (1976), and a recognition that \u201c[a]n accused has a constitutional right to a \u2018fair trial\u2019 but not necessarily to that seldom experienced rarity, a perfect trial.\u201d <em>State v. Babb, </em>258 Md. 547, 552, 267 A.2d 190, 193 (1970). In <em>Arizona v. Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. 279, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 113 L.Ed.2d 302 (1991), the United States Supreme Court stated its belief that \u201cthe harmless-error doctrine is essential to preserve the \u2018principle that the central purpose of a criminal trial is to decide the factual question of the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence, and [it] promotes public respect for the criminal process by focusing on the underlying fairness of the trial rather than on the virtually inevitable presence of immaterial error.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>499 U.S. at 308, 111 S.Ct. at 1264, 113 L.Ed.2d at 330 (quoting <em>Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 681, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 1436, 89 L.Ed.2d 674, 684-85 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>(1986) (citations omitted)). In Maryland, the harmless error doctrine\u2019s vital role in appellate review is further evidenced by the enactment of Md.Rule 8-131, which states that \u201cthe Court of Appeals may consider whether [an] error was harmless or nonprejudicial even though the matter of harm or prejudice was not raised in the petition or in a cross-petition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">In essence, Bruno asks us to create a per <em>se </em>rule, granting a defendant a new trial whenever an appellate court rules any challenged evidence inadmissible, simply because the trial was conducted on stipulated evidence, and regardless of whether the erroneously admitted evidence lends only an insignificant inference of guilt, is cumulative, or for any other reason would not affect the trial judge\u2019s ultimate decision. We decline to do so. For instance, suppose that a defendant pleads not guilty and proceeds on stipulated' evidence following a denial of a motion to suppress seven separate confessions to the same crime. Further assume that, on appeal, only the last of these confessions is ruled inadmissible, leaving six properly admitted confessions. Refusing to apply harmless error to the seventh, cumulative confession, simply because the trial was by stipulated testimony, would in no way promote \u201c \u2018public respect for the criminal process by focusing on the underlying fairness of the trial rather than on the virtually inevitable presence of immaterial error.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. at 308, 111 S.Ct. at 1264, 113 L.Ed.2d at 330 (quoting <em>Van Arsdall, 475 </em>U.S. at 681, 106 S.Ct. at 1436, 89 L.Ed.2d at 685 (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">Defendants should not be able to avoid the harmless error rule and obtain appellate review of pretrial rulings admitting clearly insignificant or cumulative evidence. Nor should convictions, even convictions on stipulated testimony, be reversed when a judge properly denied a motion to suppress most of the incriminating evidence, but erred in failing to suppress relatively insignificant items. A trial on stipulated evidence is a trial; it is not a circuitous method of obtaining appellate review of rulings admitting immaterial evidence. Neither the State nor the defendant, nor the two acting in concert, can mandate appellate relief for rulings which are harmless be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>yond a reasonable doubt. When faced with ample evidence of a defendant\u2019s guilt, other courts have applied harmless error, notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s use of stipulations. <em>See State v. Houchins, </em>79 Or.App. 66, 717 P.2d 665, 666 (1986) (concluding that erroneous refusal to suppress evidence was harmless in light of \u201coverwhelming evidence to support the convictions,\u201d where defendants proceeded to trial on stipulated facts); <em>People v. Sanders, </em>55 Ill.App.3d 178, 13 Ill.Dec. 186, 191, 370 N.E.2d 1213, 1218 (1977) (finding trial court\u2019s refusal to suppress one of three statements that \u201clent only inferential support\u201d of guilt was harmless in light of defendant\u2019s stipulation to other evidence and proper admission of two additional statements), <em>rev\u2019d sub nom. United States ex rel. Sanders v. Rowe, </em>460 F.Supp. 1128, 1146 (N.D.Ill.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\">Perhaps anticipating our decision that harmless error may be applied in an appeal from a trial by stipulated evidence, Bruno argues that the admission of his statements to Mack and Walters cannot be deemed harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Bruno is really suggesting that, in trials by stipulated evidence, the evidence stipulated to should rarely be considered harmless. Although Bruno\u2019s case is not as clear-cut as our above hypothetical case involving seven confessions, it is nonetheless a proper setting for invocation of the harmless error rule. The Court of Special Appeals ruled inadmissible the Mack and Walters statements, in which Bruno indicated his desire to have the rape victim killed. At best, these statements lend only inferential support to the conclusion that Bruno committed rape, <em>i. </em>&lt;?., they indicate \u201cconsciousness of guilt.\u201d Arguably, the statements \u201cshow not so much a consciousness of guilt [but] simply a desire to get out of jail and escape the prosecution.\u201d <em>Bruno, </em>93 Md.App. at 518, 613 A.2d at 449. The intermediate appellate court, however, found that Bruno\u2019s statement to Smith, in which Bruno expressly admitted that he forcibly raped the victim, was properly admitted. Of all the evidence that Bruno sought to suppress, the statement to Smith was clearly the most damaging. While the proffer at trial included that \u201cBruno admitted to a fellow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>inmate by the name of Norman Smith that he had raped Miss W.,\u201d the stipulation also incorporated Smith\u2019s applicable testimony from the suppression hearing. At that hearing, Smith testified that Bruno approached him and told him about his rape case. Smith further testified about Bruno\u2019s description of the incident, relating that \u201csomebody had the stun gun, and they had forced the girl to have sex with them.\u201d Smith also stated that, according to Bruno, \u201c[i]t was a forced rape.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">We are confident that the statements to Mack and Walters \u201cin no way influenced the [judge\u2019s] verdict.\u201d <em>Dorsey, </em>276 Md. at 659, 350 A.2d at 678. The trial judge had overwhelming evidence of guilt properly before him, consisting of the admission to Smith of the rape, as well as the uncontroverted, stipulated evidence supporting the conviction for first degree rape.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Under these circumstances, we believe that an appellate court may properly find the erroneous admission of two statements lending only inferential support of guilt was harmless beyond any reasonable doubt. <em>See Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 828, 17 L.Ed.2d 705, 710-11 (1967) (\u201c[B]efore a federal constitutional error can be held harmless, the court must be able to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d); <em>Milton v. Wainwright, </em>407 U.S. 371, 372-73, 92 S.Ct. 2174, 2175-76, 33 L.Ed.2d 1, 4 (1972) (finding incriminating statements harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, even if erroneously admitted in violation of Sixth Amendment rights, where other overwhelming evidence of guilt was present).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">We should briefly address the propriety of deeming an error harmless where a defendant stipulates to evidence sufficient for conviction in order to preserve a pretrial suppression <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>motion challenging only <em>one item </em>of evidence which was improperly admitted, or where a defendant stipulates to preserve his challenge to multiple pieces of evidence, <em>all </em>of which are ruled inadmissible by the appellate court. While the harmless error rule is applicable to all appeals, even appeals on stipulated evidence, we point out that an appellate court should be very cautious in ever deeming these errors harmless. In such cases, defense counsel might consider obtaining a stipulation from the State, on the record, that the disputed evidence constitutes a significant part of the State\u2019s case. Today\u2019s decision simply addresses the situation before us, where multiple evidentiary rulings <em>(i.e., </em>the admissibility of the Smith, Mack, and Walters statements) are preserved for appellate review, and only the less significant rulings are reversed, still leaving such overwhelming evidence of guilt that the appellate court can say the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">We do not believe that today\u2019s ruling will force all future defendants to go through full, adversarial trials to preserve the right to challenge pretrial rulings denying the suppression of evidence. In cases where truly dispositive rulings are at issue, a not guilty plea with stipulated evidence still provides a defendant the opportunity for quicker trials without fearing the application of the harmless error doctrine on appeal. However, we decline to allow a defendant to stipulate to evidence in order to challenge multiple, nondispositive pretrial rulings on appeal, with a reversal mandated if even a single \u201charmless\u201d ruling was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

In very limited instances, we have held that, for purposes of conducting a voluntary litany associated with entering into a guilty plea, <em>see </em>Maryland Rule 4-242(c), a \"not guilty agreed statement <em>of </em>facts\u201d is the functional equivalent of a guilty plea. <em>See Sutton v. State, </em>289 Md. 359, 366, 424 A.2d 755, 759 (1981). Without expressing any opinion on whether such a litany was required in this case, the trial judge painstakingly assured that Bruno voluntarily waived his jury trial and agreed to stipulate to the State\u2019s evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b816-6\">. In his brief, Bruno relies on cases interpreting California's conditional guilty plea statute to prohibit the use of harmless error analysis in appeals taken pursuant thereto. Interestingly, California\u2019s conditional guilty plea statute fails to provide for appellate review of the denial of a motion to suppress admissions on fifth or sixth amendment grounds. <em>See People v. Mattson, </em>50 Cal.3d 826, 850-51, 268 Cal.Rptr. 802, 819, 789 P.2d 983, 1000 (\u201cSection 1538.5(m) is properly used only to exclude evidence obtained in violation of a defendant\u2019s state and/or federal (Fourth Amendment) right to be free of unreasonable search and seizure.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 1017, 111 S.Ct. 591, 112 L.Ed.2d 595 (1990). Thus, in California, a defendant in Bruno\u2019s position could not benefit from the no-harmless-error rule first announced in <em>People v. Hill, </em>12 Cal.3d 731, 117 Cal.Rptr. 393, 528 P.2d 1 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b818-7\">. Bruno argues that by agreeing to the stipulation, the parties and trial court assumed that all of the evidence sought to be suppressed was necessary to prove his guilt. In light of this \"assumption,\u201d Bruno maintains that no error can be deemed harmless. However, an examination of the record does not bear out this contention. We fail to see the \"assumption\u201d that the inadmissibility of any portion of the evidence sought to be suppressed would be dispositive of Bruno\u2019s appeal and thereby necessitate a new trial. If Bruno was led to believe he was entitled to a new trial upon an appellate court\u2019s ruling that any one of the statements preserved for appeal was inadmissible, there is nothing in the record to show that the prosecution or the court created this belief. Thus, post-conviction relief might be the proper avenue for asserting any argument that Bruno acted upon improper advice of counsel. <em>See Stewart v. State, </em>319 Md. 81, 92, 570 A.2d 1229, 1234 (1990) (\"We have consistently held that the desirable procedure for determining claims of inadequate assistance of counsel, when the issue was not presented to the trial court, is by way of the Post Conviction Procedure Act.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b820-9\">.

The stipulated evidence, in pertinent part, detailed that, while the rape victim \"was being held down by [Bruno\u2019s] companions and after [a stun gun], which she perceived to be a dangerous and deadly weapon, was used upon her, she submitted, and Mr. Bruno engaged in ... vaginal intercourse with her forcefully, and against her consent, while the two companions were assisting in subduing her.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b826-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>ROBERT M.

It is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>[W]hen an appellant, in a criminal case, establishes error, unless a reviewing court, upon its own independent review of the record, is able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict, such error cannot be deemed \u201charmless\u201d and a reversal is mandated. Such reviewing court must thus be satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of \u2014 whether erroneously admitted or excluded-\u2014 may have contributed to the rendition of the guilty verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b827-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 659, 350 A.2d at 678 (footnote omitted). The test focuses on the effect of erroneously admitted or excluded evidence on the verdict rendered by the trier of fact. Whether that evidence played a role in the verdict is a question addressed to the reviewing court. Once the appellate court determines that error was committed, reversal is required unless it also determines, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error did not influence the verdict; harmless error occurs only if the error played no role in the trier of fact\u2019s verdict. <em>State v.

State, </em>272 Md. 233, 248, 322 A.2d 211, 219 (1974). Indeed, in that case, quoting <em>People v. Jablonski, </em>38 Mich.App. 33, 195 N.W.2d 777, 780 (1972), the Court stated the proposition even more graphically:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-7\">\u201cContinued expansion of the harmless error rule will merely encourage prosecutors to get such testimony in, since they know that, if they have a strong case, such testimony will not be considered to be reversible error, yet if they have a weak case, they will use such testimony to buttress the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>to gain a conviction and then hope that the issue is not raised on appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 248, 322 A.2d at 219. Although the majority does not . expressly so state, the Court rejects that proposition and, so, continues the movement away from harmless error as an extraordinary, rather than ordinary, test. <em>See Rubin v. State, </em>325 Md. 552, 592-93, 602 A.2d 677, 696-97 (1992) (Bell, J. dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the stipulated evidence consisted of a summary of the testimony of the State\u2019s witnesses, and evidence pertinent to the review of the court\u2019s ruling on the petitioner\u2019s motion to suppress. The testimony of three of those witnesses \u2014 two of whom, Mack and Smith were former inmates with the petitioner and the third, Walters, was a Maryland State Police undercover officer \u2014 related statements purportedly made to them by the petitioner. This testimony was the subject of the motion to suppress, which the trial court denied. The statement to Smith, which purportedly related the details of the rape, was held by the Court of Special Appeals to have been properly admitted. The opposite conclusion was reached as to those statements, involving the petitioner\u2019s desire to have the rape victim killed, made to Walters and Mack. The Court of Special Appeals, as did the majority, concluded the trial court\u2019s error was, however, harmless. As the majority views it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-7\">The trial judge [nevertheless] had overwhelming evidence of guilt properly before him, consisting of the admission to Smith of the rape, as well as the uncontroverted, stipulated evidence [of the facts and circumstances of the rape].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJd\">Majority opinion at 694 (footnote omitted). To reach that conclusion, both the majority and the Court of Special Appeals characterized the statements to Mack and Walters as \u201clending] only inferential support to the conclusion that Bruno committed rape, <em>i.e. </em>they indicate \u2018consciousness of guilt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 693.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">In harmless error analysis, the issue is not what evidence is available to the trier of fact, but rather what evidence the trier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>of fact, in fact, used in reaching its verdict. <em>See Bruce v. State, </em>318 Md. 706, 728, 569 A.2d 1254, 1265 (1990); <em>Hook, </em>315 Md. at 42, 553 A.2d at 242. Thus, using what the majority perceives as an example of a clear case of harmless error, <em>see </em>majority opinion at 692, if there were available seven confessions, but the record revealed that the trier of fact relied only on the seventh, and not the other six, exclusion of the seventh confession would require reversal of the judgment of conviction, notwithstanding the other six confessions. That is so because the seventh confession would have contributed to the rendition of the guilty verdict. In short, it is not that the evidence has been, or could be, determined to be sufficient, or otherwise sufficient, that is of dispositive importance; rather it is whether the subject evidence actually influenced the trier of fact\u2019s decision to reach a guilty verdict. <em>Hook, supra; Bruce, supra. </em>This is true whether there has been a full trial or simply a trial on stipulated evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\">Although the reviewing court, in conducting its harmless error analysis, must independently review the record, it cannot lose sight of the role of the trier of fact in assessing whether the State has met its burden of proof. The trier of fact\u2019s role involves, <em>inter alia, </em>weighing the evidence and resolving any credibility issues which might be presented. <em>See Dykes v. State, </em>319 Md. 206, 224, 571 A.2d 1251, 1260-61 (1990); <em>Gore v. State, </em>309 Md. 203, 522 A.2d 1338 (1987); <em>Wilson v. State, </em>261 Md. 551, 566, 276 A.2d 214, 221 (1971); <em>Jacobs v. State, </em>238 Md. 648, 650, 210 A.2d 722, 723-24 (1965). The appellate court does not weigh the evidence \u2014 not even when it is assessing the sufficiency of the evidence. See <em>Clemson v. Butler Aviation, </em>266 Md. 666, 671, 296 A.2d 419, 422 (1972); <em>Gray v. Director, </em>245 Md. 80, 84, 224 A.2d 879, 881 (1965). The determination of the sufficiency of the evidence requires the appellate court simply to decide whether evidence exists on the basis of which a rational trier of fact could find the elements of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2788, 61 L.Ed.2d 560, 573 (1979); <em>Bloodsworth v. State, </em>307 Md. 164, 167, 512 A.2d 1056, 1057 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>In a stipulated case, unless the stipulation otherwise indicates, all of the evidence stipulated to is intended to be, and, in fact, is, considered by the trial court in deciding whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty. <em>Barnes v. State, </em>31 Md.App. 25, 35, 354 A.2d 499, 565 (1976). Thus, in a stipulated case there is no need to speculate as to what evidence the trier of fact used in making its determination. While it may be true that less than all of the evidence stipulated to would suffice to sustain a finding of guilt, that is not what the stipulated case contemplates. By holding that the stipulated evidence is sufficient to sustain a finding of guilt and to render improperly admitted evidence harmless error, the majority in effect applies an \u201cotherwise sufficient\u201d test, in place of the <em>Dorsey </em>test. <em>See Rubin, </em>325 Md. at 597, 602 A.2d at 696-97 (Bell, J. dissenting). Under that test, if the evidence is sufficient without the improper evidence, <em>i.e., </em>the jury could have convicted the defendant without it, harm could not result from its admission. <em>Id., </em>602 A.2d at 696-97. I repeat, the Court, thereby, further expands the harmless error rule so as to make it the general rule rather than the exception. <em>See Younie, </em>272 Md. at 248, 322 A.2d at 219, citing <em>Jablonski, </em>195 N.W.2d at 780. This is not to be condoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">I also find singularly unpersuasive the distinction that the majority draws between the statements. Conceivably, a statement made to an undercover police officer, in which the petitioner seeks to put a contract on the life of the victim, corroborated by another inmate, is more credible and would be more likely to influence the trier of fact\u2019s verdict as to the petitioner\u2019s guilt than simply a statement to a fellow inmate that he was involved in the crime. Certainly, it is well settled that evidence lending inferential support of a defendant\u2019s guilt by establishing consciousness of guilt is highly relevant and, therefore, routinely admitted for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">I therefore dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b826-6\">. I will not question the proposition the majority so firmly embraces in this case \u2014 that harmless error analysis applies whenever, in order to preserve for appeal a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress, a defendant enters a not guilty plea and proceeds to trial on stipulated evidence. There may be a rare case, perhaps the example proffered by the majority, <em>see </em>majority opinion at 692, in which the harmless error test enunciated in <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 350 A.2d 665 (1976), will be satisfied even though a portion of the stipulated evidence has been held to be inadmissible. I am satisfied, however, that the case <em>sub judice </em>is not such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">In this case, the petitioner proceeded to trial on stipulated evidence in order to ensure that he was able to challenge the court\u2019s ruling on his suppression motion without having to go through a full trial. By proceeding in that fashion, the trial court\u2019s decision on guilt or innocence was, and was expected to be, totally predictable; the trial court would find the petitioner guilty. <em>See Bunnell v. Superior Court, </em>13 Cal.3d 592, 119 Cal.Rptr. 302, 531 P.2d 1086 (1975); <em>see also </em>Jon D. Botsford, <em>Conditioned Guilty Pleas: Post Guilty Plea Appeal of Nonjurisdictional Issues, 26 </em>UCLA L.Rev. 360, 384 (1978). Viewed in this fashion, the petitioner's argument that the procedure he used is equivalent to the conditional guilty plea procedure, in which challenges to evidentiary rulings are permitted, and are recognized in a number of states and the federal courts, has considerable merit. <em>See Lefkowitz v. Newsome, </em>420 U.S. 283, 290-91 n. 7, 95 S.Ct. 886, 890 n. 7, 43 L.Ed.2d 196, 203 n. 7 (1975) (distinction between the conditional guilty plea and a stipulation mere \"infatuation with labels\u201d); <em>Sutton v. State, </em>289 Md. 359, 366, 424 A.2d 755, 759 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">In <em>Lefkowitz v. Newsome, </em>the United States Supreme Court noted that the procedure whereby a criminal defendant could stipulate to all the state\u2019s evidence while entering a plea of not guilty benefits a defendant who intends to appeal his pretrial claim of unlawful search and seizure without the desire of going through an entire trial. 420 U.S. at 291, 95 S.Ct. at 890, 43 L.Ed.2d at 203. Upon the inevitable entry of judgment of conviction, the defendant is able fully to pursue his state appellate remedies. <em>See id. </em>at 290-91 n. 7, 95 S.Ct. at 890 n. 7, 43 L.Ed.2d at 203 n. 7; <em>see also Bunnell, </em>13 Cal.3d 592, 119 Cal.Rptr. 302, 531 P.2d 1086 (stipulation procedure a viable method of preserving a defendant\u2019s statutory right of appeal on all issues).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-9\">By applying harmless error analysis in a case like the present one, the Court encourages the violation of the spirit, if not the letter, of the parties' agreement. Moreover, the Court encourages a party who is unable to anticipate the consequences of a not altogether successful appeal if he or she proceeds on a stipulated case, to proceed to trial simply to obtain review of a challenged motions ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
