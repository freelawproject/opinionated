At the time of the incident in question he was 20 years old. He has an I.Q. of 52. His guidance counselor from the Montgomery County public school system, Cynthia Parker, described him as a mildly retarded person who read on the third-grade level, did arithmetic on the 5th-grade level, and interacted with others socially at school at the level of someone 11 or 12 years of age. Ms. Parker added that Raymond attended special education classes and for at least one period of time was educated at home when he was afraid to return to school due to his classmates\u2019 taunting. Because he could not understand the duties of the jobs given him, he failed to complete vocational assignments; he sometimes lost his way to work. As Raymond was unable to pass any of the State\u2019s functional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>tests required for graduation, he received only a certificate of attendance rather than a high-school diploma.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">In November or December 1990, a friend introduced Raymond to Erica Frazier, then aged 13; the two subsequently talked occasionally by telephone. On February 28, 1991, Raymond, apparently wishing to call for a ride home, approached the girl\u2019s house at about nine o\u2019clock in the evening. Erica opened her bedroom window, through which Raymond entered; he testified that \u201cshe just told me to get a ladder and climb up her window.\u201d The two talked, and later engaged in sexual intercourse. Raymond left at about 4:30 a.m. the following morning. On November 19, 1991, Erica gave birth to a baby, of which Raymond is the biological father.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Raymond was tried before the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Miller, J.) on one count of second degree rape under \u00a7 463(a)(3) proscribing sexual intercourse between a person under 14 and another at least four years older than the complainant. At trial, the defense twice proffered evidence to the effect that Erica herself and her friends had previously told Raymond that she was 16 years old, and that he had acted with that belief. The trial court excluded such evidence as immaterial, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-7\">\u201cUnder 463, the only two requirements as relate to this case are that there was vaginal intercourse, [and] that ... Ms. Frazier was under 14 years of age and that ... Mr. Garnett was at least four years older than she.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-8\">\u201cIn the Court\u2019s opinion, consent is no defense to this charge. The victim\u2019s representation as to her age and the defendant\u2019s belief, if it existed, that she was not under age, what amounts to what otherwise might be termed a good faith defense, is in fact no defense to what amount[s] to statutory rape.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-9\">\u201cIt is in the Court\u2019s opinion a strict liability offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Azf\">The court found Raymond guilty. It sentenced him to a term of five years in prison, suspended the sentence and imposed five years of probation, and ordered that he pay restitution to Erica and the Frazier family. Raymond noted an appeal; we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>granted certiorari prior to intermediate appellate review by the Court of Special Appeals to consider the important issue presented in the case, 329 Md. 601, 620 A.2d 940.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">In 1975 the Legislative Council of the General Assembly established the Special Committee on Rape and Related Offenses, which proposed a complete revision of Maryland law pertaining to rape and other sex crimes. <em>See generally </em>J. William Pitcher, <em>Rape and Other Sexual Offense Law Reform in Maryland 1976-1977, </em>7 U.Balt.L.Rev. 151 (1977). Based on the Committee\u2019s work, Senate Bill 358 was introduced, amended, and enacted on May 17, 1976, as eh. 573 of the Acts of 1976. In part, it repealed the common law crime of rape, the former statutory prohibition of carnal knowledge of underage girls, and other related crimes and replaced them with the current array of criminal laws delineating two degrees of rape and four degrees of sexual offenses. <em>See </em>the 1976 Report of the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee on S.B. 358, at 1-5 and Code, Art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 462-464C; <em>see also </em>Richard P. Gilbert &amp; Charles E. Moylan, Jr., <em>Maryland Criminal Law: Practice and Procedure </em>65-66, 68-81 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">The new legislation reformulated the former statutory rape law by introducing the element of a four-year age difference between the accused and the underage complainant. Report of the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, at 2. As originally enacted by ch. 573 of the Acts of 1976, sexual intercourse with a person under 14 by an actor more than four years older was classified as rape in the first degree, and carried a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. The Legislature, by ch. 292 of the Acts of 1977, reduced the crime to rape in the second degree carrying a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. These reforms of 1976 and 1977 created the law now embodied in \u00a7 463(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">Section 463(a)(3) does not expressly set forth a requirement that the accused have acted with a criminal state of mind, or <em>mens rea. </em>The State insists that the statute, by design, defines a strict liability offense, and that its essential elements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>were met in the instant case when Raymond, age 20, engaged in vaginal intercourse with Erica, a girl under 14 and more than 4 years his junior. Raymond replies that the criminal law exists to assess and punish morally culpable behavior. He says such culpability was absent here. He asks us either to engraft onto subsection (a)(3) an implicit <em>mens rea </em>requirement, or to recognize an affirmative defense of reasonable mistake as to the complainant\u2019s age. Raymond argues that it is unjust, under the circumstances of this case which led him to think his conduct lawful, to brand him a felon and rapist.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Raymond asserts that the events of this case were inconsistent with the criminal sexual exploitation of a minor by an adult. As earlier observed, Raymond entered Erica\u2019s bedroom at the girl\u2019s invitation; she directed him to use a ladder to reach her window. They engaged voluntarily in sexual intercourse.. They remained together in the room for more than seven hours before Raymond departed at dawn. With an I.Q. of 52, Raymond functioned at approximately the same level as the 13-year-old Erica; he was mentally an adolescent in an adult\u2019s body. Arguably, had Raymond\u2019s chronological age, 20, matched his socio-intellectual age, about 12, he and Erica would have fallen well within the four-year age difference obviating a violation of the statute, and Raymond would not have been charged with any crime at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">The precise legal issue here rests on Raymond\u2019s unsuccessful efforts to introduce into evidence testimony that Erica and her friends had told him she was 16 years old, the age of consent to sexual relations, and that he believed them. Thus the trial court did not permit him to raise a defense of reasonable mistake of Erica\u2019s age, by which defense Raymond would have asserted that he acted innocently without a criminal design. At common law, a crime occurred only upon the concurrence of an individual\u2019s act and his guilty state of mind. <em>Dawkins v. State, </em>313 Md. 638, 643, 547 A.2d 1041 (1988). In this regard, it is well understood that generally there are two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>components of every crime, the <em>actus reus </em>or guilty act and the <em>mens rea </em>or the guilty mind or mental state accompanying a forbidden act. The requirement that an accused have acted with a culpable mental state is an axiom of criminal jurisprudence. Writing for the United States Supreme Court, Justice Robert Jackson observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-5\">\u201cThe contention that an injury can amount to a crime only when inflicted by intention is no provincial or transient notion. It is as universal and persistent in mature systems of law as belief in freedom of the human will and a consequent ability and duty of-the normal individual to choose between good and evil.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-6\">* # * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-7\">\u201cCrime as a compound concept, generally constituted only from a concurrence of an evil-meaning mind with an evildoing hand, was congenial to an intense individualism and took deep and early root in American soil.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-8\"><em>Morissette v. United States, </em>342 U.S. 246, 250-252, 72 S.Ct. 240, 243-244, 96 L.Ed. 288 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">To be sure, legislative bodies since the mid-19th century have created strict liability criminal offenses requiring no <em>mens rea. </em>Almost all such statutes responded to the demands of public health and welfare arising from the complexities of society after the Industrial Revolution. Typically misdemeanors involving only fines or other light penalties, these strict liability laws regulated food, milk, liquor, medicines and drugs, securities, motor vehicles and traffic, the labeling of goods for sale, and the like. <em>See Dawkins, supra, </em>313 Md. at 644-645, 547 A.2d 1041; <em>see generally </em>Francis Bowes Sayre, <em>Public Welfare Offenses, </em>33 Colum.L.Rev. 55 (1933); Richard G. Singer, <em>The Resurgence </em>of Mens Rea: <em>III </em>\u2014 The <em>Rise and Fall of Strict Criminal Liability, </em>30 B.C.L.Rev. 337, 340-373 (1989) (suggesting, however, that strict liability doctrine in the United States in the late 19th century was motivated largely by moralistic fervor, such as found in the prohibitionist movement); Wayne R. LaFave &amp; Austin W. Scott, Jr., <em>Criminal Law </em>242-243 (2d ed. 1986); 1 <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law </em>100-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>111 (Charles E. Torcia ed., 14th ed. 1978). Statutory rape, carrying the stigma of felony as well as a potential sentence of 20 years in prison, contrasts markedly with the other strict liability regulatory offenses and their light penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Modern scholars generally reject the concept of strict criminal liability. Professors LaFave and Scott summarize the consensus that punishing conduct without reference to the actor\u2019s state of mind fails to reach the desired end and is unjust:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-6\">\u201c \u2018It is inefficacious because conduct unaccompanied by an awareness of the factors making it criminal does not mark the actor as one who needs to be subjected to punishment in order to deter him or others from behaving similarly in the future, nor does it single him out as a socially dangerous individual who needs to be incapacitated or reformed. It is unjust because the actor is subjected to the stigma of a criminal conviction without being morally blameworthy. Consequently, on either a preventive or retributive theory of criminal punishment, the criminal sanction is inappropriate in the absence of <em>mens </em>rea.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">LaFave &amp; Scott, <em>supra, </em>at 248, <em>quoting </em>Herbert L. Packer, Mens Rea <em>and the Supreme Court, </em>1962 Sup.Ct.Rev. 107, 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">Dean Singer has articulated other weaknesses of strict criminal liability theory: 1) extensive government civil regulations and strict liability in tort achieve the same deterrent effect; 2) the judicial efficiency of dispatching minor offenses without an inquiry into <em>mens rea </em>is attained equally by decriminalizing them, and hearing such cases in a regulatory or administrative forum; 3) the small penalties imposed for most strict liability offenses oblige the public to engage in a pernicious game of distinguishing \u201creal\u201d crime from some lesser form of crime; 4) some strict liability laws may result from careless drafting; and 5) strict liability dilutes the moral force that the criminal law has historically carried. <em>Singer, supra, </em>at 389-397, 403-404. The author concludes that \u201cthe predicate for all criminal liability is blameworthiness; it is the social stigma which a finding of guilt carries that distinguishes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>the criminal [penalty] from all other sanctions. If the predicate is removed, the criminal law is set adrift.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 404-405.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Conscious of the disfavor in which strict criminal liability resides, the Model Penal Code states generally as a minimum requirement of culpability that a person is not guilty of a criminal offense unless he acts purposely, knowingly, recklessly, or negligently, <em>i.e., </em>with some degree of <em>mens rea. </em>Model Penal Code \u00a7 2.02 (Official Draft and Revised Comments 1980). The Code allows generally for a defense of ignorance or mistake of fact negating <em>mens rea. Id. </em>at \u00a7 2.04. The Model Penal Code generally recognizes strict liability for offenses deemed \u201cviolations,\u201d defined as wrongs subject only to a fine, forfeiture, or other civil penalty upon conviction, and not giving rise to any legal disability. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 1.04, 2.05.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">The commentators similarly disapprove of statutory rape as a strict liability crime. In addition to the arguments discussed above, they observe that statutory rape prosecutions often proceed even when the defendant\u2019s judgment as to the age of the complainant is warranted by her appearance, her sexual sophistication, her verbal misrepresentations, and the defendant\u2019s careful attempts to ascertain her true age. <em>See </em>Larry W. Myers, <em>Reasonable Mistake of Age: A Needed Defense to Statutory Rape, </em>64 Mich.L.Rev. 105, 106 (1965). Voluntary intercourse with a sexually mature teen-ager lacks the features of psychic abnormality, exploitation, or physical danger <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>that accompanies such conduct with children. <em>Id. </em>at 119-122.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See also </em>Richard A. Tonry, Comment, <em>Statutory Rape: A Critique, </em>26 La.L.Rev. 105 (1965); Michael McGillicuddy, Note, <em>Criminal Law: Mistake of Age as Defense to Statutory Rape, </em>18 U.Fla.L.Rev. 699 (1966); Dennis L. Pieragostini, Note, <em>Reasonable Mistake as to Age </em>\u2014 a, <em>Defense to Statutory Rape under the New Penal Code, </em>2 Conn.L.Rev. 433 (1969) (statute since superseded); Kelly Vance, Note, State v. Elton: <em>The Failure to Recognize a Defense to Statutory Rape, </em>1983 Utah L.Rev. 437 (case subsequently reversed upon reconsideration); Benjamin L. Reiss, Note, <em>Alaska\u2019s </em>Mens Rea <em>Requirements for Statutory Rape, </em>9 Alaska L.Rev. 377 (1992). <em>But see </em>Frances Olsen, <em>Statutory Rape: A Feminist Critique of Rights Analysis, </em>63 Tex.L.Rev. 387, 401-413 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Two sub-parts of the rationale underlying strict criminal liability require further analysis at this point. Statutory rape laws are often justified on the \u201clesser legal wrong\u201d theory or the \u201cmoral wrong\u201d theory; by such reasoning, the defendant acting without <em>mens rea </em>nonetheless deserves punishment for having committed a lesser crime, fornication, or for having violated moral teachings that prohibit sex outside of marriage. <em>See </em>LaFave &amp; Scott, <em>supra, </em>at 410-410; Myers, <em>supra, </em>at 127-129. Maryland has no law against fornication. It is not a crime in this state. Moreover, the criminalization of an act, performed without a guilty mind, deemed immoral by some members of the community rests uneasily on subjective and shifting norms. \u201c[D]etermining precisely what the \u2018community ethic\u2019 actually is [is] not an easy task in a heterogeneous society in which our public pronouncements about morality often are not synonymous with our private conduct.\u201d LaFave &amp; Scott, <em>supra, </em>at 411. The drafters of the Model Penal Code remarked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-6\">\u201c[T]he actor who reasonably believes that his partner is above that age [of consent] lacks culpability with respect to the factor deemed critical to liability. Punishing him any<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>way simply because his intended conduct would have been immoral under the facts as he supposed them to be postulates a relation between criminality and immorality that is inaccurate on both descriptive and normative grounds. The penal law does not try to enforce all aspects of community morality, and any thoroughgoing attempt to do so would extend the prospect of criminal sanctions far into the sphere of individual liberty and create a regime too demanding for all save the best among us.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-5\"><em>Id., </em>Comment to \u00a7 213.6, at 415. We acknowledge here that it is uncertain to what extent Raymond\u2019s intellectual and social retardation may have impaired his ability to comprehend imperatives of sexual morality in any case.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">The legislatures of 17 states have enacted laws permitting a mistake of age defense in some form in cases of sexual offenses with underage persons. In Kentucky, the accused may prove in exculpation that he did not know the facts or conditions relevant to the complainant\u2019s age. Ky.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 510.030 (1992). In Washington, the defendant may assert that he reasonably believed the complainant to be of a certain age based on the alleged victim\u2019s own declarations. Wash.Rev.Code Ann. \u00a7 9A.44.030 (1988, 1993 Cum.Supp.) In some states, the defense is available in instances where the complainant\u2019s age rises above a statutorily prescribed level, but is not available when the complainant falls below the defining age. <em>E.g. </em>Pa.Cons.Stat.Ann. tit. 18, \u00a7 3102 (1983) (defining critical age at 14); W.Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 61-8B-12 (1992 Repl.Vol.) (defining critical age at 11, defense subject to a recklessness standard); Or.Rev.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 163.325 (1990 Repl.Vol.) (defining critical age at 16).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In other states, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>availability of the defense depends on the severity of the sex offense charged to the accused. <em>E.g. </em>Minn.Stat.Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 609.-344-609.345 (1987, 1993 Cum.Supp.) (defense available for certain charges under third-degree and fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">In addition, the highest appellate courts of four states have determined that statutory rape laws by implication required an element of <em>mens rea </em>as to the complainant\u2019s age. In the landmark case of <em>People v. Hernandez, </em>61 Cal.2d 529, 39 Cal.Rptr. 361, 393 P.2d 673 (1964), the California Supreme Court held that, absent a legislative directive to the contrary, a charge of statutory rape was defensible wherein a criminal intent was lacking; it reversed the trial court\u2019s refusal to permit the defendant to present evidence of his good faith, reasonable belief that the complaining witness had reached the age of consent. In so doing, the court first questioned the assumption that age alone confers a sophistication sufficient to create legitimate consent to sexual relations: \u201cthe sexually experienced 15-year-old may be far more acutely aware of the implications of sexual intercourse than her sheltered cousin who is beyond the age of consent.\u201d <em>Id., </em>39 Cal.Rptr. at 362, 393 P.2d at 674. The court then rejected the traditional view that those who engage in sex with young persons do so at their peril, assuming the risk that their partners are underage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-5\">\u201c[I]f [the perpetrator] participates in a mutual act of sexual intercourse, believing his partner to be beyond the age of consent, with reasonable grounds for such belief, where is his criminal intent? In such circumstances he has not consciously taken any risk. Instead he has subjectively eliminated the risk by satisfying himself on reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>evidence that the crime cannot be committed. If it occurs that he has been mislead, we cannot realistically conclude for such reason alone the intent with which he undertook the act suddenly becomes more heinous.... [T]he courts have uniformly failed to satisfactorily explain the nature of the criminal intent present in the mind of one who in good faith believes he has obtained a lawful consent before engaging in the prohibited act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-5\"><em>Id., </em>39 Cal.Rptr. at 364, 393 P.2d at 676.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">The Supreme Court of Alaska has held that a charge of statutory rape is legally unsupportable unless a defense of reasonable mistake of age is allowed. <em>State v. Guest, </em>583 P.2d 836,- 838-839 (Alaska 1978). The Supreme Court of Utah construed the applicable unlawful sexual intercourse statute to \u2022 mean that a conviction could not result unless the state proved a criminal state of mind as to each element of the offense, including the victim\u2019s age. <em>State v. Elton, </em>680 P.2d 727, 729 (Utah 1984) (Utah Criminal Code since amended to disallow mistake of age as a defense to unlawful sexual intercourse).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Supreme Court of New Mexico determined that a defendant should have been permitted at trial to present a defense that his partner in consensual sex told him she was 17, not 15, that this had been confirmed to him by others, and that he had acted under that mistaken belief. <em>Perez v. State, </em>111 N.M. 160, 803 P.2d 249, 250-251 (1990). Two-fifths of the states, therefore, now recognize the defense in cases of statutory sexual offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">We think it sufficiently clear, however, that Maryland\u2019s second degree rape statute defines a strict liability offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>that does not require the State to prove <em>mens rea; </em>it makes no allowance for a mistake-of-age defense. The plain language of \u00a7 463, viewed in its entirety, and the legislative history of its creation lead to this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">It is well settled that in interpreting a statute to ascertain and effectuate its goal, our first recourse is to the words of the statute, giving them their ordinary and natural import. <em>Fairbanks v. McCarter, </em>330 Md. 39, 46, 622 A.2d 121 (1993); <em>NCR Corp. v. Comptroller, </em>313 Md. 118, 124, 544 A.2d 764 (1988). While penal statutes are to be strictly construed in favor of the defendant, the construction must ultimately depend upon discerning the intention of the Legislature when it drafted and enacted the law in question. <em>State v. Kennedy, </em>320 Md. 749, 754-755, 580 A.2d 193 (1990); <em>Davis v. State, </em>319 Md. 56, 60-61, 570 A.2d 855 (1990). To that end, the Court may appropriately look at the larger context, including external manifestations of the legislative purpose, within which statutory language appears. <em>Fairbanks v. McCarter, supra, </em>330 Md. at 46, 622 A.2d 121; <em>Dickerson v. State, </em>324 Md. 163, 170-171, 596 A.2d 648 (1991); <em>Morris v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>319 Md. 597, 603-604, 573 A.2d 1346 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Section 463(a)(3) prohibiting sexual intercourse with underage persons makes no reference to the actor\u2019s knowledge, belief, or other state of mind. As we see it, this silence as to <em>mens rea </em>results from legislative design. First, subsection (a)(3) stands in stark contrast to the provision immediately before it, subsection (a)(2) prohibiting vaginal intercourse with incapacitated or helpless persons. In subsection (a)(2), the Legislature expressly provided as an element of the offense that \u201cthe person performing the act <em>knows or should reasonably know </em>the other person is mentally defective, mentally incapacitated, or physically helpless.\u201d Code, \u00a7 463(a)(2) (emphasis added). In drafting this subsection, the Legislature showed itself perfectly capable of recognizing and allowing for a defense that obviates criminal intent; if the defendant objectively did not understand that the sex partner was im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>paired, there is no crime. That it chose not to include similar language in subsection (a)(3) indicates that the Legislature aimed to make statutory rape with underage persons a more severe prohibition based on strict criminal liability. <em>See McAlear v. McAlear, </em>298 Md. 320, 343-344, 469 A.2d 1256 (1984) (a court must read the language of a statute in relation to all of its provisions in determining legislative intent); <em>Pennsylvania Nat\u2019l Mut. v. Gartelman, </em>288 Md. 151, 159, 416 A.2d 734 (1980) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Second, an examination of the drafting history of \u00a7 463 during the 1976 revision of Maryland\u2019s sexual offense laws reveals that the statute was viewed as one of strict liability from its inception and throughout the amendment process. As originally proposed, Senate Bill 358 defined as a sexual offense in the first degree a sex act committed with a person less than 14 years old by an actor four or more years older.. <em>See </em>the 1976 Report of the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee on S.B. 358, at 1-2. The Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee then offered a series of amendments to the bill. Among them, Amendment # 13 reduced the stipulated age of the victim from less than 14 to 12 or less. 1976 Senate Journal, at 1363. Amendment # 16 then added a provision defining a sexual offense in the second degree as a sex act with another \u201cunder 14 years of age, which age the person performing the sexual act knows or should know.\u201d 1976 Senate Journal, at 1364. These initial amendments suggest that, at the very earliest stages of the bill\u2019s life, the Legislature distinguished between some form of strict criminal liability, applicable to offenses where the victim was age 12 . or under, and a lesser offense with a <em>mens rea </em>requirement when the victim was between the ages of 12 and 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">Senate Bill 358 in its amended form was passed by the Senate on March 11,1976. 1976 Senate Journal, at 1566. The House of Delegates\u2019 Judiciary Committee, however, then proposed changes of its own. It rejected the Senate amendments, and defined an offense of rape, without a <em>mens rea </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>requirement, for sexual acts performed with someone under the age of 14. <em>See </em>1976 House Journal, at 3686.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Senate concurred in the House amendments and S.B. 358 became law. 1976 House Journal, at 3761; 1976 Senate Journal, at 3429; 1976 Acts of Maryland, at 1536. Thus the Legislature explicitly raised, considered, and then explicitly jettisoned any notion of a <em>mens rea </em>element with respect to the complainant\u2019s age in enacting the law that formed the basis of current \u00a7 463(a)(3). In the light of such legislative action, we must inevitably conclude that the current law imposes strict liability on its violators.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">This interpretation is consistent with the traditional view of statutory rape as a strict liability crime designed to protect young persons from the dangers of sexual exploitation by adults, loss of chastity, physical injury, and, in the case of girls, pregnancy. <em>See Michael M. v. Sonoma County Superior Court, </em>450 U.S. 464, 470, 101 S.Ct. 1200, 1204-05, 67 L.Ed.2d 437 (1981); Rita Eidson, Note, <em>The Constitutionality of Statutory Rape Laws, </em>27 UCLA L.Rev. 757, 760-761 (1980). The majority of states retain statutes which impose strict liability for sexual acts with underage complainants. We observe again, as earlier, that even among those states providing for a mistake-of-age defense in some instances, the defense often is not available where the sex partner is 14 years old or less; the complaining witness in the instant case was only 13. The majority of appellate courts, including the Court of Special Appeals, have held statutory rape to be a strict liability crime. <em>Eggleston v. State, </em>4 Md.App. 124, 241 A.2d 433 (1968); <em>see </em>the compilation in W.E. Shipley, Annotation, <em>Mistake or Lack of Information as to Victim\u2019s Age as Defense to Statutory Rape, 8 </em>A.L.R.3d 1100 (1966, 1992 Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>VI</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Maryland\u2019s second degree rape statute is by nature a creature of legisl\u00e1tion. Any new provision introducing an element of <em>mens rea, </em>or permitting a defense of reasonable mistake of age, with respect to the offense of sexual intercourse with a person less than 14, should properly result from an act of the Legislature itself, rather than judicial fiat. Until then, defendants in extraordinary cases, like Raymond, will rely upon the tempering discretion of the trial court at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT AFFIRMED, WITH COSTS.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b704-9\">. \"If any person shall carnally know and abuse any woman-child under the age of ten years, every such carnal knowledge shall be deemed felony, and the offender, being convicted thereof, shall, at the discretion of the court, suffer death by hanging ... or undergo a confinement in the penitentiary for a period not less than one year nor more than twenty-one years.\u201d Ch. 138, Sec. 4, 7th.

The majority indicates that the defendant\u2019s \u201cknowledge, belief, or other state of mind\u201d is wholly immaterial. The majority opinion at one point states: \u201cWe acknowledge here that it is uncertain to what extent Raymond\u2019s intellectual and social retardation may have impaired his ability to comprehend imperatives of sexual morality in any case.\u201d Nevertheless, according to the majority, it was permissible for the trial judge to have precluded exploration into Raymond\u2019s knowledge and comprehension because the offense is entirely one of strict liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-10\">Judge Bell\u2019s dissent, however, argues that, under the due process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Maryland Declaration of Rights, any \u201cdefendant may defend on the basis that he was mistaken as to the age of the prosecutrix.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>In my view, the issue concerning a <em>mens rea </em>requirement in \u00a7 463(a)(3) is not limited to a choice between one of the extremes set forth in the majority\u2019s and Judge Bell\u2019s opinions. I agree with the majority that an ordinary defendant\u2019s mistake about the age of his or her sexual partner is not a defense to a prosecution under \u00a7 463(a)(3). Furthermore I am not persuaded, at least at the present time, that either the federal or state constitutions require that a defendant\u2019s honest belief that the other person was above the age of consent be a defense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This does not mean, however, that the statute contains no <em>mens rea </em>requirement at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">The legislative history of \u00a7 463(a)(3), set forth in the majority opinion, demonstrates that the House of Delegates rejected the Senate\u2019s proposed requirement that an older person, having sexual relations with another under 14 years of age, know or should know that the other person was under 14. The House of Delegates\u2019 version was ultimately adopted. From this, the majority concludes that the enacted version was \u201cwithout a <em>mens rea </em>requirement.\u201d The majority\u2019s conclusion does not necessarily follow. Although the General Assembly rejected one specific knowledge requirement, it did not decree that any and all evidence concerning a defendant\u2019s knowledge and comprehension was immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">There are pure strict liability offenses where \u201cthe purpose of the penalty is to regulate rather than to punish behavior\u201d and where criminal \u201cliability is imposed regardless of the defendant\u2019s state of mind,\u201d <em>Dawkins v. State, </em>313 Md. 638, 645, 547 A.2d 1041 (1988). These \u201coffenses commonly involve light fines or penalties,\u201d <em>Dawkins, </em>313 Md. at 644, 547 A.2d at 1044. There are other offenses (also unfortunately often called \u201cstrict liability\u201d offenses) where the legislature has dispensed with a knowledge requirement in one respect but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>has not intended to impose criminal liability regardless of the defendant\u2019s state of mind.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Such offenses</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARK\">\u201cdo require \u2018fault\u2019 ..., in that they \u2018can be interpreted as legislative judgments that persons who intentionally engage in certain activities and occupy some peculiar or distinctive position of control are to be held accountable for the occurrence of certain consequences.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">W. LaFave <em>&amp; </em>A. Scott, Jr., <em>Substantive Criminal Law, </em>ch. 3, \u00a7 3.8(c), at 349 (1986), quoting Wasserstrom, <em>Strict Criminal Liability, </em>12 Stan.L.Rev. 731, 743 (1960). <em>See also </em>P.

The penalty provision for a violation of \u00a7 463(a)(3), namely making the offense a felony punishable by a maximum of 20 years imprisonment (\u00a7 463(b)), is strong evidence that the General Assembly did not intend to create a pure strict liability offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">In the typical situation involving an older person\u2019s engaging in consensual sexual activities with a teenager below the age of consent, and the scenario which the General Assembly likely contemplated when it enacted \u00a7\u00a7 463(a)(3), 464A(a)(3), 464B(a)(3), 4640(a)(2), and 4640(a)(3), the defendant knows and intends that he or she is engaging in sexual activity with a young person. In addition, the defendant knows that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>activity is regarded as immoral and/or improper by large segments of society. Moreover, the defendant is aware that \u201cconsent\u201d by persons who are too young is ineffective. Although in a particular case the defendant may honestly but mistakenly believe, because of representations or appearances, that the other person is above the age of consent, the ordinary defendant in such case is or ought to be aware that there is a risk that the young person is not above the age of consent. As the majority opinion points out, \u201cthe traditional view [is] that those who engage in sex with young persons do so at their peril, assuming the risk that their partners are underage .... \u201d It seems to me that the above-mentioned knowledge factors, and particularly the mental ability to appreciate that one is taking a risk, constitute the <em>mem rea </em>of the offenses defined by \u00a7\u00a7 463(a)(3), 464A(a)(3), 464B(a)(3), 4640(a)(2) and 4640(a)(3). In enacting these provisions, the General Assembly assumed that a defendant is able to appreciate the risk involved by intentionally and knowingly engaging in sexual activities with a young person. There is no indication that the General Assembly intended that criminal liability attach to one who, because of his or her mental impairment, was unable to appreciate that risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">It is unreasonable to assume that the Legislature intended for one to be convicted under \u00a7 463(a)(3), or under any of the other statutes proscribing sexual activity with underage persons, regardless of his or her mental state. Suppose, for example, that Raymond Garnett had not had an I.Q. of 52, but rather, had been more severely mentally retarded as was the young woman involved in <em>Wentzel v. Montgomery Gen. Hosp., </em>293 Md. 685, 447 A.2d 1244, <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1147, 103 S.Ct. 790, 74 L.Ed.2d 995 (1983). The mentally retarded person in <em>Wentzel </em>had an I.Q. of 25-30, was physiologically capable of bearing a child, but was unable to comprehend the act of sexual intercourse, or even to understand the difference between the sexes. If someone so disabled, having reached Raymond\u2019s chronological age, then had \u201cconsensual\u201d sexual intercourse with a person younger than fourteen years of age, I do not believe that he or she would have violated Art. 27, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>\u00a7 463(a)(3). Under the view that \u00a7\u00a7 463(a)(3), 464A(a)(3), 464B(a)(3), etc., define pure strict liability offenses without any regard for the defendant\u2019s mental state, presumably a 20 year old, who passes out because of drinking too many alcoholic beverages, would be guilty of a sexual offense if a 13 year old engages in various sexual activities with the 20 year old while the latter is unconscious. I cannot imagine that the General Assembly intended any such result.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">An impaired mental condition may show the absence of <em>mens rea, </em>depending upon the circumstances. <em>See, e.g., Simmons v. State, </em>313 Md. 33, 39 n. 3, 542 A.2d 1258, 1261 n. 3 (1988); <em>Hoey v. State, </em>311 Md. 473, 494-495, 536 A.2d 622 (1988). In light of the defendant Garnett\u2019s mental retardation, and its effect upon his knowledge and comprehension, he may or may not have had the requisite <em>mens rea. </em>As previously mentioned, the majority opinion itself acknowledges that it is uncertain to what extent Raymond\u2019s intellectual and social retardation may have impaired his ability to comprehend standards of sexual morality. The problem in this case is that the trial judge\u2019s view of the statute, which the majority adopts, precluded an exploration into the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">The majority points out that the trial court would not allow testimony that Erica and her friends had told the defendant that she was 16 years old. The trial court, however, went further. The court would not allow the defendant to testify concerning his knowledge. More importantly, the trial judge took the position that the offense proscribed by \u00a7 463(a)(3) is \u201ca strict liability offense\u201d and that the only requirements for conviction were that \u201cthe defendant had sexual intercourse with Erica Frazier, that at that time she was 13 years of age, [and] at that time the defendant was more than 4 years older than she. These are the only requirements that the State need prove beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d The trial court\u2019s position that the offense lacked any <em>mens rea </em>requirement, and that the defendant\u2019s mental state was wholly immaterial, was, in my view, erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">I would reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b719-7\">. In this connection, it should be noted that the defendant-appellant, in his opening brief in this Court, made no constitutional argument either directly or by invoking the principle of statutory construction that a statute should be construed so as to avoid a serious constitutional problem. Consequently, the State had no opportunity to brief the constitutional issue discussed in Judge Bell\u2019s dissent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b720-8\">. As pointed out by one commentator, \"it can be argued that if strict liability statutes are to be characterized as 'strict' because of their failure to permit inquiry as to the defendant\u2019s state of mind, this description is too broad. More appropriately, each criminal statute must be examined to determine in what respects it is \u2018strict.\u2019 \u201d Wasserstrom, <em>Strict Criminal Liability, </em>12 Stan.L.Rev. 731, 742 (1960).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b723-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>ROBERT M.

Nor do I disagree that it is in the public interest to protect the sexually naive child from the adverse physical, emotional, or psychological effects of sexual relations. I do not believe, however, that the General Assembly, in every case, whatever the nature of the crime and no matter how harsh the potential penalty, can subject a defendant to strict criminal liability. To hold, <em>as a matter of law, </em>that section 463(a)(3)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> does not require the State to prove that a defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>possessed the necessary mental state to commit the crime, <em>ie. </em>knowingly engaged in sexual relations with a female under 14, or that the defendant may not litigate that issue in defense, \u201coffends a principle of justice so rooted in the traditions of conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental\u201d and is, therefore, inconsistent with due process. <em>See United States v. Ransom, </em>942 F.2d 775, 776-77 (10th Cir.1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 112 S.Ct. 897, 116 L.Ed.2d 799 (1992), quoting <em>Snyder v. Massachusetts, </em>291 U.S. 97, 105, 54 S.Ct. 330, 332, 78 L.Ed. 674, 677 (1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>according to the defendant, he intended to have sex with a 16, not a 13, year old girl. This mistake of fact was prompted, he said, by the prosecutrix herself; she and her friends told him that she was 16 years old. Because he was mistaken as to the prosecutrix\u2019s age, he submits, he is certainly less culpable than the person who knows that the minor is 13 years old, but nonetheless engages in sexual relations with her. Notwithstanding, the majority has construed section 463(a)(3) to exclude any proof of knowledge or intent. But for that construction, the proffered defense would be viable. I would hold that the State is not relieved of its burden to prove the defendant\u2019s intent or knowledge in a statutory rape case and, therefore, that the defendant may defend on the basis that he was mistaken as to the age of the prosecutrix.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>I. Mens Rea Generally</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Generally, a culpable mental state, often referred to as <em>mens tea, see </em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law, \u00a7 27, or intent, is, and long has been, an essential element of a criminal offense. <em>Morissette v. United States, </em>342 U.S. 246, 251-52, 72 S.Ct. 240, 244, 96 L.Ed. 288, 294 (1952); <em>Tate v. State, </em>236 Md. 312, 203 A.2d 882 (1964); <em>Davis v.

A crime ordinarily consists of prohibited conduct <em>and </em>a culpable mental state; a wrongful act and a wrongful intent must concur to constitute what the law deems a crime, the purpose being to avoid criminal liability for innocent or inadvertent conduct. <em>See Dawkins v. State, </em>313 Md. 638, 643, 547 A.2d 1041, 1043 (1988); <em>see also </em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law, \u00a7 27, citing <em>United States v. Fox, </em>95 U.S. 670, 24 L.Ed. 538 (1877). Historically, therefore, unless the actor also harbored an evil, or otherwise culpable, mind, he or she was not guilty of any crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">The Supreme Court in <em>Morissette, </em>recognized that ordinarily, a defendant cannot be convicted when he or she lacks the mental state which is an element of the offense charged. That concept \u2014 crime as a compound concept \u2014 gained early acceptance in the English Common law and \u201ctook deep and early root in American soil.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 342 U.S. at 251-52, 72 S.Ct. at 244, 96 L.Ed. at 294 (footnote omitted). In that case, Mr. Justice Jackson stated the proposition thusly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-7\">The contention that an injury can amount to a crime only when inflicted by intention is no provincial or transient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>notion. It is as universal and persistent in mature systems of law as belief in freedom of the human will and a consequent ability and duty of the normal individual to choose between good and evil. A relation between some mental element and punishment for a harmful act is almost as instinctive as the child\u2019s familiar exculpatory \u201cBut I didn\u2019t mean to,\u201d and has afforded the rational basis for a tardy and unfinished substitution of deterrence and reformation in place of retaliation and vengeance as the motivation for public prosecution. Unqualified acceptance of this doctrine by English common law in the Eighteenth Century was indicated by Blackstone\u2019s sweeping statement that to constitute any crime there must first be a \u201cvicious will.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 250-51, 72 S.Ct. at 243, 96 L.Ed. at 294 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">In <em>Morissette, (id. </em>at 247-48, 72 S.Ct. at 242, 96 L.Ed. at 292-93), the defendant, a scrap iron collector, went onto a government bombing range, where bomb casings were piled haphazardly. Morissette loaded the casings onto his truck in broad daylight and took them. He was indicted for \u201cunlawfully, wilfully and knowingly stealing] and converting]\u201d property of the United States, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 641. He sought to defend on the basis that he thought the casings were abandoned, unwanted, and of no value to the government. The trial court refused to permit evidence on that point, which was affirmed on appeal. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that where intent is an essential element of the crime charged, its existence is a question of fact for the jury, and \u201cthe trial court may not withdraw or prejudge the issue by instruction that the law raises a presumption of intent from an act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 274, 72 S.Ct. at 255, 96 L.Ed. at 306. It was in this context that the Court discussed the importance of intent. The Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-7\">The unanimity with which they [courts] have adhered to the central thought that wrongdoing must be conscious to be criminal is emphasized by the variety, disparity and confusion of their definitions of the requisite but elusive mental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>element. However, courts of various jurisdictions, and for the purposes of different offenses, have devised working formulae, if not scientific ones, for the instruction of juries around such terms as \u201cfelonious intent,\u201d \u201ccriminal intent,\u201d \u201cmalice aforethought,\u201d \u201cguilty knowledge,\u201d \u201cfraudulent intent,\u201d \u201cwillfulness,\u201d <em>\u201cscienter,\u201d </em>to denote guilty knowledge or <em>\u201cmens rea,\u201d </em>to signify an evil purpose or mental culpability-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 252, 72 S.Ct. at 244, 96 L.Ed. at 294-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">More recently, in <em>Anderson v. State, </em>328 Md. 426, 444, 614 A.2d 963, 972 (1992), we held that the trial court improperly convicted the defendant for carrying concealed, pursuant to Article 27, \u00a7 36(a), a utility knife without considering the intent with which the utility knife was being carried. Noting that the utility knife could be used both as a tool and as a weapon, <em>id. </em>at 437-39, 614 A.2d at 968-69, we rejected the State\u2019s argument that no intent was required. <em>Id. </em>at 444, 614 A.2d at 971. We said instead that, when the object is not a dangerous weapon <em>per se, </em>to convict a defendant of carrying a concealed dangerous weapon requires proof that the defendant intended to use the object as a weapon. <em>Id. </em>at 444, 614 A.2d at 971.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">Although it recognized that Congress could dispense with the intent requirement if it did so specifically, the Court made clear that that power was not without limit. <em>Morissette, </em>342 U.S. at 275, 72 S.Ct. at 256, 96 L.Ed. at 307, citing <em>Tot v. United States, </em>319 U.S. 463, 467, 63 S.Ct. 1241, 1245, 87 L.Ed. 1519, 1524 (1943). Thus, when a legislature wants to eliminate intent as an element of a particular crime, it should expressly so state in the statute. <em>See </em>Larry W. Myers, <em>Reasonable Mistake of Age: A Needed Defense to Statutory Rape, </em>64 Mich.L.Rev. 105,118-19 (1965); <em>see also People v. Hernandez, </em>61 Cal.2d 529, 536, 39 Cal.Rptr. 361, 365, 393 P.2d 673, 677 (1964) (\u201cin the absence of a legislative direction otherwise, a charge of statutory rape is defensible wherein criminal intent is lacking.\u201d); Singer, <em>supra, </em>at 397. Legislative imposition of strict criminal liability, however, must be within constitutional limits; it cannot be permitted to violate the Due Process requirement of the Fourteenth Amendment, <em>see Lambert v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number><em>California, </em>355 U.S. 225, 227, 78 S.Ct. 240, 242, 2 L.Ed.2d 228 (1957), or a comparable state constitutional provision. <em>See infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">II. Strict Liability Crimes</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">Strict liability crimes are recognized exceptions to the \u201cguilty mind\u201d rule in that they do not require the actor to possess a guilty mind, or the <em>mens rea, </em>to commit a crime. <em>See Morissette, </em>342 U.S. at 251-52 n. 8, 72 S.Ct. at 244 n. 8, 96 L.Ed. at 294 n. 8. His or her state of mind being irrelevant, the actor is guilty of the crime at the moment that he or she does the prohibited act.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">In the evolution of the statutory criminal law, two classes of strict liability crimes have emerged. Richard A. Tonry, <em>Statutory Rape: A Critique, </em>La.L.Rev. 105 (1965). One of them consists of \u201cpublic welfare\u201d offenses. <em>See id.; see also Dawkins, </em>313 Md. 638, 547 A.2d 1041. Typical of this class are statutes involving, for example, the sale of food, drugs, liquor, and traffic offenses, <em>see </em>Tonry, <em>supra, </em>at 106, designed to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the community at large; violation of such statutes \u201cdepend on no mental element but consists] only of forbidden acts or omissions.\u201d <em>Morissette, </em>342 U.S. 246, 72 S.Ct. 240, 96 L.Ed. 288. In the case of public welfare offenses, strict liability is justified on several bases, including: (1) only strict liability can deter profit-driven manufacturers from ignoring the well-being of the consuming public; (2) an inquiry into <em>mens rea </em>would exhaust the resources of the courts; (3) imposition of strict liability is not inconsistent with the moral underpinnings of the criminal law because the penalties are small and carry no stigma; and (4) the legislature is constitutionally empowered to create strict liability crimes for public welfare offenses. Singer, <em>supra, </em>at 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-10\">In <em>Dawkins, </em>313 Md. at 644-645, 547 A.2d at 1044-45, this Court discussed the development of public welfare offenses and noted their characteristics:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>\u201cPublic Welfare Offenses\u201d are generally regulatory in nature. The earliest cases involved liquor and adulterated milk.... Later cases expanded the doctrine to apply to violations of traffic regulations and motor vehicle laws, sales or misbranded articles, and sales or purchases in violation of anti-narcoties laws.... These offenses commonly involve light fines or penalties____ \u201c[T]he penalty in such cases is so slight that the courts can afford to disregard the individual in protecting the social interest.... \u201d Additionally, the purpose of the penalty is to regulate rather than to punish behavior.... While liability is imposed regardless of the defendant\u2019s state of mind, the defendant is generally in a position to prevent the violation from occurring....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">313 Md. at 645, 547 A.2d at 1044 (citations omitted). The Supreme Court has also commented on such offenses, observing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-9\">These cases do not fit neatly into any of such accepted classifications of common-law offenses, such as those against the state, the person, property, or public morals. Many of these offenses are not in the nature of positive aggressions or invasions, with which the common law so often dealt, but are in the nature of neglect where the law requires care, or inaction where it imposes a duty. Many violations of such regulations result in no direct or immediate injury to person or property but merely create the danger or probability of it which the law seeks to minimize. While such offenses do not threaten the security of the state in the manner of treason, they may be regarded as offenses against its authority, for their occurrence impairs the efficiency of controls deemed essential to the social order as presently constituted. In this respect, whatever the intent of the violator, the injury is the same, and the consequences are injurious or not according to fortuity. Hence, legislation applicable to such offenses, as a matter of policy, does not specify intent as a necessary element. The accused, if he does not will the violation, usually is in a position to prevent it with no more care than society might reasonably expect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>and no more exertion than it might reasonably exact from one who assumed his responsibilities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-5\"><em>Morissette, </em>342 U.S. at 255-56, 72 S.Ct. at 246, 96 L.Ed. at 296. To like effect,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-6\">... public welfare offenses are <em>new </em>crimes, created solely by legislative enactments in the nature of police regulations. Moreover, these offenses are not strictly criminal, even though traditional criminal sanctions are relied upon, since the primary purpose of the legislature is neither punishment nor correction, but rather regulation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">Myers, <em>supra, </em>at 114 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">Obviously, and the majority concurs, <em>see </em>majority opinion at 579, \u201cstatutory rape\u201d is not merely a public welfare offense; it simply does not \u201cfit\u201d the characteristics of such an offense: it is a felony, not a misdemeanor. In striking contrast to \u201cother strict liability regulatory offenses and their light penalties,\u201d majority opinion at 579, the potential penalty of 20 years imprisonment is not a light penalty; unlike the \u201cgarden variety\u201d strict liability penalty, the penalty under section 463(a)(3), is neither so insignificant that it can be ignored as a criminal sanction, <em>see </em>Singer, <em>supra, </em>at 394, nor so slight that the fate of the defendant can be ignored, <em>see </em>Wayne R. LaFave and Austin W. Scott, Jr., <em>Criminal Law, </em>\u00a7 31, at 219 (1972) (\u201cThe greater the possible punishment, the more likely some fault is required; and conversely, the lighter the possible punishment, the more likely the legislature meant to impose liability without fault.\u201d); and section 463\u2019s primary purpose is to penalize the \u201crapist\u201d, not to correct his or her behavior.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-10\">The second class of strict liability offenses, having a different justification than public welfare offenses, consists of nar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>cotic,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> bigamy,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> adultery, and statutory rape crimes. <em>See Morissette, </em>342 U.S. at 251 n. 8, 72 S.Ct. at 244 n. 8, 96 L.Ed. at 294 n. 8; Tonry, <em>supra, </em>at 106. State legislatures have historically used two theories to justify imposing strict liability in this class of offense: \u201clesser legal wrong\u201d and \u201cmoral wrong.\u201d <em>See </em>Benjamin L. Reiss, <em>Alaska\u2019s Mens Rea Requirements for Statutory Rape, </em>9 Alaska L.Rev. 377, 381-82 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">The lesser legal wrong theory posits that a defendant who actually intended to do some legal or moral wrong is guilty not only of the crime intended but of a greater crime of which he or she may not have the requisite mental state. LaFave and Scott, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 47, at 360. The elimination of a <em>mens rea </em>element for statutory rape is rationalized by focusing on the defendant\u2019s intent to commit a related crime. Reiss, <em>supra, </em>at 381. In other words, if fornication<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>, engaging in sexual intercourse out of wedlock, <em>see generally </em>Model Penal Code, \u00a7 213.6, Comment at 430-39, is a crime, a defendant intending to engage in sex out of wedlock is made to suffer all of the legal consequences of that act. Statutory rape is such a legal consequence when the other participant is below the age of consent. Reiss, <em>supra, </em>at 382. The theory is premised, in short, upon the proposition that, as to certain crimes, \u201ca \u2018guilty mind\u2019 in a very general sense, should suffice for the imposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>of penal sanctions even when the defendant did not intentionally or knowingly engage in the acts proscribed in the statute.\u201d <em>See </em>LaFave and Scott, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 47, at 361.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">The seminal case in this area is <em>Regina v. Prince, </em>L.R. 2 Cr.Cas.Res. 154 (1875), <em>cited in </em>Myers, <em>supra, </em>at 110 and Model Penal Code, \u00a7 213.6, Comment at 414 n. 6. There, the defendant was charged with unlawfully taking a girl under the age of 16 out of the possession of the father against his will. The defendant claimed that he acted on the reasonable belief that the girl was 18. The court held that it was no defense that he thought he was committing a different kind of wrong from that which he, in fact, was committing, it being wrong to remove a daughter, even one over 16, from her father\u2019s household.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">The lesser legal wrong theory does not provide a viable rationale for holding a defendant strictly liable for statutory rape where premarital sex is not criminal.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Reiss, <em>supra, </em>at 382. <em>See </em>LaFave and Scott, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 47, at 361 (\u201c[W]here fornication is itself not criminal it [statutory rape] should not become criminal merely because the defendant has made a reasonable mistake about the age of the girl with whom he has intercourse\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Fornication is not a crime in Maryland. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number><em>Baker v. Lease, </em>236 Md. 246, 248, 203 A.2d 700, 701 (1964). Accordingly, in Maryland, there is no underlying offense from which to transfer intent. Moreover,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-5\">[a] man who engages in consensual intercourse in the reasonable belief that his partner has reached [the age of consent<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>] evidences no abnormality, no willingness to take advantage of immaturity, no propensity to corruption of minors. In short, he has demonstrated neither intent nor inclination to violate any of the interests that the law of statutory rape seeks to protect. At most, he has disregarded religious precept or social convention. In terms of mental culpability, his conduct is indistinguishable from that of any other person who engages in fornication. Whether he should be punished at all depends on a judgment about continuing fornication as a criminal offense, but at least he should not be subject to felony sanctions for statutory rape.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0j\">Model Penal Code \u00a7 213.6, Comment at 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">In utilizing the moral wrong theory, State legislatures seek to justify strict criminal liability for statutory rape when non-marital sexual intercourse is not a crime on the basis of society\u2019s characterization of it as immoral or wrong, <em>i.e., malum in se.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Reiss, <em>supra, </em>at 382. The intent to commit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>such immoral acts supplies the <em>mens rea </em>for the related, but unintended crime; the outrage upon public decency or good morals, not conduct that is wrong only because it is prohibited by legislation, <em>malum prohibitum, </em>is the predicate.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">There are significant problems with the moral wrong theory. First, it is questionable whether morality should be the basis for legislation or interpretation of the law. <em>See </em>Tonry, <em>supra, </em>at 113; <em>see also </em>Singer, <em>supra, </em>at 338 (moral blame should be abolished as a predicate for criminal liability). Immorality is not synonymous with illegality; intent to do an immoral act does not equate to intent to do a criminal act. Inferring criminal intent from immorality, especially when the accused is not even aware that the act is criminal, seems unjustifiable and unfair. <em>See </em>Reiss, <em>supra, </em>at 382. In addition, the values and morals of society are ever evolving. Because sexual intercourse between consenting unmarried adults and minors who have reached the age of consent is not now clearly considered to be immoral, the moral wrong theory does not support strict criminal liability for statutory rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Second, classifying an act as immoral, in and of itself, divorced from any consideration of the actor\u2019s intention, is contrary to the general consensus of what makes an act moral or immoral. <em>See </em>Tonry, <em>supra, </em>at 113. Ordinarily, an act is either moral or immoral depending on the intention of the actor. <em>Id., </em>citing Holmes, <em>Early Forms of Liability, </em>in The Common Law 7 (Howe ed. 1963), citing Bradley, <em>Ethical Studies, </em>Essay 1 (1876) (\u201cEven a dog distinguishes between being stumbled over and being kicked.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">Third, the assertion that the act alone will suffice for liability without the necessity of proving criminal intent is contrary to the traditional demand of the criminal law that only the act plus criminal intent is sufficient to constitute a crime. <em>See </em>Tonry, <em>supra, </em>at 113. \u201cMoral duties should not be identified with criminal duties,\u201d and, thus, when fornication is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>itself not criminal it should not become criminal merely because the defendant has made a reasonable mistake about the age of the girl with whom he has had intercourse. <em>See Hernandez, </em>61 Cal.2d at 534, 39 Cal.Rptr. at 364, 393 P.2d at 676; <em>see also </em>Myers, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Therefore, although in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the defendant engaged in sexual relations with a girl 13 years old, a minor below the age of consent, his conduct is not <em>malum, in se, see 4 </em>W. Blackstone, Commentaries * 210, and, so, strict liability is not justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">III. Mistake of Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">Generally, a mistake of fact negates the mental state required to establish a material element of the crime. LaFave and Scott, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 47, at 356. A person who engages in proscribed conduct is relieved of criminal liability if, because of ignorance or mistake of fact, he or she did not entertain the culpable mental state required for the commission of the offense. <em>See </em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law \u00a7 76.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Compare Richmond v. State, </em>330 Md. 223, 241-42, 623 A.2d 630, 638 (1993) (Bell, J., dissenting) (In case of self-defense, defendant who acts in self-defense is completely exonerated upon findings that he or she subjectively believed that his or her actions were necessary and, viewed objectively, that they were, in fact, necessary; in case of imperfect self-defense, defendant who subjectively believes that his or her actions were necessary, but, objectively, they were not, is not completely exonerated, although lesser sentence is appropriate).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">Statutory rape is defined as sexual intercourse, by a person four or more years older, with a person under the age of 14. Maryland Code (1957, 1992 Repl.Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 463(a)(3).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>That statute conclusively presumes that a person under that age is incapable of legally consenting to sexual intercourse.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number><em>Rau v. State, </em>133 Md. 613, 105 A. 867 (1919) (consent is not an element of assault with intent to have carnal knowledge of a female child under 14 years);<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Ollis v. State, </em>44 Ga.App. 793, 163 S.E. 309 (1932); <em>Golden v. Commonwealth, </em>289 Ky. 379, 158 S.W.2d 967 (1942). That the female is incapable of consenting means that any act of intercourse in which she engages, even with her consent, is conclusively presumed to have been against her will. <em>See </em>Tonry, <em>supra, </em>at 106. Consequently, a person engaging in intercourse with a female, whom he knows to be under 14 may not set up her consent as a defense. This does not mean, however, that one who does not know that the female is under 14 should not be able to set up his mistake of fact as a defense. This is because the closer a minor is to the age of consent, the more the appearance and behavior of that minor can be expected to be consistent with persons who have attained the age of consent. <em>Perez v. State, </em>111 N.M. 160, 803 P.2d 249 (1990) (strict liability inappropriate where victim in 13-16 age range); <em>Hernandez, </em>61 Cal.2d at 534 n. 3, 39 Cal.Rptr. at 364 n. 3, 393 P.2d at 676 n. 3. Indeed, one may plausibly mistake a minor 13 years old as being of the statutory age of consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">A girl 13 years old may appear to be, and, in fact, may represent herself as being, over 16. If she should appear to be the age represented, a defendant may suppose reasonably that he received a valid consent from his partner, whom he mistakenly believes to be of legal age, only to find that her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>consent is legally invalid. In this situation, the majority holds, his reasonable belief as to the girl\u2019s age and consequent lack of criminal intent are no defense; the act alone suffices to establish guilt. But it is when the minor plausibly may represent that she has attained the age of consent that need for a defendant to be able to present a defense based on his or her belief that the minor was of the age to consent is the greatest.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">The California Supreme Court in <em>Hernandez, </em>61 Cal.2d at 534 n. 3, 39 Cal.Rptr. at 364 n. 3, 393 P.2d at 676 n. 3, quoting Plascowe, <em>Sex and the Law </em>184-85 (1951), has recognized mistake of age as a defense to statutory rape. There, the defendant was convicted of statutory rape pursuant to a California law setting a consent age limit of 18 years of age. The prosecutrix was 17 years and 9 months old. The court held that an offer of proof of defendant\u2019s reasonable belief that the prosecutrix had reached the age of consent was a defense to statutory rape. 61 Cal.2d at 536, 39 Cal.Rptr. at 365, 393 P.2d at 677. The court reasoned that the imposition of criminal sanctions required conduct accompanied by a specific mental state, <em>ie., </em>\u201cthe joint operation of act and intent.\u201d 61 Cal.2d at 532, 39 Cal.Rptr. at 363, 393 P.2d at 675. It opined <em>(id. </em>61 Cal.2d at 534 n. 3, 39 Cal.Rptr. at 364 n. 3, 393 P.2d at 676 n. 3, quoting Plascowe, <em>Sex and the Law </em>at 184 and 185 (1951)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-6\">\u201cWhen the law declares that sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of ten years is rape, it is not illogical to refuse to give any credence to the defense, T thought she was older, and I therefore did not believe that I was committing a crime when I had sexual intercourse with her.\u2019 * * * But when age limits are raised to sixteen, eighteen, and twenty-one, when the young girl becomes a young woman, when adolescent boys as well as young men are attracted to her, the sexual act begins to lose its quality of abnormality and physical danger to the victim. Bona fide mistakes in the age of girls can be made by men and boys who are no more dangerous than others of their social, economic and educational level. * * * Even if the girl looks to be much older <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>than the age of consent fixed by the statute, even if she lies to the man concerning her age, if she is a day below the statutory age sexual intercourse with her is rape. The man or boy who has intercourse with such girl still acts at his peril. <em>The statute is interpreted as if it were protecting children under the age of ten.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Moreover, Myers, <em>supra, </em>at 121, concurs that reasonable mistake of age, should be a defense to statutory rape where there is no threat of force. He explains his position thusly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AL9\">[T]here are many girls between the ages of twelve and fifteen who are so obviously immature in physique, dress, and deportment that they would be approached only by a person psychologically disturbed or coming from a subculture where the acceptable age-range is lower than the usual level in the United States. However, there are even more girls from twelve to fifteen whose appearance and behavior place them within, or on the vague border of, the average male\u2019s category of desirable females. By the middle teens, most girls are sufficiently developed physically and are sufficiently aware of social attitudes for a man to have to use considerable force or some definite threat if the girl objects to sexual contact. (Footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Thus, it has been observed that, \u201c[b]y the middle teens most girls have reached a point of maturity which realistically enables them to give meaningful, although not legal, consent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 122. It is for this reason that \u201c[i]ntercourse with a girl who is in her middle to late teens lacks the qualities of abnormality and physical danger that are present when she is still a child....

The first, would impose strict liability on one who has sexual relations with a child under 10. <em>See generally </em>Model Penal Code and Commentaries, \u00a7 213.6, Comment at 415-16.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>See also </em>Del. tit. 11, \u00a7 772(a); Ohio \u00a7 2907.02(A)(3); Pa. tit. 18, \u00a7 3102; W.Va. \u00a7 61-8B-13(b). The second category would encompass minors under the critical statutory age of consent, but over 10 years old. Model Penal Code, \u00a7 213.6, Comment at 415-16. Having sexual relations with a child falling in this category would still be a crime, but a defendant could escape punishment if he or she proved that he or she was mistaken as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>child\u2019s age. Both categories are consistent with the prevailing contemporary view, and with the common law, that a child under 10 years old is too young to understand the nature and quality of his or her act, Myers, <em>supra, </em>at 109-10; Charles E. Torcia, <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law, </em>\u00a7 291; 1 Blackstone Commentaries \u00a7 212, and that a child over 10 years of age ordinarily is aware of social attitudes and the nature of sexual contact. <em>See </em>Myers, <em>supra, </em>at 121; <em>see also Hernandez, </em>61 Cal.2d at 534 n. 3, 39 Cal.Rptr. at 364 n. 3, 393 P.2d at 676 n. 3. Thus, the Code would allow the defendant to defend a charge of rape involving a minor falling in the second category on the basis that he or she reasonably believed the child to be above the critical age. <em>See </em>Model Penal Code \u00a7 213.6, Comment at 416.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the defendant does not dispute that he had sexual relations with the 13 year old prosecutrix. He seeks only to be able to defend himself against being labeled a rapist. He may only do so, however, if he is allowed to present evidence that he-acted under a mistake of fact as to the prosecutrix\u2019s age, that he believed, and reasonably so, that she was above the age of consent. The proof he proposed to present to prove his defense was that the victim and her friends told him that the victim was 16 years old. He should have been allowed to show that he lacked the \u201cguilty mind\u201d to have sex with a 13 year old.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">IV. Constitutional Limitations on Strict Criminal Liability</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">A State Legislature <em>does </em>have the power to define the elements of the criminal offenses recognized within its juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>diction. <em>Liparota v.

It thus implicates the basic characteristics, if not the fundamental underpinnings, of the accusatorial system. <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. at 364, 90 S.Ct. at 1072-73, 25 L.Ed.2d at 375. <em>See </em>Gilbert &amp; Moylan, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 45.0, 589-590.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Under our system of justice, a person charged with a crime is presumed innocent until he or she is found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. That means that he or she may not be found guilty until the State has produced evidence sufficient to convince the trier of fact, to the required extent, of that person\u2019s guilt. Moreover, although not required to do so, the defendant may present a defense, in which event the evidence the defendant produces must be assessed along with that of the State in determining whether the State has met its burden. The State\u2019s burden is not reduced or changed in any way simply because the defendant elects not to interpose a defense. In those cases, the defendant may still seek to convince the trier of fact that the State has not met its burden of proof by arguing that the inferences to be drawn from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>evidence the State has produced simply is not sufficient to support guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">Irrebuttable presumptions are rules of substantive law. McLain, \u00a7\u00a7 301.1, 303.1; Gilbert &amp; Moylan, supra, \u00a7 45.12. <em>See also </em>9 J. Wigmore, <em>Evidence, </em>\u00a7 2492 at 307-08, \u201cConclusive Presumptions\u201d (Chadbourne Rev.1981), in which it is explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-5\">Wherever from one fact another is said to be conclusively presumed, in the sense that the opponent is absolutely precluded from showing by any evidence that the second fact does not exist, the rule is really providing that where the first fact is shown to exist, the second fact\u2019s existence is wholly immaterial for the purpose of the proponent\u2019s case; and to provide this is to make a rule of substantive law and not a rule apportioning the burden of persuading as to certain propositions or varying the duty of coming forward with evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Thus, irrebuttable presumptions help to define the issues pertinent to a particular kind of case, McLain \u00a7 303.1 at 241, and, in that sense, because the substantive law determines the issues to be proved, govern the admission of evidence, thus establishing the perimeters of relevance and materiality. <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 301.1 at 183. They may be statutory, McLain, \u00a7 303.1 at 182 n. 2, or have their origin in the common law. <em>See In re Davis, </em>17 Md.App. 98, 100 n. 1, 104, 299 A.2d 856, 858 n. 1, 860 (1973); <em>Miller v. Graff, </em>196 Md. 609, 620, 78 A.2d 220, 224 (1951). Accordingly, at common law, children under the age of 7 were, and still are, irrebuttably presumed to be incapable of forming criminal intent, <em>Davis, </em>and children under 4 years of age, were, and are, irrebuttably presumed to have been incapable of contributory negligence. As a matter of substantive law, therefore, children of those ages could not then, and may not now, be prosecuted under the criminal law, be sued for negligence, or held to be contributorially negligent. Similarly, section 463(a)(3) reflects the irrebuttable presumption that a child under 14 years of age is incapable of consenting to sexual intercourse. <em>See Rau, </em>133 Md. at 613-616, 105 A. at 867.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>When the Legislature enacts a strict liability crime, <em>ie., </em>promulgates a statute which excludes as an element, the defendant\u2019s mental state, it essentially creates an irrebuttable presumption that the defendant\u2019s mental state, <em>ie., </em>knowledge or intent, is irrelevant. <em>See </em>McLain, \u00a7 301.1 at 183. That is the case with regard to statutory rape. Notwithstanding that it chooses to accomplish that result by defining the crime, rather than by means of an express presumption, which relieves the State of its burden of proof, the fact remains that the result is exactly the same: anyone who has sexual relations with a female under the age of 14 is treated as if he knew that she was under 14 and so intended to have such relations with a 14 year old female. It thus relieves the State of any duty to produce relevant evidence to prove the defendant\u2019s mental state, that he knew the prosecutrix\u2019s age, and prevents the defendant from proving the contrary. Because the irrebuttably presumed fact does not follow inextricably from the fact of sexual relations -with a 14 year old, its use to relieve the State of its burden of proof to prove the defendant\u2019s intent in that regard runs afoul of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Irrebuttable, mandatory, presumptions have long been disfavored and held to be violative of due process. <em>Vlandis v. Kline, </em>412 U.S. 441, 446, 453, 93 S.Ct. 2230, 2233, 2237, 37 L.Ed.2d 63, 68, 73 (1973), and cases therein cited. One of the bases for the disfavor is that they may conflict with the overriding presumption of innocence which the law accords to the accused and invade the fact finding process, which, in a criminal case, is the exclusive province of the jury. <em>See Carella v. California, </em>491 U.S. 263, 268, 109 S.Ct. 2419, 2421, 105 L.Ed.2d 218, 223 (1989) (Scalia, J. concurring) (jury instructions relieving the prosecution of its burden of proof violate a defendant\u2019s due process rights; whether he or she is believed ordinarily is a question of fact for the jury to decide, not one of law for the Legislature). The more usual reason for disfavoring irrebuttable presumptions, however, is that the fact conclusively presumed \u201cis not necessarily or universally true in fact,\u201d <em>Vlandis, </em>412 U.S. at 452, 93 S.Ct. at 2236, 37 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>L.Ed.2d at 71, and, so, excusing the proponent of that fact from having to establish it renders the statute \u201carbitrary, illegal, capricious and hence unconstitutional.\u201d <em>Mahoney, </em>187 Md. at 87, 48 A.2d at 603.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> This is especially so when the presumed fact bears little or no relation to the statute\u2019s expressed objective. <em>Vlandis, </em>412 U.S. at 448-49, 93 S.Ct. at 2234-35, 37 L.Ed.2d at 69-70.

It did not require proof of any mental element on the part of the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 149, 80 S.Ct. at 216, 4 L.Ed.2d at 208. Noting, but rejecting, the State\u2019s attempt to \u201canalogize this strict liability penal ordinance to familiar forms of penal statutes which dispense with any element of knowledge on the part of the person charged, food and drug legislation being a principal example,\u201d the Court observed <em>(id. </em>at 152-153, 80 S.Ct. at 218, 4 L.Ed.2d at 211 (citation omitted)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-7\">The usual rationale for such statutes is that the public interest in the purity of its food is so great as to warrant the imposition of the highest standard of care on distributors\u2014 in fact an absolute standard which will not hear the distributor\u2019s plea as to the amount of care he has used.... His ignorance of the character of the food is irrelevant. There is no specific constitutional inhibition against making the distributors of food the strictest censors of their merchandise, but the constitutional guarantees of the freedom of speech and of press stand in the way of imposing a similar requirement on the bookseller.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">In <em>Lambert, </em>a Los Angeles ordinance required convicted felons who remained in the city for more than five days to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>register with the police.

The Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2r\">actual knowledge of the duty to register or proof of the probability of such knowledge and subsequent failure to comply are necessary before a conviction under the ordinance can stand.... Where a person did not know of the duty to register and where there was no proof of the probability of such knowledge, he may not be convicted consistently with due process. Were it otherwise, the evil would be as great as it is when the law is written in print too fine or in a language foreign to the community.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">355 U.S. at 229-30, 78 S.Ct. at 243-44, 2 L.Ed.2d at 232.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Similarly, in <em>Tot, </em>holding that section 2(f) of the Federal Firearms Act violated the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment, 319 U.S. at 467, 63 S.Ct. at 1245, 87 L.Ed. at 1524, the Court overturned the defendant\u2019s conviction. It held that Congress had no power to create the presumptions contained in that section to wit: that, from the defendant\u2019s prior conviction of a crime of violence and his present possession of a firearm, it is conclusively presumed that the firearm was received in interstate or foreign commerce, after the effective date of the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 467, 63 S.Ct. at 1245, 87 L.Ed. at 1524. Rejecting the Government\u2019s argument that it was entitled to the presumption because the defendant had the better means of information, the Court said <em>(id. </em>at 469, 63 S.Ct. at 1246, 87 L.Ed. at 1525):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-6\">But the argument proves too much. If it were sound, the legislature might validly command that the finding of an indictment, or mere proof of the identity of the accused, should create a presumption of the existence of all the facts essential to guilt. This is not permissible, (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>by consciously and intentionally excluding from section 463(a)(3) any requirement that the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the victim\u2019s age be proven, the Legislature has relieved the State of that obligation; without that legislation, of course, the State\u2019s burden would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>included proving, at the very least, that the defendant knew the prosecutrix\u2019s age. On the issue of the defendant\u2019s intent, section 468(a)(3) only requires proof of the victim\u2019s age and its differential with that of the defendant. As such, once those facts have been proven, it is conclusively established that the defendant\u2019s intent was to have sexual relations with a girl of the proscribed age.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> As we have seen, not requiring proof of the defendant\u2019s intent has been accomplished by so defining the crime, not by means of an express presumption. Again, that is of no real consequence, however. By defining the crime, the Legislature prescribes what must be proven. In other words, by that process, it has determined what the rule of substantive law will be \u2014 by defining the crime so as to exclude proof of knowledge or intent, the Legislature naturally precludes the admission of any evidence bearing on the element, the proof of which it has excused. In so doing, it has made that element \u2014 intent or knowledge of the victim\u2019s age\u2014 irrelevant to the definition of the crime and, hence, irrebuttable. Wigmore, \u00a7 2492 at 307-08. It follows, therefore, that, once the other elements are proven, the defendant\u2019s knowledge or intent is necessarily established as well. It does not necessarily follow, however, that simply because the victim is 13 years old, the defendant had knowledge of her age or intended to have sexual relations with a 13 year old girl. He may have had knowledge or intent, to be sure, but, by the same token, he may not have. The defendant should have been permitted to present evidence on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">In her treatise, Professor McLain, echoing the authorities, offered an example of the Legislature redefining a crime to exclude an element, without relying on an irrebuttable presumption. She referred to Maryland Code (1957, 1992 Repl. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 286A<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> which punishes a defendant for possession of certain large amounts of drugs, without regard to intent. That is not comparable to the case <em>sub juda\u00edce. </em>While, under the statute, it is true that the possession of the proscribed drugs is a crime without proof of the intent with which they are possessed, the State is not relieved of its responsibility of proving both that they were brought into Maryland and that the possession was a knowing possession. <em>Dawkins v. State, </em>313 Md. 638, 547 A.2d 1041 (1988). In the case of statutory rape all aspects of the defendant\u2019s knowledge, save proof of the intercourse itself, has been rendered, by definition, irrelevant and, so, off limits for the trial. That is, I repeat, by no means comparable.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">The critical issue in a statutory rape case is \u201cthe age of the rape victim.\u201d That is true because the victim\u2019s age serves two related, but distinct purposes: (1) it establishes the victim\u2019s capacity to consent and (2) it represents notice to a defendant of proscribed conduct. The Maryland statute seeks irrebuttably to presume not only that the victim could not consent by virtue of age, but also that, when a defendant engages in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>sexual relations with a minor under the age of 14, he has notice of that fact. Assuming that, based on the victim\u2019s age, the Legislature could legitimately exclude consent as an element of the crime,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> it absolutely should not be able to excuse the State from its obligation to prove the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the victim\u2019s age or prevent the defendant from producing evidence on that issue. No matter how forcefully it may be argued that there is a rational relationship between the capacity to consent and the age the Legislature selected, given the tremendous difference between individuals, both in appearance and in mental capacity, there can be no such rational relationship between the proof of the victim\u2019s age and the defendant\u2019s knowledge of that fact.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> <em>See Tot, </em>319 U.S. at 469, 63 S.Ct. at 1245-46, 87 L.Ed. at 1525. <em>Mahoney, </em>187 Md. at 87, 48 A.2d at 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">The notice element of the crime of statutory rape is different from the consent element, in any event. A defendant who has knowledge that a victim has consented, in fact, to sexual relations, whether the consent is effective or not, is not thereby placed on notice as to the victim\u2019s age. Knowledge of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>consent simply does not equate with knowledge of age, just as intent to engage in sexual relations does not reveal, without more, with whom. Moreover, it is not a crime to engage in sexual relations with a minor who is at least 16 years old; it may be morally wrong, in the minds of most Americans, but it is not a crime. It is only a crime if the defendant engages in such relations with a minor under a specified age, <em>ie., </em>14, as in section 463(a)(3), or 14 or 15, as in section 464C. But even when the act engaged in is necessarily a crime, <em>e.g. </em>possession of contraband, knowledge of the illegality \u2014 that the contraband is knowingly possessed \u2014 is still required. <em>See Dawkins v. State, </em>313 Md. 638, 547 A.2d 1041 (1988). Consequently, where the activity would be legal or, at least, not illegal, but for the ages of the participants, at the very least, the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the victim\u2019s age must be proven. Otherwise, a defendant who does not know he is acting illegally could be convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Moreover, there is precedent that a felony statute which prescribes substantial penalties and conviction of which will subject the defendant to significant social stigma, violates due process unless it requires the State to prove intent or knowledge, <em>Wulff, </em>758 F.2d at 1125; <em>Holdridge v. United States, </em>282 F.2d 302 (8th Cir.1960); <em>United States v. Heller, </em>579 F.2d 990 (6th Cir.1978); <em>Guest, </em>583 P.2d 836 (Ala.1978).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>In <em>Wulff, </em>the defendant was charged with violation of the felony provisions of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, 16 U.S. \u00a7 707(b). On motion by the defendant, the trial court dismissed the charges, holding that the provisions under which he was charged violated due process, no proof of intent being required. On appeal by the Government, the Court of Appeals affirmed. 758 F.2d at 1122. That court perceived the issue to be \u201cwhether the absence of a requirement that the government prove some degree of scienter violates the defendant\u2019s right to due process.\u201d In resolving that issue, it observed, relying on <em>Holdridge, supra, </em>that \u201ca felony conviction under the act does not require proof of scienter; the crime is not one known to the common law, and ... the felony penalty provision is severe and would result in irreparable damage to one\u2019s reputation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court then held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-5\">We are of the opinion that in order for one to be convicted of a felony under the MBTA, a crime unknown to common law which carries a substantial penalty, Congress must require the prosecution to prove the defendant acted with some degree of scienter. Otherwise, a person acting with a completely innocent state of mind could be subjected to a severe penalty and grave damage to his reputation. This, in our opinion, the Constitution does not allow.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1125. <em>See Holdridge, </em>282 F.2d at 310, in which it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-7\">[WJhere a federal criminal statute omits mention of intent and where it seems to involve what is basically a matter of policy, where the standard imposed is, under the circumstances, reasonable and adherence thereto properly expected of a person, where the penalty is relatively small, where conviction does not gravely besmirch, where the statutory crime is not taken over from the common law, and where congressional purpose is supporting, the statute can be construed as one not requiring criminal intent. The elimination of this element is then not violative of the due process clause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>A similar result was reached by the Supreme Court of Alaska in <em>Guest, </em>involving a charge of statutory rape. Significantly, having held that, under its precedents, a reasonable mistake of age defense was permitted, the court submitted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Att\">[Wjhere a particular statute is not a public welfare type of offense, either a requirement of criminal intent must be read into the statute or it must be found unconstitutional.... Since statutes should be construed where possible to avoid unconstitutionality, it is necessary here to infer a requirement of criminal intent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-5\"><em>Id. </em>at <em>839 </em>(citations and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Similarly, the prosecution of statutory rape in Maryland necessarily brings into conflict the State\u2019s interests in protect- . ing minors and defendants\u2019 due process rights because section 463(a)(3) operates \u201c \u2018to exclude elements of knowledge and diligence from its definition,\u2019\u201d <em>Ransom, </em>942 F.2d at 776, quoting <em>Lambert, </em>355 U.S. at 228, 78 S.Ct. at 242, 2 L.Ed.2d at 231, and, thus, removes reasonable ignorance of the girl\u2019s age and consequent lack of criminal intent as a defense. The failure of section 463(a)(3) to require proof of a culpable mental state conflicts both with the substantive due process ideal requiring that defendants possess some level of fault for a criminal conviction of statutory rape and the procedural due process ideal requiring that the prosecution overcome the presumption of innocence by proof of the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Notwithstanding the maxim that criminal statutes dispensing with the intent requirement and criminal offenses requiring no <em>mens rea </em>have a \u201cgenerally disfavored status,\u201d the rationale of parts V and VI of the majority opinion is that the legislature has absolute authority to create strict liability crimes. For the reasons reviewed, I do not agree. On the contrary, I believe that due process both under the Fourteenth Amendment and under the Declaration of Rights, precludes strict criminal liability for statutory rape. Interpreting section 463(a)(3) as the majority does has the effect of largely relieving the State of its burden of proof and burden of persuasion. By making the defendant\u2019s intent, and, hence, blameworthiness, irrelevant, the Legislature has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>made inevitable, the petitioner\u2019s conviction. Moreover, upon conviction of the felony offense of statutory rape under section 463(a)(3), in addition to a substantial penalty of up to 20 years imprisonment, a defendant\u2019s reputation will be gravely besmirched. Where there is no issue as to sexual contact, which is more likely than not to be the case in statutory rape prosecutions, proof of the prosecutrix\u2019s age is not only proof of the defendant\u2019s guilt, it is absolutely dispositive of it and, at the same time, it is fatal to the only defense the defendant would otherwise have. So interpreted, section 463(a)(3) not only destroys absolutely the concept of fault, but it renders meaningless, in the statutory rape context, the presumption of innocence and the right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b723-6\">. Maryland Code Ann., Art 27, \u00a7 463 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-7\">(a) What constitutes. \u2014 A person is guilty of rape in the second degree if the person engages in vaginal intercourse with another person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-8\">(3) Who is under 14 years of age and the person performing the act is at least four years older than the victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-9\">(b) Penalty. \u2014 Any person violating the provisions of this section is guilty of a felony and upon conviction is subject to imprisonment for a period of not more than 20 years.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b723-10\">. There are other provisions of the Maryland sexual offenses statutes similar in purpose and effect to section 463(a)(3). Md.Code (1957, 1992 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7\u00a7 464A, 464B, and 464C also do not specify a mental state and, therefore, would also be, under the majority's rationale, strict liability crimes. Sections 464A and 464B define statutory second degree sexual act and statutory third degree sexual offense. Although neither involves intercourse, both are felonies with maximum penalties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>of 20 and 10 years respectively. Section 464C proscribes the same conduct as section 463(a)(2); however, it applies to minors 14 or 15 years old and it punishes that conduct much less severely, <em>see </em>n. 15 <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b724-8\">. The analysis I would employ is that developed for use in self defense cases, perfect and imperfect.

If the defendant generates the issue, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the act was committed without any mistake of fact \u2014 that the defendant acted intentionally and knowingly. <em>See id.; see also State v.

In contrast, one who engages in sexual relations with a child who clearly does not appear to be of the age of consent, for example, a minor 7 years of age, evidences a propensity to corrupt minors.

It is noteworthy that the early English statutes providing for strict criminal liability for statutory rape did not deny the defense of mistake <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>of fact. Under very early English common law, it was no crime to have consensual relations with a female, regardless of her age. Myers, <em>supra, </em>at 109, citing 4 W. Blackstone Commentaries *210 and 2 Coke, Institutes *180. It was not until the latter part of the thirteenth century that legislation was enacted in England making it unlawful to ravish \"damsels\u201d under the age of 12 years, with or without their consent, considered an action of trespass, with a penalty of two years and a fine in such sum as the sovereign directs. Gilbert &amp; Moylan, <em>Criminal Law, </em>\u00a7 5.0., citing 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *212. Toward the close of the 16th century, the age of consent was reduced to 10 years old, the purpose of the statute being to declare that a girl under the prescribed age was presumed incapable of consent because she was too young to understand the nature and quality of her act. Myers, <em>supra, </em>at 109-10; Charles E. Torcia, <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law, </em>\u00a7 291; 1 Blackstone Comm. *212. The offense was also increased to a felony. <em>See </em>Gilbert 6 Moylan, <em>Criminal Law, </em>\u00a7 5.0., citing 13 Edward I, Statute of Westminster 2, c.34 and Statute 18 Elizabeth I, c. 7. English courts, in contrast to American courts, which never have allowed it, however, never denied the existence of the reasonable mistake of fact defense. Myers, <em>supra, </em>at 111. American Courts erroneously interpreted <em>Regina v. Prince, </em>L.R. 2 Cr.Cas.Res. 154 (1875), <em>cited in </em>Myers, <em>supra, </em>at 111, and applied its rationale to statutory rape.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b736-8\">. Two policy considerations have historically been advanced to justify strict criminal liability for statutory rape: (1) it is desirable to provide the fullest protection to the innocent and naive female child incapable of understanding the nature of sexual intercourse; and (2) the act is immoral in itself, <em>malum in se, </em>discussed <em>supra, </em>and, so, it is appropriate to hold that the offender acts at his peril. <em>See </em>Tonry, <em>supra, </em>at 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-9\">Establishing an age, below which females are considered sexually immature and above which, they are considered sexually mature, does not assure that the first policy consideration will be achieved. <em>See </em>Tonry, <em>supra, </em>at 111. Age alone is not sufficient, considering that, in this country, the age of consent for statutory rape purposes ranges from 7 to 21 years. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b736-11\">The inadequacy of age as a demarcation line actually points up the flaws in the strict criminal liability analysis. First, it would seem reasonable to allow the accused to introduce evidence of the minor\u2019s maturity, sophistication, and past sexual experience, since maturity, not age, is the chief concern, age being but a factor. Second, the age standard (unless it is low enough) with its universal application draws an arbitrary line, resulting in the imposition of disproportionate penalties. <em>See </em>J. William Pitcher, <em>Legislation, </em>7 Balt.L.Rev. 150, 165 (1977); <em>see also </em>Tonry, <em>supra, </em>at 112. Thus, for example, pursuant to section 463(a)(3) sexual intercourse with a person under 14 years of age, if the actor is at least four years older than the victim, is a second degree rape offense punishable by a possible twenty years imprisonment. Under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>section 464C, defining a fourth degree sexual offense, the same conduct if committed with a child 14 or 15 is punishable by a possible 1 year sentence. Thus, the law creates a potential disparity of up to 19 years for a difference of as little as one day in the victim\u2019s age. <em>See </em>J. William Pitcher, <em>Legislation, </em>7 Balt.L.Rev. 150, 165 (1977). Third, placing the age standard too high may result in the anomaly of a female being legally able to consent to marriage, but unable to consent to intercourse. Tonry, <em>supra, </em>at 112, citing Ploscowe, <em>Sex and the Law </em>184 (1951).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b737-6\">. While consent was not an element of assault with intent to have carnal knowledge of a female child under 14 years, by definition, the intent to have such knowledge of a 14 year old child was.

Recognizing that the statutory rape law stemmed from traditional notions underlying the presumption of incapacity to consent, presuming that the male was responsible for the occurrence and the female was \"too innocent and naive to understand the implications and nature of her act\u201d, in <em>Hernandez, </em>61 Cal.2d at 531 n. 1, 39 Cal.Rptr. at 362 n. 1, 393 P.2d at 674 n. 1, the California Supreme Court quoted the following passage from <em>State v.

Indeed, in this case there is every reason to question whether the victim was the petitioner, rather than the minor female. The petitioner has an IQ of 52. The prosecutrix and her friends told the petitioner that she was 16 and the record does not suggest that she did not appear to be that age. The petitioner entered the prosecutrix's room at her invitation and remained with her for almost seven hours.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b740-10\">. Although it is not necessary in this case to reach the issue, I am not nearly so troubled by the retention of strict liability in cases involving very young children, <em>i.e. </em>under the age of 10, while requiring the State to prove <em>mens rea </em>in cases involving minors above the age of 10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b741-8\">. The offer of proof of the defendant's alleged mistake of fact does not alone establish that fact. Unless the jury, or trier of fact, accepts the proof, the defense must fail. Whether a defendant actually entertained the belief that the minor was 16 and, if so, its reasonableness, must depend upon the minor's appearance and the evidence, including the testimony of the defendant and other witnesses, concerning her behavior. Rather than place the burden of proof on the State, as I would do, under the Code, the burden is on the defendant not only to generate the issue, but to prove it by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See </em>Model Penal Code, \u00a7 213.6, Comment at 416.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b743-5\">.

The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees that no State shall \"deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law.\u201d This clause has been interpreted as \"a restraint on the legislative as well as on the executive and judicial powers of the government and [it] cannot be ... construed as to leave Congress free to make any process 'due process' of law by its mere will.\u201d <em>Murray\u2019s Lessee </em>v. <em>Hoboken Land &amp; Improvement Co., </em>59 U.S. (18 How.) 272, 276, 15 L.Ed. 372 (1855).

In <em>Johns </em>v. <em>State, </em>55 Md. 350, 359-63 (1881), cited by this Court in <em>Mahoney v. Byers, </em>187 Md. 81, 87, 48 A.2d 600, 603 (1946), a statute requiring the certificate of the Comptroller to be received as <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the defendant's defalcation was upheld. In doing so, however, the Court was persuaded by the fact that the evidence was only <em>prima facie:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-7\">So far as this case is concerned, it may readily be conceded, that a statute that should make evidence conclusive, which was not so of its own nature and inherent force, and by that means preclude the party from the truth, would be simply void. But the evidence furnished by the certificate only being prima facie in its effect, the traverser was left at full liberty to repel and overcome that prima facie effect, by evidence that ought to have been within his own control.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 362-63.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b750-6\">. To be sure, the statute is based on another irrebuttable presumption: that the victim is incapable of consenting. My argument is not directed at that presumption, <em>albeit </em>it is, in my opinion, logically, also fair game for constitutional challenge. See n. 26: <em>see Hernandez, </em>61 Cal.2d at 534 n. 3, 39 Cal.Rptr. at 364 n. 3, 393 P.2d at 676 n. 3. It is certainly not universally true, or even almost always true, that a minor 13 years of age is incapable of giving meaningful consent. <em>See </em>note 25 <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b751-5\">. \u00a7 286A. <em>Bringing into State in excess of certain amounts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">(a) A person who brings into this State any of the following controlled dangerous substances which it is unlawful for that person to possess, in the amounts indicated, upon conviction, is subject to the penalty provided in subsection (b) of this section:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-7\">(1) 100 pounds or greater of marijuana;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-8\">(2) 28 grams or greater of cocaine or any mixture containing 28 grams or greater of cocaine;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-9\">(3) 4 grams or more of morphine or opium or any derivative, salt, isomer, or salt of an isomer of morphine or opium;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-10\">(4) 1,000 dosage units of lysergic acid diethylamide or any mixture containing the equivalent of 1,000 dosage units of lysergic acid diethylamide;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-11\">(5) 28 grams or more of phencyclidine in liquid or powder form or 112 grams or more of any mixture containing phencyclidine;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-12\">(6) 1,000 dosage units or more of methaqualone; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-13\">(7) 28 grams or more of methamphetamines or any mixture containing 28 grams or more of methamphetamine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-14\">(b) A person convicted of violating subsection (a) of this section is guilty of a felony and may be fined not more than $50,000 or imprisoned for not more than 25 years, or both fined and imprisoned in the discretion of the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b752-6\">. It is at least arguable that incapacity to consent based on an irrebuttable presumption cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny. For statutory rape to comport with due process, a close correlation between the age of consent specified in the statute and the purpose of the statute \u2014 to render minors incapable of consenting to sexual intercourse \u2014 is required. It is not necessarily true that a statutory age of consent is a reliable indicator of the capacity of any member of the protected class to understand the nature and consequences of sexual intercourse. <em>See Hernandez, </em>61 Cal.2d at 534 n. 3, 39 Cal.Rptr. at 364 n. 3, 393 P.2d at 676 n. 3; <em>see also </em>Myers, <em>supra, </em>at 121. Given the variety of cultural factors that can influence a child's acquisition of sexual awareness, it is unlikely that any arbitrary age could do so. <em>Rita Eidson, Note, The Constitutionality of Statutory Rape Laws, </em>27 UCLA L.Rev. 757, 808 (1980). While it is reasonable to presume that very young children are naive and incapable of understanding the nature of sexual contact, and, thus, of consenting, an older adolescent's incapacity to consent on this basis seems unreasonable in light of pervasive contemporary sexual mores. <em>See Hernandez, </em>61 Cal.2d at 534 n. 3, 39 Cal.Rptr. at 364 n. 3, 393 P.2d at 676 n. 3; <em>see also </em>Note, <em>supra, </em>at 808-809.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b752-7\">. Indeed, it would appear that the irrebuttable presumption of notice is dependent on another irrebuttable presumption, that a person of a certain age cannot consent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b753-6\">. As discussed supra, there are several critical distinctions between imposing strict criminal liability for public welfare offenses and felonies. First, there is no specific constitutional provision against imposing strict criminal liability for public welfare offenses. <em>See Smith, </em>361 U.S. at 152, 80 S.Ct. at 218, 4 L.Ed.2d at 211; Singer, <em>supra </em>at 389. Second, such statutes which are designed to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the community at large, carry penalties that are not great and involve little or no stigma. <em>See </em>Tonry, <em>supra, </em>at 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">On the other hand, there are constitutional limits on a legislature's power to define the elements of more serious criminal offenses like felonies. <em>McMillan, </em>477 U.S. at 85, 106 S.Ct. at 2415, 91 L.Ed.2d at 75; <em>Wulff, </em>758 F.2d at 1125; Singer, <em>supra, </em>at 397. Second, the greater social stigma attached to imposing criminal liability in serious felony cases requires an element of blameworthiness or culpability. <em>See </em>Singer, <em>supra, </em>at 404-405. Third, the severe penalties in serious felony cases merit a culpability requirement. <em>See Holdridge, </em>282 F.2d 302.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
