The Court of Special Appeals, however, held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>the \u00a7 554 offense charged in this case contained no elements which were not also contained in the \u00a7 464C(a)(2) offense and that, therefore, the \u00a7 554 offense was an included offense which, for sentencing purposes, merged into the \u00a7 4640(a)(2) offense. Consequently, the Court of Special Appeals vacated the sentence imposed for the violation of \u00a7 554. We granted the State\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari to consider the State\u2019s argument that the \u00a7 554 offense charged in this case has a distinct element not found in the \u00a7 4640(a)(2) offense and that, for this reason, the \u00a7 554 offense is not included within the \u00a7 4640(a)(2) offense and therefore does not under Maryland law merge into the \u00a7 4640(a)(2) offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">We have often pointed out that \u201c \u2018[u]nder settled Maryland common law, the usual rule for deciding whether one criminal offense merges into another or whether one is a lesser included offense of the other, ... when both offenses are based on the same act or acts, is the so-called \u201crequired evidence test.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>In re Montrail M., </em>325 Md. 527, 531, 601 A.2d 1102, 1104 (1992), quoting <em>Williams v.

Stated another way, the \u201c \u2018required evidence is that which is minimally necessary to secure a conviction for each ... offense. If each offense requires proof of a fact which the other does not, or in other words, if each offense contains an element which the other does not,\u2019 \u201d there is no merger under the required evidence test even though both offenses are based upon the same act or acts. \u201c \u2018But, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>where only one offense requires proof of an additional fact, so that all elements of one offense are present in the other,\u2019 \u201d and where both \u201coffenses are based on the same act or acts, ... merger follows.... \u201d <em>Williams v.

State, </em>316 Md. 315, 323, 558 A.2d 715, 719 (1989), emphasis added. <em>See, e.g., Whack v.

It is undisputed that the same act or acts of fellatio formed the basis for both guilty verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">The pertinent State\u2019s evidence upon which the two guilty verdicts were based disclosed the following. Louis W., a fifteen year old boy, met the defendant in July 1988. The defendant befriended Louis by taking the boy skating and out to eat. Eventually the defendant brought Louis to his home where, on several occasions from July 1988 to January 1989, the defendant performed fellatio on Louis. According to Louis\u2019s testimony at trial, early in their relationship the defendant warned Louis not to tell anyone about the instances of oral sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">For the \u00a7 464C(a)(2) fourth degree sexual offense, the circuit court imposed the maximum penalty, one year imprisonment and a fine of $1,000. For the \u00a7 554 offense, the circuit court again imposed the maximum penalty, ten years imprisonment and a fine of $1,000. Five years of the prison term were suspended in favor of five years probation. The terms of imprisonment were to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">Lancaster took an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that, under the required evidence test, the \u00a7 554 offense is an included offense of and merges into the \u00a7 464C(a)(2) fourth degree sexual offense. Therefore, Lancaster argued, the ten year sentence imposed for the \u00a7 554 offense should be vacated. <em>See Lancaster v. State, </em>86 Md. App. 74, 80, 585 A.2d 274, 277 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>The State, agreeing that the required evidence test furnished the standard for determining the merger issue, argued in the Court of Special Appeals that the offenses did not merge under the required evidence test because each offense has distinct elements. (State\u2019s brief in the Court of Special Appeals at 3-5). According to the State, the \u00a7 554 crime is not an included offense because, as \u00a7 554 was construed by this Court in <em>Schochet v. State, </em>320 Md. 714, 580 A.2d 176 (1990), the offense requires proof of facts which need not be proven to establish a fourth degree sexual offense under \u00a7 464C(a)(2). Specifically, the State contended that because \u00a7 554 does not encompass heterosexual non-commercial acts in private between consenting adults, it is incumbent upon the State, in order to obtain a conviction under \u00a7 554, to prove as an element of the offense that the sexual acts did not fall into such category. <em>See Lancaster v. State, supra, </em>86 Md.App. at 82, 585 A.2d at 278.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The Court of Special Appeals rejected the State\u2019s position on the merger issue, agreed with Lancaster\u2019s merger argument, and vacated the sentence under \u00a7 554. Otherwise, the intermediate appellate court found no merit in Lancaster\u2019s contentions and affirmed the conviction and sentence for the fourth degree sexual offense under \u00a7 464C(a)(2). <em>Lancaster v. State, supra, </em>86 Md.App. 74, 585 A.2d 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">The Court of Special Appeals in its opinion pointed to the undisputed proposition that the fourth degree sexual offense under \u00a7 464C(a)(2) \u201crequires proof of two facts that \u00a7 554 does not, namely that the victim is 14 or 15 years of age and that the accused is at least four years older.\u201d 86 Md.App. at 82, 585 A.2d at 278. The intermediate appellate court then addressed the State\u2019s theory that the \u00a7 554 offense is not included within the \u00a7 464C(a)(2) fourth degree sexual offense because the \u00a7 554 offense requires proof of facts not required under \u00a7 464C(a)(2), stating <em>(ibid.)':</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-7\">\u201cThe State strenuously objects to the merger of \u00a7 464C and \u00a7 554, relying on <em>Schochet v. State, </em>320 Md. 714, 580 A.2d 176 (1990), for the proposition that in addition to proving that an unnatural or perverted practice occurred, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>the State must also prove that it was either nonconsensual, commercial, homosexual, involved a juvenile or not performed in private. <em>Schochet </em>involved a sex act between two heterosexual, consenting adults in the privacy of one\u2019s home. Contrary to the State\u2019s premise, <em>Schochet </em>does not require the State to prove additional facts. What <em>Schochet </em>holds is that the statute was not intended to apply to, and therefore does not criminalize, consensual heterosexual conduct in private between competent adults. The holding in <em>Schochet </em>is inapposite to any issue in the case <em>sub judice.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">The Court of Special Appeals concluded that, because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVd\">\u201cthe trial court\u2019s instructions, as well as the State\u2019s closing argument, made it clear that fellatio was the sexual act alleged under both the fourth degree sexual offense charge and the [\u00a7 554] charge ..., under the facts of this case appellant\u2019s conviction and sentence under \u00a7 554 ... merged into his conviction and sentence for the greater offense, fourth degree sexual offense under \u00a7 464C.\u201d 86 Md.App. at 84, 585 A.2d at 279.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The State filed in this Court a petition for a writ of certiorari, challenging the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 merger holding. The defendant also filed a petition, challenging the affirmance of his conviction and sentence under \u00a7 464C(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">In its certiorari petition, the State again perceived the issue in terms of the proper application of the required evidence test, and it presented a single argument, namely that \u201cthe Court of Special Appeals improperly applied the required evidence test\u201d (State\u2019s petition at 4). As in the Court of Special Appeals, the State argued that \u00a7 554 contained an element not contained in \u00a7 464C(a)(2), and that, for this reason, the former did not merge into the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">The State\u2019s theory as to why \u00a7 554 contained a distinct element, however, differed sharply from the theory which it had presented to the Court of Special Appeals. In this Court, the State agreed with the Court of Special Appeals that the elements of \u00a7 554 did not include a showing that the sexual act did not fall outside the scope of the statute as construed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number><em>Schochet v. State, supra. </em>(State\u2019s petition at 5, n. 2). The State contended, however, that \u00a7 554 is not a multi-purpose statute, that it does not have alternative elements, and that \u201c[i]t outlaws one thing \u2014 unnatural or perverted sexual practices\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 4). According to the State, the single element of \u00a7 554, namely \u201cunnatural or perverted sexual practices,\u201d encompasses \u201ca broader range of conduct than that\u201d proscribed by the \u201calternative\u201d elements of \u00a7 464C and set forth in the definition of \u201csexual act\u201d in \u00a7 461(e) <em>(ibid., </em>State\u2019s brief in this Court at 5-6). The State maintained that the determination of the particular sexual practice, and whether it involved another person or an animal, \u201cis not a determination of which purpose in a multi-purpose statute is involved. Rather, it is an analysis of the actual evidence introduced in the case \u2014 an analysis not appropriate to a \u2018required evidence\u2019 merger analysis\u201d (State\u2019s petition at 4-5). The State argued that, since \u00a7 554 contains the single distinct element of an \u201cunnatural or perverted sexual practice,\u201d it has an element not contained in the \u00a7 464C(a)(2) offense and therefore does not merge into the \u00a7 464C(a)(2) offense under the required evidence test. In the State\u2019s view, the Court of Special Appeals \u201cmisinterpret[ed]\u201d this Court\u2019s opinions dealing with \u201cmulti-purpose\u201d statutes <em>(id. </em>at 4).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">We granted the State\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari and denied the defendant\u2019s petition. Our order granting the State\u2019s petition did not raise any additional issues. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 8-131(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">As discussed earlier, when applying the required evidence test to a multi-purpose criminal offense, <em>i.e., </em>an offense containing alternative elements, a court must examine the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>element or elements relevant to the case before it. The State agrees that a fourth degree sexual offense under \u00a7 464C is a multi-purpose statute which can be committed in alternative ways. <em>See Nightingale v. State, supra, </em>312 Md. at 706, 542 A.2d at 376; <em>State v. Boozer, </em>304 Md. 98, 497 A.2d 1129 (1985). <em>Cf. Biggus v. State, supra, </em>323 Md. at 349, 593 A.2d at 1065 (holding that a third degree sexual offense under \u00a7 464B is an \u201coffense which can be committed in alternative ways\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">The relevant elements of the fourth degree sexual offense charged in this case are found in \u00a7\u00a7 4640(a)(2) and 461(e). Section 4640(a)(2) provides that a person is guilty of a fourth degree sexual offense if that person engages \u201c[i]n a sexual act with another person who is 14 or 15 years of age and the person performing the sexual act is four or more years older than the other person.\u201d Section 461(e) states that \u201c \u2018sexual act\u2019 means ... fellatio ... but does not include vaginal intercourse.\u201d Consequently, the elements of the fourth degree sexual offense charged in this case are (1) the performance of fellatio (2) with a 14 or 15 year old and (3) the performer is four or more years older than 14 or 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The second and third of the above-listed elements of the \u00a7 4640(a)(2) fourth degree sexual offense, relating to the ages of those involved, are clearly not elements of the offense proscribed by \u00a7 554. Thus, the \u00a7 464C fourth degree sexual offense charged in this case has distinct elements not found in \u00a7 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">Section 554 prohibits a person from \u201c[1] taking into his or her mouth the sexual organ of any other person or [2] animal, or [3] ... placing his or her sexual organ in the mouth of any other person or [4] animal or [5] ... committing any other unnatural or perverted sexual practice with any other person or [6] animal.... \u201d Assuming for present purposes that the terms \u201cunnatural\u201d and \u201cperverted\u201d were not each intended to encompass conduct distinct from the other, the statute prohibits three categories of conduct with other persons and the same three categories of conduct with animals. The plain language of the statute prohibits a person from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>performing fellatio or cunnilingus, prohibits a person from having fellatio or cunnilingus performed upon him or her, and prohibits other unnatural or perverted sexual practices. As to the last category, the rule of <em>ejusdem generis </em>has been held inapplicable, and the phrase \u201cunnatural or perverted sexual practice\u201d encompasses more than acts of an oral nature. <em>Blake v. State, </em>210 Md. 459, 462, 124 A.2d 273, 274 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">The statutory language clearly requires rejection of the State\u2019s argument that the \u00a7 554 offense contains a single element, namely engaging in unnatural or perverted sexual practices, and that performing fellatio is simply the \u201cactual evidence\u201d of the offense. The statute is just not written in such terms. The first prohibition in the language of the statute itself is \u201ctaking into his or her mouth the sexual organ of any other person.... \u201d This is a statutory prohibition \u2014 an element to be proven. It is not simply an evidentiary matter. The State in this case was required to establish, and did establish, that this was precisely the conduct in which the defendant had engaged. Moreover, \u00a7 554 is obviously a multipurpose statute. The use of the conjunction \u201cor\u201d in the statute makes it clear that each category of prohibited conduct represents an alternative manner of committing the offense. The phrase \u201cor other unnatural or perverted sexual practice\u201d simply represents the final category of conduct proscribed by the statute.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">We have pointed out that, when the statutory language itself \u201cembrac[es] different matters in the disjunctive,\u201d the statute is \u201cmulti-purpose\u201d and \u201ca court in applying the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>quired evidence test must examine \u2018the alternative elements relevant to the case at hand.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Ferrell, supra, </em>313 Md. at 298, 545 A.2d at 656, quoting <em>Nightingale v. State, supra, </em>312 Md. at 705, 542 A.2d at 376. The language of \u00a7 554 itself embraces different matters in the disjunctive, and thus, under our cases, \u00a7 554 is plainly a multi-purpose statute. <em>See also, e.g., Thomas v. State, supra, </em>277 Md. at 268-269, 353 A.2d at 247-248 (pointing out that \u201cthe provisions of [the statute] are in the disjunctive. The offense can be established either by showing\u201d one type of proscribed conduct or the other).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">The statutory element of \u00a7 554 relevant to this case is the defendant\u2019s \u201ctaking into his ... mouth the sexual organ of any other person.... \u201d This element would appear to be fully encompassed by the elements of the \u00a7 4640(a)(2) offense, because a forbidden \u201csexual act\u201d under \u00a7 4640(a)(2) is statutorily defined as including fellatio and eunnilingus. The \u00a7 554 offense has no additional elements. A person cannot commit a fourth degree sexual offense under \u00a7 464C, as charged in this case, without also violating \u00a7 554. Consequently, we reject the State\u2019s argument that the \u00a7 554 offense of which the defendant was convicted contained an element distinct from the elements of the \u00a7 4640(a)(2) offense of which he was convicted. The State has not established any error in the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 holding that the \u00a7 554 offense is an included offense and, for sentencing purposes, merges into the \u00a7 4640(a)(2) offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">The above discussion is dispositive of the position advanced by the State. The State has not in this case proposed any other theory which would preclude a merger of the \u00a7 554 offense into the \u00a7 4640(a)(2) offense. Moreover, the State has not argued or even intimated that, if the \u00a7 554 offense is included in the \u00a7 4640(a)(2) offense under the required evidence test, the sentence imposed upon the \u00a7 554 conviction can nevertheless stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>The two dissenting opinions, however, advance three arguments, not made by the State, as to why the \u00a7 554 offense does not merge into the \u00a7 4640(a)(2) offense.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>First, </em>Judge McAuliffe, while agreeing that the two offenses are the same under the required evidence test and thus merge, asserts that the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Double Jeopardy Clause does not preclude merging the \u00a7 4640(a)(2) offense into the \u00a7 554 offense. <em>Second, </em>Judge Chasanow argues that the two offenses do not merge under the required evidence test because the \u00a7 554 offense charged in this case requires proof of something more than fellatio. <em>Third, </em>Judge Chasanow\u2019s dissenting opinion alternatively takes the position that, even if the \u00a7 554 offense is included within the \u00a7 4640(a)(2) offense under the required evidence test, multiple sentences here are permissible under cases such as <em>Whack v. State, supra, </em>288 Md. 137, 416 A.2d 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Judge McAuliffe in dissent agrees that the two offenses charged in this case are the same under the required evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>test and that multiple sentences are not permissible. Furthermore, he agrees that the \u00a7 464C(a)(2) offense contains the distinct element and that, based on the elements, the \u00a7 554 offense is included within the \u00a7 4640(a)(2) offense. Nonetheless, Judge McAuliffe would merge the \u00a7 4640(a)(2) conviction into the included \u00a7 554 conviction, asserting that \u201c[t]he Fifth Amendment ... does not require that the conviction left standing be of the offense having the greatest number of elements.\u201d No decision by the United States Supreme Court, by this Court, or by any other court, is cited in support of this proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">Although we are not aware of any Supreme Court authority upholding the constitutionality of the merger result advocated by Judge McAuliffe, for purposes of this case we can assume arguendo that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment would not, under the circumstances here, invalidate a Maryland law providing for the merger of the \u00a7 464C(a)(2) conviction into the \u00a7 554 conviction. No such federal constitutional issue, however, is before us in this case. There is no Maryland law authorizing the merger of the \u00a7 464C(a)(2) conviction into the \u00a7 554 conviction. On the contrary, where two offenses are the same under the required evidence test, settled Maryland law prohibits the merger of the offense containing the greater elements into the included offense. The matter before us in this case, and particularly any question of which offense should merge for sentencing purposes, is entirely governed by Maryland merger law.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>As indicated above, the position taken in Judge McAuliffe\u2019s dissenting opinion is directly contrary to established Maryland merger law; it would require this Court to overrule many of its prior opinions. This Court has consistently held, without exception, that where there is merger based on the required evidence test, the included offense merges into the offense with the distinct element, regardless of the maximum sentence which each offense carries. No decision by this Court furnishes support for merging, when two offenses are the same under the required evidence test, the offense with a distinct element into the included offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Thus, in <em>Flannigan v. State, supra, </em>232 Md. 13, 191 A.2d 591, the defendant was convicted of obtaining $57.00 by a bad check with intent to defraud in violation of then Maryland Code (1957, 1967 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 142. He was also convicted, under a separate count, of obtaining money by false pretenses. Both convictions were based on the same acts. The maximum authorized sentence for the \u00a7 142 conviction was imprisonment for 18 months. The authorized sentence for the false pretenses conviction was, under then Art. 27, \u00a7 140, imprisonment \u201cfor not less than two years nor more than ten years.\u201d The trial court imposed a sentence of two years imprisonment which was authorized for the false pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>tenses conviction. On appeal, this Court remanded, ordering that the judgment under the false pretenses count be stricken out and that sentence be imposed on the \u00a7 142 conviction not to exceed 18 months imprisonment. In holding that the false pretenses conviction merged into the \u00a7 142 conviction under the required evidence test, and that the prison sentence could not exceed the 18-month maximum authorized by \u00a7 142, this Court stated (232 Md. at 19, 191 A.2d at 593-594):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-5\">\u201cWe recently had occasion to state the circumstances under which one criminal act may violate two statutes. <em>Veney v. State, </em>227 Md. 608, 177 A.2d 883. We quoted from Judge Soper\u2019s opinion in <em>Aaronson v. United States, </em>175 F.2d 41 (C.A., 4 [1949]), as follows: \u2018A single transaction may be an offense against two statutes if each statute requires proof of a fact which the other does not.\u2019 Applying that test to the instant case, it is readily observed that a conviction under \u00a7 142 requires \u2018proof of a fact\u2019 (a worthless check) that \u00a7 140 does not necessarily require. However, a conviction under \u00a7 140, when a bad check is involved, does not require \u2018proof of a fact\u2019 that is not essential to sustain a conviction under \u00a7 142. Hence, we hold that appellant should not have been convicted on the fourth count.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-6\">*****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-7\">\u201cWe shall, therefore, remand the case for the imposition of a proper sentence under the conviction on the third count.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">The Court in <em>Johnson v. State, supra, </em>283 Md. at 203-204, 388 A.2d at 930, again held that, where two offenses are deemed the same under the required evidence test, the included offense merges into the offense having a distinct element regardless of the maximum authorized sentence for each offense. In that case, the defendant Johnson, an employee of the State Department of Social Services, devised and carried out a scheme under which he defrauded the State out of $33,000.00 over a period of 2/6 years by preparing and submitting false applications for welfare payments which resulted in the Department\u2019s issuing checks to various fictitious persons. Johnson or an accomplice then cashed the checks. Johnson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>was convicted of obtaining money by false pretenses and of welfare fraud in violation of Art. 27, \u00a7 230A. As previously indicated, the maximum penalty for a conviction of obtaining money by false pretenses was 10 years imprisonment. The maximum penalty for welfare fraud under \u00a7 230A was, and still is, three years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The trial court in <em>Johnson </em>sentenced the defendant to four years imprisonment on the false pretenses convictions and sentenced him to concurrent terms on the welfare fraud convictions. The Court of Special Appeals, taking the same view that Judge McAuliffe now takes, held that the welfare fraud convictions merged into the false pretenses convictions and vacated the judgments on the welfare fraud counts. This Court, however, in an opinion by Judge Marvin Smith, held that, under the required evidence test, false pretenses was an included offense within welfare fraud, that the convictions for false pretenses merged into the convictions for welfare fraud, and that \u201c[t]he sentence must be under \u00a7 230A, which provides the lesser penalty. Thus, the Court of Special Appeals erred.\u201d 283 Md. at 204, 388 A.2d at 930. This Court in <em>Johnson </em>also specifically rejected the same position which is taken by Judge McAuliffe today, saying <em>(ibid.):</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-6\">\u201cThere is at least the suggestion here that because false pretenses carries a potential punishment of 10 years imprisonment while the maximum imprisonment for welfare fraud is three years that this in some fashion makes false pretenses the greater crime into which welfare fraud would merge. This concept was rejected by the Court in <em>Flannigan v. State, </em>232 Md. 13, 19, 191 A.2d 591 (1963).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-7\"><em>See also, e.g., Nightingale v.

No Maryland case, to the best of our knowledge, draws the distinction suggested by Judge Chasanow\u2019s dissent. On the contrary, our cases have treated the prohibitions of \u00a7 554 relating to oral sex acts with other persons the same as prohibitions against fellatio and cunnilingus. <em>See, e.g., Schochet v. State, supra, </em>320 Md. at 718, 732, 580 A.2d at 178, 185 (referring to the defendant\u2019s being charged with \u201cfellatio, in violation of Art. 27, \u00a7 554,\u201d and referring to the fact that \u201ccases in this Court have upheld convictions under \u00a7 554 based on engaging or attempting to engage in fellatio\u201d); <em>Neville v.

Because \u00a7 554 refers to \u201cthe sexual organ of any other person\u201d and prohibits \u201cplacing ... <em>her </em>sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>organ <em>into </em>the mouth of another person\u201d (emphasis added), it also encompasses cunnilingus. Because of this, the statute obviously requires no more than the application of one person\u2019s mouth, lips or tongue to another person\u2019s sexual organ.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Judge Chasanow\u2019s dissent attempts to find support for its narrow construction of \u00a7 554\u2019s oral sex prohibitions in <em>Thomas v. State, </em>301 Md. 294, 483 A.2d 6 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>470 U.S. 1088, 105 S.Ct. 1856, 85 L.Ed.2d 153 (1985). In <em>Thomas, </em>the appellant, who forced a woman to kiss his penis, was convicted of violating \u00a7 464(a) of Art. 27 which provides that \u201c[a] person is guilty of a sexual offense in the first degree if the person engages in a sexual act ... \u201d under one of four aggravating circumstances. As previously discussed, \u201csexual act\u201d as defined in Art. 27, \u00a7 461(e), includes \u201cfellatio.\u201d The word \u201cfellatio\u201d itself, however, is undefined. The appellant in <em>Thomas </em>contended that fellatio required proof of penetration of the mouth. This Court, reasoning that the legislature intended \u201cto give \u2018fellatio\u2019 its common, ordinary and well-accepted meaning,\u201d held that \u201cfellatio, within the meaning of \u00a7 461(e), encompasses the oral contact with the male sex organ involved in this case.\u201d <em>Thomas, </em>301 Md. at 32, 483 A.2d at 20. Section 554 was not at issue in the <em>Thomas </em>ease, nor were the requirements of \u00a7 554 discussed therein. While the Court in <em>Thomas </em>pointed out that the appellant in that case was not charged under \u00a7 554, nothing in this Court\u2019s opinion suggested that \u00a7 554\u2019s oral sex prohibitions were more narrow than fellatio or cunnilingus.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Judge Chasanow\u2019s dissent alternatively argues that, under this Court\u2019s decisions, multiple sentences under both \u00a7 464C(a)(2) and \u00a7 554 are permissible in the case at bar. Reliance is placed upon <em>Whack v. State, supra, </em>288 Md. 137, 416 A.2d 265, and <em>Frazier v. State, </em>318 Md. 597, 612-615, 569 A.2d 684, 692-693 (1990), as well as language from the opinion in <em>Randall Book Corp. v.

His dissent concludes that the Legislature intended that the \u00a7 4640(a)(2) offense be treated as a \u201cparticular aggravating circumstance\u201d designed to impose punishment \u201ccumulative to the punishment existing under \u00a7 554.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">The position taken by Judge Chasanow cannot be squared with our cases or with the language of \u00a7 464C.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Under this Court\u2019s decisions, the required evidence test is not simply another rule of statutory construction. Instead, it is a long-standing rule of law to determine whether one offense is included within another when both are based on the same act or acts. <em>See, Hagans v. State, </em>316 Md. 429, 445-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>453, 559 A.2d 792, 799-804 (1989). The notion that the required evidence test functions only as rule of statutory construction, in the context of multiple punishments, is refuted by the many cases holding that the test is fully applicable to determine merger issues involving common law crimes, including common law crimes for which there is no statutorily prescribed penalty. <em>See, e.g., In re Montrail, supra, </em>325 Md. at 532, 601 A.2d at 1104 (\u201cThe required evidence test \u2018applies to both common law and statutory offenses\u2019 \u201d); <em>Biggus v.

State, supra, </em>280 Md. at 274 n. 4, 373 A.2d at 269 n. 4, this Court did not appear to recognize any exception to the rule that multiple punishments were prohibited when a defendant, based on the same act or acts, was convicted of both a greater and an included offense. The Court in such cases simply vacated the sentence on the included offense, taking the position that multiple punishments were forbidden as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">In <em>Newton, </em>although holding that the included offense involved in that case merged into the greater offense, this Court for the first time noted as follows (280 Md. at 274 n. 4, 373 A.2d at 269 n. 4, emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">\u201c[T]he legislature may indicate an <em>express intent </em>to punish certain conduct more severely if particular aggravating circumstances are present by imposing punishment under two separate statutory offenses which otherwise would be deemed the same under the required evidence test.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALA\">Nevertheless, our opinions since <em>Newton </em>have recognized that the above-noted exception is very limited, and that, when two offenses, based on the same act or acts, are deemed to be the same under the required evidence test, there is merger as a matter of course. <em>See, e.g., In re Montrail M., supra, </em>325 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>at 533, 601 A.2d at 1104 (the two offenses \u201care deemed to be the same under the required evidence test, and merger follows as a matter of course\u201d); <em>Williams v.

For example, Judge Chasanow\u2019s dissent relies on language from <em>Randall Book Corp v. State, supra, </em>316 Md. at 324, 558 A.2d at 720, that, with regard to multiple punishments, \u201ca critical question is one of legislative intent\u201d and that the required evidence test \u201cis not dispositive.\u201d But, in the very same paragraph from the <em>Randall Book </em>opinion, we explained why the required evidence test is not dispositive. Judge McAuliffe there stated for the Court (316 Md. at 323, 558 A.2d at 719-720, emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-6\">\u201cThe [required evidence] rule does not provide the final answer in cases involving multiple punishment because, <em>when specifically authorized </em>by the legislature, cumulative sentences for the same offense may under some circumstances be imposed after a single trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Consequently, specific or express authorization by the Legislature is a pre-condition for multiple punishments when two offenses are deemed the same under the required evidence test.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>See, also, Williams v.

The only two cases in which we have applied the exception, <em>Whack v. State, supra, </em>and <em>Frazier v. State, supra, </em>involved convictions under the 1972 handgun statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The defendant in the <em>Whack </em>case was convicted of and received separate sentences for armed robbery under Art. 27, \u00a7 488, and use of a handgun in the commission of a felony under Art. 27, \u00a7 36B(d), based upon a single act of robbery with a handgun. Relying upon the language in <em>Newton, supra, </em>280 Md. at 274 n. 4, 373 A.2d at 269 n. 4, that multiple sentences may in some circumstances be allowable for two offenses, which are deemed the same under the required evidence test, if there is \u201can express intent to punish certain conduct more severely if particular aggravating circumstances are present,\u201d we upheld the multiple sentences in <em>Whack. </em>We initially pointed out in <em>Whack </em>that the General Assembly, in the Handgun Act of 1972, \u201cspecifically addressed the matter of other statutes\u201d encompassing conduct that was also an offense under the Handgun Act, and \u201cspecifically amended or superseded those other statutes\u201d where \u201cit desired no duplication,\u201d 288 Md. at 145, 146, 416 A.2d at 269-270. More importantly, in <em>Whack </em>we relied on the language in the Handgun Act, Art. 27, \u00a7 36B(d), where the General Assembly stated that the offense of using a handgun in the commission of a felony or a misdemeanor constituting a crime of violence shall be a \u201cseparate\u201d offense and <em>expressly </em>stated that the sentence under the Handgun Act shall be \u201cin addition to any other sentence imposed by virtue of commission of said felony or misdemean- or,\u201d 288 Md. at 147, 416 A.2d at 270.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">In <em>Frazier v. State, supra, </em>318 Md. at 612-615, 569 A.2d at 692-693, we held that the express intent of the General Assembly in the Handgun Act of 1972 allowed the imposition of multiple punishments for two offenses deemed to be the same under the required evidence test, namely wearing, carry<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>ing and transporting a handgun in violation of Art. 27, \u00a7 36B(b) and possession of a revolver after being convicted of a crime of violence in violation of Art. 27, \u00a7 445(c). The <em>Frazier </em>opinion relied entirely upon the <em>Whack </em>opinion and the language of the handgun statute set forth in <em>Whack.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">These decisions under the Handgun Act of 1972 furnish no support for the argument that the present case falls within the limited exception to the principle that merger follows as a matter of course when two offenses, based on the same act or acts, are the same under the required evidence test. The statutory language of the Handgun Act itself specifically addressed the matter of duplication of offenses and expressly provided for cumulative sentences under particular circumstances. The language of the fourth degree sexual offense statute, Art. 27, \u00a7 464C, does not \u201cspecifically\u201d or \u201cexpressly\u201d or \u201cclearly\u201d address the matter or provide for cumulative sentences. In fact, neither the language of \u00a7 464C, nor the language of Ch. 573 of the Acts of 1976 which enacted the new sexual offenses subheading to Art. 27 of the Code (\u00a7\u00a7 461-464E), deals with the matter of multiple punishments.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Judge Chasanow\u2019s dissent takes the position that \u00a7 464C was intended to be a penalty enhancement statute similar to the \u00a7 36B(d) provision of the Handgun Act involved in the <em>Whack </em>case. There is, however, little similarity. Section 36B(d), which provides an enhanced penalty for using a handgun in the commission of a felony or a misdemeanor constituting a crime of violence, expressly, in the statutory language, delineated the other crimes which would trigger the enhanced penalty under \u00a7 36B(d). The language of \u00a7 464C, on the other hand, makes no reference to any other crimes. The statutory language is not in terms of penalty enhancement. Moreover, our cases have not viewed the sexual offense statutes as penalty enhancement provisions. When the same conduct has been an offense under either \u00a7 464A or 464B or 464C, and has also constituted another offense, with both being deemed the same under the required evidence test, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>have not permitted multiple punishments. <em>See, e.g., Biggus v. State, supra, </em>323 Md. at 350-352, 593 A.2d at 1065-1066; <em>Nightingale v. State, supra, </em>312 Md. 699, 542 A.2d 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">As shown by the language of the Handgun Act of 1972, as well as the language of other statutes, the General Assembly is well aware of the principles of merger under Maryland law and knows how to specifically or expressly provide for multiple punishments in situations where there would otherwise be a merger.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In \u00a7 464C, the General Assembly most certainly did not specifically or expressly authorize multiple punishments. Consequently, the present case does not fall within the exception noted in <em>Newton </em>and applied in <em>Whack.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Judge Chasanow\u2019s dissent finds \u201cclear\u201d legislative intent that the General Assembly intended multiple punishments under both \u00a7 464C and \u00a7 554 by relying on the legislative history of \u00a7 464C. This history shows that the 1976 Senate bill providing for the new sexual offense statutes, Senate Bill 358, as it originally passed the Senate, would have repealed \u00a7 554 and \u00a7 553 (punishing sodomy with a ten-year maximum prison sentence), but that, prior to final enactment, the provision repealing \u00a7\u00a7 554 and 553 was deleted. The legislative history of \u00a7 464C does not provide any evidence of legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>intent to authorize multiple punishments. We reviewed this legislative history in <em>Schochet v. State, supra, </em>320 Md. at 734-735, 580 A.2d at 185-186. The only discussion in the legislative history of whether or not \u00a7\u00a7 554 and 553 should be retained was in the report of the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, and the matter of multiple punishments was not mentioned in that report. The Committee\u2019s reasons for proposing the deletion of \u00a7\u00a7 554 and 553 had nothing to do with multiple punishments. Furthermore, in <em>Schochet, </em>we took the position that the likely reasons for retaining \u00a7\u00a7 554 and 553 were to encompass conduct not covered by \u00a7\u00a7 464, 464A, 464B and 464C.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">The language and history of \u00a7 464C no more reflects a legislative intent favoring multiple punishments than the language and history of numerous other statutes which have been before this Court in similar cases where we have held that an included offense merges into a greater offense. Permitting multiple punishments in the present case simply cannot be reconciled with our prior cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Moreover, the consequences of upholding multiple punishments in the present situation dictate that, if the General Assembly intends multiple punishments, it should specifically or expressly provide for them. For example, since every violation of \u00a7 464C(a)(2) is also a violation of \u00a7 554 or \u00a7 553, adopting Judge Chasanow\u2019s view would subject everyone convicted of violating \u00a7 464C(a)(2) to a maximum of eleven years imprisonment (one year under 464C(a)(2) and ten years under \u00a7\u00a7 554 or 553). Nonetheless, the General Assembly expressly determined that the maximum prison sentence for violating \u00a7 464C(a)(2) should be one year. Furthermore, under Judge Chasanow\u2019s view, the eleven-year maximum term of imprisonment for the fourth degree sexual offense proscribed by \u00a7 464C(a)(2) would exceed the ten-year maximum term for a third degree sexual offense under \u00a7 464B. It would also make every \u00a7 464C(a)(2) violation a so-called \u201cpenitentiary offense\u201d as provided for in \u00a7\u00a7 554 or 553.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>The dissenting opinion by Judge Chasanow, disregarding the requirement of express or specific legislative intent, presumes that whenever an included offense with a higher maximum penalty would merge into a greater offense with a lower maximum penalty under the required evidence test, the Legislature must have intended to authorize cumulative punishments. To reconcile this notion with our prior cases, Judge Chasanow\u2019s opinion, quoting language from <em>Simms v. State, supra, </em>288 Md. at 726, 421 A.2d at 965, suggests that an included offense with a larger maximum penalty should merge into a greater offense with a smaller maximum penalty only when the additional element or elements of the latter offense are mitigating factors or when the lesser offense is a common law offense with no statutory maximum.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The quoted language from the <em>Simms </em>opinion, relied on by Judge Chasanow, is simply an observation that usually greater offenses represent more heinous crimes but that sometimes the additional element of the greater offense \u201cmay have been viewed\u201d by the Legislature as a mitigating factor. <em>Simms, 288 </em>Md. at 726, 421 A.2d at 965. This qualified observation from <em>Simms, </em>concerning a possible legislative viewpoint under some circumstances, certainly was not intended to, and did not, change Maryland merger law. Moreover, the <em>Simms </em>opinion made it clear that the merger and sentencing principles set forth in that opinion were applicable regardless of whether the distinct element of the greater offense is viewed as a mitigating or aggravating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">A review of this Court\u2019s opinions demonstrates that, where two charged offenses have been deemed the same under the required evidence test, and where neither offense was under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>the Handgun Act of 1972, there has been a merger regardless of whether the distinct element of the greater offense is viewed as an aggravating factor, a mitigating factor, or neither. Whenever this Court has determined that the offenses are the same under the required evidence test and that the Legislature did not expressly or specifically authorize multiple punishments, the included offense has <em>invariably </em>been merged into the greater offense, without regard to the maximum penalties of each or the heinousness of the conduct. On the facts of several cases in this Court, where an included offense carrying a longer maximum penalty was merged into a greater offense carrying a shorter maximum penalty, or where the maximum penalty for the included offense was capped by the shorter maximum penalty of a charged greater offense, the defendant\u2019s conduct was quite heinous and in no way deserving of mitigation in sentencing. <em>See, e.g., Biggus v. State, supra, </em>323 Md. at 344, 593 A.2d at 1062 (defendant, displaying a \u201cutility knife or razor knife\u201d and a hypodermic needle, forceably committed digital anal penetration upon a 13-year old boy and punched the boy on the head when he tried to leave); <em>Snowden v. State, supra, </em>321 Md. at 614-615, 583 A.2d at 1057-1058 (defendant assaulted and battered the robbery victim by shooting him in the arm with a rifle); <em>Nightingale v. State, supra, </em>312 Md. at 700-702, 542 A2d at 1062 (on repeated occasions, the two defendants committed various acts of sexual child abuse on their 13 and 14 year old daughters); <em>Johnson v. State, </em>310 Md. 681, 682-683, 531 A.2d 675, 675-676 (1987) (involved a vicious attack, with a baseball bat, upon the victim); <em>Simms v. State, supra, </em>288 Md. at 715-718, 421 A.2d at 959-960 (one defendant assaulted the victim with a wine bottle and the other defendant assaulted a different victim with a gun); <em>Johnson v. State, supra, </em>283 Md. at 200-203, 388 A.2d at 928-930.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Underlying Judge Chasanow\u2019s insistence that the General Assembly intended cumulative punishments in this case is the view that merging an offense with a 10-year maximum sentence into an offense with one-year maximum sentence is illogical and unsound. In our view, the merger <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>principles which have been consistently followed by this Court are neither illogical nor unsound.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">The required evidence test merger situation involving a greater offense with a shorter maximum penalty, and an included offense with a longer maximum penalty, typically arises when the included offense is a relatively broad offense covering a wide range of conduct and the greater <em>offense </em>(because of the additional elements) is a narrower offense covering the specific type of conduct engaged in by the defendant. <em>See, e.g., Biggus v. State, supra, </em>323 Md. at 350-352, 593 A.2d at 1065-1066 (offense of battery, carrying a greater maximum penalty, was merged into a sexual offense, carrying a lesser maximum penalty).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The longer maximum penalty for the included offense is appropriate because of the wide range of conduct encompassed and the need for flexibility in sentencing depending upon the conduct involved in a particular case. <em>See Simms v. State, supra, </em>288 Md. at 726, 421 A.2d at 965 (\u201cbasic crimes such as simple assault or larceny can embrace an almost infinite variety of fact patterns\u201d). <em>See also State v. Duckett, </em>306 Md. 503, 510-511, 510 A.2d 253, 257 (1986) (\u201cthe types of offenses which fall within the ambit of the crime of battery vary widely\u201d). The maximum penalty prescribed by statute for the greater and more circumscribed offense, however, represents a legislative judgment <em>concerning </em>the punishment for the precise type of conduct prohibited by that statute. In light of this, as well as the usual rule of law that the specific controls over the general, it is reasonable to sentence the defendant in accordance with the offense more specifically tailored to his or her conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Section 554, like common law battery, is an offense of a \u201cvery broad and sweeping nature\u201d and a statute \u201ccontaining broad general language,\u201d <em>Schochet v. State, supra, </em>320 Md. at 729, 731, 580 A.2d at 183, 184. Section 554 encompasses conduct ranging from the extremely heinous forceful attack upon a pregnant woman, by her doctor, involved in <em>Berger v. State, </em>179 Md. 410, 20 A.2d 146 (1941),<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> to the consensual, heterosexual conduct between two adults involved in <em>Neville v. State, supra, </em>290 Md. at 370-371, 430 A.2d at 573 (1981). Contrary to the apparent view of the dissenting opinions, the General Assembly obviously did not contemplate that every type of conduct falling within the broad proscriptions of \u00a7 554 be punished with ten years imprisonment. If the General Assembly had contemplated such a result, it would not have enacted \u00a7 4640(a)(2), because every violation of \u00a7 4640(a)(2) is also a violation of \u00a7 554 or \u00a7 553.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">While \u00a7 554 is a broad statute, \u00a7 4640(a)(2) is narrow, applying only to \u201ccunnilingus, fellatio, analingus, or anal intercourse\u201d performed upon a 14 or 15 year old by a person four or more years older. The distinctive elements of \u00a7 4640(a)(2), not found in \u00a7 554, which brings the present case within \u00a7 464C(a)(2)\u2019s coverage, are the ages of the defendant and of the person upon whom he performed fellatio.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">In arguing that it is illogical to limit the defendant\u2019s sentence to one-year imprisonment, Judge Chasanow emphasizes the \u201caggravating circumstance\u201d that the youth involved was 15 years of age. But it is precisely because the youth was 15 years old that the case falls within \u00a7 4640(a)(2). Section 4640(a)(2) is specifically and deliberately aimed at sexual relations with 14 or 15 year olds. The whole purpose of those provisions of a fourth degree sexual offense relating to consensual sexual activity (\u00a7 4640(a)(2) and \u00a7 4640(a)(3)) was to prohibit an adult from engaging in such activity with a 14 or 15 year old. Moreover, in the very next sentence of the fourth degree sexual offense statute, \u00a7 4640(b), the General Assem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>bly determined that the older person who engages in the proscribed sexual activity with a 14 or 15 year old \u201cis subject to imprisonment for a period of not more than one year....\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> What Judge Chasanow\u2019s dissenting opinion really finds \u201cillogical,\u201d it would seem, is the General Assembly\u2019s judgment that a person who performs fellatio on a 15 year old should be subject to a maximum of only one year imprisonment. Nevertheless, that is a matter for the General Assembly and not for this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">As previously mentioned, because every violation of \u00a7 464C(a)(2) is also a violation of either \u00a7 554 or \u00a7 558, under Judge Chasanow\u2019s view every violation of \u00a7 464C(a)(2) would be punishable by a maximum of eleven years imprisonment. Such eleven year effective maximum sentence for conduct constituting a fourth degree sexual offense under \u00a7 464C(a)(2) would be greater than the ten-year maximum sentence for a third degree sexual offense under \u00a7 464B. This result would be illogical.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">For the reasons discussed above, the Court of Special Appeals in this case correctly held that the \u00a7 554 offense merges into the \u00a7 464C(a)(2) offense under the required evidence test.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

Judge Chasanow\u2019s dissent also discusses the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, along with several United States Supreme Court cases, and points out that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not necessarily preclude multiple punishments for the same act, under two statutory offenses which are deemed to be the same offense under the required evidence test, and that the matter of legislative intent is particularly important in determining the constitutional permissibility of multiple punishments. Judge Chasanow's dissent, however, later acknowledges that these principles are essentially reflected in numerous Maryland cases dealing with the merger of offenses. In fact, prior to any of the Supreme Court decisions on this subject relied on by Judge Chasanow's dissent, this Court in <em>Newton v. State, </em>280 Md. 260, 274 n. 4, 373 A.2d 262, 269 n. 4 (1977), pointed out that multiple punishments under two different statutory provisions, deemed to be the same offense under the required evidence test, could in some circumstances be imposed for the same act where the Legislature expressly indicated such an intent. <em>See also, e.g., Whack v. State, </em>288 Md. 137, 143, 416 A.2d 265, 268 (1980), <em>appeal dismissed and cert., denied, </em>450 U.S. 990, 101 S.Ct. 1688, 68 L.Ed.2d 189 (1981) (\u2018\u2018The imposition of multiple punishment ... is of ten particularly dependent upon the intent of the Legislature\").</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">Consequently, we do not suggest that the result in the present case would be any different under the Supreme Court cases cited by Judge Chasanow's dissent. Nevertheless, for the reasons set forth in Part IV A, we base our holding in this case entirely upon Maryland common law merger principles.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b542-8\">. Even the Supreme Court cases cited in Judge Chasanow\u2019s dissent recognize the need for absolutely clear legislative intent to authorize multiple punishments when the multiple offenses are deemed to be the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>same under the required evidence test. Thus, in <em>Missouri v. Hunter, </em>459 U.S. 359, 368, 103 S.Ct. 673, 679, 74 L.Ed.2d 535, 543-544 (1983), the Supreme Court held that multiple punishments did not violate the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Double Jeopardy Clause because of \"clearly expressed legislative intent\u201d and because \"[h]ere, the Missouri Legislature has made its intent crystal clear.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">In <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>United States, </em>445 U.S. 684, 695, 100 S.Ct. 1432, 1439, 63 L.Ed.2d 715, 725-726 (1980), the Court struck down multiple sentences because Congressional intent to authorize such sentences was not \"clearly\u201d expressed. The Court in <em>Whalen </em>rejected the same type of statutory construction arguments which Judge Chasanow\u2019s dissent advances in the present case. The offenses in <em>United States v. Woodward, </em>469 U.S. 105, 105 S.Ct. 611, 83 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985), were not the same under the required evidence test, and, for this reason, cumulative sentences were permitted. In <em>Albernaz v. United States, </em>450 U.S. 333, 101 S.Ct. 1137, 67 L.Ed.2d 275 (1981), the offenses also were not the same under the required evidence test.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Finally, in its most recent expression on the matter, <em>United States v. Dixon, supra, </em>113 S.Ct. at 2856, 125 L.Ed.2d at 568, the Supreme Court stated as follows: \"In both the multiple punishment and multiple prosecution contexts, this Court has concluded that where the two offenses for which the defendant is punished or tried cannot survive the \u2018same-elements\u2019 test, the double jeopardy bar applies.\u201d There was not even a mention of the \"expressed legislative intent\u201d exception in the opinion of the Court. This reinforces the principle that where two offenses are deemed the same under the required evidence test, merger follows as a matter of course.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b543-8\">. In light of these cases, if the required evidence test, as applied in the context of multiple punishments under statutory offenses, is viewed as a rule of statutory construction, it would clearly not be an ordinary rule of statutory construction to be applied along with various other rules and criteria. Instead, it would be a rule which, in <em>all </em>cases falling within its scope, strictly presumes that the legislative body did not intend multiple punishments unless the pertinent statutes expressly or specifically authorize multiple punishments. To view the required evidence test as simply another rule of statutory construction, as Judge Chasanow's dissent does, renders the test indistinguishable from the rule of lenity which is applicable when offenses are not deemed the same under the required evidence test. Nevertheless, our cases, as well as the Supreme Court cases cited by Judge Chasanow, draw a clear distinction between the required evidence test and the rule of lenity. <em>See, e.g., White v. State, supra, </em>318 Md. at 742-744, 744-748, 569 A.2d at 1272-1273, 1273-1275. <em>See also, e.g., Albernaz v.

State, </em>312 Md. 699, 542 A.2d 373 (1988). In <em>Nightingale </em>this Court held that the several sexual offenses proscribed by \u00a7\u00a7 464A, 464B, and 464C, were, under the required evidence test, included within sexual child abuse proscribed by \u00a7 35A, when based on the same acts, that, therefore, there was merger, and that multiple punishments were consequently precluded. It is noteworthy that the General Assembly, while dissatisfied on policy grounds with the consequences of the merger holding in <em>Nightingale, </em>did not change in any way the basic principles of Maryland merger law applied in <em>Nightingale. </em>Instead, and in accordance with the existing principles of Maryland law governing the merger of offenses, the General Assembly specifically and expressly authorized multiple punishments in \u00a7 35A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b548-6\">. A strained analysis has given rise to the exceptions crafted by Judge Chasanow. For example, in discussing the decision merging a sexual offense conviction into a conviction for sexual child abuse in <em>Nightingale v. State, supra, </em>312 Md. 699, 542 A.2d 373, he advances the dubious proposition that it is \"at least possible that the legislature intended that a sexual offense by a child\u2019s parent, custodian or supervisor was at least theoretically slightly less traumatic or severe than, the same sexual offense committed on the child by a stranger.\u201d 332 Md. at 442, 631 A.2d at 483.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b550-6\">. <em>See also, e.g., Johnson v.

The Fifth Amendment is satisfied, however, if either of the convictions is vacated, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>does not require that the conviction left standing be of the offense having the greatest number of elements. Under the circumstances of this case, I would vacate the judgment of conviction of fourth degree sexual offense, and affirm the judgment for the more serious offense of committing an unnatural or perverted sexual practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">In order not to be considered the same offense for double jeopardy purposes, each offense much require proof of a fact that the other does not. <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932). Although the fourth degree sexual offense (\u00a7 464C offense) contains at least one element that the unnatural and perverted sexual offense (\u00a7 554 offense) does not, the converse is not true. Under the facts of this case, nothing more was needed to prove a \u00a7 554 offense than was required to prove a \u00a7 464C offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">As the majority points out, when applying the <em>Blockburger </em>test to offenses having alternative elements, a court must examine the alternative elements relevant to the case at issue. In his dissent, Judge Chasanow concludes that a \u00a7 554 offense <em>could </em>require proof of a fact not required to establish a \u00a7 464C offense (penetration of the mouth by a sexual organ), and therefore the <em>Blockburger </em>test is satisfied and the two offenses are not the same. I do not agree with that analysis. The inquiry should be case specific, rather than based on theoretical scenarios. In the instant case, the single fact relied on by the State to establish both offenses was that the defendant took the penis of the complainant into his mouth. Judge Chasanow contends that a non-penetrating contact between the complainant\u2019s penis and the defendant\u2019s mouth would have satisfied the \u201cfellatio\u201d element of \u00a7 464C, but not the oral sex element of \u00a7 554. Assuming the accuracy of that statement, it is of no consequence here, because it is to the facts required to prove the \u00a7 464C violation in this case that we look, and not to what might occur in some other case.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">In <em>Harris v. Oklahoma, </em>433 U.S. 682, 97 S.Ct. 2912, 53 L.Ed.2d 1054 (1977), the defendant challenged, on double <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>jeopardy grounds, a conviction of robbery with firearms following a conviction of felony murder. He argued that the predicate felony relied on by the State to establish felony murder was the same robbery with firearms for which he was subsequently convicted. Although it is perfectly obvious that the felony element of felony murder may be established by proof of any number of violent felonies, and thus successive prosecutions for felony murder and for robbery with firearms would not offend the Double Jeopardy Clause if the underlying felony relied on to establish the felony murder were anything other than robbery with firearms, those were not the facts of the <em>Hams </em>case. Focusing on the particular facts of that ease, and the facts relied on by the State to prove the felony murder, the Supreme Court held that a successive prosecution for robbery with firearms was barred. To the same effect, see <em>Newton v. State, </em>280 Md. 260, 265-68, 373 A.2d 262 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Multiple punishments may be permitted for offenses that are the same within the meaning of the Double Jeopardy Clause, but only when the legislature specifically intends that result.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-7\">The <em>Blockburger </em>rule does not provide the final answer in cases involving, multiple punishment because, when specifically authorized by the legislature, cumulative sentences for the same offense may under some circumstances be imposed after a single trial. <em>Missouri v. Hunter, </em>459 U.S. 359, 368-69, 103 S.Ct. 673, 679-80, 74 L.Ed.2d 535 (1983); <em>Albernaz v.

Accordingly, when dealing with the question of multiple punishments imposed after a single trial, and based on the same conduct, a critical question is one of legislative intent. The <em>Block-burger </em>test is helpful in such cases as an aid in determining legislative intent, but is not dispositive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-8\"><em>Randall Book Corp. v. State, </em>316 Md. 315, 323-24, 558 A.2d 715 (1989). I find no indication that the legislature intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>to permit multiple punishments when the same conduct resulted in violations of \u00a7 464C and \u00a7 554. Accordingly, I agree with the majority that one of the convictions must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">I do not agree that the proper remedy in this case is to vacate the \u00a7 554 conviction and the accompanying sentence of 10 years imprisonment<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and a f\u00edne of $1,000, and to leave standing the \u00a7 464C conviction and its sentence of one year imprisonment (suspended) and a fine of $1,000. The Double Jeopardy Clause is fully satisfied if one of the convictions is vacated and the defendant is given a sentence no greater than was intended by the legislature. As Justice Kennedy pointed out for the Supreme Court, \u201cneither the Double Jeopardy Clause nor any other constitutional provision exists to provide unjustified windfalls.\u201d <em>Jones v. Thomas, </em>491 U.S. 376, 387, 109 S.Ct. 2522, 105 L.Ed.2d 322 (1989). Unless the legislature intended that \u00a7 464C entirely supplant \u00a7 554 when the described age differential was present,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a result not suggested by the majority nor supported by the facts, the penalty imposed for the violation of \u00a7 554 is entirely proper.

Lancaster initially ingratiated himself to Louis by paying for an occasional meal and sponsoring a night at the skating rink. Lancaster began inviting Louis to his home. Louis testified that, on the first visit, Lancaster showed him his gun collection and the two watched television. Two days later, Lancaster picked up Louis and, on the way to Lancaster\u2019s home, bought an X-rated video tape. Once home, Lancaster put the tape in his VCR and, after twenty minutes of viewing, Lancaster pulled down Louis\u2019s pants and performed \u201coral sex\u201d on Louis. Afterward, the two went to the skating rink where Lancaster paid Louis\u2019s admission. This scenario became the blueprint for regular triweekly rendezvous where Lancaster would have \u201coral sex\u201d with Louis. Louis testified that approximately six months after the first encounter, he contacted the police because he was feeling \u201cbad about [himjself\u2019 and didn\u2019t want to become like Lancaster.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Lancaster was charged and convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court for Allegany County of one count of committing an unnatural or perverted sexual practice under Maryland Code (1957, 1987 Repl.Vol.), Article 27, \u00a7 554<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and one count of committing a fourth degree sexual offense under \u00a7 464C(a)(2). Both offenses were alleged to have occurred over approximately a six-month period from July, 1988 through January, 1989. Lancaster received the maximum penalty of ten years\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of $1,000 for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>conviction under \u00a7 554 with five years of the ten-year sentence suspended and five years\u2019 probation. Lancaster also received the maximum penalty of one year imprisonment and a $1,000 fine under \u00a7 464C, that term of imprisonment was suspended and five years probation was imposed to run concurrently with the probation for the suspended portion of the sentence imposed under \u00a7 554. Lancaster appealed his convictions to the Court of Special Appeals. The intermediate appellate court vacated the conviction and ten-year sentence for unnatural or perverted sex practices holding that, under the required evidence test, that conviction and sentence merged into the conviction and one-year suspended sentence for a fourth degree sex offense under \u00a7 464C.

The next inquiry is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>whether the unnatural or perverted sex practice of \u201ctaking into [one\u2019s] mouth the sexual organ of [another]\u201d requires more than, and therefore is different from, the fourth degree sexual act of fellatio. Since the legislature used different terms, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cfellatio\u201d under \u00a7 464C and \u201ctaking into [one\u2019s] mouth the sexual organ of [another]\u201d in \u00a7 554, we may logically assume the statutes meant to punish different acts. The trial judge and both parties seemed to be under the impression that both statutes required different acts. Without any objection, the trial judge gave the following instruction to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-5\">\u201cNow there are two charges that you must consider in this case. First, a statutory offense known as sexual offense in the fourth degree. In order to convict the Defendant of a sexual offense in the fourth degree, the State must prove the following elements: that the Defendant <em>committed fellatio </em>with the witness Louis [W.]; that at the time the witness Louis [W.] was either fourteen or fifteen years of age; and that at the time the Defendant was at least four years older than the witness Louis [W.].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">Now fellatio means that the Defendant <em>applied his mouth to the sexual organ </em>of the witness Louis [WJ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-7\">s|\u00ab :js</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-8\">Secondly, the Defendant is charged with the offense of unnatural and perverted sexual practices.... In order for the Defendant to be convicted of this offense, the State must prove to you unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant <em>took into his mouth the sexual organ of the witness </em>Louis [W.].\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">If there ever was any doubt that fellatio as defined in the sexual offense statutes is different from the act of taking into his or her mouth the sexual organ of any other person under \u00a7 554, it was clearly resolved in <em>Thomas v. State, </em>301 Md. 294, 483 A.2d 6 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>470 U.S. 1088, 105 S.Ct. 1856, 85 L.Ed.2d 153 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">In <em>Thomas, </em>Chief Judge Murphy writing for the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>\u201cAppellant alleges that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for the first degree sexual offense of forcing Ms. Wilkins to perform fellatio upon him. He argues that Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 554, as interpreted in <em>Gooch v. State, </em>34 Md.App. 331, 367 A.2d 90 (.1976), requires proof that the sexual organ penetrated the mouth. The evidence presented at trial indicated that Ms. Wilkins was forced to \u2018kiss\u2019 appellant\u2019s penis. Since there was no showing that the mouth was penetrated, he argues that the evidence was insufficient to support the first degree sexual offense conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-5\">Appellant\u2019s contention is meritless. Section 554 pertains to the crime of \u2018unnatural or perverted sexual practices\u2019; he was not charged with violating this law. Rather, appellant was convicted of a first degree sexual offense as set forth in \u00a7 464(a) of Art. 27, which provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\">\u2018A person is guilty of a sexual offense in the first degree if the person engages in a sexual act:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-7\">(1) With another person by force or threat of force against the will and without the consent of the other person, and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-8\">(i) Employs or displays a dangerous or deadly weapon or an article which the other person reasonably concludes is a dangerous or deadly weapon.... \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-9\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-10\">The term \u2018sexual act,\u2019 as used in this section, is defined by Art. 27, \u00a7 461(e) to include \u2018fellatio\u2019 \u2014 a word not defined in the statute. We think that the legislature intended to give \u2018fellatio\u2019 its common, ordinary and well-accepted meaning. <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>743 (4th ed. rev. 1968) defines fellatio as an \u2018offense committed with the male sexual organ and the mouth.\u2019 <em>See also People v. Sohmers, </em>55 Misc.2d 925, 286 N.Y.S.2d 714, 717 (Crim.Ct.196[8]); <em>State v. McParlin, </em>422 A.2d 742, 743 n. 2 (R.I.1980). <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>gives the following definition: \u2018the practice of obtaining sexual satisfaction by oral stimulation of the penis.\u2019 Under the general view, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>proof of penetration is not required; all that must be shown is some contact between the mouth and the male organ. <em>Carter v. State, </em>122 Ga.App. 21, 176 S.E.2d 238 (1970); <em>State v. Phillips, </em>365 So.2d 1304 (La.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>442 U.S. 919, 99 S.Ct. 2843, 61 L.Ed.2d 287 (1979); <em>McDonald v. State, </em>513 S.W.2d 44 (Tex.Crim.App.1974). Therefore, we hold that fellatio, within the meaning of \u00a7 461(e), encompasses the oral contact with the male sex organ involved in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 320-21, 483 A.2d at 19-20. <em>Thomas </em>establishes that \u00a7 554 contains a requirement that the fourth degree sexual offense under \u00a7 464C does not. The specific statutory offense, under \u00a7 554, of taking <em>into </em>one\u2019s mouth the sexual organ of another requires more than fellatio, which is simply, oral genital <em>contact </em>under \u00a7 464C. Since each offense contains a requirement that the other does not, the two convictions do not violate the <em>Blockburger </em>required evidence test and there can be separate convictions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Although it is clear that the <em>Blockburger </em>test is the only test for successive prosecutions, cumulative sentences arising from the same prosecution may implicate additional issues such as the rule of lenity and merger.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>Successive prosecutions are barred if the two offenses are the same under the <em>Blockburger </em>test or violate the <em>Ashe v. Swenson </em>collateral-estoppel prohibition. Cumulative (as distinguished from successive) sentences present slightly different considerations. I will make no attempt to discuss all of the somewhat perplexing cases discussing, for sentencing purposes, common law double jeopardy, constitutional double jeopardy, merger, and the rule of lenity. I will even assume for the purpose of the cumulative sentences discussion that cumulative sentences imposed by the trial judge violate the <em>Blockburger </em>test and implicate all common law prohibitions, including the rule of lenity and merger, but that does not end our inquiry. Obviously, the legislature can change the common law by statute. <em>Wildermuth v. State, </em>310 Md. 496, 529, 530 A.2d 275, 291-92 (1987); <em>Jones v. State, </em>303 Md. 323, 337 n. 10, 493 A.2d 1062, 1069 n. 10 (1985); <em>Pope v. State, </em>284 Md. 309, 341, 396 A.2d 1054, 1073 (1979). <em>See also </em>Maryland Declaration of Rights, Article 5(a). Further, as I will discuss, the legislature can even provide for cumulative sentences for offenses that clearly are the same under the <em>Blockburger </em>test. For example, the legislature can provide in one statute that robbery is punishable by ten years and in a second statute that robbery with a handgun is punishable by ten years, which sentence shall be in addition to any sentence imposed for robbery. Robbery is a lesser included offense within robbery with a handgun, and the two offenses are the same under the <em>Blockburger </em>test since each does not contain an element not found in the other. Yet, as we will see, the legislature is free to authorize cumulative punishments.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">In <em>Missouri v. Hunter, </em>459 U.S. 359, 103 S.Ct. 673, 74 L.Ed.2d 535 (1983), the Supreme Court stated that \u201csimply because two criminal statutes may be construed to proscribe the same conduct under the <em>Blockburger </em>test does not mean that the Double Jeopardy Clause precludes the imposition, in a single trial, of cumulative punishments pursuant to those statutes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 368, 103 S.Ct. at 679, 74 L.Ed.2d at 543. <em>See also Ohio v.

Woodward, </em>469 U.S. 105, 107-10, 105 S.Ct. 611, 612-13, 83 L.Ed.2d 518, 520-22 (1985) (determining that cumulative punishment was permissible for convictions under the federal currency reporting statute and the false statement statute, where each conviction was based on the same conduct). For additional Supreme Court cases categorizing the <em>Blockburger </em>test as a \u201crule of statutory construction\u201d in the single prosecution/multiple punishment context, see <em>Albernaz v. United States, </em>450 U.S. 333, 340, 101 S.Ct. 1137, 1143, 67 L.Ed.2d 275, 282 (1981); <em>Whalen v.

State, </em>280 Md. 260, 274 n. 4, 373 A.2d 262, 269 n. 4 (1977), pointed out that multiple punishments under two different statutory provisions, deemed the same offense under the required evidence test, could in some circumstances be cumulatively imposed for the same act where the legislature expressly indicated such an intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">In several other <em>post-Newton </em>cases, this Court has recognized that the legislature may punish certain conduct by imposing punishment pursuant to two separate statutory offenses which would otherwise be deemed the same pursuant to the <em>Blockburger </em>required evidence test. In <em>Randall Book Corp. v. State, </em>316 Md. 315, 558 A.2d 715 (1989), Judge McAuliffe writing for the Court stated, \u201cwhen dealing with the question of multiple punishments imposed after a single trial, and based on the same conduct, a critical question is one of legislative intent. The <em>Blockburger </em>test is helpful in such cases as an aid in determining legislative intent, but is not dispositive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 324, 558 A.2d at 720.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">In <em>Whack v.

State, </em>318 Md. 597, 569 A.2d 684 (1990), held that the, conviction for carrying a handgun did not merge into the conviction for possessing a revolver, even if the two offenses were deemed the same under the required evidence test, because we determined that the legislature did not intend to prohibit separate penalties for violation of the two statutes. <em>Id. </em>at 614-15, 569 A.2d at 693. In <em>Frazier, </em>the Court relied upon <em>Whack </em>acknowledging that \u201c \u2018[t]he imposition of multiple punishment ... is often particularly dependent upon the intent of the Legislature.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 613, 569 A.2d at 692 (quoting <em>Whack, </em>288 Md. at 143, 416 A.2d at 268).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">The <em>Whack/Frazier </em>line of cases recognizes that common law merger principles may be modified by the legislature and that separate punishment for two offenses deemed the same under the <em>Blockburger </em>test is a question of legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">III. <em>Legislative Intent</em></p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">The issue before this Court, therefore, would seem to be one of statutory construction and dependent on the intent of the legislature. The conclusion reached by the majority suggests that unless the sentencing court merged the ten-year sentence for violation of Art. 27, \u00a7 554, into the one-year sentence for violation of Art. 27, \u00a7 464C, the punishment would have exceeded the one-year maximum intended by the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">In determining whether cumulative sentences may be imposed for the same offense, this Court has said: \u201cThe key, of course, is legislative intent. As helpful as the various rules of statutory construction may be in determining legislative intent, perhaps the soundest guidance comes from the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>Court\u2019s admonition that we give the language of a statute a \u2018commonsensical meaning.\u2019 \u201d <em>Randall Book, </em>316 Md. at 324, 558 A.2d at 720 (quoting <em>United States v.

We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-5\">\u201cWe approach the propriety of the two sentences ... from the pinnacle we have reached in our many attempts to divine legislative intent.

I believe there is only one clear and obvious intent. Generally, oral genital contact is punishable by up to ten years; the same act practiced upon a 14 or 15-year-old by an adult over four years older is punishable by up to one <em>additional </em>year. The two statutes unquestionably were meant to be cumulative.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">In cases where this Court has tried to determine whether the legislature intended to authorize cumulative punishment, we have read the statutes \u201cin light of external manifestations of intent or general purpose available through other evidence [and have] considered] \u2018the general history and prevailing mood of the legislative body with respect to the type of criminal conduct involved.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cunningham v. State, </em>318 Md. 182, 185, 567 A.2d 126, 127 (1989) (quoting <em>Randall Book, </em>316 Md. at 327, 558 A.2d at 721).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">The Maryland General Assembly initially proscribed unnatural or perverted practices by enacting \u00a7 554 (then \u00a7 439-A) by Chapter 616 of the Acts of 1916 and imposed a maximum imprisonment of ten years upon conviction under the statute. Sixty years later, by Ch. 573 of the Acts of 1976, the legislature \u201cenacted significant and comprehensive legislation which codified Maryland law on rape and other sexual offenses.\u201d J. William Pitcher, <em>Rape and Other Sexual Offense Law Reform in Maryland, 1976-1977, </em>7 U.Balt.L.Rev. 151 (1977). Section 464C, which defines and proscribes fourth degree sex offenses, was a part of the 1976 enactment. This Court in <em>Schochet v. State, </em>320 Md. 714, 580 A.2d 176 (1990), had occasion to examine the legislature\u2019s intent regarding the effect that Ch. 573 of the Acts of 1976 was to have upon \u00a7 554:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-7\">\u201cAs originally introduced and as approved by the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, Senate Bill 358, which became Ch. 573 of the Acts of 1976, would have repealed Art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 553 and 554. The Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee report on Senate Bill 358 stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>\u2018Present law proscribes consensual anal (sodomy) or oral (perverted practices) sexual acts. Since these crimes [under \u00a7\u00a7 553 and 554], when committed between consenting adults, are very rarely prosecuted because of their clandestine and personal nature, they are not a proper subject of statutory recognition by prohibition.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVQ\">Nevertheless, before final enactment, Senate Bill 358 was amended so as not to repeal \u00a7\u00a7 553 and 554. Those sections were left intact.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 734-35, 580 A.2d at 186.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Court in <em>Whack </em>and <em>Frazier </em>examined the legislative history involved in those cases and noted that the General Assembly, upon the enactment of the later statute, amended or superseded some, but not all, of the existing statutes. The <em>Frazier </em>Court recognized that \u201c \u2018[w]here [the legislature] desired no duplication, it specifically amended or superseded those other statutes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Frazier, </em>318 Md. at 614, 569 A.2d at 693 (quoting <em>Whack, </em>288 Md. at 146, 416 A.2d at 270). Thus, in concluding that the legislature did not intend the offenses to be duplicative and did not intend for them to merge, the Court found it was \u201csignificant that the Legislature did not amend or supersede\u201d the earlier existing statute. <em>Id. </em>In the instant case, the legislative history likewise discloses the fact that the legislature was aware of the duplicative nature of the 1976 statutory scheme and the already existing \u00a7\u00a7 553 and 554. The fact that the legislature specifically declined to repeal or amend \u00a7 554 indicates that it did not intend for the 1976 statutory provisions to supplant \u00a7 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">To be sure, this Court has on several occasions merged an offense with a higher penalty into an offense that contained an additional element yet contained a lower penalty. An analysis of each of these cases reveals that generally they are cases where the legislative intent was not clear and it was at least <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>conceivable that the additional element might have been considered by the legislature as a mitigating circumstance, or cases where the \u201clesser\u201d offense was a common law offense with <em>no </em>statutory maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">In <em>Flannigan v. State, </em>232 Md. 13, 191 A.2d 591 (1963), the defendant was convicted of obtaining $57.00 by a bad check with intent to defraud in violation of then Maryland Code (1957, 1962 Cum.Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 142. He was also convicted, under a separate count, of obtaining money by false pretenses. Both convictions were based on the same acts. The maximum authorized sentence for the \u00a7 142 conviction was imprisonment for eighteen months if the amount was under $100 and ten years if the amount was over $100. The authorized sentence for the false pretenses conviction was, under then Art. 27, \u00a7 140, imprisonment \u201cfor not less than two years nor more than ten years\u201d regardless of the amount. The trial court imposed a sentence of two years\u2019 imprisonment which was authorized for the false pretenses conviction, but not by \u00a7 142 because the amount was under $100. On appeal, this Court remanded, ordering that the judgment under the false pretenses count be stricken out and that sentence be imposed on the \u00a7 142 conviction not to exceed eighteen months\u2019 imprisonment. In holding that the false pretenses conviction merged into the \u00a7 142 conviction under the required evidence test, and that the prison sentence could not exceed the eighteen-month maximum authorized by \u00a7 142, this Court stated simply:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-6\">\u201cIn this case, a sentence of two years was imposed. When the value of the property obtained is under the value of $100 in a conviction under \u00a7 142, the maximum penalty is a $50 fine and eighteen months\u2019 confinement. We shall, therefore, remand the case for the imposition of a proper sentence under the conviction on the third count.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 19,191 A.2d at 594. It is clear that one of the additional elements of the eighteen-month \u201cgreater offense\u201d was that the value of the property wrongfully obtained was under $100. Clearly that additional element was a mitigating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>The majority cited and relied on <em>Johnson v. State, </em>283 Md. 196, 203-04, 388 A.2d 926, 930 (1978), which held that the included offense merged into the offense having a distinct additional element. In that case, the defendant Johnson, an employee of the State Department of Social Services, devised and carried out a scheme under which he defrauded the State out of a substantial sum of money by preparing and submitting false applications for welfare payments which resulted in the Department\u2019s issuing checks to various fictitious persons. Johnson or an accomplice then cashed the checks. Johnson was convicted of obtaining money by false pretenses and of welfare fraud in violation of Art. 27, \u00a7 230A. As previously indicated, the maximum penalty for a conviction of obtaining money by false pretenses was ten years\u2019 imprisonment. The maximum penalty for welfare fraud under \u00a7 230A was, and still is, three years\u2019 imprisonment. Johnson was sentenced to four years\u2019 imprisonment on the false pretenses convictions and sentenced to concurrent terms on the welfare fraud convictions. The Court of Special Appeals, holding that the welfare fraud convictions merged into the false pretenses convictions, vacated the judgments on the welfare fraud counts. This Court, however, in an opinion by Judge Marvin Smith, held that, under the required evidence test, false pretenses was an included offense within welfare fraud, that the convictions for false pretenses merged into the convictions for welfare fraud, and that \u201c[t]he sentence must be under \u00a7 230A, which provides the lesser penalty. Thus, the Court of Special Appeals erred.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>283 Md. at 204, 388 A.2d at 930. The legislative intent with regard to cumulative sentences was unclear and it was at least conceivable that the legislature felt it was a less serious offense to defraud the State Department of Social Services than to defraud a private citizen or corporate entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">Another ease where an offense with a higher penalty merged into an offense with a lower penalty is <em>Nightingale v. State, </em>312 Md. 699, 542 A.2d 373 (1988), which held that, where a sexual offense is a required element of child abuse, the conviction for the sexual offense must merge into the convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>tion for child abuse even if the sexual offense carried a higher penalty than child abuse. <em>Id. </em>at 708, 542 A.2d at 377. Although illogical, it was at least possible that the legislature intended that a sexual offense by a child\u2019s parent, custodian, or supervisor was theoretically, slightly less traumatic or severe than the same sexual offense committed on the child by a stranger. Therefore, the additional element in the child abuse statute was at least conceivably a mitigating element. The legislature quickly made it clear that their intent was that these offenses could be punished cumulatively and amended the child abuse statute to provide that \u201c[t]he sentence imposed under this section may be imposed separate from and consecutive to or concurrent with a sentence for any offense based upon the act or acts establishing the abuse.\u201d Md.Code (1957, 1987 Repl.Vol., 1991 Cum.Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 35A(b)(3). <em>See </em>Ch. 604 of the Acts of 1990 (noting House Bill 815\u2019s \u201cpurpose of reversing the holding[ ] of the Maryland Court of Appeals in <em>[Nightingale]\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">In <em>Slye v. State, </em>42 Md.App. 520, 524-27, 401 A.2d 195, 198-200 (1979), the Court of Special Appeals held that, under the required evidence test, a conviction for larceny, for which the maximum prison sentence was 15 years, merged into a conviction for shoplifting, for which the maximum prison sentence was three years. Again, although the court\u2019s analysis was based only on the elements of the offense, it is at least conceivable that the legislature believed that stealing goods from open display counters in mercantile establishments was giving into temptation and thus less severe than other forms of larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">In many of the above cited cases, there was <em>dicta </em>about the offenses with lesser elements merging into offenses with greater elements regardless of the penalty, but these statements were only <em>dicta. </em>It is important to keep in mind the admonition in <em>Dixon </em>where, writing for the Supreme Court, Justice Scalia emphasized the importance in this area of \u201c \u2018the need to distinguish an opinion\u2019s holding from its dicta.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dixon, </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 113 S.Ct. at 2861, 125 L.Ed.2d at 574 (quoting <em>U.S. Nat. Bank of Or. v. Independent Ins. Agents, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>508 U.S. \u2014, \u2014 n. 11, 113 S.Ct. 2173, 2187 n. 11, 124 L.Ed.2d 402, 423 n. 11 (1993)). In our prior merger cases, a careful analysis of the holdings reveals that the legislative intent was not clear, and it was at least conceivable that the legislature intended that there be a merger of the offense with the higher penalty into the offense with the lower penalty. In none of our prior cases would merger have been as unreasonable and illogical as it would be in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Several of our cases have also held that common law offenses with no maximum punishment \u201cmerge into,\u201d and are limited by, the punishment for the \u201cgreater\u201d statutory offense with the added element. For example, in <em>Simms v. State, </em>288 Md. 712, 421 A.2d 957 (1980), the defendants were charged, <em>inter alia, </em>with assault with intent to rob in violation of Art. 27, \u00a7 12, and with common law assault. The maximum sentence for assault with intent to rob is ten years\u2019 imprisonment. The only limitation upon the number of years\u2019 imprisonment to which a defendant may be sentenced for common law assault, as well as common law battery, is the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. Sentences of twenty years\u2019 imprisonment for common law assault have been upheld by this Court. <em>See Roberts v. Warden, </em>242 Md. 459, 219 A.2d 254, <em>cert. denied, </em>385 U.S. 876, 87 S.Ct. 156, 17 L.Ed.2d 104 (1966); <em>Adair v. State, </em>231 Md. 255, 189 A.2d 618 (1963). Assault with intent to rob and common law assault are deemed to be the same offense under the required evidence test. Although common law assault carries the greater maximum penalty, it is the included offense, and assault with intent to rob is the offense with the distinct element, namely an intent to rob. This Court in <em>Simms </em>ordered that the sentences for common law assault be vacated and that the cases be remanded for the imposition of a new sentence, which could not exceed the maximum for assault with intent to rob, <em>i.e., </em>ten years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>Simms, </em>288 Md. at 727, 421 A.2d at 965.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">These common law merger cases are inapposite to the instant case because the common law set no punishment at all for the \u201clesser\u201d offense, only a constitutional limitation of cruel or unusual punishment. The <em>only </em>maximum penalty in these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>common law merger cases was the penalty for the greater offense. The legislature could not have intended that the greater offense with a statutory maximum be punished <em>cumulatively </em>to an offense that had no maximum penalty. The most likely legislative intent was merger, not cumulative punishment, and the maximum penalty for the greater offense should control. Also, unless the statutory maximum of the \u201cgreater\u201d offense was intended to control over the unlimited common law penalty of the \u201clesser\u201d offense, there was no reason to enact the statute creating the \u201cgreater\u201d offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">The majority\u2019s merger analysis implies that the legislature intended to treat the age requirements of \u00a7 464C, <em>(i.e., </em>that the victim be 14 or 15 and the perpetrator more than 4 years older), as a mitigating factor requiring a reduction of the maximum penalty under \u00a7 554 to the maximum allowable under \u00a7 464C. The majority\u2019s conclusion that the additional element of \u00a7 464C made it the greater offense is based upon principles that the Maryland courts have derived from <em>Block-burger </em>in <em>Simms, </em>288 Md. at 726, 421 A.2d at 965; <em>Johnson v. State, </em>283 Md. at 203-04, 388 A.2d at 930; and <em>Slye, </em>42 Md.App. at 525-26, 401 A.2d at 199-200. After citing the <em>Blockburger </em>test as \u201cthe only feasible test for determining what is a \u2018greater\u2019 \u201d offense, the Court in <em>Simms </em>acknowledged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-6\">\u201cWhile usually the \u2018greater offense\u2019 under this test will represent the more heinous or aggravated crime, this is not always true. In some situations when the Legislature creates a greater offense by adding an element to a basic crime such as larceny or false pretenses, the additional element may have been viewed as a mitigating rather than an aggravating factor, and for this reason a lesser maximum penalty is provided for the particular greater offense. This is illustrated by the offenses involved in <em>Johnson v. State, supra, </em>283 Md. at 203-204[, 388 A.2d at 929-930], and <em>Slye v. State, supra.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-7\"><em>Simms, </em>288 Md. at 726, 421 A.2d at 965. It is simply not conceivable that the legislature intended the youthful age of the victim to be either a mitigating factor or a reason to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>reduce the punishment. After noting that legislative intent dictates whether a defendant can be punished twice when the conduct violates two statutes each of which proscribe the conduct, Chief Justice Warren aptly observed that \u201c[ojften the inquiry [into legislative intent] produces few if any enlightening results. Normally these are not problems that receive explicit legislative consideration. But this fact should not lead the judiciary, charged with the obligation of construing these statutes, to settle such questions by the easy application of stereotyped formulae.... All relevant criteria must be considered and the most useful aid will often be common sense.\u201d <em>Gore v. United States, </em>357 U.S. 386, 394, 78 S.Ct. 1280, 1285, 2 L.Ed.2d 1405, 1411 (1958) (Warren, C.J., dissenting). <em>See also Albernaz v. United States, </em>450 U.S. 333, 340-41, 101 S.Ct. 1137, 1143-4, 67 L.Ed.2d 275, 282-83 (1981) (noting that silence in the legislative history as to whether the legislature intended to authorize multiple punishment is not to be read as an ambiguity). Logically, the legislature sought to provide additional protection for adolescents and consequently intended the punishment under \u00a7 464C to be cumulative to the punishment existing under \u00a7 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">In <em>Newton, </em>this Court made an observation that is applicable to the instant case when it noted that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-6\">\u201cthe legislature may indicate an express intent to punish certain \u25a0 conduct more severely if <em>particular aggravating circumstances are present </em>by imposing punishment under two separate statutory offenses which otherwise would be deemed the same under the required evidence test.\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-7\"><em>Newton, </em>280 Md. at 274 n. 4, 373 A.2d at 269 n. 4.

Looking at the relatively insubstantial one-year maximum prescribed for violation of \u00a7 464C, it is clear that the legislature did not intend for that penalty to supersede a greater ten-year penalty based upon the same conduct. The General Assembly intentionally declined to repeal \u00a7 554 at the time it enacted \u00a7 464C. \u201cIt is presumed that the General Assembly acted with full knowledge of prior legislation and intended statutes that affect the same subject matter to blend into a consistent and harmonious body of law.\u201d <em>State v. Bricker, </em>321 Md. 86, 93, 581 A.2d 9, 12 (1990). I believe that both common sense and the \u201cexternal manifestations\u201d of the General Assembly indicate that the legislature intended for behavior that violated both \u00a7 554 and \u00a7 464C to be. separately and cumulatively punished. The legislature could not have intended that an unnatural or perverted sex practice carry a maximum of ten years\u2019 imprisonment if committed on adults, but only one year if committed on 14 or 15-year-olds. Likewise, the legislature could not have intended that a valid ten-year maximum sentence be reduced to a one-year maximum because the defendant is charged with and convicted of both offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The unsoundness of the majority\u2019s holding is also illustrated by its inference that, if the State believed that the one-year maximum prison sentence under \u00a7 464C was inadequate, it had a remedy \u2014 it could avoid merger by prosecuting only under \u00a7 554. According to the majority, the only way the State would have been able to secure the ten-year maximum sentence for Lancaster\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 554 for unnatural or perverted sex practices would have been to not also prosecute and convict Lancaster for the \u00a7 464C fourth degree sex offense. Thus, in order to avoid a merger, the State would have to forego its right to prosecute under \u00a7 464C, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>thereby forego having Lancaster\u2019s criminal conviction record reflect that his crime was perpetuated on a 14 or 15-year-old child.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">The majority\u2019s decision in the instant case is that, when a defendant is prosecuted for and convicted of all the statutory crimes he or she committed, an unnatural or perverted sex practice by an adult on an adult carries up to ten years\u2019 imprisonment, but if committed by an adult on a 14 or 15-year-old child, there is merger of offenses and the maximum punishment for the act will be reduced to one year. Construing the statutes as the majority does could conceivably encourage the sexual exploitation of 14 or 15-year-old children. The majority\u2019s decision is at best illogical, but it is inexcusable to blame the legislature and suggest that such a result is what the legislature intended when they enacted \u00a7 554 and \u00a7 464C.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b556-7\">.

It is possible that fellatio, <em>i.e., </em>oral genital contact not involving taking into one\u2019s mouth the sexual organ of another, could be an unnatural or perverted sex practice under \u00a7 554\u2019s catch-all phrase covering \"any other unnatural or perverted sex practice.\u201d There is at least some <em>dicta </em>to that effect in a few cases. <em>See Schochet v. State, </em>320 Md. 714, 718, 732, 580 A.2d 176, 178, 185 (1990) (referring to the defendant being charged with \"fellatio, in violation of Art. 27, \u00a7 554,\u201d and referring to the fact that \"cases in this Court have upheld convictions under \u00a7 554 based on engaging or attempting to engage in fellatio\u201d); <em>Neville v. State, </em>290 Md. 364, 377, 380-81, 430 A.2d 570, 576-77, 578 (1981) (equating the \u00a7 554 charge there involved with \"fellatio\u201d and \"oral sodomy\u201d). If, however, fellatio is simply one of the generic \u201cother unnatural or perverted sex practice[s]\u201d prohibited by \u00a7 554, then this offense differs from, and contains elements not included in, the prohibited \"sexual act[s]\u201d of the fourth degree sex offense statute, \u00a7 464C. A statute punishing fellatio is obviously not the same offense as a statute punishing <em>any </em>unnatural or perverted sex practice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b569-7\">.
