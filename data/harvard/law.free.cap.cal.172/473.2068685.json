On September 13, 1915, the said Oscar Shield filed his application before the Industrial Accident Commission for an adjustment of his claim, to which the petitioner filed an answer setting up the defense that the proceeding was barred by the statute of limitations contained in section 16 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation, Safety, and Insurance Act. (Stats. 1913, p. 279; Stats. 1915, pp. 1079, 1302.) The commission made an award in favor of said employee, commanding the petitioner to pay him certain compensation.
