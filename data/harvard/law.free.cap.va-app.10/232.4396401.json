The commission held that it did, and as a consequence ruled that when the claimant filed a second \u201cApplication for Hearing,\u201d the claim was barred by the two year limitation of Code \u00a7 65.1-87. We reverse the commission\u2019s finding because the facts do not show that the claimant withdrew his claim or that the commission dismissed it. Accordingly, we reverse the commission\u2019s holding that it lacked jurisdiction and remand the claim for further hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">Code \u00a7 65.1-87 provides that the right to compensation under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is forever barred \u201cunless <em>a claim </em>be filed\u201d with the Industrial Commission within two years after the injury by accident. Neither the Act nor the commission\u2019s rules specify a particular method or form for filing a claim. In keeping with the policy that formal pleadings are not required in matters before the commission, the filing of various documents with the commission has been held sufficient to constitute the filing of a \u201cclaim.\u201d The \u201cApplication for Hearing\u201d form which the commission adopted in order to set in motion the adjudicatory process before the commission under Code \u00a7 65.1-94 is sufficient, and is frequently used, to file a claim, but the filing of less formal documents, such as letters sent to the commission from claimants or their attorneys, or informal notices styled as \u201cclaims,\u201d or even letters from the employer\u2019s attorney, have been held sufficient to meet the requirement for filing a claim. <em>See, e.g., Chalkley v. Nolde Bros., </em>186 Va. 900, 911, 45 S.E.2d 297, 301 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">On February 27, 1987, the claimant, by counsel, filed his claim with the Industrial Commission, not on an \u201cApplication for Hearing\u201d form provided by the commission, but by a letter from coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>sel and a form prepared by counsel styled, \u201cClaim and Agreement to Retain Counsel.\u201d The claim form filed by counsel alleged that the claimant sustained an accidental injury on May 26, 1986, \u201cfor which workers\u2019 compensation may be due.\u201d The form identified the claimant, the employer and its address, and the date and nature of the injury, and this information sufficed to satisfy the filing requirements. <em>See id. </em>The employer previously had filed a first report of accident on September 15, 1986. On December 7, 1987, the claimant filed an \u201cApplication for Hearing\u201d on the pre-printed form provided by the commission, requesting that the claim be scheduled for a hearing. The commission set the case on its hearing docket for March 16, 1988. The claimant thereafter withdrew the \u201cApplication for Hearing,\u201d presumably because he had no medical evidence which related the injury to an incident at work. The commission entered an order on March 28, 1988, which provided that the hearing would \u201cnot take place\u201d because the applicant had \u201cwithdrawn the application.\u201d The order further stated, \u201cThe hearing is therefore cancelled and this case is ORDERED from the hearing docket.\u201d The order made no reference to the claim being withdrawn or dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">On August 31, 1988, claimant\u2019s counsel filed a second \u201cApplication for Hearing,\u201d designating on the commission\u2019s printed form, \u201cChange in Condition (To Reopen Case).\u201d The commission ruled that, because no award previously had been entered, the application could not be for a hearing to consider a change in condition; the commission treated the application as the filing of a claim. The commission thereupon ruled that the earlier request to withdraw the \u201cApplication for Hearing\u201d constituted a withdrawal of the claim, and that the effort to refile the claim more than two years after the alleged accidental injury of May 26, 1986, was barred by the two year limitation of Code \u00a7 65.1-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The commission stated that it has \u201cconsistently held that the withdrawal of an application at the request of the claimant has the same effect as if though an application had not been filed,\u201d citing its opinions in <em>Brown v. Eastern Isles Manufacturing Corporation, 52 </em>O.I.C. 44 (1970), and <em>Kenney </em>v. <em>Pancake Kitchens, Inc., </em>48 O.I.C. 147 (1966). The commission further held that its order of March 28, 1988, \u201cstated that <em>the claim </em>had been withdrawn and the case was ordered from the docket.\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>The commission\u2019s order entered following claimant\u2019s withdrawal of the \u201cApplication for Hearing\u201d stated that \u201cthe scheduled hearing should not take place\u201d because \u201c[t]he applicant has <em>withdrawn the </em>applicationThe order also provided that \u201c[t]he hearing is therefore cancelled and this case is ORDERED from the <em>hearing </em>docket.\u201d (emphasis added). Contrary to the finding of the commission, the order did not find that the applicant had withdrawn \u201cthe claim,\u201d but rather stated that the claimant had \u201cwithdrawn the application\u201d for hearing. Likewise, the order did not order the case removed from the commission\u2019s docket, but rather \u201ccancelled\u201d the hearing and ordered the case from the \u201chearing docket.\u201d Nothing in the record establishes that the claimant withdrew or intended to withdraw his claim, or that the commission ordered that the claim be dismissed. Instead, the record establishes that the claimant merely withdrew his \u201cApplication for Hearing,\u201d which in this instance was not the vehicle by which his claim was filed. The commission did no more than cancel the hearing and remove the case from its hearing docket. If the commission is unwilling to grant claimants continuances of hearings upon request or only upon showing good cause, it is not required to allow the claimants to withdraw an \u201cApplication for Hearing.\u201d However, the commission cannot hold that a claimant has withdrawn a \u201cclaim\u201d absent a clear showing that the claim has been withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">The commission misapplied its established principle \u201cthat the withdrawal of an application at the request of the claimant has the same effect as if though an application had not been filed.\u201d Keenan\u2019s \u201cclaim\u201d was filed when counsel filed the \u201cClaim and Agreement to Retain Counsel\u201d form with the commission. When the \u201cApplication for Hearing\u201d was withdrawn, it was as if the \u201cApplication for Hearing\u201d had not been filed; the \u201cclaim,\u201d however, was still pending and had not been withdrawn or dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The Supreme Court\u2019s denial of a writ of error in <em>Kenney </em>and the commission\u2019s opinion in <em>Brown </em>provide no support for its holding. In both cases the \u201cApplication for Hearing\u201d served as the vehicle for filing the claim. Withdrawal of the application in <em>Brown </em>and the dismissal of the application in <em>Kenney </em>for failure of the claimant to appear and prosecute his claim effectively withdrew or dismissed the claims in those cases. Therefore, before these \u201cclaims\u201d could be considered, the \u201cclaims\u201d had to be refiled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>within the statutory time limitation; otherwise, the commission was barred from hearing the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">We hold that withdrawal of an \u201cApplication for Hearing,\u201d where the \u201cApplication\u201d did not serve to file the \u201cclaim,\u201d does not constitute withdrawal of the claim. Thus, in the absence of an order from the commission dismissing the claim for failure to prosecute, the commission has jurisdiction to hear the pending claim. Accordingly, we hold that the commission has jurisdiction to hear the claim and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Baker, J., and Duff, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
