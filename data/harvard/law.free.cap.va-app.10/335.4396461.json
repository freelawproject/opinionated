On appeal, he raises the following questions: (1) whether the trial court erred in allowing a police officer to testify that after he gave the appellant his Miranda warnings, the appellant said he did not have anything to say and further stated \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about;\u201d and (2) whether the trial court abused its discretion by failing to replace a juror who allegedly had fallen asleep. Upon review, we find no error and affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">Following a sidebar conference at trial, during which Mayo\u2019s objection to Officer Pierce\u2019s anticipated testimony was overruled,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the officer testified that after he read him his rights, Mayo signed a card acknowledging that he understood them. Officer Pierce testified that after he told Mayo why he was there and read him his rights, Mayo said that he did not have anything to say and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d Relying on <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610 (1976), and <em>Schrum </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 204, 246 S.E.2d 893 (1978), Mayo argues that the trial court improperly permitted his silence to be used against him when it admitted this statement. We disagree. Mayo\u2019s statement was not an invocation of his right to remain silent. It was a denial and an assertion of his inability to respond. <em>See Taylor </em>v. <em>Riddle, </em>563 F.2d 133, 137 (4th Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1020 (1978) (Defendant\u2019s response that \u201c[Yjou\u2019ve done asked me a question I can\u2019t answer\u201d was held to be an expression of his inability to respond rather than an exercise of his right to remain silent.) Mayo, having broken silence after being advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, his statement was admissible. <em>See Anderson </em>v. <em>Charles, </em>447 U.S. 404 (1980); <em>Squire </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>633, 283 S.E.2d 201 (1981). Furthermore, even if Mayo invoked his right to remain silent by stating that he had nothing to say, his second statement was voluntary and was not in response to interrogation. <em>See Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Mayo also contends that the trial court\u2019s failure to remove a juror who allegedly was sleeping and to replace him with an alternate juror constituted an abuse of discretion and violated his right to a fair and competent jury. At the conclusion of the evidence, defense counsel requested the court to discharge for cause a juror who allegedly was sleeping. The record reveals that during the Commonwealth\u2019s direct examination of its forensic serologist, the trial court <em>sua sponte </em>admonished the jury as follows: \u201cBe sure everybody has got their eyes open. If you don\u2019t have your eyes open, I don\u2019t know whether you\u2019re listening or not. So please be sure you have your eyes open.\u201d Later, the prosecutor made a joking remark about a man on the jury, who Mayo asserts was the sleeping juror. Mayo did not request that the juror be removed at the time when he allegedly was sleeping. Thus, his objection was not timely. Furthermore, we cannot conclude from the record that the juror was, in fact, asleep or that the court abused its discretion in failing to remove him. The record reflects that the court did not agree with defense counsel\u2019s observations that the juror appeared to be asleep during most of the trial. Defense counsel conceded at oral argument that just because a juror\u2019s eyes were closed did not mean that the juror was inattentive.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the ruling of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">Baker, J., and Barrow, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b368-10\"> Later, the trial court allowed defense counsel to state his objection for the record. Defense counsel objected to the admission of Mayo\u2019s short statement because it was \u201cmerely an assertion by him of his rights not to speak at all.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
