Fain testified that the shooting was accidental. On cross-examination he was asked why he had not given that explanation to the police officers and other witnesses when the case was being investigated. He moved for a mistrial, contending that this violated his constitutional right against self-incrimination. He appeals the denial of that motion. Upon review, we find no error and affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-12\">On November 3, 1987, an argument developed between Fain and the victim, Buddy Montgomery. Steve Cox, who was present, heard a shot. Turning around, Cox saw Fain shoot Montgomery in the back. As Montgomery fell and moaned, Fain told him to shut up or he would kill him. Fain then pointed the pistol at Cox, who was frightened and ran from the house to get help.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-13\">Arlen Montgomery, the victim\u2019s uncle, arrived at the scene before the police. He inquired about Buddy, and Fain told him, \u201cI shot him twice. I don\u2019t know.\u201d Deputy Sheriffs Akers, Alderman, and Normandin arrived. Deputy Alderman took Fain off the porch to the edge of the road. Fain asked Alderman to look at the left side of his face. Alderman saw a small scratch. He testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>that \u201cMr. Fain made the statement that a person had the right to protect theirself and, uh, he had to do what he had to do.\u201d Deputy Akers walked up to where Fain and Deputy Alderman were standing. Deputy Alderman asked him to shine his flashlight on Fain\u2019s forehead. Deputy Akers testified that Fain \u201chad a small place in his eyebrow just above it.\u201d Deputy Akers commented, \u201cLooks like a small scratch.\u201d Fain responded, \u201cThat was enough, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Deputy Akers walked to the front door of the house, saw someone lying on the floor inside, and went back to where Fain was standing. Fain asked him how Buddy was doing. Deputy Akers replied that he didn\u2019t think that he was hurt too bad, that he looked all right. Fain then told Akers that he didn\u2019t think that he had hurt him too bad, but he had to do what he had to do. Akers testified further that Fain \u201cmade a statement there that he\u2019d asked Buddy to leave several times, and he said he wouldn\u2019t leave, so, you know, he\u2019d done what he had to do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Deputy Alderman then asked the defendant to have a seat in his police car, told him that he was not under arrest, and advised him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Fain said that he would rather riot make any statements or write anything until he talked to an attorney and saw how Buddy Montgomery was. However, while seated in Alderman\u2019s car, in Deputy Normandin\u2019s presence, Fain said to his mother, \u201cI had to shoot a man, mama. It was just Buddy Montgomery. He\u2019s had it coming.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Deputy Kinzer described the following conversation between Fain and Arlene Chapman which occurred in his presence at the Sheriffs department later that evening:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-8\">Ronnie said, \u201cMan has a right to protect himself. Are you mad at me?\u201d And he was talking to Miss Chapman. And she said, \u201cNo. You done what you had to do.\u201d And Ronnie said, \u201cIf a man can\u2019t protect\u201d- And I didn\u2019t catch what he said. - \u201cit\u2019s bad.\u201d And Miss Chapman said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. He had it coming.\u201d And Ronnie, again: \u201cI guess all of them down there are mad at me.\u201d Miss Chapman: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry about them. They know how Buddy was. He was all time causing trouble.\u201d Ronnie, again: \u201cI kept telling him to leave.\u201d Miss Chapman: \u201cI know.\u201d Then, Ronnie: \u201cWhat the hell was Wimpy doing down there?\u201d Miss Chapman: \u201cI <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>don\u2019t know. He was there before the police.\u201d And I spoke up about that time, and I was asking Ronnie, I said, \u201cDid you say he was there before any police?\u201d Ronnie: \u201cHell, yeah. He knocked on the door. Said he was the police. I told my girlfriend not to open the door until the police got there.\u201d And I asked him, again, I said, \u201cYou say he knocked on the door and said he was the police?\u201d Miss Chapman spoke up and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right. How did he get there before you all?\u201d I answered her, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d And then Ronnie, again: \u201cYou must - He must have a scanner. He didn\u2019t have no business there.\u201d Miss Chapman: \u201cI know.\u201d Ronnie, again: \u201cWell, he had it coming for a long time.\u201d Miss Chapman: \u201cThat\u2019s right. He came in our house one time we didn\u2019t know he was there.\u201d Ronnie: \u201cI still say I had a right to protect myself. Do you know his condition?\u201d I answered him, \u201cNo more than a while ago. He\u2019s taking a lot of blood.\u201d And Ronnie, again: \u201cAh, it\u2019ll be O. K. Don\u2019t you think a man has a right to protect his home?\u201d And I answered, \u201cWell, maybe, in some cases.\u201d Ronnie, again: \u201cYou would do the same as I did.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Deputy Kinzer testified that after Miss Chapman left, Steve Cox came into the room. He testified as to the following conversation in his presence between the defendant and Cox:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">And Mr. Cox came in, his statement: \u201cRonnie, I\u2019m sorry but I had to tell what I seen.\u201d Ronnie: \u201cThat\u2019s O. K.\u201d Mr. Cox: \u201cI like both of you.\u201d Ronnie: \u201cHey, we\u2019re still friends.\u201d Mr. Cox: \u201cI love you as a brother, but I had to tell the truth.\u201d Ronnie: \u201cNo problem. I know you had to tell it like it was. All you can do is tell the truth.\u201d Mr. Cox: \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Ronnie: \u201cHow is he doing?\u201d Mr. Cox: \u201cThey tell me he might not make it.\u201d And then Ronnie: \u201cI hope\u201d - And then I didn\u2019t catch what he said there. - Uh, Mr. Cox, again: \u201cI sure hope he does. I\u2019m going to the hospital to check on him.\u201d Ronnie: \u201cI don\u2019t think I would go. All of the Montgomery\u2019s [sic] will be there. They are probably all mad.\u201d Mr. Cox: \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d Ronnie: \u201cMaybe not at you, but me. Tell them I\u2019m sorry, but I had to protect what is mine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>All of the foregoing conversations and statements were received in evidence without objection. Fain makes no contention that they were elicited in violation of his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">At trial, Fain testified that he and Montgomery engaged in a struggle, during which Montgomery knocked him into the refrigerator. He said that he then got his pistol, pointed it at Montgomery and ordered him to leave. He said that Montgomery grabbed the pistol, and that as they struggled the pistol fired. He did not at that time think that Montgomery had been hit. They continued to fight, and Montgomery knocked him backwards, causing him to fall over a chair. At that time the pistol fired again. He denied that he intended to shoot Montgomery, but said that both times the pistol discharged accidentally. On cross-examination he was referred to his statements at the scene, and the following dialogue ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-6\">Q. And at that time, did Deputy Akers indicate in so many words to you \u2014 \u201cWell, looks like a small scratch.\u201d - pointing up over to the left side of your eye?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-7\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-8\">Q. And, uh, did he also \u25a0\u2014 Did you say at that time, as he\u2019s testified, \u201cThat\u2019s enough, ain\u2019t it?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-9\">A. I don\u2019t remember exactly what I did say, but, uh, I think I was gonna say something else. And the officer was around there, and he \u2014\u2022 When Arlen Montgomery came up and said there was more Montgomery\u2019s [sic] on the way, the deputy told me to go get in the car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-10\">Q. Do you deny saying, \u201cThat\u2019s enough, ain\u2019t it?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-11\">A. I don\u2019t deny it, but I don\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-12\">Q. Now, Deputy Akers indicated that he then, I think, checked in the house to see how things were, and came back and had further conversation with you at which time, uh, you asked how he was doing \u2014 how Buddy was doing. Do you remember that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-13\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>Q. You remember having that conversation with Deputy Akers inquiring about Buddy\u2019s condition?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-5\">A. I didn\u2019t really know it was Akers there, but I remember asking an officer how Buddy was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-6\">Q. O. K. Well, an officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-7\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-8\">Q. And Deputy Akers has testified that he said, and of course, it turned out that he was very wrong, that he didn\u2019t think Buddy was hurt too bad.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-9\">A. That\u2019s what he told me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-10\">Q. Right. And then, uh, he\u2019s testified that you went on to say, \u201cHe\u2019ll be all right. I didn\u2019t hurt him too bad. But I told him to leave and he wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-11\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-12\">Q. Is that what you said to him then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-13\">A. I don\u2019t quite remember the exact words but they were similar to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-14\">Q. Uh-huh. You didn\u2019t tell Deputy Akers that there, uh, that \u2014 that Buddy was whipping you, or that there had been a struggle for the gun and it had accidentally gone off. You didn\u2019t do \u2014 You just said he, uh, he wouldn\u2019t leave.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-15\">A. I told one officer out there that he had struck me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-16\">Q. Right. Right. But you didn\u2019t tell anybody about any struggle or anything like that, did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-17\">A. It just happened so fast, and, uh, everybody was around there, and they just told me to get to the car, and I didn\u2019t \u2014 I didn\u2019t get to talk to too many people and tell them anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-18\">Q. Yeah. And you never indicated to anybody that the gun went off accidentally, did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-19\">A. I didn\u2019t make any statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Q. I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m not talking about statements. I\u2019m talking about there when you were talking to these officers. You talked to Deputy Akers. You talked to Deputy Alderman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-5\">A. I was more concerned with Buddy Montgomery\u2019s condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-6\">Q. I understand that. My question is, during the course of these things that you said, you never indicated at any time that there was a, uh, uh, uh, an accidental shooting, did you?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Counsel for the defendant then moved for a mistrial, arguing that the foregoing questions asserted against the defendant his invocation of his right to remain silent and violated his constitutional right against self-incrimination. The court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">Fain relies on <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610 (1976), and on <em>Durant v. Commonwealth, 1 </em>Va. App. 454, 375 S.E.2d 396 (1988). In <em>Doyle, </em>the defendant, upon being arrested and advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, made no statement. In his testimony at trial, he offered an exculpatory explanation. On cross-examination, the prosecutor impeached the defendant by asking why he had failed to give this account to the police upon his arrest. The Supreme Court held that the use for impeachment purposes of the defendant\u2019s exercise of his right to remain silent after receiving the <em>Miranda </em>warning violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 426 U.S. at 619. The Court noted that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings assure an accused, at least implicitly, that his decision to remain silent cannot be used against him. <em>Id. </em>at 618. The Court quoted from Justice White\u2019s concurrence in <em>United States v. Hale, </em>422 U.S. 171, 182-83 (1975),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-9\">[I]t does not comport with due process to permit the prosecution during the trial to call attention to his silence at the time of arrest and to insist that because he did not speak about the facts of the case at that time, as he was told he need not do, an unfavorable inference might be drawn as to the truth of his trial testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">426 U.S. at 619.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>In <em>Durant, </em>the defendant was charged with aggravated sexual battery committed upon the person of her daughter. Upon her arrest, she was advised of her <em>Miranda </em>rights and chose to remain silent. At trial she testified that she had committed the acts under coercion by her husband. When asked why she never told anyone about these incidents, she replied that she did not have a telephone at home and that her husband was always with her. When asked by the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney why she did not tell the whole story to the police, she replied, \u201cBecause I told them that I wanted to talk to my lawyer first and that is what I did.\u201d The Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney then commented, \u201c[S]o instead of coming forth and spewing forth the whole story, you made the statement that you wanted to talk to somebody else?\u201d The defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial was denied. We reversed the conviction, holding,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\">Since Durant did not waive her right to remain silent and the Commonwealth referred to her post-arrest, <em>post-Miranda </em>warnings silence both during cross-examination of Durant and in closing argument, <em>Doyle </em>is dispositive and mandates reversal of the defendant\u2019s conviction. While the use of Durant\u2019s pre-arrest silence is proper for impeachment of her duress defense. . . use of Durant\u2019s post-arrest, <em>post-Miranda </em>silence is a violation of both her right to remain silent and a denial of fundamental fairness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 460, 375 S.E.2d at 399 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">In <em>Schrum v. </em>Commonwealth, 219 Va. 204, 246 S.E.2d 893 (1978), the defendant, accompanied by his attorney, surrendered himself at the police station. At trial, the investigating officer testified that Schrum, upon advice of his attorney, had made no statement. The Supreme Court of Virginia held that this employed against Schrum his invocation of his right against self-incrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 211, 246 S.E.2d at 898. The factual situations in <em>Doyle, Durant </em>and <em>Schrum </em>are distinguishable from the present case. In each of those cases the defendant chose to remain silent after receiving either the <em>Miranda </em>warning or advice from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>his attorney. However, both before<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and after he received the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, Fain spoke freely and voluntarily to the investigating officers and to his friends in the presence of the police officers. He discussed and explained what happened and he undertook to give his side of the story. These accounts, which were consistent with each other, were inconsistent with his trial testimony that the gun discharged accidentally. By directing Fain\u2019s attention to these prior statements, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney did not use against him his <em>post-Miranda </em>warning silence, but rather sought to impeach him through the use of his prior inconsistent statements. This was proper cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">In <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Charles, </em>447 U.S. 404 (1980), the defendant testified that he had stolen a car from a particular location. He was asked on cross-examination whether he had not admitted to an investigating officer that he had stolen the car from a different particular location. Approving this line of cross-examination as not violative of <em>Doyle, </em>the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\"><em>Doyle </em>bars the use against a criminal defendant of silence maintained after receipt of governmental assurances. But <em>Doyle </em>does not apply to cross-examination that merely inquires into prior inconsistent statements. Such questioning makes no unfair use of silence because a defendant who voluntarily speaks after receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings has not been induced to remain silent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\"><em>Charles </em>was applied in <em>Squire </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 633, 283 S.E.2d 201 (1981). In that case, the defendant, arrested on charges of sodomy, robbery and attempted rape, was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Acknowledging that he understood these, he consented to an interview. The officer testified that during the interview the defendant said that he would like to see the person who had accused him. The victim was brought in and identified the defendant. The officer testified, \u201cAnd that was it.\u201d At trial, the defendant presented an alibi, saying that he was with two other men at the time of the crime. On cross-examination, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney asked Squire why he did not tell the police about those two men. Squire contended that this cross-examination violated his right against self-incrimination because he was entitled to refrain from giving information to the police. Rejecting this argument, the Supreme Court of Virginia said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-5\">In the present case, Squire did not remain silent after receiving his <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Harding testified that he interviewed Squire, and Squire conceded that he answered Harding\u2019s questions although he could not remember what questions were asked. During the interview, Squire asked to be confronted by his accuser, an action inconsistent with an intention to maintain silence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-6\">Squire could have exercised his constitutional right to remain silent in accordance with the <em>Miranda </em>warning that he acknowledged having received. If he had done so, he could not properly have been cross-examined at trial about his failure to mention his alibi to the investigating officer. Once he broke his silence, however, to answer questions under pretrial police interrogation and to request to see his accuser, he did not have the right thereafter to remain silent selectively and then prevent the prosecution from cross-examining him about his failure to reveal the exculpatory facts to which he testified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 638, 283 S.E.2d at 204-05.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">Both before and after receiving his <em>Miranda </em>warning Fain freely and voluntarily gave to investigating officers and to friends in the presence of investigating officers what purported to be a comprehensive account of the shooting. The inconsistencies between those accounts and his exculpatory trial testimony were a proper subject for cross-examination. The motion for a mistrial was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">Koontz, C.J., and Moon, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b490-9\"> <em>See Fletcher v. </em>Weir, 455 U.S. 603 (1982) (per curiam) (in the absence of the sort of affirmative assurances embodied in the <em>Miranda </em>warning, a state may permit cross-examination about post-arrest silence).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
