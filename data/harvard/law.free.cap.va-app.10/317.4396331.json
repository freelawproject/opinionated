Russnak appeals from an order which, although not revoking the suspended sentence, required restitution and imposed supervised probation, neither of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>which condition was imposed in the sentencing order. Russnak contends: (1) that there was no proof of a violation sufficient to sustain an adverse ruling; and (2) that the ordering of restitution and probation was tantamount to imposition of a new sentence. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the judgment on the show cause order.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">In October 1986, Carl Russnak pled guilty to grand larceny in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-95, and he requested a presentence report. At the December 1986 sentencing hearing, defense counsel told the trial judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-6\">I should also point out, in addition, Your Honor, that with reference to the amount of money taken from Shoney\u2019s, both the attorney for Shoney\u2019s, and Shoney\u2019s and Mr. Russnak and myself have been working together diligently towards the restitution with the restoration of the motorcycle that was . . . purchase[d] . . . with the funds. . . . [Tjhat motorcycle has now been transferred in terms of ownership over to Shoney\u2019s and we are working towards the aspect of Shoney\u2019s either keeping the bike themselves and coming to some agreed-upon sum or having that bike sold at some period of time and applying that towards restitution. So the spirit of cooperation between him and his former employer is still there as well as having applied to that his paychecks that he still has coming to him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">The trial judge sentenced Russnak to twenty years imprisonment with fifteen years suspended, on the condition that he \u201ckeep the peace, be of good behavior, violate no law of the Commonwealth or any other jurisdiction and that the Commonwealth recover against the defendant its costs by it about its prosecution in this behalf expended.\u201d The sentencing order contained no mention of restitution or probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Russnak was paroled from the penal system in March 1988. Five months later, the trial judge issued a show cause order based upon the Commonwealth\u2019s allegation that Russnak \u201chas made no restitution to [the restaurant] nor restitution to the Commonwealth for the costs involved in his extradition.\u201d At the show cause hearing, a probation and parole officer testified that Russnak was assigned to her in March 1988 upon his parole. She further testified that Russnak had been employed since May following his release and that he had not made restitution. On cross-examination, the parole officer stated that following Russnak\u2019s release on parole the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\">I went over the court order with [Russnak] and indicated to him that the court order did not indicate that he had to pay restitution nor that he was on probation for the offense, therefore, I could not require that he make restitution or that he be supervised on probation. He\u2019s only on parole supervision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Relying on Code \u00a7 19.2-305.1(A), the trial judge ruled that restitution was inherently part of the suspended sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>dered Russnak to pay $2,188.01 restitution to the restaurant and to pay the Commonwealth its costs in extraditing Russnak from Texas for the 1986 trial. In addition, he ordered that Russnak be placed on supervised probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">It is beyond question that \u201c[a] court which has ordered a suspension of sentence undoubtedly has the power to revoke it when the defendant has failed to comply with the conditions of the suspension.\u201d <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>205 Va. 349, 354, 136 S.E.2d 840, 844 (1964). The Commonwealth asserts this principle and argues that \u201c[i]n light of \u00a7 19.2-305.1(A) some form of restitution was implicit in the [sentencing] order since a suspended sentence was imposed.\u201d We disagree with that interpretation of the sentencing order. We conclude, instead, that the trial judge lacked authority to modify the sentencing order.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Code \u00a7 19.2-305.1 contains the statutory scheme for ordering the payment of restitution by persons \u201cconvicted of a crime in violation of any provision in Title 18.2.\u201d When a trial judge determines that restitution has not been-paid, the statute requires that the trial judge, \u201c[a]t the time of sentencing, . . . shall determine the amount to be repaid . . . and the terms and conditions thereof.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-305.1(C). The statute further states that the trial judge \u201cshall include such findings in the judgment order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The judgment order in this case, however, does not include any such findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">We acknowledge that the legislature intended that probation or a suspended sentence would only be permitted if the defendant \u201cshall make at least partial restitution for [the] property damage or loss, or shall be compelled to perform community services, or both, or shall submit a plan for doing that which appears to the court to be feasible under the circumstances.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-305.1(A). However, the same statute that requires restitution also requires the trial judge to make such findings in the sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>order. Code \u00a7 19.2-305.1(C). We believe it is patent that the legislature intended that the restitution requirement be expressly ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Code \u00a7 19.2-305.1(A) allows a range of possible means of satisfying the restitution requirement: \u201cat least partial restitution,\u201d or \u201ccommunity service,\u201d or some combination of restitution and community service, or \u201ca plan for doing that which appears . . . to be feasible under the circumstances.\u201d Because of this range of possibilities, the findings by the trial judge are an essential element of the statute. In the absence of such findings, neither the victim nor the defendant can be certain of what is expected. Such uncertainty defeats the legislative purpose of requiring the defendant to conform his conduct to a standard designed to compensate for the loss that the defendant caused.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Our interpretation of the restitution statute is not inconsistent with <em>Marshall </em>v. Commonwealth, 202 Va. 217, 116 S.E.2d 270 (1960). In <em>Marshall, </em>an order granting a suspended sentence under a former statute did not include a condition of good behavior.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">Since the original statute, Acts 1918, ch. 349, p. 528, we have recognized that the power thus given is to be exercised on condition that the defendant be of good behavior and we said so in <em>Slayton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra, </em>185 Va. at 365, 38 S.E.2d at 483; and in <em>Dyke </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>193 Va. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>478, 484, and at 490 (dissenting opinion), 69 S.E.2d 483, \u2022 486, 490. While the precise point has not previously been in issue, we now hold, in view of the purpose and history of the statute and the liberal construction to be given it, that the proper construction is that the phrase \u201cduring good behavior\u201d qualifies the power to suspend, as well as the power to place \u201con probation under the supervision of a probation officer,\u201d and that good behavior is a condition of every suspension, with or without probation, whether expressly so stated or not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 220, 116 S.E.2d at 273. The Supreme Court also grounded its decision in that case on an alternative basis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-7\">It seems entirely clear that the failure of a defendant to be of good behavior, amounting to substantial misconduct, during the period of suspension would provide reasonable cause for revocation of the suspension whether or not good behavior was expressly stated to be a condition of the suspension. It follows that in either aspect of the matter, whether good behavior was a condition of the suspension ... or bad behavior a sufficient cause for revoking the suspension . . . the question here is simply whether there has been an abuse of discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 220-21, 116 S.E.2d at 273-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">In either event, it is important to note that <em>Marshall </em>was interpreting Code \u00a7 53-272, which contained no requirement that the trial court commit its determinations to writing. Unlike former Code \u00a7 53-272, its successor, Code \u00a7 19.2-303, requires that the terms and conditions of th\u00e9 restitution requirements \u201cshall be entered in writing by the court.\u201d Likewise, Code \u00a7 19.2-305.1, which specifically addresses persons causing property loss as a result of a \u201cviolation of any provision in Title 18.2,\u201d requires that determinations concerning \u201cthe amount to be repaid . . . and the terms and conditions\u201d of the repayment \u201cshall\u201d be included by the trial judge as \u201cfindings in the judgment order.\u201d Because the statute requires the trial judge to include the terms of restitution in the sentencing order, we conclude that no \u201cimplicit\u201d requirement of \u201csome form of restitution,\u201d as suggested by the Commonwealth, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>arises from an order that is otherwise silent as to that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The facts of this case demonstrate why an order fixing the terms and conditions of restitution must be contained in a sentencing order. The record reflects that at the 1986 sentencing hearing, the trial judge was made aware of efforts by Russnak\u2019s counsel to resolve the restitution question with the restaurant. Russnak had executed and assigned the title to a motorcycle to the restaurant. Russnak\u2019s counsel delivered the certificate of title to the restaurant\u2019s legal counsel prior to the sentencing hearing and Russnak\u2019s counsel informed the trial judge, prior to sentencing, that this had been done.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">We are unable to glean from the record whether the trial judge at the time the sentencing order was entered concluded that satisfactory restitution had been tendered, thus obviating the need to require further payments, whether the trial judge determined to leave further restitution to Russnak and the restaurant, or whether the trial judge simply forgot to include the findings in the order. However, we believe it is significant that the trial judge\u2019s 1988 order required Russnak to make restitution only in an amount that reflects a credit for the value of the motorcycle. Moreover, the trial judge acknowledged in 1988 that Russnak had made partial restitution when he delivered to the restaurant the certificate of title to the motorcycle. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-305.1(B) (\u201cpartial restitution\u201d may suffice to satisfy the restitution requirement).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">Russnak had not violated the sentencing order. Under these circumstances, the trial judge had no authority to impose probation by an order entered after Russnak had been released on parole from the Department of Corrections. Rule 1:1 allows the trial judge to modify sentences only when done within twenty-one days following entry of the sentencing order. An exception to that Rule is found in Code \u00a7 19.2-303, which allows the trial judge, \u201cat any time before [a sentenced felon] is transferred to the Department [of Corrections], [to] suspend or otherwise modify the unserved portion of a sentence.\u201d <em>See also In re Department of </em>Corrections, 222 Va. 454, 463, 281 S.E.2d 857, 862 (1981). Only under the circumstances recited in Code \u00a7 19.2-303 may the trial judge more than twenty-one days following entry of the sentencing order, \u201cplace the person on probation\u201d for the first time. Code \u00a7 19.2-303.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>Although the original sentencing order suspended part of Russnak\u2019s sentence without any provision for probation, under Code \u00a7 19.2-303 that is a permissible disposition. It has been long established that a \u201c[sjentence may be suspended without putting the defendant on probation.\u201d <em>Dyke </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>193 Va. 478, 482, 69 S.E.2d 483, 486 (1952). The Commonwealth points to no statutory or decisional authority, and we can find none, which permits the trial judge to modify a sentencing order after a convicted felon has been released by the Department of Corrections on parole and impose for the first time a requirement of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Lastly, the 1988 show cause order requires Russnak to pay \u201cto the Commonwealth its costs in extraditing\u201d him for the 1986 trial. The 1986 sentencing order required Russnak to pay the Commonwealth \u201cits costs by it about its prosecution in this behalf suspended.\u201d The Commonwealth asserts that \u201cimplicit\u201d in the costs that the sentencing order imposed on Russnak \u201care the costs of extraditing the defendant from Texas.\u201d The only costs that are found in the record concerning the larceny prosecution, however, are the costs of $137.80 that were assessed in the general district court in 1986. Those costs apparently do not include expenses for extraditing Russnak from Texas. The record contains neither the amount of the extradition costs nor the basis upon which the Commonwealth asserts that the sentencing order encompasses extradition costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">The Commonwealth also asserts that <em>\u201crestitution </em>to the Commonwealth for the costs related to the defendant\u2019s extradition is clearly included in the sentencing order which specifies that the Commonwealth \u2018recover against the defendant its costs\u2019 expended for the purpose of prosecuting the defendant\u201d (emphasis added). The record does not reflect whether the costs ordered to be paid to the Commonwealth by the 1988 show cause order are deemed to be restitution or part of the costs as ordered in the sentencing order. Therefore, we must remand the issue concerning extradition costs to the circuit court for further proceedings. We note, however, that before any restitution may be ordered to be paid to the Commonwealth pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-305, the defendant must be on probation. <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 252, 253-54, 335 S.E.2d 276, 277 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>In summary, although not revoking Russnak\u2019s suspended sentence, the trial judge determined that Russnak was in violation of the sentencing order and imposed new conditions. We conclude that no violation of the suspended sentencing order occurred and that the trial judge lacked authority to impose those conditions on Russnak. Accordingly, we reverse and dismiss so much of the show cause order that (1) required Russnak to pay further restitution and (2) placed Russnak on probation. In addition, because the record does not reflect the basis for ordering Russnak to pay the costs of extradition and does not reflect the amount of the costs that was assessed in 1986, we remand this portion of the show cause order to the trial judge for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed in part, and remanded in part.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">. Coleman, J., and Duff, J. concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b351-8\"> The record also reflects that in November 1986, defense counsel wrote a letter to the attorney for the restaurant enclosing a \u201cCertificate of Origin For a Vehicle\u201d and a \u201cTemporary Certificate\u201d for a motorcycle that Russnak had purchased in Texas. Defense counsel requested the restaurant\u2019s counsel to \u201creview this information and determine if it will be sufficient to go forward with a sale of the motorcycle in Texas.\u201d Defense counsel also requested counsel or a representative of the restaurant to \u201cappear in Hanover County Circuit Court to advise the Court of our efforts.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b352-7\"> Code \u00a7 19.2-305.1 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-8\">A. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person convicted of a crime in violation of any provision in Title 18.2, except the provisions of Article 2 (\u00a7 18.2-266 <em>et seq.) </em>of Chapter 7 of Title 18.2, on or after July 1, 1977, which resulted in property damage or loss, shall be placed on probation or have his sentence suspended unless such person shall make at least partial restitution for such property damage or loss, or shall be compelled to perform community services, or both, or shall submit a plan for doing that which appears to the court to be feasible under the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-9\">B. At or before the time of sentencing, the court shall receive and consider any plan for making restitution submitted by the defendant. If the court finds such plan to be reasonable and practical under the circumstances, it may consider probation or suspension of whatever portion of the sentence that it deems appropriate. If the court suspends a portion of any sentence imposed, it may order that restitution shall commence upon the release of such person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-10\">C. At the time of sentencing, the court, in its discretion, shall determine the amount to be repaid by the defendant and the terms and conditions thereof. If community service work is ordered, the court shall determine the terms and conditions upon which such work shall be performed. The court shall include such findings in the judgment order. The order may specify that sums paid under such order shall be paid to the clerk, who shall disburse such sums as the court may, by order, direct. Any court desiring to participate in the Setoff Debt Collection Act (\u00a7\u00a7 58.1-520 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>through 58.1-534) for the purpose of collecting fines or costs shall, at the time of sentencing, obtain the social security number of each defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-9\">D. Unreasonable failure to execute the plan by the defendant shall result in revocation of the probation or imposition of the suspended sentence. A hearing shall be held in accordance with the provisions of this Code relating to revocation of probation or imposition of a suspended sentence before either such action is taken. (1977, c. 682; 1978, c. 131; 1981, c. 224; 1984, cc. 32, 269).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b354-9\"> In pertinent part, former Code \u00a7 53-272 (now substantially rewritten as Code \u00a7 19.2-303) stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-10\">After a plea, a verdict or a judgment of guilty in any court having jurisdiction to hear and determine the offense with which the prisoner at the bar is charged, if there are circumstances in mitigation of the offense, or if it appears compatible with the public interest, the court may suspend the execution of sentence, in whole or in part, or the imposition of sentence or commitment, and may also place the defendant on probation under the supervision of a probation officer, during good behavior for such time and under such conditions of probation as the court shall determine. In case the prisoner has been sentenced for a misdemeanor and committed, or in case a jail sentence has been imposed upon the prisoner upon conviction of a felony, the court, or judge of such court in vacation may at any time before the sentence has been completely served, suspend the unserved portion of any such sentence, or place the defendant on probation under the supervision of a probation officer during good behavior, for such time and under such conditions of probation as the court shall determine, or otherwise modify and alter the sentence imposed if it appears compatible with the public interest.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
