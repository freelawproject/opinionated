The Board, after a hearing, placed the VFW Ocean View Post 3160 (licensee) on probation for permitting a gambling device to be present on the licensee\u2019s premises in violation of Code \u00a7 4-37(A)(l)(n).* <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Licensee appealed the Board\u2019s decision to the trial court asserting, as it does here, that the device complained of was permitted pursuant to a permit issued by the Commissioner of Revenue of the City of Norfolk by the authority granted in Code \u00a7 18.2-340.2. By order entered on September 16, 1988, the trial court reversed the Board and dismissed the charge against the licensee, stating in its order that \u201c\u00a7 18.2-340.1(3) of the Code of Virginia as applied in this case to VFW Ocean View Post 3160 is impermissibly vague and ambiguous, that the statute is a part of the criminal laws and must be strictly construed, that the Court is unable to determine the meaning of \u2018prearranged\u2019 in the statute and is unable to determine whether the conduct in issue is illegal, and therefore, that \u00a7 18.2-340.1(3) is unenforceable when applied to the \u2018Nevada cards\u2019 as operated by VFW Ocean View Post 3160.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">The facts upon which the Board based its decision are not in dispute. Licensee is an organization as defined in Code \u00a7 18.2-340.1. Licensee holds a Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Board license as well as a valid permit for the conduct of authorized \u201craffles.\u201d The permit was issued by the office of the Commissioner of Revenue for the City of Norfolk. On November 12, 1986, the Board\u2019s special agent, B. T. Seberly, acting on a com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>plaint of gambling at licensee\u2019s premises, investigated the complaint. Upon being admitted to the premises, Seberly found and seized a large number of pull-tab cards known as \u201cNevada Club Cards.\u201d Approximately 44,000 cards were seized. The parties stipulated that the cards seized were on licensee\u2019s premises, were possessed by licensee, and were in use by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">A Nevada Club Card sells for twenty-five cents and each card has five chances to win. Upon purchasing a card, the player must pull open each of five perforated windows. The opening of a window exposes either three bars, three bells, three oranges, three lemons, three cherries, or combinations thereof. The back of the card shows that, to be a \u201cwinner,\u201d all three symbols in the windows must match. Although the winning cards are determined in advance by the manufacturer, licensee did not know which cards contained winning combinations. The licensee purchased the cards by the case. Each case contained 1,680 pre-printed cards. At twenty-five cents per card, the sale of an entire case would yield $420 in gross sales to the seller. Each case has a limited number of predetermined winning cards. The total payout for all winning cards is $284, thereby providing the seller with $136 net profit per case.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">At the trial court hearing the Attorney General conceded that licensee had, at all times, been open and honest about its use and sale of the cards, and did not allow the sale of any cards until it received advance approval from the local commissioner of revenue. However, licensee did not seek an advance ruling from the Board or the office of the Attorney General. During the Board proceedings, counsel for licensee sought an opinion from the Commonwealth Attorney for the City of Norfolk as to the legality of sales of the cards. The Commonwealth Attorney responded by letter dated July 6, 1987, stating that although the use of the Nevada Club Cards \u201ccould be technically illegal\u201d in that they did not fall within the statutory definition of \u201craffle,\u201d he did not feel that the legislature intended to prohibit the type of activity being conducted by licensee and that the sale of the Nevada Club Cards was no more offensive than an ordinary raffle or instant bingo.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">When applicable, the provisions of Code \u00a7 18.2-340.1(3) provide an exemption from the anti-gambling statutes. The issue in this case is whether the Nevada Club Cards constitute \u201cgam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>bling devices\u201d as defined in Code \u00a7 18.2-325,* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and, if so, whether the activity is exempted by Code \u00a7 18.2-340.1(3). We hold that the Nevada Club Cards are \u201cgambling devices.\u201d Thus, to overturn the decision of the Board, the burden is upon licensee to show that Code \u00a7 18.2-340.1(3) exempts the sale of Nevada Club Cards. If the wording of the statute cannot be shown to provide a shield for licensee then it has none. We find no such language in Code \u00a7 18.2-340.1(3) which exempts the cards; therefore, we find that licensee did not meet its burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Code \u00a7 18.2-340.1(3) defines the term \u201craffle\u201d to mean a random drawing of either a name or number which corresponds with a ticket or other proof of purchase of the winning name or number. The term \u201craffle\u201d does not encompass a system whereby, to win, a purchaser must match bars, cherries or lemons in triple sequence as required by the Nevada Club Cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">For the reasons stated, the judgment of the trial court is reversed and the finding of the Board sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">Barrow, J., and Coleman, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b198-8\"> \u00a7 4-37.
