Potter argues that the circuit court proceedings against him should have been dismissed because the Commonwealth failed to file the information \u201cforthwith\u201d in accordance with the statutory mandate. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-11\">Potter was convicted three times of driving under the influence, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266, and three times of driving on a revoked or suspended license, in violation of Code \u00a7 46.1-350.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> These convictions occurred on July 21, 1981, September 8, 1981, April 26, 1984, September 8, 1981, April 16, 1984, and April 26, 1984, respectively. The April 26, 1984, conviction of driving under the influence resulted in Potter\u2019s license being suspended for a period of ten years. On June 15, 1984, Potter\u2019s license was suspended indefinitely for driving under the influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-12\">On February 10, 1987, the Commissioner of the Division of Motor Vehicles certified an abstract of Potter\u2019s record to the Fairfax County Commonwealth\u2019s attorney for the purpose of commencing habitual offender proceedings against Potter. Based upon this certification, the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney signed the infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>mation on September 17, 1987, and filed it on January 20, 1988. At the April 14, 1988, adjudication hearing, Potter asserted that the eleven month lapse of time between the DMV certification and the filing of the information did not comply with the statutory requirement to file \u201cforthwith.\u201d Finding that Potter had not been prejudiced by the delay, the circuit judge ruled that the Commonwealth had sufficiently complied with the statute and declared Potter an habitual offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Code \u00a7 46.1-387.4,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in effect at the time of these proceedings, provided: \u201cThe attorney for the Commonwealth, upon receiving the aforesaid transcripts or abstracts from the Commissioner, <em>shall forthwith </em>file information against the person named therein in the court of record having jurisdiction of criminal offenses in the political subdivision in which such person resides.\u201d (emphasis added). The term \u201cforthwith\u201d has been defined as \u201crequiring] reasonable promptness without unnecessary delay.\u201d <em>Bouldin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>4 Va. App. 166, 171, 355 S.E.2d 352, 355 (1987); <em>see also Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>588 (5th ed. 1979). Whether the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney instituted the proceedings \u201cforthwith\u201d depends upon the facts and circumstances of each case. <em>See Bouldin, </em>4 Va. App. at 171, 355 S.E.2d at 355 (brief delay of eight days from time of receipt of abstract held not violative of Code \u00a7 46.1-387.4); <em>see also State </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>12 Kan. App. 2d 803, 758 P.2d 247 (1988) (where six months of eighteen month delay was caused by incorrect or out of state address, dismissal of petition for failure to file \u201cforthwith\u201d was not appropriate); <em>State </em>v. <em>Garton, 2 </em>Kan. App. 2d 709, 586 P.2d 1386 (1978) (proceeding was commenced \u201cforthwith,\u201d despite thirteen month delay, where defendant was incarcerated and was therefore not prejudiced by delay and action was instituted immediately upon his release); <em>State v. Ward, </em>31 N.C. App. 104, 107, 228 S.E.2d 490, 492 (1976) (failure to act \u201cforthwith\u201d where district attorney instituted proceeding two years and three months after receiving abstract from Commissioner of Department of Motor Vehicles and respondent was prejudiced thereby).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">In the present case, eleven months elapsed between the certification of the abstracts by DMV and the filing of the petition by the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney. The only reason given for the delay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>was the inability of the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney to process the information in a more expeditious fashion due to a heavy case load. We agree with Potter that the Commonwealth failed to provide a satisfactory excuse for the lengthy delay. Under these facts, the filing was not \u201cforthwith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">We disagree with Potter\u2019s contention, however, that dismissal of the information was appropriate under the circumstances. Code \u00a7 46.1-387.9:2 allows a person adjudged an habitual offender under Code \u00a7 46.1-387.2 to petition the court for restoration of the privilege to operate a motor vehicle after the expiration of five years from the date of the habitual offender adjudication. Potter alleges prejudice flowing from the Commonwealth\u2019s delay in filing the information, which resulted in his being deprived of his driving privileges eleven months longer than if the Commonwealth had complied with the statutory framework. We are unpersuaded by this position. According to the record, Potter\u2019s license had been suspended for a ten year period as of April 26, 1984. Potter\u2019s license was further suspended indefinitely on June 15, 1984. As a result of these prior adjudications, Potter was not privileged to operate a motor vehicle at the time of the DMV certification or at any time prior to entry of the court\u2019s order. Potter\u2019s inability to drive during this period was not a product of the Commonwealth\u2019s delay in filing the information. <em>See Garton, </em>2 Kan. App. 2d at 712, 586 P.2d at 1388. Moreover, because Potter was barred from operating a motor vehicle until April 26, 1994 under the previously imposed suspension, an eleven month delay in Potter\u2019s eligibility to seek restoration of driving privileges after five years cannot be considered prejudicial under the circumstances. We conclude that, in the absence of a showing of prejudice by the delay, dismissal of the information is not appropriate. <em>See id. </em>at 711, 586 P.2d at 1388.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the circuit court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">Keenan, J., and Willis, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b146-13\"> Now Code \u00a7 46.2-351.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b146-14\"> Now Code \u00a7 46.2-301.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b147-7\"> Now Code \u00a7 46.2-353.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
