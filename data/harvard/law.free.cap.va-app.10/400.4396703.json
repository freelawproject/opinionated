The requirement that the declaration be before a magistrate is a procedural, not a substantive, requirement of the implied consent statute designed to provide <em>prima facie </em>evidence of refusal and provide an accused with an impartial judicial review of his or her justifications in refusing. Code \u00a7 18.2-268(S). The magistrate only verifies the arrested individual\u2019s initial refusal to the arresting officer, Code \u00a7 18.2-268(E), which refusal is deemed under the implied consent statute to have occurred where the act of driving occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">\u201cImplied consent laws,\u201d which are based upon public policy and highway safety concerns, provide that before the sovereign is required to authorize motorists to operate upon its highways, it may require through its police powers that motorists consent to giving a breath or blood sample when charged with operating a vehicle while intoxicated. Since consent is deemed to have been given at the time of driving, the refusal to abide by that consent necessarily occurs where the act of driving occurred. <em>See Deaner </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>210 Va. 285, 289, 170 S.E.2d 199, 202 (1969)(the same act of driving that gives rise to the offense gives rise to the independent implied consent violation). The act of refusal is inseparable from the implied consent and the act of driving itself. Thus, the location of the magistrate before whom the arresting officer takes the refusing individual is irrelevant to the issue of whether the implied consent law was violated in a particular jurisdiction. The city\u2019s jurisdiction to punish the defendant for violating the city\u2019s implied consent ordinance was established by proof that the defendant was arrested for driving while intoxicated within the city and thereafter refused to submit to the taking of a breath or blood sample. Therefore, the conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">Duff, J., and Moon, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b433-11\"> The Circuit Court for Fairfax County is the circuit court for Fairfax County and the City of Fairfax.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b433-12\"> Section 13.1 of the Code of the City of Fairfax, which he was charged with violating, incorporates by reference Code \u00a7 18.2-268, Virginia\u2019s implied consent statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
