Capua, </em>656 F.2d 1033, 1037 (5th Cir.1981). Nonconstitutional claims that could have been raised on direct appeal, but were not, may not be asserted in a collateral proceeding. <em>Id. </em>Vaughn was sentenced within the Guideline range and did not appeal the sentence. A district court\u2019s technical application of the Guidelines does not give rise to a constitutional issue. <em>U.S. v. Lopez, </em>923 F.2d 47, 50 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 111 S.Ct. 2032, 114 L.Ed.2d 117 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">Vaughn\u2019s claim is not cognizable under the limited scope of relief available under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 because it is not of constitutional dimension, could have been raised on direct appeal, and there has been no showing as to why it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
