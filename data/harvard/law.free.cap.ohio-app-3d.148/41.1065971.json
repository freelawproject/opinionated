Getto. This court affirms.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b79-11\">{\u00b6 2} At approximately 1:20 a.m. on May 27, 1999, Officer Getto was driving his marked police cruiser west on West Smith Road in Medina. Driving west in front of Officer Getto was a pickup truck, which, it later came to be known, was being operated by Michael J. Leach. Officer Getto observed that as the pickup truck in front of him crossed over railroad tracks, it veered left of the centerline of West Smith Road and into the eastbound lane, and returned to the westbound lane.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-12\">{\u00b6 3} Officer Getto entered the license number of the pickup into his onboard computer, from which he learned that there was an outstanding arrest warrant for the owner of the vehicle, Mr. Leach. Officer Getto decided to initiate a traffic stop and activated his overhead flashing lights. Instead of stopping, Leach swerved left of center and accelerated past the car in front of him in an attempt to flee from Officer Getto. Officer Getto then activated his siren and pursued Leach.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-13\">{\u00b6 4} The Medina Police Department had a fresh-pursuit policy in effect at the time of the pursuit. In compliance with this policy, Officer Getto established radio communications with his shift commanding officer, Sergeant Horton. Also pursuant to the policy, Sergeant Horton assumed a supervisory role over the pursuit via radio communications with Officer Getto. Other members of the Medina Police Department joined Officer Getto in the pursuit of Leach in response to Sergeant Horton\u2019s request, and county sheriffs officers also rendered assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>{\u00b6 5} The pursuit continued for approximately eleven minutes, sometimes at speeds in excess of eighty-five miles per hour. The pursuit ended when Leach\u2019s pickup collided with a vehicle driven by appellant. Appellant sustained severe personal injuries as a result of this collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">{\u00b6 6} Appellant filed an action against the city of Medina and Officer Getto, as well as a John Doe defendant. Appellant\u2019s complaint alleged that the defendants\u2019 conduct constituted gross negligence and/or willful, wanton, or malicious misconduct, which proximately caused his injuries. Appellees moved for summary judgment on the bases that they were statutorily immune from liability and that they did not proximately cause appellant\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">{\u00b6 7} The trial court granted appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Appellant then filed a \u201cmotion for reconsideration\u201d with the trial court, asserting that an Ohio Supreme Court decision issued after the entry of summary judgment for appellees \u201ccalled the constitutional validity of [sections of the Political Subdivision Tort Liability Act] into question.\u201d The trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion. Appellant has appealed from the denial of both motions, asserting three assignments of error which this court has rearranged to facilitate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">{\u00b6 8} Pursuant to Civ.R. 56(C), summary judgment is proper if \u201c(1) [n]o genuine issue as to any material fact remains to be litigated; (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and viewing such evidence most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, that conclusion is adverse to that party.\u201d <em>Temple v. Wean United, Inc. </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 317, 327, 4 O.O.3d 466, 364 N.E.2d 267. Appellate review of a lower court\u2019s entry of summary judgment is de novo, applying the same standard used by the trial court. <em>McKay v. Cutlip </em>(1992), 80 Ohio App.3d 487, 491, 609 N.E.2d 1272. The party seeking summary judgment initially bears the burden of informing the trial court of the basis for the motion and identifying portions of the record demonstrating an absence of genuine issues of material fact as to the essential elements of the nonmoving party\u2019s claims. <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 293, 662 N.E.2d 264. The movant must point to some evidence in the record of the type listed in Civ.R. 56(C) in support of his motion. Id. Once this burden is satisfied, the nonmoving party has the burden, as set forth in Civ.R. 56(E), to offer specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial. Id. The nonmoving party may not rest upon the mere allegations and denials in the pleadings but instead must point to or submit some evidentiary material that shows that a genuine dispute over the material facts exists. <em>Henkle v. Henkle </em>(1991), 75 Ohio App.3d 732, 735, 600 N.E.2d 791.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>Assignment of Error Number Three</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cThe trial court erred in holding that defendants are immune from liability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">{If 10} In his third assignment of error, appellant has argued that R.C. Chapter 2744, regarding statutory immunity of political subdivisions, violates Sections 5 and 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution. Appellant has contended that R.C. Chapter 2744 violates, respectively, his fundamental right to trial by jury and his right to a remedy for injuries by due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">{\u00b6 11} Appellant did not contest the constitutionality of R.C. Chapter 2744 at the trial court in his memorandum in opposition to appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rather, appellant first raised the issue in a \u201cmotion for reconsideration\u201d filed with the trial court after final judgment had been rendered on appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment. A motion for reconsideration of final judgment in the trial court, however, is a nullity. <em>Pitts v. Dept. of Transp. </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 378, 379, 21 O.O.3d 238, 423 N.E.2d 1105. Appellant\u2019s failure to timely challenge the constitutionality of the statute in the trial court constitutes a waiver that bars appellant from raising the issue on appeal. <em>Howard v. Seidler </em>(1996), 116 Ohio. App.3d 800, 815, 689 N.E.2d 572, appeal not allowed (1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 1494, 678 N.E.2d 1230, citing <em>State v. Smith </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 284, 293, 574 N.E.2d 510, certiorari denied (1994), 512 U.S. 1246, 114 S.Ct. 2768, 129 L.Ed.2d 882. Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">Assignment of Error Number Two</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cThe trial court erred in finding that no genuine issues of fact remain to be decided by the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">{\u00b6 13} In his second assignment of error, appellant has argued that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of appellees because there existed genuine issues of fact regarding whether appellees were immune from liability pursuant to R.C. 2744.02 and R.C. 2744.03. Appellant has contended that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>whether appellees\u2019 conduct was willful or wanton, as well as the issue of proximate cause, should have been submitted to a jury. However, \u201cjust because a particular element of a claim or defense involves a question of fact does not automatically preclude the claim or defense from a determination under summary judgment. The inquiry under summary judgment is whether the moving party has demonstrated the absence of a genuine issue of material fact and, if so, whether the nonmoving party has responded with evidence demonstrating the existence of a genuine issue of material fact.\u201d <em>Wagner v. Heavlin </em>(2000), 136 Ohio App.3d 719, 730, 737 N.E.2d 989. See, also, <em>Lewis v. Bland </em>(1991), 75 Ohio App.3d 453, 599 N.E.2d 814; <em>Jackson v. Poland Twp. </em>(Sept. 29, 1999), Mahoning App. Nos. 96 C.A. 261, 97 C.A. 13 and 98 C.A. 105, 1999-Ohio-998, 1999 WL 783959 (each affirming summary judgment where no genuine issue of fact existed as to whether police officer\u2019s conduct during high-speed pursuit proximately caused third party\u2019s injuries).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">City of Medina\u2019s Liability</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">{\u00b6 14} Determining whether a political subdivision is immune from liability requires a three-tier analysis. <em>Cater v. Cleveland </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 24, 28, 697 N.E.2d 610. The starting point is the general rule that political subdivisions are immune from tort liability:</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cFor the purposes of this chapter, the functions of political subdivisions are hereby classified as governmental functions and proprietary functions. Except as provided in division (B) of this section, a political subdivision is not liable in damages in a civil action for injury, death, or loss to persons or property allegedly caused by any act or omission of the political subdivision or an employee of the political subdivision in connection with a governmental or proprietary function.\u201d R.C. 2744.02(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">{\u00b6 16} At the second tier, this comprehensive immunity can be abrogated pursuant to any of the five exceptions set forth at R.C. 2744.02(B). Finally, immunity lost to one of the R.C. 2744.02(B) exceptions may be reinstated if the political subdivision can establish one of the statutory defenses to liability. <em>Cater, </em>83 Ohio St.3d at 28, 697 N.E.2d 610.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">{\u00b6 17} Applying this three-tiered analysis to the instant case, we begin with the general rule that the city, as a political subdivision, is immune from liability for the acts or omissions of its employees in connection with a governmental or proprietary function. R.C. 2744.02(A)(1). Moving to the second tier, the only exception to this immunity relevant to the present case is set forth at R.C. 2744.02(B)(1):</p>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cExcept as otherwise provided in this division, political subdivisions are liable for injury, death, or loss to persons or property caused by the negligent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>operation of any motor vehicle by their employees upon the public roads, highways, or streets when the employees are engaged within the scope of their employment and authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">{\u00b6 19} Assuming arguendo that appellant\u2019s injuries were \u201ccaused by the negligent operation\u201d of the police cruiser driven by Officer Getto,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the final step of the analysis reinstates the city\u2019s immunity if the city can establish a defense to its liability:</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cThe following are full defenses to such [R.C. 2744.02(B)(1) ] liability:</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c(a) A member of a municipal corporation police department or any other police agency was operating a motor vehicle while responding to an emergency call and the operation of the vehicle did not constitute willful or wanton misconduct.\u201d R.C. 2744.02(B)(1)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">{\u00b6 22} Assimilating the foregoing provisions, summary judgment on the issue of the city\u2019s immunity is proper if reasonable minds could only conclude that (1) Officer Getto was responding to an emergency call, and (2) Officer Getto\u2019s operation of his patrol car did not constitute willful or wanton misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">Emergency Call</p>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">{\u00b6 23} An \u201cemergency call\u201d is \u201ca call to duty, including * * * personal observations by peace officers of inherently dangerous situations that demand an immediate response on the part of the peace officer.\u201d R.C. 2744.01(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-11\">{\u00b6 24} The statutory definition does not limit \u201cemergency calls\u201d to occasions of inherent danger or danger to human life. <em>Moore v. Columbus </em>(1994), 98 Ohio App.3d 701, 706, 649 N.E.2d 850, appeal not allowed (1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 1422, 648 N.E.2d 514. In determining whether an emergency call exists, \u201cthe proper focus should be on all the attendant facts and circumstances leading up to or giving rise to the pursuit, <em>including </em>the operation of the fleeing motorist\u2019s vehicle during the pursuit.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Wagner, </em>136 Ohio App.3d at 729, 737 N.E.2d 989. In <em>Wagner, </em>the court found no genuine issue of fact that the officer\u2019s pursuit was in response to an emergency call where the officer initiated a traffic stop of a motorist he suspected of not having a valid driver\u2019s license, and the driver ran a red light and fled at high speed. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-12\">{\u00b6 25} This court has previously stated: \u201cIt is the duty of law enforcement officials who observe reckless motorists to apprehend those motorists who make the highways dangerous to others.\u201d <em>Lewis, </em>75 Ohio App.3d at 456, 599 N.E.2d 814. In the instant case, Officer Getto personally observed appellant veer his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>truck left of the center line, and attempted to stop appellant after learning of the outstanding warrant for appellant\u2019s arrest. In attempting to initiate the stop, Officer Getto activated his siren and flashing lights. Accordingly, reasonable minds could only conclude that Officer Getto was responding to an \u201cemergency call.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Willful or Wanton Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cWanton misconduct\u201d has been defined as \u201cthe failure to exercise any care toward one to whom a duty of care is owed when the failure occurs under circumstances for which the probability of harm is great and when the probability of harm is known to the tortfeasor.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Brockman v. Bell </em>(1992), 78 Ohio App.3d 508, 515, 605 N.E.2d 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cWillful misconduct\u201d is \u201c \u2018an intentional deviation from a clear duty or from a definite rule of conduct, a deliberate purpose not to discharge some duty necessary to safety, or purposely doing wrongful acts with knowledge or appreciation of the likelihood of resulting injury.\u2019\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., quoting <em>Tighe v. Diamond </em>(1948), 149 Ohio St. 520, 527, 37 O.O. 243, 80 N.E.2d 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">{\u00b6 28} The exception to immunity set forth at R.C. 2744.02(B)(1) for negligent operation of motor vehicles by employees of political subdivisions has no application to the decisions of Officer Getto and Sergeant Horton to initiate and continue the chase. The R.C. 2744.02(B)(1) exception to political subdivision immunity applies only where an employee <em>negligently operates </em>a motor vehicle; decisions concerning whether to pursue a suspect and the manner of pursuit are beyond the scope of the exception for negligent operation of a motor vehicle. See <em>Rahn v. Whitehall </em>(1989), 62 Ohio App.3d 62, 574 N.E.2d 567 (affirming dismissal of plaintiffs action where plaintiff alleged police were only negligent or reckless only in the <em>manner </em>in which they conducted the chase, but did not allege that the police were reckless in the operation of their motor vehicles \u2014 e.g., failed to activate their emergency signals during the pursuit); <em>Taylor v. Cleveland </em>(Dec. 17, 1992), Cuyahoga App. No. 63873, 1992 WL 390194 (affirming summary judgment on immunity grounds where plaintiff alleged willful and wanton misconduct only in the officers\u2019 initiation and continued pursuit of the fleeing vehicle, but not in the way the officers handled their vehicle during the pursuit). The blanket immunity conferred by R.C. 2744.02(A)(1) in connection with governmental functions therefore applies to the decisions to initiate and continue the pursuit, as one governmental function of the city is \u201cthe provision of police services or protection and the regulation of the use of public roads and streets, including the regulation of traffic thereon. R.C. 2744.01(C)(2)(a), (e), and (j).\u201d <em>Rahn, </em>62 Ohio App.3d at 66, 574 N.E.2d 567.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>{\u00b6 29} Accordingly, to avoid summary judgment, appellant must show the existence of a genuine issue of fact as to whether Officer Getto\u2019s operation of his police cruiser during the pursuit of Leach was willful or wanton. After a thorough review of the record, this court concludes that reasonable minds could only find that Officer Getto\u2019s operation of his police cruiser during the pursuit of Leach was not willful or wanton. The pursuit began at approximately 1:20 a.m. and took place primarily outside the Medina city limits. Officer Getto activated his overhead flashing lights and siren at the beginning of the pursuit. Before Leach\u2019s collision with appellant, Officer Getto encountered only one or two other vehicles during the chase, both at the beginning of the pursuit. When Officer Getto encountered stop signs and railroad crossings during the chase, he slowed or stopped his cruiser to ensure that he could clear them safely. Officer Getto followed Leach at a distance of approximately one-quarter of a mile throughout most of the chase and reached top speeds of between eighty and ninety miles per hour. At the time of Leach\u2019s collision with appellant, Officer Getto was travelling approximately 50 miles per hour. In view of these uncontroverted facts regarding the chase, appellant has failed to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of fact as to whether Officer\u2019s Getto\u2019s operation of his police cruiser during the pursuit constituted willful or wanton misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Officer Getto\u2019s Individual Liability</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">{\u00b6 30} R.C. 2744.03(A)(6) sets forth the circumstances under which employees of political subdivisions are immune from civil liability. In order to defeat summary judgment on his claim against Officer Getto under this statute, appellant must show some genuine issue of material fact as to whether Officer Getto acted with \u201cmalicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">{\u00b6 31} \u201c(A) In a civil action brought against a political subdivision or an employee of a political subdivision to recover damages for injury, death, or loss to persons or property allegedly caused by any act or omission in connection with a governmental or proprietary function, the following defenses or immunities may be asserted to establish nonliability:</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c(6) [T]he employee is immune from liability unless one of the following applies:</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">{\u00b6 34} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">{\u00b6 35} \u201c(b) The employee\u2019s acts or omissions were -with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner[.]\u201d R.C. 2744.03(A)(6)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-12\">{\u00b6 36} In applying this standard, this court has stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>{\u00b6 37} \u201c \u2018Malice\u2019 refers to the willful and intentional design to do injury. <em>Jackson v. Butler Cty. Bd. of Cty. Commrs. </em>(1991), 76 Ohio App.3d 448, 453, 602 N.E.2d 363. \u2018Bad faith\u2019 connotes a \u2018dishonest purpose, moral obliquity, conscious wrongdoing, breach of a known duty through some ulterior motive or ill will partaking of the nature of fraud.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 454, 602 N.E.2d 363, quoting <em>Slater v. Motorists Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1962), 174 Ohio St. 148, 21 O.O.2d 420, 187 N.E.2d 45, paragraph two of the syllabus. \u2018Reckless\u2019 conduct refers to an act done with knowledge or reason to know of facts that would lead a reasonable person to believe that the conduct creates an unnecessary risk of physical harm and that this risk is greater than that necessary to make the conduct negligent. <em>Thompson v. McNeill </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 102, 104-105, 559 N.E.2d 705, citing 2 Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts (1965) 587, Section 500.\u201d <em>Piro v. Franklin Twp. </em>(1995), 102 Ohio App.3d 130, 139, 656 N.E.2d 1035.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">{\u00b6 38} Appellant has asserted that, based upon the danger to the public associated with high-speed pursuits, Officer Getto should not have initiated the chase of Leach, and should have abandoned the pursuit long before Leach\u2019s collision with appellant. Appellant has further argued that appellees failed to adequately balance (1) the seriousness of Leach\u2019s offense which gave rise to the chase, against (2) the danger to the public occasioned by a high-speed pursuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">{\u00b6 39} Officer Getto attempted to initiate a traffic stop of Leach after entering Leach\u2019s license plate number through his on-board computer and learning that there was an outstanding warrant for Leach\u2019s arrest. When Leach failed to pull over and sped away, Officer Getto pursued Leach and advised his supervisor, Sergeant Horton, that he was engaging in a high-speed pursuit. As part of his supervisory role over the pursuit, Sergeant Horton asked the police dispatcher the reason for Leach\u2019s outstanding warrant. The dispatcher responded, over the frequency being monitored and used by Officer Getto and Sergeant Horton, that the outstanding warrant was for failure to appear in a neighboring county. The dispatcher also gave a code indicating that police officers from the neighboring jurisdiction would pick up Leach only if he was apprehended in an adjacent county, which in turn indicated that the offense underlying the warrant was minor. Officer Getto did not know, at any time during the pursuit, the specific offense for which Leach failed to appear.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">{\u00b6 40} Officer' Getto has not contested that his pursuit of Leach endangered the public or that he was aware of this danger throughout the chase. However, the fact that danger inheres in high-speed chases alone is not sufficient to present a genuine issue of fact concerning whether Officer Getto acted with malicious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner. Nor does appellant\u2019s assertion that Officer Getto should have ascertained the reason underlying Leach\u2019s failure to appear establish such a genuine issue of fact. The offense for which Leach\u2019s outstanding warrant was issued may be one consideration in determining whether to initiate and continue the high-speed pursuit. However, Officer Getto\u2019s failure to discover the specifics of the offense underlying the outstanding arrest warrant, in the instant before the pursuit was initiated or while it was in progress, does not create a genuine issue of fact as to whether the pursuit was conducted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">{\u00b6 41} Appellant has also argued that the testimony of two expert witnesses is sufficient to create a genuine issue of fact as to whether appellees\u2019 conduct gives rise to liability. Appellant\u2019s witnesses testified that appellees violated the police department\u2019s fresh-pursuit policy, failed to exercise any care for the public during the pursuit, and engaged in conduct that was wanton, reckless, extreme, and outrageous. Appellant fails to appreciate that this testimony does not create any issues of <em>fact, </em>but merely states appellant\u2019s position with respect to appellees\u2019 culpability, which is a legal conclusion. <em>Hackathorn v. Preisse </em>(1995), 104 Ohio App.3d 768, 772, 663 N.E.2d 384, appeal not allowed (1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 1456, 656 N.E.2d 951. Nor does appellant\u2019s contention that appellees violated the police department\u2019s fresh-pursuit policy create an issue of fact for a jury in this case; a violation of an internal departmental procedure is irrelevant to the issue of whether appellees\u2019 conduct constituted willful or wanton misconduct. <em>Rodgers v. DeRue </em>(1991), 75 Ohio App.3d 200, 205, 598 N.E.2d 1312; <em>Jackson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">{\u00b6 42} Accordingly, having already determined that Officer Getto\u2019s operation of his police cruiser during the pursuit did not constitute willful or wanton misconduct, reasonable minds could only conclude that Officer Getto did not act with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">Assignment of Error Number One</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cThe trial court erred in holding that [appellees\u2019] conduct was not the proximate cause of [appellant\u2019s] injuries as a matter of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">{\u00b6 44} In his first assignment of error, appellant has argued that the trial court erred in finding, as a matter of law, that appellees\u2019 initiation and continuation of the high-speed pursuit was not the proximate cause of appellant\u2019s injuries. This court disagrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">{\u00b6 45} This court has previously considered the circumstances under which a police officer may be a proximate cause of injuries to a third party who is struck by a vehicle fleeing from the officer. See <em>Lewis, </em>75 Ohio App.3d at 453, 599 N.E.2d 814. In <em>Lewis, </em>this court held that even where police pursuit contributes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>to a fleeing violator\u2019s reckless driving, the proximate cause of a pursued\u2019s collision with a third party is not the officer\u2019s pursuit, but the reckless driving of the pursued:</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">{\u00b6 46} \u201cIt is the duty of law enforcement officials who observe reckless motorists to apprehend those motorists who make the highways dangerous to others. <em>Roll v. Timberman </em>(1967), 94 N.J.Super. 530, 536, 229 A.2d 281. The proximate cause of an accident in such a situation is the reckless driving of the pursued, notwithstanding recognition of the fact that police pursuit contributed to the pursued\u2019s reckless driving.\u201d Id. at 456, 599 N.E.2d 814.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">{\u00b6 47} In affirming summary judgment for the defendants, this court held that the police officer\u2019s involvement in the pursuit was insufficient to create an issue of fact on the element of proximate cause, in the absence of some evidence that the officer\u2019s conduct was extreme or outrageous:</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">{\u00b6 48} \u201cWhen a law enforcement officer pursues a fleeing violator and the violator injures a third party as a result of the chase, the officer\u2019s pursuit is not the proximate cause of those injuries unless the circumstances indicate extreme or outrageous conduct by the officer, as the possibility that the violator will injure a third party is too remote to create liability until the officer\u2019s conduct becomes extreme.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">{\u00b6 49} Appellant has asserted that there was sufficient evidence before the trial court from which a reasonable jury could conclude that appellees\u2019 conduct during the high-speed pursuit was extreme and outrageous. However, having already determined that no genuine issue of fact existed as to whether appellees\u2019 conduct was willful or wanton, or was with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner, this court finds that reasonable minds could only conclude that appellees\u2019 conduct was also not extreme or outrageous. Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">{\u00b6 50} Appellant\u2019s assignments of error are overruled. The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b88-12\">Batchelder, P.J., and Baird, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b81-11\">. Appellant has cited <em>Butler v. Jordan </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 354, 750 N.E.2d 554, for the proposition that three Justices of the Ohio Supreme Court \"expressly recognized,\u201d after the trial court granted summary judgment in the instant case, that R.C. Chapter 2744 violates the Ohio Constitution. At issue in <em>Butler </em>was whether a county\u2019s failure to execute its statutory duty to conduct a pre-certification investigation of a day care center precluded the county's immunity, under R.C. 2744.02(B)(5) (precluding governmental immunity where liability is expressly imposed by statute) for a child's death which resulted from mistreatment at the center. Although the plurality opinion, signed by three Justices, criticizes and questions the constitutionality of political subdivision immunity, all seven Justices concur in the judgment that R.C. Chapter 2744 prevails to immunize the political subdivision from liability. <em>Butler </em>does not, in any event, compel a reversal on political subdivision immunity grounds of the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b83-13\">.
