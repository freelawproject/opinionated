Plaintiff-appellee is the state of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">STATEMENT OF THE FACTS AND CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b258-12\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>On December 10, 1999, a complaint was filed in the Licking County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, alleging that appellant was a delinquent child by virtue of having committed acts which, if committed by an adult, would have constituted the offense of aggravated robbery, a felony of the first degree. The complaint specifically alleged that, on or about August 21, 1999, appellant, along with two other individuals, attempted to rob a cab driven by Ronald Thornton and that during the incident, appellant \u201cdisplayed a sawed-off shotgun, and threatened Mr. Thornton with the shotgun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-13\">{\u00b6 3} Subsequently, on May 25, 2001, a motion for bindover was filed by appellee. Appellee, in its motion, specifically requested that appellant be bound over to the Licking County Court of Common Pleas, General Division, pursuant to R.C. 2151.26(B)(4) and Juv.R. 30(B). Thereafter, on June 8, 2001, appellee filed a motion to amend, seeking to amend the motion for bindover to include R.C. 2151.26(B)(2) \u201cas statutory authority for the basis of transfer of this matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>to the Court of Common Pleas, General Division.\u201d As memorialized in a judgment entry filed on June 20, 2001, the trial court granted appellee\u2019s motion to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">{\u00b6 4} On July 2, 2001, a hearing was held in the Licking County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division. Pursuant to a judgment entry filed on July 3, 2001, the trial court found that there was probable cause to believe that:</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">{\u00b6 5} \u201c1. Patrick Keith Simpson is age nineteen (19), having been born on April 1, 1982 to Marian Simpson, his mother, of Branchville, South Carolina. His birth occurred in Orangeburg, South Carolina.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">{\u00b6 6} \u201c2. At the time of the commission of the alleged offense on August 21, 1999, Patrick Keith Simpson was age seventeen (17) and was domiciled in the state of South Carolina but was visiting a relative in Newark, Licking County, Ohio. He returned to South Carolina on August 22 or 23,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c3. Patrick Keith Simpson did commit on August 21, 1999 in the County of Licking, State of Ohio the offense of aggravated robbery, a felony of the first degree, which is a category two offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">{\u00b6 8} The trial court, in its entry, further found, by \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d that appellant was domiciled in the State of South Carolina at the time of the commission of the offense and that if \u201cthe act charged in this case (aggravated robbery in which a deadly weapon is utilized) had been committed in the state of South Carolina, [appellant] would be subject to criminal prosecution as an adult under the laws of South Carolina.\u201d For the above reasons, the trial court transferred appellant\u2019s case to the Licking County Court of Common Pleas, General Division, \u201cfor adult prosecution\u201d pursuant to R.C. 2151.26(B)(2)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Juv.R. 30(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">{\u00b6 9} On August 16, 2001, the Licking County Grand Jury indicted appellant on one count of aggravated robbery in violation of R.C. 2911.01(A)(1) and/or (A)(2), a felony of the first degree, and one count of unlawful possession of dangerous ordnance in violation of R.C. 2923.17(A), a felony of the fifth degree. Both counts contained firearm specifications. At his arraignment on August 27, 2001, appellant entered a plea of not guilty to the charges contained in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-11\">{\u00b6 10} Thereafter, a jury trial commenced on September 28, 2001, in the Licking County Court of Common Pleas, General Division. Prior to the commencement of trial, appellant orally moved the trial court for a dismissal of the charges against him on the basis that the trial court lacked jurisdiction because appellant was a juvenile at the time of the offenses. The trial court, however, denied appellant\u2019s oral motion. The jury subsequently returned with verdicts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>finding appellant guilty of the two charges contained in the indictment as well as the two gun specifications. As memorialized in a judgment entry filed on October 3, 2001, the trial court sentenced appellant to an aggregate prison sentence of six years.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">{\u00b6 11} It is from his conviction and sentence that appellant now prosecutes his appeal, raising the following assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cThe trial court committed harmful error in binding the defendant-appellant over to the adult court to dispose of the instant matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">{\u00b6 13} Appellant, in his sole assignment of error, argues that the trial court erred in binding appellant over to the Licking County Court of Common Pleas, General Division, for prosecution as an adult. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">{\u00b6 14} As is stated above, the trial court, in its July 3, 2001 judgment entry, ordered that appellant be bound over to the Licking County Court of Common Pleas, General Division, pursuant to R.C. 2151.26(B)(2) and Juv.R. 30(B). R.C. 2151.26<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> states:</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c(B) After a complaint has been filed alleging that a child is a delinquent child for committing an act that would be an offense if committed by an adult, the court at a hearing shall transfer the case for criminal prosecution to the appropriate court having jurisdiction of the offense if the child was fourteen years of age or older at the time of the act charged, if there is probable cause to believe that the child committed the act charged, and if one or more of the following applies to the child or the act charged:</p>\n<p id=\"b260-11\">(II16} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b260-12\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c(2) The child is domiciled in another state, and, if the act charged had been committed in that other state, the child would be subject to criminal prosecution as an adult under the law of that other state without the need for a transfer of jurisdiction from a juvenile, family, or similar noncriminal court to a criminal court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-13\">{\u00b6 18} R.C. 2151.26(B)(2) clearly was intended to prevent out-of-state minors from coming into Ohio and committing offenses which would subject them to punishment as an adult in their state of domicile but, in Ohio, are under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>{\u00b6 19} Appellant, in the case sub judice, does not challenge the trial court\u2019s conclusions that there was probable cause to believe that appellant committed the offense of aggravated robbery or that appellant was 17 years old at the time of the commission of such offense. Nor does appellant argue that the bindover requirements set forth in Juv.R. 30 were not met. However, appellant does challenge the trial court\u2019s determination that appellant was domiciled in the state of South Carolina.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">{\u00b6 20} As appellant notes in his brief, the first issue for determination is whether R.C. 2151.26(B)(2), when speaking of the child being \u201cdomiciled in another state,\u201d is referring to domicile at the time of the commission of the offense or, rather, domicile at the time of the bindover hearing. We agree with appellant that this is a case of first impression because there appear to be no decisions that have applied or interpreted R.C. 2151.26(B)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">{\u00b6 21} Pursuant to R.C. 2151.01, the chapters within R.C. Chapter 2151 relating to juveniles are to be liberally construed and interpreted. \u201c[A]ll ambiguities in criminal or delinquency statutes are to be resolved in favor of the accused, especially when the penalty prescribed is severe. * * * Relinquishment of juvenile court jurisdiction is potentially the most severe sanction imposed on a child in the juvenile justice system.\u201d <em>In re B.S. </em>(1998), 103 Ohio Misc.2d 34, 39, 725 N.E.2d 362. See, also, R.C. 2901.04(A) and <em>State v. Richard </em>(1998), 129 Ohio App.3d 556, 718 N.E.2d 508. As noted by appellant in his brief, when construing the domicile requirement in R.C. 2151.26(B)(2) in favor of appellant, \u201cthe current ambiguity must be resolved in favor of weighing the question of a child\u2019s domicile at the time of the offense.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Such an interpretation is in accord with the reference in R.C. 2151.26(B)(2) to the child\u2019s age at the \u201ctime of the act charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">{\u00b6 22} The next issue for determination is whether the trial court erred in finding that appellant was domiciled in South Carolina at the time of the commission of the offense. \u201cDomicile\u201d is defined as \u201c[t]hat place where a man has his true, fixed, and permanent home and principal establishment, and to which whenever he is absent he has the intention of returning.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1991). As is stated above, the trial court, in its entry, specifically found \u201cby clear and convincing evidence that [appellant] was domiciled in the State of South Carolina at the time of the commission of the offense\u201d and that if \u201cthe act charged in this case (aggravated robbery in which a deadly weapon is utilized) had been committed in the State of South Carolina, [appellant] would be subject to criminal prosecution as an adult under the laws of South <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>Carolina.\u201d The trial court, in its entry, further found that there was \u201cprobable cause\u201d to believe that appellant was domiciled in the state of South Carolina at the time of commission of the alleged offense. Appellant now contends that the record is devoid of any evidence to support such finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">{\u00b6 23} We find that the trial court did not err in holding that there was clear and convincing evidence that appellant was domiciled in South Carolina at the time of the commission of the offense.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Clear and convincing evidence is that evidence \u201cwhich will produce in the mind of the trier of facts a firm belief or conviction as to the facts sought to be established.\u201d <em>Cross v. Ledford </em>(1954), 161 Ohio St. 469, 53 O.O. 361, 120 N.E.2d 118, paragraph three of the syllabus. At the July 2, 2001 hearing in this matter, Heath Heistand testified that appellant was living with him in an apartment in Newark, Ohio, for about a week or two around the time of the robbery in August 1999. The following testimony was adduced when Heistand was asked whether appellant told him why he had come to Newark from South Carolina:</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cA. Yeah, he said he got into some trouble down in South Carolina. Some charges were pending and he didn\u2019t want to stay down there.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cQ. Did he indicate whether or not he had warrants for his arrest in South Carolina?</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cA. He didn\u2019t say that. He just said he got in trouble.\u201d Transcript at 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">{\u00b6 27} Heistand further testified that appellant was from either Branchville or Orangeburg, South Carolina, and that, while appellant was supposed to spend at least a couple of months in Newark, after the robbery, \u201call of sudden, he wants to go back to South Carolina.\u201d Transcript at 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">{\u00b6 28} Detective Kevin Wells of the city of Newark Police Department also testified at the July 2, 2001 bindover hearing. Detective Wells testified that after contacting the police department in Branchville, South Carolina, he \u201ceventually did get some information on a young man named Patrick Simpson that had been in trouble down there.\u201d Transcript at 127. When Detective Wells traveled to South Carolina to speak with appellant on December 14, 1999, appellant, who was incarcerated at the time, filled out a <em>Miranda </em>warning form. The following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>testimony was adduced when Detective Wells was asked what information appellant filled out on the form:</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cA. His name.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cQ. Which was what?</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cA. Patrick Keith Simpson.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cQ. Okay.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cA. The address, 512 Laney Street. Social Security number, * * *\u2014 it\u2019s a little hard to read his writing. For me it is. I am not sure what the rest of it is there. His date of birth. It appears to be 4/1/82. And education level, he put ten. And under, can subject read and write the English language, he put his initials and yes in the yes spot.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cQ. Are you familiar with 512 Laney Street as to where that is located?</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cA. Yes. When we did travel to South Carolina, we went to the local police department there and made contact with them. And one of their officers drove us to Patrick\u2019s residence. We attempted to make contact with his mother to talk to her and it was 512 Laney Street in Branchville, South Carolina.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-12\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cQ. Okay.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-13\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cA. I believe.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-14\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cQ. Were you able to make contact with Patrick\u2019s mother?\u201d Transcript at 136-137.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-15\">{\u00b6 39} Based on the foregoing, we find that the trial court did not err in holding that there was clear and convincing evidence that appellant was domiciled in South Carolina at the time of the commission of the offense. We find that the evidence presented at the bindover hearing would \u201cproduce in the mind of the trier of facts a firm belief or conviction\u201d that appellant was domiciled in South Carolina at the time of commission of the offense in the case sub judice.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-16\">{\u00b6 40} Appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error is, therefore, overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-17\">{\u00b6 41} Accordingly, the judgment of the Licking County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-18\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b263-19\">Gwin, P.J., and Farmer, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b259-12\">. Appellee, at the bindover hearing, conceded that R.C. 2151.26(B)(4) was not applicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b260-14\">. R.C. 2151.26 has since been amended and recodified as R.C. 2152.12, effective January 1, 2002.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b261-8\">. We note that appellee, at the oral argument in this matter, agreed that, when speaking of domicile, R.C. 2151.26(B)(2) was referring to domicile at the time of the commission of the offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b262-11\">. While, as is stated above, the trial court, in its entry, also found that there was \"probable cause\u201d to believe that appellant was domiciled in South Carolina at the time of the offense, we do not believe that \"probable cause\u201d is the proper standard. While R.C. 2151.26(B)(2) specifically requires a trial court to determine whether there was \"probable cause\u201d to believe that the child committed the act charged, it does not expressly require a trial court to determine whether there was \"probable cause\u201d that the child was domiciled in another state. Had the legislature intended for a probable-cause standard also to be applied to domicile, it could have expressly so provided.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
