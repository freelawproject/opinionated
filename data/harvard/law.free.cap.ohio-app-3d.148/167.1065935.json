Eifel\u2019s claim for unemployment benefits. For the reasons below, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and reinstate the decision of the Review Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-15\">{\u00b6 3} Eifel was employed by Medical Mutual of Ohio (\u201cMMO\u201d) from February 28, 1994 through June 28, 2000. In March 2000, Eifel had surgery and took medical leave. Thereafter, without returning to work after her medical leave, Eifel sought leave under the Family Medical Leave Act (\u201cFMLA\u201d) to care for a family member. On June 28, 2000, prior to the expiration of her FMLA leave, Eifel resigned from MMO.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-16\">{\u00b6 4} On June 29, 2000, Eifel applied for unemployment compensation from the Ohio Bureau of Employment Services (\u201cOBES\u201d). Her application was denied on July 24, 2000, because OBES found that she quit her employment without just cause. She appealed this decision, and on August 15, 2000, the OBES Adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>trator issued a redetermination that affirmed the July 24, 2000 denial of her request for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">{\u00b6 5} The matter was transferred to the Unemployment Compensation Review Commission (\u201cReview Commission\u201d) where a hearing was conducted. On September 22, 2000, the Review Commission hearing officer disallowed Eifel\u2019s claim, finding that she quit without just cause and was not able to work due to unwarranted restrictions she had placed on her availability. On November 8, 2000, Eifel\u2019s request for review of the Review Commission\u2019s September 22, 2000 decision was disallowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">{\u00b6 6} Pursuant to R.C. 4141.28(0)(1), Eifel timely appealed the matter to the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas. The trial court reversed the decision of the Review Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">{\u00b6 7} The Director raises the following assignment of error on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cThe common pleas court erred in reversing the Ohio Unemployment Compensation Review Commission\u2019s decision that appellee quit work without just cause where the decision was not unlawful, unreasonable or against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">{\u00b6 9} In <em>Johnson v. Ohio Bur. of Emp. Serv. </em>(May 14, 1998), Cuyahoga App. No. 73591, 1998 WL 241917, we set forth the standard applied in reviewing a decision of the Review Commission:</p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cThe Ohio Supreme Court in <em>Tzangas, Plakas &amp; Mannos v. Ohio Bur. of Emp. Serv. </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 694, 653 N.E.2d 1207, found that pursuant to R.C. 4141.28(0), an appellate court may reverse the Review Commission\u2019 s decision only if it is unlawful, unreasonable or against the manifest weight of the evidence. In <em>Tzangas, </em>the Supreme Court found that this same standard of review applies at each judicial appellate level including the Common Pleas Court, the Court of Appeals and the Ohio Supreme Court. Id. at 697 [653 N.E.2d 1207].</p>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cFollowing this standard, a reviewing court is not permitted to make factual findings or decide the credibility of witnesses, as determinations of purely factual questions are primarily reserved for the Review Commission. <em>Irvine v. Unemployment Comp. Bd. of Review </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St.3d 15, 18 [19 OBR 12], 482 N.E.2d 587; <em>Brown-Brockmeyer Co. v. Roach </em>(1947), 148 Ohio St. 511 [36 O.O. 167], 76 N.E.2d 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-12\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cAccordingly * * * we limit our review to a determination of the lawfulness and reasonableness of the Review Commission\u2019s decision, in light of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>the evidence presented to it. We will not reverse that decision if it is supported by competent, credible evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">{\u00b6 13} The Review Commission\u2019s September 22, 2000 decision disallowing Eifel\u2019s claim for benefits reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cIssue 1: <em>[Just </em>Cause]</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cClaimant quit employment with Medical Mutual of Ohio Inc. because she did not feel that the employer could provide her with a work environment that would not injure her health.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c[CJlaimant made requests of the employer to accommodate her need for a clean, pollution-free environment and * * * the employer took steps to accommodate claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c[Cjlaimant has not established the medical necessity of quitting her employment and thus she quit without just cause within the meaning of the Ohio Unemployment Compensation Law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-11\">{\u00b6 20} The trial court reversed the Review Commission\u2019s decision finding that an incorrect statement of law was applied to the issue of just cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-12\">{\u00b6 21} R.C. 4141.29(D)(2)(a) provides that \u201cno individual may * * * be paid benefits * * * [fjor the duration of the individual\u2019s unemployment if the director finds that [t]he individual quit work without just cause * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-13\">{\u00b6 22} In overruling the Review Commission decision, the trial court, relying on <em>Barnett v. Ohio Bur. of Emp. Serv. </em>(June 12, 1986), Cuyahoga App. No. 50751, 1986 WL 6723, determined:</p>\n<p id=\"b206-14\">{\u00b623} \u201cThe proper issue is whether claimant reasonably believed that her asthma was caused by environmental pollutants at work and that there was no way for her safely to continue working in the MMO building.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-15\">{\u00b6 24} The claimant in <em>Barnett </em>worked at an industrial casings plant and suffered from severe hearing loss. After a hearing, the Review Commission denied the claimant\u2019s benefits despite finding that \u201c[l]oud noise throughout the plant * * * was unavoidable.\u201d The Review Commission made its decision based on the fact that medical experts disagreed on whether the noise at the plant caused the hearing loss or whether it was a hereditary problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-16\">{\u00b6 25} In reversing the Review Commission\u2019s decision, this court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b206-17\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cWhether or not plant conditions actually caused appellant\u2019s hearing loss was not at issue; rather the issue was the reasonableness of appellant\u2019s belief that they were the cause <em>and that quitting was the only reasonable way to avoid </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number><em>further loss of hearing. </em>Cf. <em>Irvine v. Ohio Bd. of Unemploy. Comp. </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St.3d 15 [19 OBR 12, 482 N.E.2d 587].\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">{\u00b6 27} Although phrased differently, the Review Commission relied on the same proposition of law as did the trial court. The issue in <em>Barnett </em>was whether quitting provided the only solution to preserving the claimant\u2019s health. In other words, the issue was whether it was medically necessary for the claimant to quit. This is precisely the question considered by the Review Commission in the instant matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">{\u00b6 28} <em>Irvine, </em>upon which the <em>Barnett </em>court relied, sets forth the standard of law applicable to the instant case. In its syllabus, the Ohio Supreme Court states:</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cAn employee\u2019s voluntary resignation on the basis of health problems is without just cause within the meaning of R.C. 4141.29(D)(2)(a) when the employee is physically capable of maintaining a position of employment with the employer, but fails to carry her burden of proving that she inquired of her employer whether employment opportunities were available which conformed to her physical capabilities and same were not offered to her by the employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">{\u00b6 30} Applying <em>Irvine </em>to the instant matter, we find that the Review Commission did not err in disallowing Eifel\u2019s claims for unemployment compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">{\u00b6 31} Here, the Review Commission found that prior to her leave, Eifel made requests to MMO to accommodate her asthma. In response to her request, the Review Commission found that MMO took steps to accommodate her and showed a \u201cwillingness to do things to satisfy claimant\u2019s need for a !non-injurious\u2019 work environment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">{\u00b6 32} Although contradictory evidence was presented on the issue of whether the requested accommodations were made, it is not our position as a reviewing court to dispute a factual finding of the Review Commission that is supported by competent credible evidence. <em>Johnson v. Ohio Bur. of Emp. </em>(May 14, 1998), Cuyahoga App. No. 73591, 1998 WL 241917. A review of the record supports the Review Commission\u2019s finding. Pat McBride, the medical disability coordinator for MMO, testified that once advised of Eifel\u2019s asthma problems, she provided Eifel with a Material Safety Data Sheet (\u201cMSDS\u201d) from the cleaning service used by MMO, and awaited feedback from Eifel or her doctor regarding the necessary accommodations. McBride also testified that in the meantime Eifel\u2019s work station was moved, air ventilation was provided, and Eifel was given fans for her desk.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>{\u00b6 33} Thus, although Eifel met her burden with regard to proving that she advised MMO of her need for accommodation, she failed to establish that no actions were taken by MMO in response to her request.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">{\u00b6 34} Further, Eifel never provided MMO with her doctor\u2019s instructions for accommodation after MMO provided her with the MSDS. The first time that MMO received Eifel\u2019s doctor\u2019s medical restrictions<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was two days<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> before Eifel resigned from MMO. Thus, because Eifel quit while she was on FMLA leave, she failed to give MMO sufficient timely notice to afford it the opportunity of finding satisfactory alternate employment for her. See <em>Irvine </em>at 18, 19 OBR 12, 482 N.E.2d 587.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">{\u00b6 35} Therefore, we find that Eifel quit without just cause. Because of our determination of this issue, it is unnecessary to determine whether Eifel was available for work pursuant to R.C. 4141.29(A)(4)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">{\u00b6 36} Accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment because we find that the Review Commission\u2019s decision was not unlawful, unreasonable, or against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">{\u00b6 37} Judgment reversed and cause remanded with instructions to reinstate the Review Commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b208-10\">Michael J. Corrigan, P.J., and James J. Sweeney, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b208-11\">. The body of Dr. Neal C. Chadwick\u2019s letter, in its entirety, reads: \"The above patient has been under my care since 1997 with severe bronchial asthma. She has had multiple attacks requiring numerous medications and currently takes both Intal and Albuterol on a regular basis. She is extremely sensitive to environmental conditions such as dust or fumes which may precipitate her bronchial asthma. The patient should be in a relatively clean environment with no extremes of temperature or environmental pollutant that would help precipitate her asthma.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b208-12\">. Although the Review Commission did not make this finding, McBride testifies that this is when she received the letter. Her testimony is corroborated by the markings on the letter from Eifel\u2019s doctor, which indicate that it was dictated on June 14, 2000, and transcribed on June 18, 2000.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
