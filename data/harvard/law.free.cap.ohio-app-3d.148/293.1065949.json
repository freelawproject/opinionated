This court affirms.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">{\u00b6 2} While serving as Mayor of Avon Lake, appellant was indicted on eleven criminal charges. Appellant was charged with theft in office in violation of R.C. 2921.41(A)(1), theft in violation of R.C. 2913.02(A)(2), three counts of having an unlawful interest in a public contract in violation of R.C. 2921.42(A)(1), three counts of tampering with evidence in violation of R.C. 2921.12(A)(1), complicity to tampering with evidence in violation of R.C. 2923.03(A)(1) and 2921.12(A)(1), election falsification in violation of R.C. 3599.30, and soliciting or accepting improper compensation in violation of R.C. 2921.43(A)(1). After a jury trial, appellant was found guilty of two counts of having an unlawful interest in a public contract, one count of tampering with evidence, and one count of complicity to tampering with evidence. Appellant has appealed the convictions, asserting seven assignments of error. For ease of discussion, the substantive factual history of this case will be divided into four sections which precede the appropriate assignment(s) of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Unlawful Interest in a Public Contract</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">{\u00b6 3} The evidence presented at appellant\u2019s trial established that appellant contracted to have two city events catered by the Fountain Bleau Party Center (the \u201cCenter\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The evidence also showed that at the time of the events, appellant\u2019s brother, Dan, was working for the Center and was attempting to purchase it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> James Weisbarth, one of the Center\u2019s owners, testified that Dan negotiated to purchase the Center prior to January 2000 and that the deal fell apart sometime after January 2000. It is undisputed that at the time of the events in question Dan was attempting to buy the Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">{\u00b6 4} It is also undisputed that Dan was the manager of the Center in December 1999 until the spring of 2000. While Dan did not receive a salary from the Center until January 2000, Weisbarth testified that at the time of the events Dan was the sole manager of the Center. Dan\u2019s duties included handling the day-to-day running of the business, which included the hiring and firing of employees, payroll, scheduling employees, and paying distributors. Dan was also responsible for booking parties and the outside catering jobs. Trial testimony also established that Dan selected and ordered the company vehicle. Dan\u2019s son and wife were also employed by the Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>{\u00b6 5} Appellant testified that he recognized that if his brother owned the Center he could not use it for city functions, but that he thought that since Dan was not an owner, no conflict existed. Appellant also testified that he attempted to have one of the parties at another location in Avon Lake but that party center was unavailable. Appellant stated that he did not hide the fact that the parties were catered by the Center, but he admitted that he did not inform the public that his brother was the manager of the Center and was attempting to buy it.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Assignment of Error Number One</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cThe trial court erred in failing to grant the appellant\u2019s motion under Crim.R. 29(A) for judgment of acquittal on the counts alleging having an unlawful interest in a public contract, as proscribed by [R.C. 2921.42], in that the evidence was not legally sufficient to support a conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">{\u00b6 7} In his first assignment of error, appellant has asserted that the trial court erred in denying his motion for acquittal under Crim.R. 29(A) because the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction for having an unlawful interest in a public contract. Specifically, appellant has argued that an \u201cinterest,\u201d as required by R.C. 2921.42, does not exist in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">{\u00b6 8} Pursuant to Crim.R. 29(A), a trial court \u201cshall order the entry of a judgment of acquittal * * * if the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction of such offense or offenses.\u201d To determine whether a conviction is supported by legally sufficient evidence, this court must decide \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus; see, also, <em>State v. Wolfe </em>(1988), 51 Ohio App.3d 215, 216, 555 N.E.2d 689. \u201cIn essence, sufficiency is a test of adequacy.\u201d <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386, 678 N.E.2d 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">{\u00b6 9} Appellant was charged with violating R.C. 2921.42 for having an unlawful interest in a public contract. Pursuant to R.C. 2921.42, \u201c[n]o public official shall knowingly * * * [authorize, or employ the authority or influence of his office to secure authorization of any public contract in which he, a member of his family, or any of his business associates has an interest^]\u201d R.C. 2921.42(A)(1). \u201cA person acts knowingly, regardless of his purpose, when he is aware that his conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when he is aware that such circumstances probably exist.\u201d R.C. 2901.22(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">{\u00b6 10} While the term \u201cinterest\u201d is not statutorily defined, the Ohio Ethics Commission in discussing R.C. 2921.42 found:</p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c[A]n employee is considered to have an interest in his employer\u2019s contracts if: (1) the employee takes part in contract negotiations; (2) his salary is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>based on the proceeds of the contract; (3) he receives a share of the contract\u2019s proceeds in the form of a commission or fee; (4) his employment responsibilities include participation in the administration or execution of the contract; or (5) where the employee\u2019s tenure is dependent upon his employer receiving the award of such contract.\u201d Ohio Ethics Commission, Advisory Opinion No. 89-008.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">{\u00b6 12} In 1992, the Ohio Ethics Commission clarified its definition of \u201cinterest\u201d in relation to R.C. 2921.42 by stating that:</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c[A]n employee of a firm will be deemed to have an \u2018interest\u2019 in a public contract entered into by her employer * * * if any of the following circumstances apply: (1) the employee has an ownership interest in, or is a director, trustee, or officer of, her employer; (2) she takes part, as a firm employee, in contract negotiations or the application process; (3) her salary is based or dependent upon, or is paid from, the proceeds of the contract; (4) she receives a share of the contract\u2019s proceeds in the form of a commission or fee; (5) her responsibilities as an employee include participation in the administration or execution of the contract or she has the responsibility to oversee execution or administration of the contract; (6) the employing agency receives most or all of its funding from the contract, such that the establishment or operation of her employing agency is dependent upon receipt of the contract; or, (7) the creation or continuation of her employment is dependent upon her employer receiving the award of the contract.\u201d Ohio Ethics Commission, Advisory Opinion No. 92-002.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">{\u00b6 14} In the case sub judice, the trial court used the Ohio Ethics Commission\u2019s definition of \u201cinterest\u201d in its jury instructions. Appellant has not assigned such use as error. Therefore, the only issue before this court is whether sufficient evidence existed to support a conviction of having an unlawful interest pursuant to R.C. 2921.42 as that \u201cinterest\u201d was defined in the jury instructions. The pertinent jury instruction is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cA city mayor\u2019s brother has an improper interest in that city\u2019s public contract (1) if he receives or expects to receive a definite and direct financial benefit from the other party\u2019s participation in the city\u2019s public contract, or (2) if he has or expects to have a definite and direct responsibility for the other party\u2019s adoption or performance of the city\u2019s public contract. A city mayor\u2019s brother may have an improper interest in the city\u2019s public contract if, (a) he has an ownership interest in the company with which the city makes that public contract; or (b) he actively participates in that company\u2019s negotiations for that public contract; or (c) he has direct responsibility for that company\u2019s performance of that public contract.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>{\u00b6 16} This court concludes that, in construing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, the record demonstrates that a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of having an unlawful interest in a public contract proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence showed that appellant violated R.C. 2921.42 because he knowingly authorized two public contracts in which his brother had an interest. While the record does not cite under which prong of the interest definition the jury categorized Dan\u2019s relationship to the Center, the record does clearly show an interest within the trial court\u2019s definition. As manager of the Center, Dan had direct responsibility for the Center\u2019s performance of the contracts, that is, he was directly responsible for the hosting and catering of the events. By all accounts, Dan ran the Center; he was in charge of the day-to-day activities, including booking parties, outside catering, paying distributors, collecting fees, and employee scheduling and payroll. Therefore, a rational trier of fact could find an interest as enumerated in the trial court\u2019s \u201cinterest\u201d jury instruction. Accordingly, the trial court properly denied appellant\u2019s Crim.R. 29(A) motion for acquittal. Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Tampering with Evidence/Complicity to Tampering with Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">{\u00b6 17} Appellant testified that he received a phone call from the prosecutor informing him that the police and/or prosecutor would be coming by his office to collect documents relating to his campaign finance and his charity, the Mayor\u2019s Ball. Appellant stated that he called his secretary and told her to cooperate with the police. Appellant also testified that he told the prosecutor that it would take the weekend to gather the materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">{\u00b6 18} Appellant continued his testimony by explaining that when he returned to his office he told his secretary that the police were coming and asked her whether there was anything they should be concerned about the police seeing or anything he should look at. He wrote his secretary a note asking her to put anything she did not want the police to see in a bag for him. Appellant\u2019s secretary testified that he asked her whether she had anything that \u201cneed[ed] to be bagged.\u201d She testified that she told him that she did not think they should do that and then showed him a computer disk. Appellant took the disk from her and placed it in his jacket pocket and went upstairs to his office area.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>{\u00b6 19} Appellant\u2019s secretary called the police and told them he had taken the disk. Sergeant Jack Hall testified that he was sent to appellant\u2019s office and that when appellant was asked about the disk he had taken from his secretary he denied knowing about the disk. Hall testified that it was not until he elevated his voice and became upset, stating \u201c[t]he disk that you took from your secretary downstairs after you had written her a note telling her to, if there was anything [that] needed bagged because you had previously told her that the police were on the way, * * * that disk,\u201d that appellant acknowledged knowing about the disk. After retrieving the disk from his jacket, appellant gave it to Hall. It is undisputed that neither a warrant nor a subpoena was issued for the disk.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">{\u00b6 20} Appellant testified that he took the disk only to see what was on it and that he was not going to keep it or attempt to impair the investigation. Appellant stated that he was going to give the disk to the police after he looked at its contents. Appellant also testified that he thought it was unreasonable for the police to take documents based on his secretary\u2019s phone call that said he was trying to hide information. On cross-examination, Sergeant Hall testified that he had filed a grievance over vacation pay and that he was in negotiations with the city as a union representative, but he denied appellant\u2019s allegations that the investigation was the result of bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Assignment of Error Number Two</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cThe trial court erred in failing to grant the appellant\u2019s motion under Crim.R. 29(A) for judgment of acquittal on the counts alleging tampering with evidence, as proscribed by [R.C. 2921.12(A)(1) ].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">Assignment of Error Number Three</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cThe conviction of tampering with evidence, as proscribed by [R.C. 2921.12(A)(1) ], is against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">{\u00b6 23} In his second assignment of error, appellant has asserted that the trial court erred in denying his motion under Crim.R. 29(A) because the evidence was not sufficient to support a conviction for tampering with evidence. In his third assignment of error, appellant has argued that the conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-11\">{\u00b6 24} As this court discussed in considering appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, Crim.R. 29(A) requires a trial court to enter a judgment of acquittal if the evidence is insufficient to support a conviction for the offense. \u201cWhile the test for sufficiency requires a determination of whether the state has met its burden of production at trial, a manifest weight challenge questions whether the state has met its burden of persuasion.\u201d <em>State v. Gulley </em>(Mar. 15, 2000), 9th Dist. No. 19600, at 3, 2000 WL 277908.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>{\u00b6 25} In determining whether a conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence, this court must \u201creview the entire record, weigh the evidence and all reasonable inferences, consider the credibility of witnesses and determine whether, in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the trier of fact clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.\u201d <em>State v. Otten </em>(1986), 33 Ohio App.3d 339, 340, 515 N.E.2d 1009.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">{\u00b6 26} When an appellate court reverses based on manifest weight, it acts in effect as a \u201cthirteenth juror,\u201d setting aside the resolution of testimony and evidence as found by the trier of fact. <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541. This action is reserved for the exceptional case where the evidence presented weighs heavily in favor of the defendant. <em>Otten, </em>33 Ohio App.3d at 340, 515 N.E.2d 1009. \u201cA conviction is not against the manifest weight of the evidence merely because there is conflicting evidence before the trier of fact.\u201d <em>State v. Haydon </em>(Dec. 22, 1999), 9th Dist. No. 19094, at 14, 1999 WL 1260298, appeal not allowed (2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 1482, 727 N.E.2d 132. Additionally, it is well established that \u201cthe weight to be given the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses are primarily for the trier of the facts.\u201d <em>State v. DeHass </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 39 O.O.2d 366, 227 N.E.2d 212, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">{\u00b627} Appellant was convicted of two counts of tampering with evidence under R.C. 2921.12. Pursuant to R.C. 2921.12(A)(1):</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cNo person, knowing that an official proceeding or investigation is in progress, or is about to be or likely to be instituted, shall do any of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">{\u00b6 29} \u201c(1) Alter, destroy, conceal, or remove any record, document, or thing, with purpose to impair its value or availability as evidence in such proceeding or investigation[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">{\u00b6 30} This court cannot conclude that, given the evidence before it, the jury created a manifest miscarriage of justice such that appellant\u2019s convictions must be reversed. After careful review of the entire record, weighing the evidence and all reasonable inferences, this court finds that the jury did not lose its way when it found that appellant tampered with evidence when, knowing that the police and/or prosecutor planned on visiting his office to collect documents relating to his charity and campaign finance, appellant took a computer disk from his secretary and placed it in his jacket pocket. The jury was in the best position to listen to and view the witnesses and adjudge their credibility to determine that appellant knowingly removed and concealed a \u201crecord, document, or thing\u201d with the purpose to either impair its value or availability as evidence in an investigation or official proceeding. Based on the foregoing, this court cannot find that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>appellant\u2019s conviction for tampering with evidence was against the manifest weight of the evidence. Therefore, appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">{\u00b6 31} This court has previously noted that \u201c[bjecause <em>sufficiency </em>is required to take a case to the jury, a finding that a conviction is supported by the <em>weight </em>of the evidence must necessarily include a finding of sufficiency. Thus, a determination that [a] conviction is supported by the weight of the evidence will also be dispositive of the issue of sufficiency.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>State v. Roberts </em>(Sept. 17, 1997), 9th Dist. No. 96CA006462, at 4, 1997 WL 600669. Accordingly, having found that appellant\u2019s conviction for tampering with evidence was not against the manifest weight of the evidence, this court need not discuss further his challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. Therefore, appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Assignment of Error Number Four</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cThe trial court erred in failing to grant the appellant\u2019s motion under Crim.R. 29(A) for judgment of acquittal on the counts alleging complicity with tampering with evidence, as proscribed by [R.C. 2921.12(A)(1)], in that the evidence was not legally sufficient to support a conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">{\u00b6 33} In his fourth assignment of error, appellant has argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion under Crim.R. 29(A) because there was not sufficient evidence to convict him of complicity to tampering with evidence. Appellant has asserted that he cannot be convicted of complicity without an accomplice. This court disagrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">{\u00b6 34} As previously discussed, in order to grant an acquittal under Crim. R. 29(A) the record must show that no rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt. R.C. 2923.03(A)(1) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cNo person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">{\u00b6 36} \u201c(1) Solicit or procure another to commit the offense[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-11\">{\u00b6 37} Therefore, this court must determine whether any rational trier of fact could have found that appellant solicited or procured another to tamper with evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-12\">{\u00b6 38} This court finds that any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of complicity to tampering with evidence proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Any rational trier of fact could view appellant\u2019s actions and comments towards his secretary regarding the disk as solicitation to destroy, alter, conceal, or remove evidence. It is undisputed that appellant asked his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>secretary whether there was anything they should be concerned about the police seeing and that should be \u201cbagged.\u201d She showed him the disk and he placed it in his jacket. Therefore, based on appellant\u2019s behavior towards his secretary, sufficient evidence existed to support a conviction. Further, appellant\u2019s argument that he cannot be convicted of complicity without an accomplice is without merit. Pursuant to R.C. 2923.03(B), \u201c[i]t is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.\u201d Accordingly, appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Assignment of Error Number Five</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cThe convictions for tampering with evidence and complicity with tampering with evidence should have been merged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">{\u00b6 40} In his fifth assignment of error, appellant has claimed that his convictions for tampering with evidence and complicity to tampering with evidence should have been merged because the offenses are the same and he can be sentenced for only one of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">{\u00b6 41} The Double Jeopardy Clauses of the United States and Ohio Constitutions protect criminal defendants from multiple punishments for the same offense. <em>State v. Rance </em>(1999), <em>85 </em>Ohio St.3d 632, 634, 710 N.E.2d 699. R.C. 2941.25 reinforces the principles and concepts contained in the Double Jeopardy Clause. See <em>State v. Fields </em>(Aug. 9, 2000), 9th Dist. No. 99CA0062, at 8, 2000 WL 1124071, appeal not allowed (2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 1489, 739 N.E.2d 815. R.C. 2941.25 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">{\u00b6 42} \u201c(A) Where the same conduct by defendant can be construed to constitute two or more allied offenses of similar import, the indictment or information may contain counts for all such offenses, but the defendant may be convicted of only one.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-12\">{\u00b6 43} \u201c(B) Where the defendant\u2019s conduct constitutes two or more offenses of dissimilar import, or where his conduct results in two or more offenses of the same or similar kind committed separately or with a separate animus as to each, the indictment or information may contain counts for all such offenses, and the defendant may be convicted of all of them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-13\">{\u00b6 44} Crimes are allied offenses of similar import if the elements of the crimes \u201c \u2018correspond to such a degree that the commission of one crime will result in the commission of the other}.]\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Jones </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 12, 13, 676 N.E.2d 80, quoting <em>State v. Blankenship </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 116, 526 N.E.2d 816. If the elements do not so correspond, the offenses are. of dissimilar import and the court\u2019s inquiry ends and the multiple convictions are permitted. R.C. 2941.25(B); See <em>State v. Nixon </em>(Apr. 25, 2001), 9th Dist. Nos. 00CA007638 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>and 00CA007624, at 23-24, 2001 WL 422885. Further, when comparing the elements of the offenses, the \u201celements should be compared in the statutory abstract.\u201d <em>Rance, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 637, 710 N.E.2d 699.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">{\u00b6 45} Accordingly, this court must first determine whether, in the abstract, the elements of tampering with evidence and complicity to tampering with evidence correspond to such a degree that the commission of one crime will result in the commission of the other, and therefore, the crimes are of similar import. <em>Rance, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 636, 710 N.E.2d 699. If they are offenses of similar import, then this Court must determine whether appellant committed those offenses separately or with a separate animus. Id. If the tampering with evidence and complicity to tampering with evidence were committed separately or with a separate animus, then appellant can be punished for both. R.C. 2941.25(B); <em>Jones, </em>78 Ohio St.3d at 13-14, 676 N.E.2d 80. \u201cNo one factor is dispositive in determining whether there were separate acts or animi.\u201d <em>Nixon </em>at 24, citing <em>Jones, </em>78 Ohio St.3d at 14, 676 N.E.2d 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">{\u00b6 46} This court finds that appellant\u2019s motion to merge the convictions for tampering with evidence and complicity to tampering with evidence was properly denied. Tampering with evidence involves the defendant <em>personally </em>altering, destroying, concealing, or removing a record, document, or thing. Complicity to tampering with evidence entails a defendant soliciting or procuring <em>another person </em>to tamper with evidence. A review of the offenses establishes that the elements constituting tampering with evidence are different than the elements constituting complicity to tampering with evidence. There can be tampering with evidence without complicity to tampering with evidence and vice versa; the commission of the one offense is not incidental to the commission of the other. Once the defendant solicits another person to tamper with evidence, the complicity to tamper with evidence is complete. A defendant\u2019s subsequent conduct that gives rise to a different charge is a separately identifiable crime. Therefore, tampering with evidence and complicity to tampering with evidence are of a dissimilar import and appellant was properly convicted of both crimes. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s fifth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">Evidence of Other Acts</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">{\u00b6 47} During its opening statement, the state presented its case by discussing the many facts of the case, the eleven charges that were against appellant, and its arguments concerning appellant\u2019s guilt. The state commented on the issue of public versus private records and maintaining campaign records on a city computer, but then told the jury that it would not have to address such an issue. Appellant objected to the state\u2019s comments. The court overruled the objection and informed the jury that the state was only presenting its arguments and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>the statements were not to be taken as fact or evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt. The state continued its opening statement by clarifying that its comments were made in relation to records involved in the theft and tampering with evidence charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">{\u00b6 48} During the state\u2019s examination of appellant\u2019s secretary, it asked her about using city time on a city computer for campaign purposes. Appellant objected and the examination continued without a ruling from the court. The state also asked a city worker about city employees and campaign fund functions. Appellant objected and the court overruled the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">{\u00b6 49} While questioning Mr. Hamilton, a city worker, about campaign signs, the state asked him whether he was paid to put signs together on city time. Appellant objected and the court instructed the jury that putting campaign signs together on city time was not a charge in this case and therefore they should not consider the statements as evidence. A discussion was then held in chambers outside the hearing of the jury. After voicing his objection, appellant requested a mistrial. The state responded that it was presenting the issue in response to appellant\u2019s argument that the case was based on vindictive prosecution. The state argued that it was only showing that other charges could have been brought. The court sustained appellant\u2019s objection, denied appellant\u2019s request for a mistrial, and gave the following instruction to the jury:</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">{\u00b6 50} \u201cLadies and gentlemen, as I was about to say before, we are here concerned with certain specific charges and whether there is or is not any basis for any other complaint is not before you and you should not consider it, so whatever was said here regarding any other activities that are not part of these charges, you should disregard and give no attention or weight for any purpose whatever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">{\u00b6 51} At the close of the case, appellant renewed his objections to the state\u2019s questions regarding \u201cother acts.\u201d Specifically, in order to preserve the record, appellant objected to the state\u2019s questioning appellant about having campaign material on a city computer and working on his campaign at City Hall. Appellant argued that such questioning tainted the jury. The court responded that it had overruled the objection and explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">{\u00b6 52} \u201cThe Court concluded that under Evidence Rule 404(B) and under Evidence Rule 403, that the evidence that you\u2019re concerned with was potentially relevant to counts six, seven, nine, and ten, those having to do with tampering with evidence and complicity to tampering with evidence, inasmuch as they would reflect upon the state of mind of Defendant Urbin. Further, the Court concluded that the probative weight of those was not substantially outweighed by it\u2019s [sic] prejudicial evidence effect under the circumstances of this case and, therefore, the Court permitted that evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Assignment of Error Number Six</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">{\u00b6 53} \u201cThe trial court erred in allowing the prosecuting attorney, over objection, to introduce evidence of other acts and crimes not specified in the indictment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">{\u00b6 54} In his sixth assignment of error, appellant has argued that the trial court erred in admitting evidence relating to other acts committed by appellant. Appellant has asserted that the trial court allowed the state to introduce improper evidence relating to his charity work and campaigning.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">{\u00b6 55} \u201cA trial court enjoys broad discretion in the admission and exclusion of evidence and will not be reversed absent a clear abuse of discretion which materially prejudiced the objecting party.\u201d <em>State v. Smith </em>(Nov. 8, 2000), 9th Dist. No. 99CA007399, at 6-7, 2000 WL 1675052, citing <em>Williams v. Oeder </em>(1995), 103 Ohio App.3d 333, 341, 659 N.E.2d 379, appeal not allowed (1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 1422, 655 N.E.2d 741. An abuse of discretion connotes an attitude on the part of the trial court that is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>State v. Adams </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 157, 16 O.O.3d 169, 404 N.E.2d 144. When applying the abuse-of-discretion standard, an appellate court may not substitute its judgment for that of the trial court. <em>Pons v. Ohio State Med. Bd. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 619, 621, 614 N.E.2d 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">{\u00b6 56} Evid.R. 404(B) governs the admissibility of other acts evidence:</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">{\u00b6 57} \u201cEvidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">{\u00b6 58} \u201c[T]he improper use of other-acts evidence necessitates reversal when there is a \u2018reasonable possibility that the testimony contributed to the accused\u2019s conviction.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Treesh </em>(2001), 90 Ohio St.3d 460, 483, 739 N.E.2d 749, certiorari denied (2001), 533 U.S. 904, 121 S.Ct. 2247, 150 L.Ed.2d 234, quoting <em>State v. Lytle </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St.2d 391, 2 O.O.3d 495, 358 N.E.2d 623.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">{\u00b6 59} This court finds that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing limited testimony concerning appellant\u2019s charity work and campaign finance. The trial court properly instructed the jury to disregard the questions, statements, and testimony that were not proper under Evid.R. 404. The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it determined that the other acts testimony concerning appellant\u2019s charity work and campaigning were admissible under Evid.R. 404 as possible proof of motive or intent for appellant\u2019s three tampering with evidence charges. This Court cannot find a reasonable possibility that the limited other acts testimony contributed to appellant\u2019s convictions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>especially since appellant was found not guilty of other charges that related to the other acts testimony. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s sixth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">Prosecutorial Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">{\u00b6 60} A review of the transcript shows that both counsel for the state and appellant used various trial tactics and questioning techniques to argue their cases to the jury. While conducting the cross-examination of appellant, the prosecutor stated, \u201cSome people think that there\u2019s a concept called \u2018surgical avoidance of a question\u2019 by shifting the answer slightly to another topic as a sign of deception.\u201d The trial court responded by sustaining an objection. The state continued its cross, asking appellant \u201cAre you doing that to me sir?\u201d After appellant asked the trial court if he should answer, the court reminded the parties that arguments are not appropriate in asking or answering questions. The issue arose again in appellant\u2019s cross-examination when the prosecutor stated, \u201cSo, again, you\u2019ve avoided my question by substituting something else.\u201d The defense objected and the trial court sustained the objection. The trial court again reminded the parties to not to make comments and just ask questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">{\u00b6 61} Later in appellant\u2019s cross-examination, the state asked \u201cDid you see your lawyers ask the Judge to throw these charges out based on legal grounds?\u201d The court quickly informed the jury to disregard the question and defense counsel asked for a sidebar, which was conducted in the judge\u2019s chambers. The defense formally objected to the state\u2019s question and requested a mistrial or a curative instruction. The state argued that its question was \u201ca fair response to the entire defense tactic of this case and [encouraged] the Court to explain [to the jury] everybody\u2019s role\u201d in the case. The court found that since the witness did not answer the question, \u201cthe prejudice that could result otherwise [was] not as great.\u201d The court denied the mistrial but gave the following curative instruction:</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">{\u00b6 62} \u201cBy your oath you agree that you will accept and apply the Judge\u2019s instructions about the rules of law. Jurors are not permitted to change the law, nor are they permitted to apply their own concept of what they think the law should be. On the other hand, the Judge has no authority to decide which witnesses to believe or which version of a disputed event is true. Therefore, you should disregard any impression you may have about the Judge\u2019s view of the facts. I\u2019ve also instructed you, you are the sole judges of the facts and the weight of the evidence. And then I added, to weigh the evidence you must consider the credibility of the witnesses. To the extent that any question or any comment by any witness suggests that I have a view as to which version of disputed facts is correct, they are wrong. I have no such view. I don\u2019t have authority to have a view and I don\u2019t have such a view. That\u2019s your job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ao-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>{\u00b6 63} Appellant was not asked any further questions concerning his use of trial counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">{\u00b6 64} During its closing argument, the state argued that its case was not vindictive or all-inclusive by charging appellant with every conceivable crime. The state argued that appellant admitted to several other improprieties, such as campaigning on city time and using city workers and equipment during city time for campaign purposes, and he was not charged as a result of those acts. Near the end of its closing argument, the state said:</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">{\u00b6 65} \u201cI did spend one-third of my opening refuting the falsehoods cast by the defense. Unfortunately, that seems to be at least half, if not more, of Defendant Urbin\u2019s defense, so do not take these attacks lightly. We think they\u2019re improper, but yet they\u2019re here and it\u2019s something that has be dealt with. In fact, the fact that I didn\u2019t wait for him to do it first does not mean I don\u2019t believe in my case, my cause or my sergeant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">{\u00b6 66} The defense objected to the state\u2019s use of the term \u201cI.\u201d The court responded by instructing the jury that \u201cnone of the lawyers are permitted to express their opinions about the case. They can express their opinions about the evidence in the case. There is a difference.\u201d The state then concluded its closing. While discussing the admissibility of evidence to the jury, the defense requested a mistrial because of the state\u2019s expression of its personal beliefs. The court again overruled the objection and denied the mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">Assignment of Error Number Seven</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">{\u00b6 67} \u201cAppellant was denied his right to a fair trial by the misconduct of the prosecuting attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">{\u00b6 68} In his seventh and final assignment of error, appellant has asserted that the prosecutor\u2019s behavior during the trial constituted prosecutorial misconduct. Specifically, appellant has contended that the following incidents establish prosecutorial misconduct: 1) the improper introduction of prior bad acts and character evidence, 2) vouching for the veracity of the lead investigator in the state\u2019s closing argument, 3) improperly commenting on appellant\u2019s method of responding to questions, and 4) improperly commenting on appellant\u2019s use of trial counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">{\u00b6 69} In <em>State v. Lott </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 555 N.E.2d 293, the Ohio Supreme Court addressed the limited scope within which a judgment may be reversed on grounds of prosecutorial misconduct, stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b344-11\">{\u00b6 70} \u201c \u2018[T]he touchstone of due process analysis in cases of alleged prosecu-torial misconduct is the fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor. * * * [Gjiven the myriad safeguards provided to assure a fair trial, and taking into account the reality of the human fallibility of the participants, there can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>no such thing as an error-free, perfect trial, and that the Constitution does not guarantee such a trial. [I]t is the duty of a reviewing court to consider the trial record as a whole and to ignore errors that are harmless including most constitutional violations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lott, </em>51 Ohio St.3d at 166, 555 N.E.2d 293, quoting <em>United States v. Hasting </em>(1983), 461 U.S. 499, 508-509, 103 S.Ct. 1974, 76 L.Ed.2d 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">{\u00b6 71} Accordingly, a judgment can be reversed on grounds of prosecutorial misconduct only where the improper conduct deprived the defendant of a fan-trial. <em>State v. Carter </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 545, 557, 651 N.E.2d 965; see, also, <em>State v. Maurer </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 239, 266, 15 OBR 379, 473 N.E.2d 768, certiorari denied (1985), 472 U.S. 1012, 105 S.Ct. 2714, 86 L.Ed.2d 728.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">{\u00b6 72} To determine whether the prosecutor\u2019s comments rise to the level of prosecutorial misconduct, this court must decide whether the remarks were improper, and, if they were, whether they prejudicially affected the substantial rights of the defendant. <em>State v. Smith </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St.3d 13, 15, 14 OBR 317, 470 N.E.2d 883. Even if the question or comment is improper, the verdict will not be overturned unless the defendant was actually prejudiced by the impropriety. <em>Lott, </em>51 Ohio St.3d at 165, 555 N.E.2d 293. \u201cIsolated comments by a prosecutor are not to be taken out of context and given their most damaging meaning.\u201d <em>State v. Hill </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 195, 204, 661 N.E.2d 1068, citing <em>Donnelly v. DeChristoforo </em>(1974), 416 U.S. 637, 647, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 40 L.Ed.2d 431. \u201c[I]t must be clear beyond a reasonable doubt that, absent the prosecutor\u2019s comments, the jury would have found defendant guilty.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>14 Ohio St.3d at 15, 14 OBR 317, 470 N.E.2d 883.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">{\u00b6 73} This court finds that the prosecutor\u2019s behavior did not deny appellant a fair trial. First, appellant\u2019s contention that the questions concerning other acts constituted prosecutorial misconduct is without merit. As discussed in appellant\u2019s sixth assignment of error, the trial court properly addressed the prosecutor\u2019s questions regarding appellant\u2019s other acts and this court will not review the issue further. Second, the prosecutor did not engage in prosecutorial misconduct when he questioned appellant and suggested that he was attempting to avoid answering questions. This court finds that in the case sub judice, the prosecutor\u2019s two attempts to elicit firm answers from appellant were questioning techniques, which did not constitute improper behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">{\u00b6 74} While two of the prosecutor\u2019s questions/comments were improper, it has not been established that they prejudicially affected appellant. Appellant\u2019s claim of prosecutorial misconduct based on the prosecutor expressing his personal belief is without merit. WTiile the prosecutor\u2019s use of \u201cI\u201d in his closing argument was improper, the entire closing argument must be reviewed in order to determine whether the remarks objected to were prejudicial. <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number><em>Loza </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 61, 79, 641 N.E.2d 1082. After careful review of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, this court finds that, in the context of the entire closing argument and the evidence against appellant and in light of the trial court\u2019s admonition to the jury that lawyers cannot express their personal opinions about a case, appellant was not prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">{\u00b6 75} Appellant\u2019s final claim of prosecutorial misconduct is not well taken. The prosecutor\u2019s question concerning appellant\u2019s use of his trial counsel was improper, but appellant has not established that it prejudicially affected him. After the question, the trial court gave a curative instruction on the duties of the jury and judge, specifically pointing out the jury\u2019s duty to disregard comments suggesting the judge has made a decision on the case or formed an opinion of the case. The record establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that even without the prosecutor\u2019s improper questions the jury would have found appellant guilty. Further, appellant has failed to show that any actions by the prosecutor denied him a fair trial. Based on the foregoing, appellant\u2019s seventh assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">{\u00b6 76} Appellant\u2019s seven assignments of error are overrated. The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b346-8\">Slaby, P.J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b346-9\">Carr, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b332-10\">.

This court notes that the jury instruction mistakenly contains the term \"improper interest\u201d in relation to the mayor's brother. While appellant did object to the elements in the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>court\u2019s interest instruction at trial, he did not object to the \u201cimproper interest\u201d phrase; therefore the issue is waived on appeal. Moreover, the error does not constitute plain error under Crim.R. 52(A) because it did not affect appellant\u2019s substantial rights. The record establishes that the jury properly understood the definition of \"interest\u201d in the trial court\u2019s jury instruction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
