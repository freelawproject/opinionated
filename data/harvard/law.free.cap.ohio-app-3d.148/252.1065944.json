Geggiee, a.k.a. Geggie, administrator of the estate of Richard Worstine, appeals from the judgment of the Common Pleas Court of Hancock County granting summary judgment in favor of the defendant-appellee, Cooper Tire &amp; Rubber Company (\u201cCooper Tire\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">{\u00b6 2} The appellant\u2019s father, Richard, was employed by Cooper Tire as a laborer. Part of Richard\u2019s job duties included operating a tire-building machine. While running the machine on July 14,1999, Richard was crushed by the machine and subsequently died as a result of the injuries two days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">{\u00b6 3} In her complaint, the appellant alleged:</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">{\u00b6 4} \u201c5. As a result of plaintiffs decedent\u2019s job duties involving the tire building machine, decedent\u2019s injury and death were substantially certain to occur for the following reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cA. Plaintiffs decedent was required as part of his job duties to repetitively enter a zone having a hazard of crushing.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cB. Plaintiffs decedent\u2019s machine had an unguarded pedal which, if pressed, would cause the machine to repetitively cycle and trap him while he was within the zone of operation thereby creating a risk of being crushed.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cC. The machine on which plaintiff was required to work failed to have a properly operating shut-off mechanism within reach so that plaintiffs decedent could shut off the machine if he were caught in the machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-12\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cD. The machine on which plaintiff was required to work failed to have a properly operating shut-off mechanism which would have permitted others to shut off the machine so that plaintiffs decedent could be removed from the machine once he had been injured. As a result of the failure the machine continued to crush plaintiffs decedent until his injuries became fatal, even after others discovered his situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-13\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cD [sic]. The failure to properly maintain and appropriately guard the machine as set forth in paragraph [sic] A through D, <em>supra, </em>caused the injury and/or death to be substantially certain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-14\">{\u00b6 10} Together with the complaint, appellant also filed a request for production of documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-15\">{\u00b6 11} Cooper Tire thereafter filed a Civ.R. 12(C) motion for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the complaint contains no operative facts to support a claim against an employer for a workplace intentional tort. In response to Cooper Tire\u2019s motion, appellant filed a memorandum that, among other arguments, maintains that Cooper Tire failed to respond to discovery. After considering the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>applicable Ohio case law, the trial court granted the motion in favor of Cooper Tire.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">{\u00b6 12} The appellant now appeals from the judgment of the trial court and asserts the following two assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">\n<em>ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR I</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cThe Court erroneously dismissed a complaint which pled facts which, if proven, would establish a workplace intentional tort.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR II</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cThe Court erroneously dismissed appellant\u2019s complaint when the employer substantially hindered the investigation of an intentional tort claim, by not viewing liberally the facts establishing the intentional tort claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">{\u00b6 15} In its opinion and judgment entry granting summary judgment in favor of Cooper Tire, the trial court thoroughly addressed the arguments raised by the appellant\u2019s assignments of error. The appellant\u2019s complaint fails to establish \u201cintent,\u201d as explained by <em>Fyffe v. Jeno\u2019s, Inc.,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>for the purpose of proving the existence of an intentional tort committed by an employer against an employee. Accordingly, upon the reasoning set forth in the trial court\u2019s opinion and judgment entry filed March 12, 2001, in that court and attached hereto as an appendix, we overrule both of the appellant\u2019s assignments of error and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">{\u00b6 16} It is therefore ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the opinion and judgment entry of the common pleas court filed on March 12, 2001, be, and they hereby are adopted and incorporated into this opinion and that a copy of same shall be attached hereto and made a part hereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">{\u00b6 17} Having found no error prejudicial to the appellant herein, in the particulars assigned and argued, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-12\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b290-13\">Shaw and Thomas F. Bryant, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"b291-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b290-14\">.
