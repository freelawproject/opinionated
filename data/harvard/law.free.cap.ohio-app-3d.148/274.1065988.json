Corrigan, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b310-19\">{\u00b6 1} A jury found defendant Carlos Smith guilty of preparing drugs for sale and possession of drugs, after hearing testimony from two police officers who saw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>the defendant pass a plastic bag containing crack cocaine to another man, Clarence Jones. Jones had been indicted with the defendant, and they were scheduled to be tried together. After strongly insisting that he had nothing to do with the drugs found, Jones decided to plead guilty just after the jury had been sworn but before any testimony had been taken. Because Jones had been present throughout voir dire, the court noted Jones\u2019s absence to the jury and told it that Jones had pleaded guilty and was no longer a part of the case. In this appeal, the defendant raises several issues relating to the court\u2019s comment that Jones pleaded guilty, as well as the state\u2019s decision to comment on Jones\u2019s absence from trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">{\u00b6 2} It is a long-standing rule that information that a co-defendant has pleaded guilty to or has been convicted of an offense stemming from the same facts or circumstances forming the basis of a prosecution against another is inadmissible as proof against the other. See <em>Kazer v. Ohio </em>(1831), 5 Ohio 280, 281-282, 1831 WL 97. This is because evidence that another pleaded guilty to or was convicted of an offense stemming from the same facts or circumstances is not necessarily evidence that the other committed the same offense. In <em>United States v. Gambino </em>(C.A.3, 1991), 926 F.2d 1355, 1363, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals quoted <em>Bisaccia v. New Jersey Atty. Gen. </em>(C.A.3, 1980), 623 F.2d 307, 312, and <em>United States v. Toner </em>(C.A.3, 1949), 173 F.2d 140, 142, and stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">{\u00b6 3} \u201c \u2018There are strong considerations against using a co-conspirator\u2019s guilt as substantive evidence of another defendant\u2019s guilt. \u201cThe foundation of [this] policy is the right of every defendant to stand or fall with the proof of the charge made against him, not against somebody else * * *. The defendant has a right to have his guilt or innocence determined by the evidence presented against him, not by what has happened with regard to a criminal prosecution against someone else.\u201d \u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">{\u00b6 4} This is not to say that evidence of a co-defendant\u2019s guilty plea is never admissible. In some circumstances, evidence of a co-defendant\u2019s guilty plea may go to the jury if its use is limited to other purposes such as impeachment, see, e.g., <em>United States v. King </em>(C.A.5, 1974), 505 F.2d 602, or to show that the state has nothing to hide in its plea agreements. See, e.g., <em>United States v. Hilton </em>(C.A.11, 1985), 772 F.2d 783, 787. See, generally, Carlson, Evidentiary Issues in Criminal Cases: Admissibility of Plea Agreements on Direct Examination \u2014 Are There Any Limits? (2001), U.Miami L.Rev. 707, 712-715. The test most often used to determine the admissibility of a co-defendant\u2019s guilty plea was set forth in <em>United States v. Casto </em>(C.A.5, 1989), 889 F.2d 562, 567, and requires the court to consider (1) whether a limiting instruction was given, (2) whether there was a proper purpose in introducing the fact of the guilty plea, (3) whether the plea was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>improperly emphasized or used as substantive evidence of guilt, and (4) whether the introduction of the plea was invited by defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">{\u00b6 5} After co-defendant Jones pleaded guilty, the court went on the record with counsel outside the jury\u2019s hearing. The court noted that \u201c[w]e have to explain the absence of the other guy [Jones]. I will say he pled guilty.\u201d Defense counsel responded, \u201cI\u2019m going to talk about it in opening.\u201d The court brought the jury back in and said:</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cInitially, I can tell that you have all observed that Mr. Kelly and his client, Mr. Jones, are no longer present in the Courtroom. This is because Mr. Jones decided to enter a plea of guilty, as offered to him by the State of Ohio over the luncheon recess.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">{'\u00b6 7} \u201cAs we go through this trial, you will hear further instructions from the Court on how to treat that fact, as it relates to any other issues which you will be called upon to decide, but at this time that is all you really need to know and that is all I am going to instruct you on at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">(\u00b6 8} \u201cWe will continue with the trial to determine the guilt or innocence of the remaining Defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">{\u00b6 9} In its opening statement to the jury, the state told the jury:</p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cNow, as the Judge has told you, Mr. Jones pled guilty just before you came out here today, this afternoon. He pled guilty to Possession of Drugs, the felony of the fourth degree that he was indicted for. That does not relieve this Defendant of responsibility in this case. He still faces the two charges, the Preparation of Drugs for Sale and the Possession of Drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-11\">{HU} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b312-12\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c* * * The fact that one Defendant has pled guilty does not negate this case, does not relieve this Defendant of responsibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-13\">{\u00b6 13} Defense counsel likewise mentioned Jones\u2019s guilty plea and established the defense theory that Jones alone was responsible for any drug activity that occurred at the time of arrest:</p>\n<p id=\"b312-14\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cVery briefly, folks, I think what the evidence is going to show you in this case is that Mr. Jones, as the Prosecutor just pointed out to you, just pled guilty to the drugs. He has finally admitted today that the drugs were his. He told the Judge that and he has admitted to the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-15\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cMR. FISHER: Objection, your honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-16\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cMR. GREENE: I believe the evidence is going to show you that.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-17\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cTHE COURT: Sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>{\u00b6 18} \u201cMR. GREENE: My client, as I talked to you about in voir dire, steadfastly denies, as he stands before you, that he had the drugs or had anything to do with the drugs. * * * I think that you will see that my client did not have anything to do with the cocaine that Mr. Jones had on him, that he has admitted to, and that should be the end of the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">{\u00b6 19} In the interval between the close of the state\u2019s case-in-chief and the defendant\u2019s case, the defense informed the court that it intended to call Jones as a defense witness. The court noted that it would contact Jones\u2019s attorney because \u201c[h]e\u2019s going to be incriminating himself.\u201d When defense counsel said that Jones had already incriminated himself, the court disagreed, saying:</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cWell, he hasn\u2019t really yet, Mr. Greene. You know, he stood up in this Court this morning and told me they weren\u2019t his drugs and he did not want to plead. Then he enters a plea, which many people do when they are not guilty, because of the risk of exposure. * * * Now from his presence, I assume what you are telling me is he was taking the plea and it\u2019s all his and that he has nothing to do with this other co-defendant. * * * Otherwise, he would have no reason to stand up here. He would be incriminating himself, in front of me, because I\u2019m the sentencing Judge. * * * Because he\u2019s now flip-flopped around three different times. I think he needs an attorney to discuss this with him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">{\u00b6 21} The court recessed to give defense counsel a chance to call Jones\u2019s attorney. When the court reconvened, it asked defense counsel how many witnesses the defense would present. Counsel replied, \u201cjust one\u201d and proceeded to present the defendant as the sole defense witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">{\u00b6 22} After trial, the defendant obtained new counsel and filed a motion for a new trial on grounds that trial counsel performed ineffectively by failing to subpoena Jones as a witness. The court denied the motion. Appended to the motion was this affidavit by Jones:</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cTo whom it concern the drugs that was found was not Carlos Smith he did not know about them he is not guilty of having any drugs only me and I plead[ed] guilty already the case should be dismissed my lawyer would not let me testify at Carlos trial. [Sic.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">{\u00b6 24} The defendant first argues that the court erred by failing to instruct the jury that evidence of Jones\u2019s guilty plea could not be considered as substantive evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">{\u00b6 25} There is a consensus that the court should make a limiting instruction to the jury when notifying the jury that a co-defendant has pleaded guilty and is no longer part of the case. <em>United States v. Baez </em>(C.A.10, 1983), 703 F.2d 453, 455 (\u201c[C]autionary instructions limiting the jury\u2019s use of the plea to permissible purposes are critical.\u201d). However, there is no clear consensus as to what kind of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>instruction the court should give. In <em>United States v. Halbert </em>(C.A.9, 1981), 640 F.2d 1000, 1006-1007, the court found inadequate an instruction telling the jury that the disposition of two co-defendants\u2019 cases prior to trial \u201cshould not control or influence you in your verdict with reference to the remaining defendant, Mr. Halbert. You must base your verdict as to him solely on the evidence presented to you in this courtroom.\u201d Id. at 1006.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">{\u00b6 26} At the other end of the spectrum is <em>United States v. Johnson </em>(C.A.7, 1994), 26 F.3d 669, 676, in which the court noted that the following instruction adequately protected a defendant from a mention that several co-defendants had pleaded guilty:</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">{\u00b6 27} \u201c \u2018What the attorneys have said during the course of the trial and what they will say in their arguments to you, those statements are not evidence and may not be considered by the jury as evidence * * *. It is what the witnesses have said that\u2019s the evidence in this case * * *. But what the attorneys say is not evidence.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">{\u00b6 28} We do not have to choose in this case between these competing standards, for we must review the defendant\u2019s arguments for plain error as he did not object in any way whatsoever. Moreover, as pointed out by the state, the defendant not only did not object at a time when the court gave the opportunity to do so, but he told the court that he intended to use Jones\u2019s guilty plea as substantive evidence of his own innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">{\u00b6 29} Plain error results from an error of omission. It arises in circumstances where a party has failed to call an error to the court\u2019s attention at a time at which the error could be corrected, the error itself is obvious, and the error clearly affected the outcome of the trial. <em>State v. Nicholas </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 431, 436, 613 N.E.2d 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">{\u00b6 30} Our review of the applicable legal standards governing our review would not be complete unless we mentioned the invited error doctrine. Unlike plain error, \u201cinvited error\u201d is error of commission. The Ohio Supreme Court has held that invited error arises when a party tries to take advantage of an error that the party induced the trial court to make. <em>State ex rel. The V Cos. v. Marshall </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 467, 471, 692 N.E.2d 198. The invited error doctrine is applied when defense counsel is \u201cactively responsible\u201d for the trial court\u2019s error. <em>State v. Campbell </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 320, 324, 738 N.E.2d 1178.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">{\u00b6 31} In <em>United States v. King </em>(C.A.5, 1974), 505 F.2d 602, 607, the court made the following assessment of reviewing cases like this where a defendant failed to object to a mention that a co-defendant had pleaded guilty prior to trial:</p>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cIn assessing King\u2019s assertion of plain error in this case, then, we must carefully examine all the facts and circumstances of the case in their proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>context. The presence or absence of an instruction is an important factor, but it is also essential to consider other factors, such as whether there was a proper purpose in introducing the fact of the guilty plea, whether the plea was improperly emphasized or used as substantive evidence of guilt, whether the introduction of the plea was invited by defense counsel, whether an objection was entered or an instruction requested, whether the defendant\u2019s failure to object to the testimony could have been the result of tactical considerations, and whether, in light of all the evidence, the failure to give an instruction was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">{\u00b6 33} The record shows that the court and counsel conferred on how to inform the jury that Jones was no longer a part of the case. The court said that it would have to explain Jones\u2019s absence and would do so by telling the jury that he pleaded guilty. Defense counsel then replied, \u201cI\u2019m going to talk about it in opening.\u201d And talk about he did. Defense counsel laid out the strategy of using Jones\u2019s guilty plea as substantive proof in his opening statement by telling the jury that Jones had pleaded guilty and \u201che has finally admitted today that the drugs were his.\u201d Defense counsel went on to say that defendant did not have anything to do with the drugs and that Jones\u2019s guilty plea \u201cshould be the end of the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">{\u00b6 34} So the defendant not only failed to object at a time when the court asked for some input on how to inform the jury about Jones\u2019s absence from trial, he gave the court and counsel for the state every reason to think that he would affirmatively use Jones\u2019s conviction as substantive proof of his own innocence. In fact, the defendant told the court that he would be calling Jones as witness. Had Jones been called as a witness, the circumstances of his guilty plea no doubt would have laid before the jury. This would have been completely permissible. See <em>United, States v. Mealy </em>(C.A.7, 1988), 851 F.2d 890, 899.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">{\u00b6 35} As it turned out, Jones did not testify, and the defendant now claims that the court\u2019s involvement in that decision somehow violated his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation. We disagree, for the record does not suggest to us that the court barred Jones\u2019s testimony. In fact, the court had no objection in principle to Jones\u2019s testimony, subject only to giving Jones\u2019s attorney notice that Jones would be called as a witness. The court correctly acted to preserve Jones\u2019s right against self-incrimination, pointing out that while Jones had pleaded guilty, he had yet to be sentenced. Because Jones had initially maintained his innocence during the plea negotiations, the court was concerned that Jones might incriminate himself for sentencing purposes were he to take the witness stand and completely exculpate the defendant \u2014 hence, its insistence that Jones\u2019s attorney be notified.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>{\u00b6 86} We agree with the state that nothing in the record suggests that the court\u2019s act of ensuring a witness\u2019s constitutional rights should be viewed as impeding the defense. If the defendant truly believed that Jones could assist his case, he had the right to subpoena Jones and force him to invoke his right against self-incrimination in front of the jury. See <em>Columbus v. Cooper </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 42, 550 N.E.2d 937, paragraph one of the syllabus. Such a scenario might have been very helpful to the defendant, as Jones\u2019s silence in light of questions about his guilty plea might have reflected well on Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">{\u00b6 37} By making a strategic decision to comment on Jones\u2019s guilty plea, indeed using that guilty plea as substantive evidence of his own innocence, the defendant cannot be heard to complain that the court erred by failing to inform the jury that Jones\u2019s guilty plea could not be used as substantive evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt. He not only failed to object to the court\u2019s comment, but he actively prompted that comment by adopting a strategy that would use Jones\u2019s guilty plea to his own advantage. The defendant cannot have it both ways. We therefore find that the court did not err in any respect. The assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b316-6\">James D. Sweeney, P.J., concurs. \u2022</judges>\n<judges id=\"b316-7\">Diane Karpinski, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b316-8\">Karpinski, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AU\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">{\u00b6 38} I concur with the majority; however, I write to emphasize that the trial court should be giving a limiting instruction in the circumstance here. Moreover, we should offer a model. As Judge Brogan observed in a similar case from the Second District:</p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cThe jury should be instructed as to the \u2018limited\u2019 purpose for which they may consider the evidence that the witness has pleaded guilty to a crime which arose out of the same events for which defendant is on trial. See Model Jury Instruction, Eighth Circuit (1993), Sec. 2.19. The admission of such evidence without a limiting instruction is not reversible error if defense counsel does not request an instruction and if the evidence was introduced for a proper purpose.\u201d <em>State v. Clark </em>(May 4, 1994), Montgomery App. No. 13435, at * 26-27, 1994 WL 171223, following <em>Gerberding v. United States </em>(C.A.8, 1973), 471 F.2d 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-11\">{\u00b6 40} The model jury instruction of the Eighth Circuit states as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b316-12\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cYou have heard evidence that witness (name) has pleaded guilty to a crime which arose out of the same events for which the defendant is on trial here. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>You must not consider that guilty pleas as any evidence of this defendant\u2019s guilt. You may consider that witness\u2019s guilty plea only for the purpose of determining how much, if at all, to rely upon that witness\u2019s testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">{\u00b6 42} The Committee Comments following this instruction provide an explanation:</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cEvidence that a codefendant has pleaded guilty may not be used as substantive proof of a defendant\u2019s guilt. However, such evidence is admissible to impeach, to show the witness\u2019s acknowledgment of participation in the offense, or to reflect on his credibility. In such circumstance the jury should be instructed that the evidence is received for one or more of these purposes alone, and that the jurors are not to infer the guilt of the defendant. <em>United States v. Roth, </em>736 F.2d 1222, 1226 (8th Cir.) Cert. Denied. 469 U.S. 1058 [105 S.Ct. 541, 83 L.Ed.2d 429] (1984). See also <em>Gerberding v.
