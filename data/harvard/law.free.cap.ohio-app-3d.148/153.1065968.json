On appeal, Cohara claims that the court should have calculated interest from August 25, 1999 to March 8, 2001, because, he asserts, Consolidated failed to provide him with an appropriate release or a settlement check until the latter date. In a second appeal, which we consolidated for purposes of review, Cohara separately asserts that the trial court erred in denying his motion for relief from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">{\u00b6 2} Consolidated cross-appeals from the court\u2019s award of interest, arguing that Cohara breached the settlement agreement by failing to sign a release; it therefore maintains that Cohara is not entitled to interest on the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">{\u00b6 3} After reviewing these arguments, we have concluded that the court erred in denying Consolidated\u2019s motion for summary judgment and in awarding interest to Cohara. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-11\">{\u00b6 4} In this case, counsel stipulated to the pertinent facts, which are that on August 29, 1997, Cohara filed a complaint (case No. 339635) against Consolidated Rail Corporation, his employer, alleging violations of the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act and the Federal Safety Appliance Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-12\">{\u00b6 5} Conrail, Inc. is the sole owner of Consolidated Rail Corporation. In 1998, Norfolk Southern Railway Company and CSX Transportation, Inc. purchased Conrail. In the stipulations, the parties describe the relationship of these entities as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b190-13\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cSince June 1, 1999, portions of Conrail\u2019s assets have been separately operated by subsidiaries of Norfolk Southern Corporation and CSX Corporation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>That portion of Conrail assets not separately operated by Norfolk Southern Railway Company and CSX Transportation, Inc. is operated by Conrail on behalf of its owners, Norfolk Southern Corporation and CSX Corporation. On or about March 1, 1999, Norfolk Southern Corporation and CSX Transportation, Inc. assumed administrative responsibility for Conrail FELA claims and lawsuits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">{\u00b6 7} On May 9, 1999, the parties settled case No. 339635 for $150,000, and Consolidated prepared a release and submitted it to Cohara on May 13, 1999, in furtherance of the settlement. This release stated in relevant part that Cohara would \u201c* * * release and forever discharge the said <em>CONSOLIDATED RAIL CORPORATION, its predecessor, parent, affiliated and subsidiary companies or corporations </em>and any and all other parties, associations and corporations jointly or severally liable * * (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">{\u00b6 8} Cohara, however, expressed \u201cmisgivings about the settlement\u201d and subsequently decided to reject it. Accordingly, on May 20, 1999, he filed a motion to reinstate case No. 339635. Consolidated opposed his motion and, in addition, filed a motion to enforce the settlement agreement. On June 10, 1999, the court denied Cohara\u2019s motion to reinstate and, after conducting a hearing, granted Consolidated\u2019s motion to enforce the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">{\u00b6 9} Thereafter, on August 25,1999, Consolidated prepared a second release, which stated in part that Cohara would \u201c* * * release and forever discharge Norfolk Southern Railway Company, CSX Transportation, Inc. and Consolidated Rail Corporation, and * * * to the same extent as if expressly named, their respective parents, subsidiaries and affiliated companies, their leased and operated lines, and all other persons, firms and corporations, all of the respective predecessors, successors, assignees, lessors, officers, directors, agents and employees of the aforesaid released parties, past and present, as well as their heirs and legal representatives * *</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">{\u00b6 10} Cohara refused to sign this release on the basis that Norfolk Southern Railway Company and CSX Transportation, Inc. were not parties to his settlement agreement with Consolidated Rail Corporation and that he did not want to sign a release naming his current employer, CSX Transportation, Inc. Consolidated, in turn, refused to deliver the settlement check without a signed release.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">{\u00b6 11} Subsequently, on May 26, 2000, Consolidated agreed to remove Norfolk Southern Railway Company and CSX Transportation, Inc. from the release. At that point, Cohara demanded interest on the settlement and, on July 21, 2000, filed a second lawsuit (case No. 413549) against Consolidated Rail Corporation, claiming that Consolidated breached the original settlement agreement and praying for $150,000 plus prejudgment interest at 10 percent per annum.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>{\u00b6 12} The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment on Cohara\u2019s prejudgment interest claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">{\u00b6 13} On March 8, 2001, after briefing the issues, Consolidated issued another release, which discharged <em>\u201cCONSOLIDATED RAIL CORPORATION, its predecessors, parent, affiliated and subsidiary companies or corporations </em>and any and all other parties, associations and corporations jointly or severally liable * * (Emphasis added.) Cohara signed this release, which expressly left pending his claim for interest; with that understanding, Consolidated tendered the settlement check to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">{\u00b6 14} On March 14, 2001, the court denied Consolidated\u2019s motion for summary judgment and awarded Cohara interest from August 25, 1999, the date of the second release, until May 26, 2000, the date Consolidated agreed to remove the names of its parent companies from the release.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">{\u00b6 15} On March 22, 2001, Cohara filed a motion for relief from judgment, urging that interest should have been calculated through March 8, 2001, when Consolidated sent the final release. On April 6, 2001, with his Civ.R. 60(B) motion still pending, Cohara filed a notice of appeal. Consolidated filed a cross-appeal on April 12, 2001. Our court remanded this case to the trial court for its ruling on Cohara\u2019s motion for relief from judgment, which the court denied on June 14, 2001, returning Cohara\u2019s first appeal and Consolidated\u2019s cross-appeal to our court. Subsequently, Cohara filed a second appeal from the denial of his motion for relief from judgment, and we consolidated these appeals for purposes of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">{\u00b6 16} On appeal, Cohara raises two assignments of error for review. They state:</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cI. The trial court committed reversible error when it failed to award plaintiff interest on the settlement between the parties through March 8, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cII. The trial court committed reversible error when it failed to rule on plaintiffs motion for relief from judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-11\">{\u00b6 19} In its cross-appeal, Consolidated Rail Corporation raises one assignment of error for review. It states:</p>\n<p id=\"b192-12\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cThe trial court committed reversible error when it denied Conrail\u2019s motion for summary judgment and ruled that plaintiff was entitled to interest on the $150,000 settlement amount from August 25, 1999 until May 26, 2000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-13\">{\u00b6 21} We shall consider Consolidated\u2019s cross-appeal first because it is determinative of this case. On appeal, Consolidated argues that Cohara breached the settlement agreement by refusing to sign the original releases, that a court then had to order him to honor the agreement, that the releases it prepared subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>quent to the order to enforce the agreement were appropriate, and that it is therefore entitled to summary judgment on Cohara\u2019s claim for interest. Cohara does not explain his refusal to sign the first release but rejected the second one because it included two \u201cnon-parties\u201d to the settlement agreement and urges that he did not receive an appropriate release from Consolidated Rail until March 8, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">{\u00b6 22} In <em>Temple v. Wean United, Inc. </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 317, 327, 4 O.O.3d 466, 364 N.E.2d 267, the court set forth the following standard for summary judgment under Civ.R. 56(C):</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cCiv.R. 56(C) specifically provides that before summary judgment may be granted, it must be determined that: (1) No genuine issue as to any material fact remains to be litigated; (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and viewing such evidence most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, that conclusion is adverse to that party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">{\u00b6 24} Here, we are called upon to consider whether the trial court properly granted summary judgment to Cohara, whether it properly calculated interest, and whether it properly denied Consolidated\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Based on stipulation, no genuine issues of material fact exist; therefore, the only question before us is whether either party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">{\u00b6 25} R.C. 1343.03(A)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> governs prejudgment interest for breach of contract claims and states:</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cIn cases other than those provided for in sections 1343.01 and 1343.02 of the Revised Code, when money becomes due and payable upon any bond, bill, note, or other instrument of writing, upon any book account, upon any settlement between parties, upon all verbal contracts entered into, and upon all judgments, decrees, and orders of any judicial tribunal for the payment of money arising out of tortious conduct or a contract or other transaction, the creditor is entitled to interest at the rate of ten per cent per annum, and no more, unless a written contract provides a different rate of interest in relation to the money that becomes due and payable, in which ease the creditor is entitled to interest at the rate provided in that contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>{\u00b6 27} The purpose of prejudgment interest under this statute is to make the nonbreaching party whole by compensating him for the period of time between the breach and judgment. See <em>Royal Elec. Constr. Corp. v. Ohio State Univ. </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 110, 117, 652 N.E.2d 687. It follows that a breaching party is not entitled to prejudgment interest; nor is a nonbreaching party liable for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">{\u00b6 28} In this case, Cohara breached the settlement agreement when he refused to sign the May 13, 1999 release of Consolidated Rail and instead expressed \u201cmisgivings\u201d about the settlement and sought to have the court reinstate his FELA complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">{\u00b6 29} After the court ordered Cohara to honor the settlement agreement on August 3, 1999, Consolidated sent him a second release, which he again refused to sign, purportedly because it named Norfolk Southern Railway Company and CSX Transportation, Inc. In particular, Cohara complained that this release would have discharged his then-current employer, CSX, \u201cfrom any and all known or unknown claims which had accrued since the day Appellant became an employee of CSX.\u201d However, Consolidated expressly limited this release to injuries arising from accidents which occurred \u201cat or near Erie, Pennsylvania on or about September 4, 1994,\u201d \u201cat or near Brookpark, Ohio on or about November 8, 1994,\u201d and \u201call other <em>accidents </em>to date.\u201d (Emphasis added.) There is no evidence in the record that Cohara suffered any other injuries prior to August 25, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">{\u00b6 30} Subsequently, according to the stipulations, Consolidated offered to remove CSX from the release, but Cohara refused to proceed with settlement. On May 26, 2000, Consolidated proposed that Cohara \u201cline out\u201d the names Norfolk and CSX from the release, but Cohara still refused to sign or settle the matter. Then Consolidated offered to provide a new release, listing only Consolidated as the releasee, but Cohara again refused to execute such a release or to accept payment without Consolidated\u2019s agreement to pay interest on the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">{\u00b6 31} Consolidated contends that Cohara unreasonably rejected the second release naming Norfolk and CSX because these entities are its parent companies, having assumed administrative responsibility for Consolidated\u2019s FELA claims on March 1, 1999, and because they were ultimately discharged by the inclusion of the language \u201cparent * * * companies or corporations\u201d in the release that Cohara eventually signed on March 8, 2001. Consolidated maintains that it did not breach the settlement agreement and that it would have delivered the settlement check if Cohara had signed a release. Consolidated contends that Cohara breached the agreement, stalled payment, and should not profit from the delay he induced; therefore, Consolidated urges that he is not entitled to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>prejudgment interest, and it argues that the court erred in denying its motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">{\u00b6 32} We agree with Consolidated\u2019s position. Cohara caused the delay in receiving his settlement check by attempting to have the agreement vacated, by objecting to naming Consolidated\u2019s parent companies in the release, and by unreasonably refusing to resolve the case. Because Norfolk and CSX assumed responsibility for FELA claims against Consolidated on March 1, 1999, and because Consolidated limited the release to <em>accidents </em>occurring prior to that date, Cohara has not satisfactorily explained his objection to including these entities in the release. Significantly, the release document that Cohara eventually signed released \u201cCONSOLIDATED RAIL CORPORATION, its predecessors, parent, affiliated and subsidiary companies or corporations\u201d and therefore effectively released Consolidated\u2019s <em>parent </em>companies, Norfolk Southern Railway Company and CSX Transportation, Inc., even though not expressly named.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">{\u00b6 33} According to the stipulations filed in this case, the <em>only issue </em>regarding Cohara\u2019s failure to sign a release concerned the inclusion of Norfolk and CSX. This delayed settlement, but because Cohara eventually signed a release of Consolidated and parent entities, no material difference existed between the release as originally submitted and the one he ultimately signed. Contrary to the dissenting view, no dispute ever existed regarding the term \u201caccident,\u201d and Cohara did not raise concerns about the possible release of an \u201coccupational disease\u201d as his basis for forestalling settlement and signing a release. This court is limited to the record on appeal and should not create issues not raised by the parties below.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">{\u00b6 34} Based on the foregoing, Consolidated did not breach the settlement agreement; rather, Cohara induced the delay and is not therefore entitled to prejudgment interest during this period. Accordingly, the trial court erred when it denied Consolidated\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Cohara\u2019s claim for interest, and we reverse that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">{\u00b6 35} Our disposition of Consolidated\u2019s cross-appeal renders Cohara\u2019s assignments of error moot, and pursuant to App.R. 12(A)(1)(c), we decline to address them.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">Judgment reversed and case remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b195-10\">Patricia A.

I would sustain Cohara\u2019s assignments of error and reverse the judgment in part and modify it. The majority has placed the cart before the horse. It ignores appellee and cross-appellant Consolidated Rail Corporation\u2019s (\u201cConrail\u2019s\u201d) obligation to pay the settlement when it is \u201cdue and payable\u201d under R.C. 1343.03 and attempts to justify Conrad\u2019s mistaken contention that it had the ability to condition payment of the settlement upon Cohara\u2019s execution of a release. He was not required to execute any release, much less the blatantly unreasonable release submitted, in order to trigger Conrad\u2019s duty to tender payment and, since it failed to tender payment until March 8, 2001,1 would order the judgment modified to include interest from August 25, 1999, until that date. Moreover, even though Cohara was willing to sign a release, Conrad did not proffer an acceptable release until that date, which only bolsters his claim for interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Cohara\u2019s Duty to Execute Any Release.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">{\u00b6 37} The majority baldly concludes that Cohara breached the settlement agreement by failing to execute the release submitted to him on August 25, 1999, without any indication that the agreement required him even to execute a release, much less the one presented to him on that date. The stipulation of facts states that \u201c[o]n May 9, 1999, Plaintiff agreed to dismiss his suit against Defendant and release Defendant of all claims against it in return for payment of $150,000.00.\u201d The single \u201cDefendant\u201d was Conrad, and the phrase \u201call claims against it\u201d means all claims then pending against Conrad and arising from the events alleged in Cohara\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">{\u00b6 38} Cohara\u2019s complaint was dismissed with prejudice on May 11, 1999, and barred relitigation of those claims against Conrad and its privies.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The settlement agreement and dismissal provided Conrad all necessary protection against Cohara\u2019s motion to reopen, or an attempt to refile a complaint based upon the same events. A dismissal with prejudice is final and acts as res judicata with respect to the facts and the parties.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After dismissing the case, Cohara\u2019s endorsement of a release that embodied only the terms of the settlement would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>be a useless exercise and thus was unnecessary to trigger Conrail\u2019s duty to tender payment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">{\u00b6 39} Because the settlement agreement did not contain terms requiring a release of liability beyond that achieved by the dismissal of the complaint with prejudice, no other release was necessary before the money became due and payable under R.C. 1343.03(A).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The parties agreed to the terms of the settlement, and all claims against Conrail were released via the dismissal with prejudice. Although Cohara was willing to execute a release similar to the one submitted to him on May 13,1999, even this release was more extensive than that achieved by the dismissal with prejudice, it was not part of the parties\u2019 agreement, and was not properly a condition precedent to Cohara\u2019s right to payment or Conrail\u2019s duty to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">{\u00b6 40} Under R.C. 1343.03(A), interest on a settlement agreement begins to accrue when the money becomes \u201cdue and payable.\u201d Cohara does not argue that the money became \u201cdue and payable\u201d at any point prior to August 25, 1999, and, therefore, I will not address the issue of whether the money became due prior to that time. Although the majority\u2019s argument is somewhat unclear on this point because it insists on blaming Cohara for his motion to reopen the case, even it does not contend that Cohara\u2019s initial motion to reopen gave Conrail carte blanche to delay payment and bar him from any claim for post-judgment interest after the judge ordered enforcement of the settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">{\u00b6 41} While one can argue that the money was not due and payable while Cohara sought to reopen the case, after the judge ordered the settlement enforced, Conrail\u2019s sole reason for delaying payment was the supposed condition requiring him to release his claims, which had already been accomplished by the dismissal. Conrail was not entitled to condition payment on Cohara\u2019s execution of any release after the complaint was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">{\u00b6 42} The majority finds that Cohara unreasonably refused to sign a release, which was a condition to Conrail\u2019s duty to pay, and thus the money did not become \u201cdue and payable\u201d prior to March 8, 2001. This conclusion is patently incorrect.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Just as a judgment debtor can avoid post-judgment interest only by tendering payment unconditionally, a settlement debtor can avoid post-settlement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>interest only by tendering payment in accordance with the terms of the settlement agreement. The debtor cannot alter the terms of the agreement by attaching a condition that was not part of the bargain. The majority has ignored the provisions of R.C. 1343.03 and, instead, places the onus on Cohara for not blindly endorsing a proffered release that went beyond the bounds of the agreement to release all claims then pending against Conrail, when he had already released the claims in accordance with the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Cohara\u2019s Duty to Execute the August 25, 1999 Release.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">{\u00b6 43} Second, the majority offhandedly, and incorrectly, minimizes Conrail\u2019s wholly unreasonable and unjustified request that Cohara release claims for events that were not the subject of his complaint, concluding that the language was limited to \u201caccidents,\u201d and finds, with no support in the record, that Cohara had not been involved in any other \u201caccidents.\u201d Regardless of whether Cohara was involved in any other \u201caccidents,\u201d however that term is defined, between the time of his complaint and August 25, 1999, he was not required to release Conrail from claims other than those arising from the two incidents stated in his complaint, he was not required to release any claims against entities not in privity with Conrail, and he was not required to present this court with any evidence that he was involved in another \u201caccident\u201d in order to prove the proposed release terms unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">{\u00b6 44} The original release proffered to Cohara on May 13, 1999, stated that he would release Conrail and \u201cits predecessor, parent, affiliated and subsidiary companies or corporations and any and all other parties, associations and corporations jointly or severally liable\u201d from all claims arising from incidents occurring on September 4, 1994 and November 8, 1994. When, however, Judge Judith Kilbane Koch<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> denied Cohara\u2019s motion to reopen the case and ordered enforcement of the settlement agreement, Conrail presented him with a second and different release on August 25, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">{\u00b6 45} The majority has already reproduced much of the language of the second proposed release, so I will not copy it here. However, for those who tend to skim over the lengthy statement of erstwhile privies, I will condense that language to its essence, which is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">{\u00b6 46} \u201ci. I, Joseph E. Cohara[,] * * * do hereby release and forever discharge Norfolk Southern Railway Company, CSX Transportation, Inc. and Consolidated Rail Corporation, * * * and all other persons, firms and corporations, * * * of and from all claims which I have or may hereafter have, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>personal injuries, known or unknown, and/or loss of any kind resulting or in any way arising from [the accidents alleged in the complaint] * * * and all other accidents to date.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">{\u00b6 47} This is not a typographical error, nor is it out of context. The August 25, 1999 document, by its plain language, conditions the payment of $150,000 on Cohara\u2019s releasing the world from liability for all claims, \u201cknown or unknown,\u201d occurring before he endorses the document. If he had been rear-ended in traffic the day before, this document sought release of any claim against the tortfeasor. Of course, neither the record nor the stipulation of facts indicates that the agreement to settle Cohara\u2019s then pending claims against Conrail contemplated such a broad release of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">{\u00b6 48} Seeking release for parties and events outside those in the complaint is beyond the scope of the agreement, and Cohara\u2019s refusal to grant such a release was justified on principle alone, without any discussion of whether he had been involved in any other \u201caccidents,\u201d and without attempting to define the term \u201caccidents\u201d for purposes of the release. Furthermore, even if the release could be construed as limited to Conrail and its predecessors, affiliates and subsidiaries, which it plainly is not, the elephant in the corner here is the possibility that Cohara might have a claim for asbestosis or some other occupational disease, resulting from exposure prior to August 25, 1999, but not yet apparent.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The term \u201caccidents\u201d is not defined in the release and, because Conrail had no business asking for release of any claims other than those in the complaint, Cohara had every right to insist that the term be removed, without stopping to quibble over its definition<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> or risk that Conrail or some other party would assert the release as a defense in some future case and then litigate its meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">{\u00b6 49} Even now, the majority stops short of expressly defining a limit to the word \u201caccidents,\u201d failing to state that the word does not include the contraction of occupational diseases. The majority opinion\u2019s placement of emphasis upon the word \u201caccidents\u201d is feeble assurance indeed, and even at that Cohara did not have the benefit of even this ambiguous and ambivalent gesture at the time the release was proffered. The majority not only errs in failing to recognize that Cohara was entitled to reject the unreasonable proposal on its face but, even on the majority\u2019s terms, he would have compromised any subsequent claim by allowing Conrail to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>interject an ambiguous term, unwarranted under any definition, that would fester until the claim was brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">{\u00b6 50} The majority\u2019s position is hypocritical; on one hand it faults Cohara for failing to sign a release that-went beyond the settlement agreement, arguing that the additional temis were harmless, but fails to fault Conrail for refusing to remove the same supposedly harmless terms. While aggravating in any sphere, it is most depressing to hear a judge tell a litigant that a contract term means nothing, yet he must agree to it rather than have it removed. Such assurances legendarily result in the purchase of swampland.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">{\u00b6 51} The May 13, 1999 document sought release of Conrail, a number of \u201caffiliated\u201d entities that may or may not have had the identity of interest necessary to bar relitigation as a matter of law,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> then sought release of \u201call other parties\u201d jointly or severally liable for claims arising from the complaint. By the stipulated terms of the settlement agreement, even this release was too broad, as Cohara had agreed only to release <em>Conrail </em>from those claims. The \u201caffiliated\u201d entities included in this agreement would be only those legally entitled to claim preclusion as its privies, which would be accomplished by naming only Conrail.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">{\u00b6 52} Cohara eventually agreed to release Conrail and \u201call other parties\u201d from liability for the events arising from the complaint, although he was not required to under the terms of the original agreement. It appears that after the August 3, 1999 order enforcing the settlement, he was willing to execute the May 13, 1999 release, even though it went beyond the agreement\u2019s terms. The major difference between the May 13, 1999 release, the August 25, 1999 release, and the March 8, 2001 release that Cohara eventually signed, however, is that the second document did not limit the release of liability to the events in his complaint, but instead required him to release all parties for all events to that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">{\u00b6 53} It is clear that the additional terms in the second proffered release changed its effect relative to the first and, again, there was no reason that Cohara should have been required to agree to those terms, guess at their effect, or accept the representation that they were harmless or meaningless and risk the opposite. The provision attempting to release all entities from liability for \u201call other accidents to date\u201d broadens even further the inappropriate inclusion of other parties in the first release, and is wholly unreasonable. Cohara was not required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>to release any other claims, nor was he required to investigate all of his possible claims before rejecting the proposal.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">{\u00b6 54} Furthermore, the judge\u2019s conclusion that the May 26, 2000 offer to cross out reference to Norfolk Southern and CSX resolved all defects in the August 25, 1999 release was incorrect; that act would have no effect, because the document still purported to release \u201call * * * persons, firms and corporations\u201d from all claims. Even when Cohara apparently was willing to release all parties from the claims in <em>his complaint, </em>Conrail then insisted that he sign a release that could hardly have been more expansive or more unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">{\u00b6 55} The majority responds to these truths by stating that the case must be decided solely upon the stipulations, and then claims that Cohara\u2019s refusal to sign the release was not related to the overbroad release of claims, but to his objections to naming Norfolk Southern and CSX as parties. This machination fails on its own terms, however, because the stipulations show that Conrail\u2019s duty to tender payment was not conditioned on Cohara\u2019s executing any release. He had already performed his part of the bargain when the case was dismissed with prejudice, and that fact should dispose of this case; any remaining statements in the parties\u2019 stipulations are irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">{\u00b6 56} Moreover, even if Cohara objected to the release for the wrong reasons, the majority has not explained why his failure to articulate its true defects required him to sign it. If an unscrupulous dealer knowingly<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> offers defective merchandise and the customer objects to its color, is the customer then obligated to accept the merchandise because the dealer went to the trouble of painting it, even though the customer is now aware of its defect? The answer, for those who have trouble with such things, is no, because requiring the customer to buy the defective goods would reward the dealer for his deceit. The majority opinion does just this; by focusing on Cohara\u2019s conduct, it tells defendants that it is good and ethical and professional and right to attempt such deceit, because only good can come of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>{\u00b6 57} Furthermore, the majority has misstated the stipulations by claiming that Cohara\u2019s only reason for refusing to sign the August 25, 1999 release was its inclusion of Norfolk Southern and CSX as named parties. In fact, Cohara refused to sign the release after Conrail offered to cross out those names and before he claimed entitlement to interest. The stipulations reflect no reason for his refusal to execute the release with the offending names crossed out, and Conrail admitted, in its motion for summary judgment, that Cohara\u2019s reasons for doing so were unknown. It is, therefore, reasonable to address other reasons for Cohara\u2019s refusal because the stipulations are ambiguous or incomplete. Moreover, he raised these arguments in his briefs and at oral argument, and his arguments to the trial judge show his concern that he was releasing all claims against his current employer, despite the fact that he attributed the problem to the explicit naming of his employer instead of to the overbroad statement of claims released. The majority\u2019s selective priggishness<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> should not be excused, for it is employing dreadful means to uphold a defendant\u2019s insistence on a patently outrageous and indefensible release. This turns logic and policy on its head, as the majority apparently is intent on \u201cprotecting\u201d defendants from plaintiffs who unreasonably delay payment of claims in order to increase the amount of statutory interest owed. Such a policy is as ridiculous as it sounds, for the difficulty courts have always faced is that defendants delay payment of claims in order to continue reaping the benefit of their money \u2014 it is far less likely that courts will be deluged by judgment creditors who have thwarted debtors\u2019 efforts to pay and, thus, there is no reason to deny interest payments on such an artifice.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">{\u00b6 58} The majority invites defendants not only to claim that payment is conditioned on the execution of releases when such conditions were not bargained for, but also to include terms in those releases that are so offensive that no lawyer could competently allow his client to agree to them. By insisting upon such offensive terms, defendants can withhold payment and point to the majority decision in defending against claims for post-judgment/post-settlement interest. This must be the result sought by the majority because there is no other reason to render this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">{\u00b6 59} The opinion might have begun as a senseless reflex, but the majority has persisted in it even after faced with the overwhelming illogic of its view. It casts a blind eye both to R.C. 1343.03 and to Conrail\u2019s ability to interplead the settlement funds under Civ.R. 22, under the guise that Cohara enabled Conrail to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>cheat him. I would sustain Cohara\u2019s assignments of error, overrule Conrail\u2019s assignments, reverse the judgment, and remand with instructions to grant Cohara statutory post-settlement interest from August 25, 1999 until March 8, 2001.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b196-9\">. <em>Musa v.

The majority attempts to limit the arguments by manipulating the stipulations only after finding that its argument in support of the proposed release is irremediable and insipid.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
