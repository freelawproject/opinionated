Erie argues that, as an insurance agent charged with the duty of understanding and explaining available coverages to his customers, David Shindollar should be treated as a special class of insureds and exempted from the mandates of R.C. 3937.18(C). We find, based upon the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of R.C. 3937.18(C), that extrinsic evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>David Shindollar\u2019s knowledge and experience is inadmissible for purposes of establishing the adequacy of Erie\u2019s offer of uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage or that such coverage was knowingly and expressly waived. Furthermore, because the policies herein fail to incorporate elements essential for a meaningful offer, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">{\u00b6 2} Facts and procedural history relevant to the issues raised on appeal are as follows. On December 31, 1998, David Shindollar\u2019s daughter, Sarah, was seriously injured while a passenger in a motor vehicle.\" The negligent tortfeasor\u2019s insurer, State Farm Insurance, paid Sarah the policy\u2019s $100,000 per-person liability coverage limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">{\u00b6 3} At the time of the accident, Sarah Shindollar was a minor and resided with her parents. The Shindollar family was insured under two policies issued by Erie: a $250,000 per-person and $500,000 per-accident automobile liability policy with uninsured and underinsured (\u201cUM/UIM\u201d) coverage selected at lower limits of $100,000 per person and $300,000 per accident; and a $1,000,000 personal catastrophe policy with a signed UM/UIM rejection form. Appellees submitted UM/UIM claims under the foregoing policies. Erie declined coverage, contending that UM/UIM coverage was not available under the personal catastrophe policy and that recovery under the automobile policy was precluded due to the $100,000 limit. Appellees received from the tortfeasor\u2019s insurance provider, which was set off from the policy\u2019s $100,000 per-person coverage limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">{\u00b6 4} In January 2001, appellees filed a declaratory judgment action seeking a determination as to their rights to UM/UIM coverage under the Erie policies. Thereafter, both sides moved for summary judgment. Appellees claimed that they were entitled to additional UM/UIM coverage and compensation under the policies as a matter of law, arguing that the offers and rejections of UM/UIM coverage contained therein were deficient and that UM/UIM coverage should be implied up to the liability limits of each policy. Erie argued that the offer and rejections contained therein were adequate and that the rejections were knowing and voluntary, citing the fact that David Shindollar was an insurance agent who understood UM/UIM coverage and had participated in the execution of the automobile policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">{\u00b6 5} On November 13, 2001, the trial court granted appellees\u2019 motion, finding that the limited rejection in the automobile policy and the rejection form addressing the personal catastrophe policy were invalid and that UM/UIM coverage would therefore be implied in the amount of the underlying liability limits of each policy. The instant appeal followed, with Erie presenting a single assignment of error for our consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">{\u00b6 6} For its assignment of error, Erie argues that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment \u201cwhere the insured was an insurance agent and it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>was discernible from the four corners of the insuring agreements that the insured had knowingly and expressly selected lower UM/UIM coverage on the automobile liability policy and had expressly rejected UM/UIM coverage on an umbrella policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">{\u00b6 7} Summary judgment is appropriate when, looking at the evidence as a whole, the record demonstrates (1) that no genuine issue of material fact remains to be litigated; (2) that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and; (3) that, after construing the evidence most strongly in the nonmovant\u2019s favor, reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In ruling on a summary judgment motion, the trial court is not permitted to weigh evidence or choose among reasonable inferences; rather, the court must evaluate evidence, taking all permissible inferences and resolving questions of credibility in favor of the nonmovant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellate review of summary judgment determinations is conducted de novo.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, this court considers the motion independently and without deference to the trial court\u2019s findings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">{\u00b6 8} Pursuant to R.C. 3937.18(A), all insurance companies are required to offer UM/UIM coverage with every automobile liability or motor vehicle liability policy delivered or issued for delivery in Ohio. Every policy must have two-year guarantee periods during which the policy cannot be altered except by agreement of the parties.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The commencement of each new policy period mandated by R.C. 3937.31(A) brings into existence a new contract of automobile insurance, whether the policy is categorized as a new policy of insurance or a renewal of an existing policy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The statutory law in effect on the date of each \u201cnew\u201d policy is the law to be applied.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">{\u00b6 9} The automobile policy herein was initiated on June 27, 1985. Counting successive two-year policy periods therefrom, the last renewal was June 27,1997, prior to the September 3, 1997 effective date of the 1997 amendments to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>R.C. 3937.18.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, that is the version of the law that governs the automobile policy. In contrast, issues arose as to whether the personal catastrophe policy\u2019s last renewal preceded the 1997 amendments. Although there has been disagreement as to the effect of the amendments on the requirements for valid written offers of UM/UIM coverage as set forth by the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>Gyori v. Johnston Coca-Cola Bottling Group, </em>Inc.,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and <em>Linko v. Indemn. Ins. Co. of N. Am.,</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we find the following passage from the Sixth District\u2019s pronouncement in <em>Raymond v. Sentry </em>Insurance<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> to be persuasive and conclude that the 1997 amendments did not alter Linko\u2019s requirements for a valid offer of UM/UIM coverage:</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cThe trial court concluded that in enacting the amendment, the General Assembly intended to reject <em>Gyori </em>except for the portion that it adopted or modified (rejection must be in writing, but need not be executed prior to the effective date of the policy) and, by creating a presumption of a valid offer from a written rejection, eliminate all of the <em>Linko </em>requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cThe trial court is correct with respect to <em>Gyori. </em>The Legislature clearly considered that case and acted to accept that a rejection of UM/UIM coverage must be in writing and, tacitly by its creation of a presumption, that there must be an offer of coverage. The General Assembly deleted the <em>Gyori </em>requirement that the coverage rejection must come prior to the effective date of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cHowever, the General Assembly could not have intended to directly negate the holding of <em>Linko </em>if for no other reason than that the amendment at issue predates <em>Linko </em>by three years. [FN3] Consequently, even after the 1997 amendment, there is vitality to the <em>Linko </em>requirements. <em>Pillo v. Stricklin </em>(Dec. 31, 2001), Stark App. No. 2001CA00204, [2002-Ohio-363, 2001 WL 1744148].</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cFN3. Additionally, the legislature specifically addresses <em>Linko </em>in a 2001 amendment to R.C. 3937.18. 2001 Am.Sub.S.B. 97, Sec. 3, uncodified.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>{\u00b6 14} Accordingly, we proceed to determine whether Erie made a sufficient offer of UM/UIM coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">{\u00b6 15} In <em>Gyori </em>the Ohio Supreme Court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c1. There can be no rejection pursuant to R.C. 3937.18(C) absent a written offer of uninsured motorist coverage from the insurance provider.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">{\u00b6 17} <em>\u201c2 </em>In order for a rejection of uninsured motorist coverage to be expressly and knowingly made, such rejection must be in writing and must be received by the insurance company prior to the commencement of the policy year\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">{\u00b6 18} The court also concluded that \u201c[t]he mandates of R.C. 3937.18 apply to providers of excess coverage as well as providers of primary liability coverage.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Failure to properly offer or reject [UM/JUIM coverage results in coverage by operation of law.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In <em>Linko, </em>the court explained that <em>\u201cGyori </em>stands for the proposition that we cannot know whether an insured has made an express, knowing rejection of UM/UIM coverage unless there is a written offer and written rejection. It only follows that a valid rejection requires a meaningful offer, <em>ie., </em>an offer that is an offer in substance and not just in name.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The court held that in order to satisfy the offer requirement, the insurer must (1) inform the insured of the availability of uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage, (2) set forth the premium for the coverage, (3) include a brief description of the coverage, and (4) expressly state the uninsured/underinsured coverage limits in its offer.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">{\u00b6 19} Erie argues that, as an insurance agent charged with the duty of understanding and explaining available coverages to his customers,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> David Shindollar should be treated as a special class of insureds and exempted from the mandates of R.C. 3937.18(C). Erie further avers that there is no indication that he did not understand the implications of rejecting or selecting lower limits for UM/UIM coverage and asserts that the signed rejection within the umbrella <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>policy and his selection of lower limits in the automobile policy provide sufficient evidence of an express rejection within the four corners of the insurance agreements to preclude implication of UM/UIM coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">{\u00b6 20} In <em>Gyori, </em>the Johnston Coca-Cola Bottling Group (\u201cJohnston\u201d), a sophisticated commercial buyer, had a policy of rejecting UM/UIM coverage when it was legally possible to do so and actively sought to minimize its insurance costs by making a knowing and express rejection of UM/UIM coverage. Consistent with company policy, John Rains, Risk Manager for Johnston and the person primarily responsible for procuring insurance for the company, enlisted the company\u2019s insurance broker to draft specifications and request bids for insurance rejecting or opting for minimally required coverage. In response thereto, National Union Fire Insurance Company prepared a policy, which excluded coverage but did not contain a rejection form. The broker discussed with Rains the coverages available, including UM/UIM, and then compared bids for the best price, eventually selecting the National Union policy. Upon appellate review, the court found that, despite the lack of a written offer or rejection, \u201c[t]he undisputed facts * * * amply demonstrate that Johnston was well aware of the availability of UM coverage, understood it and made an informed and knowledgeable waiver of that coverage.\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Nevertheless, upon further review, the Ohio Supreme Court held that <em>\u201chowever express and knowing Johnston\u2019s actions were, they could not constitute a rejection because there was no offer made which Johnston could </em>reject.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">{\u00b6 21} Moreover, when presented with the question of whether a signatory\u2019s intent could be established by extrinsic evidence or whether the four corners of the insurance agreement control in determining whether a named insured\u2019s waiver was knowingly and expressly made, the <em>Linko </em>court expounded upon <em>Gyori, </em>holding:</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cWe conclude that the four corners of the insurance agreement control in determining whether the waiver was knowingly and expressly made by each of the named insureds. Again, we cite <em>Gyori, </em>which requires a written offer and \u00e1 written rejection of UM/UIM coverage. In <em>Gyori </em>this court made it clear that the issue of whether coverage was offered and rejected should be apparent from the contract itself. This court stated that the requirement of written offers \u2018will prevent needless litigation about whether the insurance company offered UM coverage.\u2019 * * * By requiring an offer and rejection to be in writing, this court impliedly held in <em>Gyori </em>that if the rejection is not within the contract, it is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>valid. In doing so, this court greatly simplified the issue of proof in these types of cases \u2014 the offer and rejection are either there or they are not. Extrinsic evidence is not admissible to prove that a waiver was knowingly and expressly made by each of the named insureds.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">{\u00b6 23} Therefore, David Shindollar\u2019s familiarity with or personal understanding of UM/UIM coverage is irrelevant to the determination of whether there has been a sufficient offer or rejection of UM/UIM coverage, and extrinsic evidence of his knowledge and experience is inadmissible for purposes of establishing the adequacy of Erie\u2019s offer or that coverage was knowingly and expressly waived. Accordingly, we proceed to examine the contents of the subject insurance agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">{\u00b6 24} The rejection form in <em>Linko </em>read:</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cOhio Revised Code Section 3937.18 requires us to offer you Uninsured/Underinsured Motorists Insurance coverage in an amount equal to the policy bodily injury liability limit(s) with respect to any motor vehicle registered or principally garaged in the State of Ohio, unless you reject such coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cUnless you have previously rejected this coverage, your policy has been issued to include Uninsured/Underinsured Motorists Insurance coverage at limit(s) equal to the policy bodily injury liability limit(s).\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">{\u00b6 27} Reviewing this language, the court found that the \u201calleged offer is complete only in its incompleteness. It does not describe the coverage, does not list the premium costs of UM/UIM coverage, and does not expressly state the coverage limits.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">{\u00b6 28} As mentioned previously, the automobile policy herein provides bodily injury liability coverage in the amount of $250,000 per person and $500,000 per accident. However, UM/UIM coverage was selected in the amount of $100,000 per person and $300,000 per accident, which is lower than the limits of liability coverage. The portions of the application relating to UM/UIM coverage provide:</p>\n<p id=\"b580-11\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cUninsured/Underinsured Motorists</p>\n<p id=\"b580-12\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cBodily Injury Per Person/Per Accident</p>\n<p id=\"b580-13\">{\u00b6 31} \u201c\u25a1 $15/30</p>\n<p id=\"b580-14\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c\u25a1 -</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>{\u00b6 33} \u201cSee Item 23 on reverse side.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">{\u00b6 34} Item 23 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">{\u00b6 35} \u201c\u25a1 REJECTION OF UNINSURED/UNDERINSURED MOTORIST COVERAGE OHIO I (we), the Named Insured, hereby reject insurance against Uninsured/Underinsured Motorists and as provided by Section 3937.18 Ohio Revised Code you are hereby requested to eliminate such coverage from my (our) policy and all renewals thereof (Must be signed by each Named Insured).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">{\u00b6 36} \u201c\u25a1 SELECTION OF LOWER LIMITS OF UNINSURED/UN-DERINSURED MOTORIST COVERAGE OHIO I (we), the Named Insured, reject Uninsured/Underinsured Motorists limits equal to my (our) Bodily Injury Limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cI (we) select instead $ ,000 per person and $ ,000 per accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">{\u00b6 38} The personal catastrophe policy rejection form appears as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b581-11\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cREJECTION OF UNINSURED MOTORIST COVERAGE</p>\n<p id=\"b581-12\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cI (we) the Named Insured, decline insurance protection against Uninsured Motorists, including Underinsured Motorists. I (we) request that you eliminate such coverage from my (our) policy and all future renewals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-13\">{\u00b6 41} The foregoing provisions do not describe the coverage, do not list the premium costs of UM/UIM coverage, and do not expressly state the coverage limits. The automobile application and personal catastrophe rejection form, lacking in required information essential for a valid offer of UM/UIM coverage, cannot be termed a \u201cwritten offer\u201d that would allow an insured to make an express, knowing rejection of coverage equal to the liability limits of the underlying policies.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> As a result, UM/UIM coverage arises by operation of law in amounts equal to the policies\u2019 liability limits.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Therefore, construing the evidence most favorably to Erie, reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion: appellees were entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Accordingly, Erie\u2019s assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-14\">{\u00b6 42} Having found no error prejudicial to the appellant herein in the particulars assigned and argued, we affirm the judgment of trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-15\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b581-16\">Shaw, P.J., and Hadley, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b576-7\">.
