(\u201cAllega\u201d), and plaintiff city of Cleveland ex rel. Walter O\u2019Malley appeal the trial court\u2019s order issuing a permanent injunction, which requires that the electrical duct bank and manhole handling, assembly, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>installation (\u201cduct bank work\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on the Cleveland Hopkins International Airport Runway Expansion Project (\u201cthe project\u201d) be apportioned equally between electricians and laborers. For the reasons below, we reverse the trial court\u2019s decision and dismiss O\u2019Malley\u2019s taxpayer suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">{\u00b6 2} In July 2000, the city of Cleveland enacted Codified Ordinances (\u201cC.O.\u201d) 552-2000 and 1234-2000, which authorized the Director of Port Control to enter into contracts for the project. The city then began accepting bids from contractors and chose Allega as the general contractor of the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">{\u00b6 3} The duct bank work involved in the project is specifically at issue. Allega has a contract with the Laborers International Union of North America, Local 860, which requires Allega to use employees of this union for all airport construction work, including the duct bank work.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">{\u00b6 4} Between August and December 2000, representatives of the Electrical Workers, IBEW, Local No. 38, notified the Director of Port Control of possible labor and wage disputes surrounding the project. In December 2000, O\u2019Malley, acting as the business representative of Local 38, wrote a letter to the Director of Port Control, citing bid specification C-22 and suggesting that a review of the city\u2019s records would reveal that Local 38 has customarily performed the duct bank work and should be awarded the work on the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">{\u00b6 5} As a result, the Port Control and City Council began to investigate which trade traditionally performed the duct bank work. In January 2001, this matter became an issue at the city council\u2019s Aviation Committee meetings.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">{\u00b6 6} In February 2001, the Port Control entered into a contract with Allega.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">{\u00b6 7} Then, on March 14, 2001, the city council passed C.O. 454-01, which codified the finding of the Aviation Committee that electricians customarily performed duct bank work at the airport. On April 30, 2001, C.O. 454-01 was repealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-11\">{\u00b6 8} On April 9, 2001, O\u2019Malley sent a written request to the city\u2019s law director asking him to institute a civil action alleging bid requirement violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-12\">{\u00b6 9} On April 25, 2001, O\u2019Malley commenced this action by filing a verified taxpayer complaint for injunctive relief. The complaint sought to permanently enjoin the city from using nonelectricians to perform the duct bank work on the project. The second count of the complaint sought to permanently enjoin the city from compensating workers performing the duct bank work at less than the prevailing wage rate for electricians. O\u2019Malley also sought attorney fees under R.C. 733.61.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>{\u00b6 10} O\u2019Malley simultaneously filed a motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, requesting the same injunctive relief described in his complaint. Allega intervened, and the court set the matter for hearing on the motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">{\u00b6 11} In response, the city and Allega filed separate motions to dismiss the complaint or to stay the proceedings pending the outcome of the unfair labor practice charge filed by Allega against Laborers International Union of North America, Local 860. The basis of the charge was that Local 860 threatened to picket and strike to force Allega to assign particular work to its union members rather than to members of Local 38, the electrical workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">{\u00b6 12} The trial court denied the motions to dismiss and again set the pending motions for hearing. The city opposed the motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, and the city again sought dismissal based on lack of standing to bring a taxpayer action. The trial court denied the city\u2019s request to dismiss the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">{\u00b6 13} After holding several hearings on the preliminary injunction, the trial court made the following order on June 8, 2001:</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cAfter considering all of the evidence, the Court finds that electricians and laborers have both customarily performed the work in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cBased on this evidence, it is the order of the Court that the duct bank and manhole handling, assembly and installation shall be apportioned equally between the electricians and the laborers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">{\u00b6 16} The city filed its notice of appeal, which is designated case No. 79833, and sought a stay of the Jun\u00e9 8 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-11\">{\u00b6 17} Allega filed its notice of appeal, which is designated case No. 79856, and a motion to stay the permanent injunction pending appeal. The trial court granted the stay of the June 8 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-12\">{\u00b6 18} O\u2019Malley filed his notice of cross-appeal in case No. 79856, and the two appellate cases were consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-13\">{\u00b6 19} Upon initial review, we determined that the trial court\u2019s decision only disposed of the first claim, which concerned the use of nonelectricians to perform work on the Project. Thus, on April 23, 2002, this court sua sponte remanded the matter to the trial court for a final order on the wage claim. The parties filed a stipulated order for dismissal without prejudice of count two, which was granted by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-14\">{\u00b6 20} The parties raise the following assignments of error on the issue of O\u2019Malley\u2019s standing to bring a taxpayer action:</p>\n<p id=\"b604-15\">{\u00b6 21} The city maintains:</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>{\u00b6 22} \u201cI. The trial court committed reversible error in failing to dismiss the purported taxpayer action for lack of standing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">{\u00b6 23} Allega also argues:</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cII. The trial court erred by permitting a taxpayer without standing to bring a taxpayer lawsuit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">{\u00b6 25} And O\u2019Malley asserts:</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cII. The trial court erred when it refused to grant plaintiffs leave to amend the complaint to allow recovery as a taxpayer\u2019s action under the city of Cleveland Codified Ordinances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">{\u00b6 27} Responsibility for the enforcement of a public right to the performance of a public duty by a municipal corporation is imposed in the first instance upon the city\u2019s law director. See <em>State ex rel. Nimon v. Springdale </em>(1966), 6 Ohio St.2d 1, 35 O.O.2d 1, 215 N.E.2d 592, paragraph one of syllabus; R.C. 733.58.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-10\">{\u00b6 28} However, R.C. 733.59 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b605-11\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cIf the village solicitor or city director of law fails, upon the written request of any taxpayer of the municipal corporation, to make any application provided for in sections 733.56 to 733.58 of the Revised Code, the taxpayer may institute suit in his own name, on behalf of the municipal corporation. * * * No such suit or proceeding shall be entertained by any court until the taxpayer gives security for the cost of the proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-12\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cThe word \u2018taxpayer\u2019 as used in Section 733.59, Revised Code, contemplates and includes any person who, in a private capacity as a citizen, elector, freeholder or taxpayer, volunteers to enforce a right of action <em>on behalf of and for the benefit of the public, </em>and any such person is subject to the conditions imposed by that section, unless waived.\u201d <em>Nimon, </em>6 Ohio St.2d 1, 35 O.O.2d 1, 215 N.E.2d 592, paragraph two of syllabus. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b605-13\">{\u00b6 31} The record reveals that prior to filing suit, O\u2019Malley sent a written request to the city\u2019s law director seeking his action in the matter. In addition, O\u2019Malley has provided security for the cost of the proceedings. Thus, the preliminary requirements to bringing an action under R.C. 733.59 have been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-14\">A. General Tax Fund</p>\n<p id=\"b605-15\">{\u00b6 32} However, the city still maintains that O\u2019Malley lacks standing to bring a taxpayer\u2019s suit pursuant to R.C. 733.59. It argues that O\u2019Malley\u2019s status as a taxpayer fails because no general municipal tax funds support the project because the airport, by ordinance, is a self-sustaining enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>{\u00b6 33} In response, O\u2019Malley argues that his standing is based on statutory authority, and thus he is not required to show that he has a special interest in the funds at issue. Furthermore, O\u2019Malley maintains that the general tax fund is in fact used to support the airport and to pay the salaries of airport decision-makers.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">{\u00b6 34} When a taxpayer does not have statutory authority to bring a suit on behalf of a municipal corporation, he must show that he has a special interest in the funds that are the subject matter of the litigation. <em>State ex rel. Paul v. Ohio State Racing Comm. </em>(1989), 60 Ohio App.3d 112, 574 N.E.2d 587. Here, O\u2019Malley has brought this action pursuant to R.C. 733.59; thus, he is not required to show a special interest in the funds at issue. Nonetheless, Councilman Michael Dolan, the Chairman of the Aviation Committee, testified that general funds are used to pay his salary, the salaries of airport staff members, and others responsible for making decisions regarding airport projects. Although the actual costs of the project are paid from a separate fund, the nexus between the airport decision-makers and general fund is sufficient to establish that contributors to the general fund have an interest in airport projects. Cf. <em>Tiemann v. Univ. of Cincinnati </em>(1998), 127 Ohio App.3d 312, 712 N.E.2d 1258 (a common-law taxpayer action where decision-making functions were performed by the university and funding for the university construction project came directly from university\u2019s special fund). Thus, O\u2019Malley\u2019s status as a taxpayer with respect to funding does not fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">B. Public Right</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">{\u00b6 35} The city also argues that O\u2019Malley lacks standing and that his taxpayer action fails because he has not established a violation of a public right.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">{\u00b6 36} O\u2019Malley contends that the public has a right to compel the city and its general contractors to abide by the terms of their competitively bid contracts. O\u2019Malley also contends that the city has violated the public\u2019s right to safety by using nonelectricians for the installation of the electrical duct bank portion of the project. Thus, he argues that substantial public rights are at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">{\u00b6 37} Before we can determine whether O\u2019Malley has standing as a taxpayer to bring the instant action, we must analyze the validity of the alleged public rights for which he brought suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">1. Bid Specification Compliance</p>\n<p id=\"b606-10\">{\u00b6 38} O\u2019Malley contends that the integrity of the competitive bid process has been compromised by the city\u2019s alleged failure to require its contractors to abide by the bid procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>{\u00b6 39} At issue is bid specification C-22, with which O\u2019Malley contends Allega failed to comply. C-22 reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cThe Contractor shall clarify and apportion * * * the performance of labor to the various trades involved in accordance with the local customs, rules and jurisdictional awards, regulations, etc., insofar as may be applicable to this work regardless of the classification as indicated in the specifications.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">{\u00b6 41} O\u2019Malley argues that bid specification C-22 requires the use of electricians and electrical contractors rather than laborers for the duct bank work. However, Allega assigned the duct bank work to employees from the laborers\u2019 union. Accordingly, O\u2019Malley maintains that Allega did not act in accordance with the local customs and rules in apportioning the duct bank work and thus did not comply with bid specification C-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">{\u00b6 42} However, there is no specific requirement in the bid specification that requires the use of electricians for the duct bank work. Further, evidence was presented that supported a finding that since 1988, employees of Local 860 have performed electrical duct work at the airport on at least five occasions. Most significantly, while this matter was pending on appeal, the NLRB issued a decision in <em>Laborers\u2019 Internatl. Union of N. Am., AFL-CIO, Local Union 860 </em>and <em>Anthony Allega Cement Contr., Inc. </em>(Sept. 28, 2001), No. 8-CD-480, 336 NLRB No. 28, 2001 WL 1220503, in which it determined that based in part on past practice and area practice, \u201cthe employees represented by Local 860 are entitled to perform the work in dispute.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, Allega and the city fully complied with bid specification C-22. Thus, because the city was in full compliance with the bidding process, no public right was violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">2. Public Safety</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">{\u00b6 43} As previously stated, the evidence presented at trial revealed that on at least five previous occasions, Allega has used members of Local 860 on projects similar to the duct bank work at issue. These previous projects were completed without harm to the safety of the public. Thus, O\u2019Malley has failed to establish that the use of nonelectricians creates a true public safety issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">3. Private Interest</p>\n<p id=\"b607-11\">{\u00b6 44} There is no question that, as the business representative of the IBEW, Local 38, O\u2019Malley has a private interest in seeking a determination that electricians should be assigned to perform the electrical duct bank work.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>{\u00b6 45} Nonetheless, a taxpayer has standing to enforce a public right, regardless of private or personal benefit. <em>State ex rel. Cater v. N. Olmsted </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 315, 322-323, 631 N.E.2d 1048; see, also, <em>State ex rel. Ohio Academy of Trial Lawyers v. Sheward, </em>86 Ohio St.3d 451, 715 N.E.2d 1062; <em>State ex rel. White v. Cleveland </em>(1973), 34 Ohio St.2d 37, 63 O.O.2d 79, 295 N.E.2d 665.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">{\u00b6 46} However, when the taxpayer\u2019s aim is merely for his own benefit, no public right exists, and a taxpayer action pursuant to R.C. 733.59 cannot be maintained. See <em>State ex rel. Caspar v. Dayton </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 16, 558 N.E.2d 49 (where the court held that police union members lacked standing in a taxpayer action seeking fringe benefits from the city.)</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">{\u00b6 47} We determine that no public rights are being protected through this suit. Thus, O\u2019Malley lacks standing to bring a taxpayer action pursuant to R.C. 733.59. Accordingly, the trial court erred by denying the city\u2019s request for dismissal and by finding that O\u2019Malley had standing to bring the instant action.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">{\u00b6 48} The city also raises the following assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">{\u00b6 49} \u201cII. The trial court committed reversible error in failing to dismiss the purported taxpayer action based on federal labor law preemption.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">{\u00b6 50} And Allega alleges:</p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">{\u00b6 51} \u201cI. The trial court erred by failing to find that the federal labor law preempts plaintiffs claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-11\">{\u00b6 52} As noted above, while this matter was pending, the NLRB issued its <em>Laborers\u2019 Intematl. Union </em>decision in which it determined that \u201cthe employees represented by Local 860 are entitled to perform the work in dispute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-12\">{It 53} As a general rule, neither state nor federal courts have jurisdiction over suits directly involving activity subject to section 8 of the NLRA. <em>San Diego Bldg. Trades Council v. Garmon </em>(1959), 359 U.S. 236, 245, 79 S.Ct. 773, 3 L.Ed.2d 775; <em>Bottle Beer Drivers, Beer &amp; Soft Drink Bottlers &amp; Allied Workers Local Union No. 1199 v. Dameron </em>(Dec. 4, 1998), 1st Dist. No. C-970922, 1998 WL 833609 (Gorman, J. concurring). The reasons for this are simple: uniformity of decision and deference to the expertise of the NLRB. The NLRB has its own procedures for investigation, complaint and notice, and hearing and decision. See <em>Garner v. Teamsters, Chauffeurs &amp; Helpers Local Union No. 776 </em>(1953), 346 U.S. 485, 490, 74 S.Ct. 161, 98 L.Ed. 228; <em>Dameron, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-13\">{\u00b6 54} In the labor action filed by Allega against Local 860, Allega alleged that Local 860 violated Section 8(b)(4)(D) of the NLRA. Thus, the NLRB action commenced by Allega directly involved activity subject to Section 8 of the NLRA. Accordingly, we must defer to the NLRB\u2019s decision regarding the issue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>whether members of Local 860 or Local 38 should be assigned the duct bank work on the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">{\u00b6 55} However, O\u2019Malley contends that we should not defer to the NLRB\u2019s decision on the local-custom issue because the parties named in that action are different from the parties named herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\"> {\u00b6 56} However, which parties were named is of no consequence. The fact is that the same <em>issue </em>raised herein was raised in <em>Laborers\u2019 Internatl. Union of North America, AFL-CIO, Local Union 860 </em>and <em>Anthony Allega Cement Contr., Inc. </em>Where both the NLRA claims and the state law claims share a fundamental element and create a sufficiently large risk of inconsistent decisions, the state law claims are preempted. See <em>Local 926, Internal. Union of Operating Engineers v. Jones </em>(1983), 460 U.S. 669, 103 S.Ct. 1453, 75 L.Ed.2d 368; <em>Dameron. </em>Here, there is no question that the case at bar and the NLRB decision share fundamental elements and that the trial court\u2019s decision that apportioned the duct bank work to both Local 38 and Local 860 was not consistent with the NLRB\u2019s decision, which found that Local 860 is entitled to perform the duct bank work. Thus, the trial court\u2019s decision is preempted by the NLRB\u2019s decision. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s decision and dismiss this matter due to O\u2019Malley\u2019s lack of standing to maintain this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">{\u00b6 57} The city\u2019s remaining assignments of error are:</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">{\u00b6 58} \u201cHI. The trial court committed reversible error in failing to dismiss the purported taxpayer action based on plaintiffs failure to exhaust available administrative remedies under the Davis-Bacon Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">{\u00b6 59} \u201cIV. The trial court committed reversible error in creating a remedy without first finding that the contract was entered in violation of the city\u2019s corporate powers or in contravention of statutes or ordinances governing it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">{\u00b6 60} \u201cV. The trial court committed reversible error in its creation of a remedy by essentially rewriting the parties\u2019 contract so as to shift from the contractor to the city the responsibility for clarifying and apportioning the performance of labor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-11\">{\u00b6 61} \u201cVI. The judgment is against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-12\">{\u00b6 62} Allega\u2019s remaining assignments of error are:</p>\n<p id=\"b609-13\">{\u00b6 63} \u201cHI. The trial court erred by permitting a taxpayer-plaintiff to enforce a contract to which he is not a party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-14\">{\u00b6 64} \u201cIV. The trial court erred by finding that bid specification C-22 requires the use of electricians.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>{\u00b6 65} \u201cV. The trial court erred by apportioning the work between laborers and electricians because \u2018custom and practice\u2019 simply does not support that division of labor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">{\u00b6 66} O\u2019Malley\u2019s last assignment of error on appeal is:</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">{\u00b6 67} \u201cI. The trial court committed reversible error by not finding that the contract between the city of Cleveland and Allega requires electricians to perform the electrical duct bank and manhole work at Cleveland airport.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">{\u00b6 68} Based on the foregoing analysis, the parties\u2019 remaining assignments of error are moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">Judgment reversed and cause dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b610-9\">Timothy E.
