Seminatore appeals from a judgment of the common pleas court that adopted the final report of a court-appointed Special Master in connection with the winding up of the general partnership of Climaco, Climaco, Seminatore, Lefkowitz &amp; Garofoli in accordance with R.C. 1775.36.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">{\u00b6 2} On appeal, Seminatore raises four assignments of error, charging in two of them that the court abused its discretion in adopting findings of the Special Master regarding partnership assets and liabilities and regarding no breach of fiduciary duty, claiming that these findings were against the manifest weight of the evidence. In the other two assignments of error, he argues that the court abused its discretion in awarding sanctions against him and in dismissing his fraud claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">{\u00b6 3} After a thorough review of the record before us, we have concluded that the Special Master\u2019s report is supported by competent, credible evidence, and we therefore reject the first and second assignments of error. Further, because Seminatore has failed to present us with either a transcript of proceedings or an App.R. 9 statement of the contempt hearing on his fraud claim, we are unable to conduct meaningful review of the third and fourth assignments of error, and we therefore summarily overrule them.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-10\">{\u00b6 4} The record before us reveals that, in 1976, several attorneys, including Seminatore, formed the General Partnership of Climaco, Climaco, Seminatore, Lefkowitz &amp; Garofoli, from which they practiced law. Thereafter, the General Partnership leased office space in the Leader Building in downtown Cleveland.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-11\">{\u00b6 5} In 1982, the members of the General Partnership formed a legal professional association, Climaco, Climaco, Seminatore, Lefkowitz and Garofoli, L.P.A. (hereinafter \u201cthe Firm\u201d), but because they already had a lease in the name of the General Partnership, the Firm subleased the office space from the General Partnership. In 1986, when the Firm moved to the Halle Office Building, it continued to use the General Partnership as a \u201cpass through\u201d entity, i.e., the General Partnership leased the office space, and the Firm then subleased the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>space from the partnership. The General Partnership\u2019s assets were limited to furniture, artwork, and equipment purchased to furnish the Firm\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">{\u00b6 6} On April 17, 1997, the Firm terminated Seminatore, and as a result, he sued the firm in common pleas court case No. 352977, where the court entered a directed verdict in favor of the Firm on his claims for wrongful termination, promissory estoppel, and breach of fiduciary duty. On appeal, however, in App. No. 76658, we reversed in part, remanding his promissory estoppel and breach of fiduciary duty claims. On further appeal, the Supreme Court denied the parties\u2019 discretionary cross-appeals. See <em>Seminatore v. Climaco, Climaco, Lefkowitz &amp; Garofoli Co., L.P.A. </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 1513, 746 N.E.2d 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">{\u00b6 7} At the time of his termination from the Firm, Seminatore owned a 12.75 percent interest in the General Partnership. On November 15, 1999, he filed a complaint in common pleas court for dissolution and an accounting of the General Partnership, and a fraud claim under R.C. 1777.99, naming the partnership and the individual partners as defendants. During the course of proceedings, one of the partners, Michael Climaco, sought affirmative relief from the remaining partners and requested the court order them to purchase his share in the General Partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">{\u00b6 8} On April 7, 2000, the General Partnership filed a motion for sanctions against Seminatore, asserting that his claim under R.C. 1777.99 constituted frivolous conduct because that statute had been repealed in 1996. On May 18, 2000, the court conducted a hearing on the motion for sanctions; however, our record does not contain a transcript or App.R. 9 statement of that hearing. Thereafter, the court imposed sanctions against Seminatore in the amount of $1,732.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">{\u00b6 9} On September 6, 2000, the court dismissed Seminatore\u2019s fraud claim, ordered the dissolution of the General Partnership, and referred the winding-up of the partnership to a Special Master. The Special Master met with the parties and reviewed depositions, pleading, briefs, exhibits and the court file, and conducted a physical inspection of the leased space in the Halle Building.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">{\u00b6 10} On November 7, 2000, the Special Master issued a final report, finding, inter alia, that the General Partnership was only a \u201cpass through\u201d entity, with no source of revenue other than funds it received from the Firm; that it had been the lessee of office space in the Halle Building in downtown Cleveland, and that lease constituted a liability because the rental amount exceeded market value; and that the only assets of the partnership consisted of furniture, equipment, and artwork. The Special Master determined that the liability of the lease exceeded the estimated value of the partnership assets, and, therefore, he recommended that Seminatore and Michael Climaco be discharged from any liabilities of the partnership but that they be found to have no claim to any partnership assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>{\u00b6 11} Two days later, on November 9, 2000, the trial court adopted the final report of the Special Master. On November 21, 2000, Seminatore filed a motion to vacate the court\u2019s order adopting the Special Master\u2019s report, arguing he had 14 days to file objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">{\u00b6 12} On December 5, 2000, Seminatore filed this appeal, raising four assignments of error for our review. The first two state:</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cThe trial court abused its discretion when it adopted the findings of the court-appointed Special Master regarding partnership assets and liabilities which findings were not supported by the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cThe trial court abused its discretion when it adopted the finding by the court-appointed Special Master of no breach of fiduciary duty which was not supported by the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">{\u00b6 15} Seminatore argues that the Special Master\u2019s report is against the manifest weight of the evidence and that the court erred in adopting this report without allowing him 14 days to file objections in accordance with Civ.R. 53 procedures. Seminatore alleges \u201cclear documentary and testimonial evidence\u201d before the Special Master established that the General Partnership had valuable assets and no liabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">{\u00b6 16} The General Partnership, on the other hand, asserts that it was only a \u201cpass through\u201d entity, with no source of revenue, and that its lease was a major liability that exceeded any assets. It further asserts that we should presume regularity because Seminatore failed to produce a record of the proceedings before the Special Master.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">{\u00b6 17} Based on our review of that record, we are unable to conclude that the Special Master\u2019s report is against the manifest weight of the evidence. It is well established that judgments supported by some competent, credible evidence will not be reversed by a reviewing court as being against the manifest weight of the evidence. See <em>C.E. Moms Co. v. Foley Constr. Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 279, 8 O.O.3d 261, 376 N.E.2d 578. Here, the limited record supports the Special Master\u2019s conclusion that the General Partnership did not breach any fiduciary duty and that the General Partnership\u2019s lease constituted a significant liability which exceeded its assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">{\u00b6 18} In particular, both parties relied on a \u201cTrial Depreciation Report\u201d prepared by Ernst &amp; Young in 1994, which analyzed the partnership assets and liabilities when another partner, Thomas Colaluca, left the Firm. In this report, Ernst &amp; Young found the fair market value of improvements made to the leasehold \u201cto be zero\u201d because of their fixed nature, which made them the lessor\u2019s property under the terms of the lease. It further found the estimated value of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>the General Partnership\u2019s furniture and equipment to be $65,358; naturally, this figure would have depreciated since then.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">{\u00b6 19} On the other hand, using the lease-analysis table appended to the Ernst &amp; Young report, commencing on April 1997, and through the life of the lease, the date of Seminatore\u2019s termination, the General Partnership will be liable for a $1,132,679 overpayment on the fair market value of the lease at the Halle Building. As noted by the General Partnership, because of the Firm\u2019s downsizing, much of this space is unused, and cheaper, more practical office space is readily available. Therefore, based on the exhibits before the Special Master, his finding that the partnership\u2019s liabilities exceeded its assets is supported by the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">{\u00b6 20} Given the state of the record, and without any contrary evidence to rebut the contents of the documentation reviewed by the Special Master, we are constrained to conclude the Special Master\u2019s findings are supported by competent, credible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">{\u00b6 21} With respect to Seminatore\u2019s procedural contention that the court denied him the opportunity to object to the Special Master\u2019s report in accordance with Civ.R. 53, there are two reasons why this challenge must fail: First, the procedures set forth in Civ.R. 53, as amended in 1995, no longer expressly apply to noncourt-employed special masters, see, e.g., <em>State ex rel. Head of Claims, Allstate Ins. Co. v. Gaul </em>(1999), 131 Ohio App.3d 419, 722 N.E.2d 616, citing the Staff Note to the amendment of Civ.R. 53(D) in 1995 (\u201cPrior language largely drawn from Federal Civil Rule 53 relative to special masters and largely applicable to situations where special masters were appointed for individual cases and were not court employees is eliminated.\u201d); second, even assuming arguendo that this rule applies by analogy, Seminatore cannot prevail because, pursuant to Civ.R. 53(E)(4)(c), he had an obligation to actually file objections even after the court adopted the Special Master\u2019s report, and he failed to do so. Accordingly, he has waived the opportunity to present this argument on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">{\u00b6 22} Civ.R. 53(E)(3)(b) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c(b) * * * A party shall not assign as error on appeal the court\u2019s adoption of any finding of fact or conclusion of law unless the party has objected to that finding or conclusion under this rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">{\u00b6 24} Although Civ.R. 53(E)(3)(a) provides a party 14 days to file objections, Civ.R. 53(E)(4)(c) states:</p>\n<p id=\"b654-10\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c(c) Permanent and interim orders. The court may adopt a magistrate\u2019s decision and enter judgment without waiting for timely objections by the parties, but the filing of timely written objections shall operate as an automatic stay of execution of that judgment until the court disposes of those objections and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>vacates, modifies, or adheres to the judgment previously entered.\u201d As we stated in <em>Riolo v. Navin </em>(Apr. 4, 2002), Cuyahoga App. No. 79809, 2002-Ohio-1551, at \u00b6 22, 2002 WL 502408:</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cHere, although the magistrate\u2019s report and the trial court\u2019s order adopting it had been filed on the same day, Civ.R. 58(E)(4)(c) afforded Navin fourteen days to file objections and effect the automatic stay provision of that rule. He failed to do so and, therefore, pursuant Civ.R. 53(E)(3)(b), he has waived the right to file an appeal from that judgment. Accord <em>Thompson v. Thompson </em>(Aug. 10, 2001), Portage App. No. 2000-P-0110, unreported [2001 WL 901252]; <em>Huffman v. Huffman </em>(July 13, 2001), Trumbull App. No. 2000-T-0095, unreported [2001 WL 799882]; <em>Simms v. Simms </em>(Mar. 27, 1998), Portage App. No. 97-P-0005, unreported [1998 WL 156886].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">{\u00b6 27} We agree with the dissent\u2019s view that Civ.R. 53 does not apply to this case; however, it is Seminatore who relies solely on this rule to support his contention that the court erred in not affording him an opportunity to object to the Special Master\u2019s report; moreover, neither Seminatore nor the dissent have been able to point to any other legal authority to support the proposition that a trial court must provide the party with a reasonable period of time to file objections to a special master\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">{\u00b6 28} Thus, because of the absence of any authority to the contrary, Semina-tore\u2019s only tenable argument is that Civ.R. 53 applies by analogy, and that he had 14 days to file objections. However, he never did so, and Civ.R. 53(E)(4)(c) clearly contemplates the court\u2019s adoption of a magistrate\u2019s ruling without waiting for objections and does not relieve a party from the duty to file those objections if the court prematurely adopts the magistrate\u2019s report. <em>Riolo, </em>supra. Here, Seminatore never filed objections to the Special Master\u2019s report, and even if he had the right to do so by analogy to Civ.R. 53, this failure constitutes waiver of his right to appeal from that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">{\u00b6 29} Accordingly, these assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">{\u00b6 30} Seminatore\u2019s third and fourth assignments state:</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cThe trial court abused its discretion in awarding sanctions against Mr, Seminatore.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cThe trial court abused its discretion in dismissing Mr. Seminatore\u2019s fraud claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-11\">{\u00b6 33} We are unable to review Seminatore\u2019s third and fourth assignments of error due to a lack of record. Here, he claims that the trial court erred in dismissing his fraud claim and imposing sanctions after conducting a hearing on these matters. Patently, however, he failed to produce the transcript of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>hearing as part of the record on appeal, nor has he presented an App.R. 9 statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">{\u00b6 34} \u201c[I]n the absence of a record, the proceedings at trial are presumed correct.\u201d <em>State v. Brown </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 305, 314, 528 N.E.2d 523, fn. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">{\u00b6 35} As the court stated in <em>Knapp v. Edwards Laboratories </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 197, 199,15 O.O.3d 218, 400 N.E.2d 384:</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cThe duty to provide a transcript for appellate review falls upon the appellant. This is necessarily so because an appellant bears the burden of showing error by reference to matters in the record. * * * When portions of the transcript necessary for resolution of assigned errors are omitted from the record, the reviewing court has nothing to pass upon and thus, as to those assigned errors, the court has no choice but to presume the validity of the lower court\u2019s proceedings, and affirm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">{\u00b6 37} Further, \u201c[i]f a transcript is \u2018unavailable\u2019 an appellant has an obligation to provide a complete record pursuant to App.R. 9(C), (D) or (E).\u201d <em>State v. Nero </em>(Feb. 21, 2002), Cuyahoga App. No. 79866, 2002-Ohio-656, at \u00b620, 2002 WL 337729, quoting <em>State v. Newell </em>(Dec. 6, 1990), Cuyahoga App. Nos. 56801 and 60128, 1990 WL 193357.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">{\u00b6 38} Based on Seminatore\u2019s failure to provide a transcript or an App.R. 9 statement of these proceedings, we must presume regularity and summarily reject the third and fourth assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b656-10\">Ann Dyke, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b656-11\">Diane Karpinski, A.J., dissents in part.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b656-12\">Karpinski, Administrative Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AYi\">dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-13\">{\u00b6 39} With regard to appellant\u2019s Assignments of Error III and IV, relating to the court granting appellees\u2019 motion for sanctions against him, I concur with the majority\u2019s decision to overrule these claimed errors because of appellant\u2019s failure to provide this court with either a transcript from the sanctions hearing or any of the other items specified in App.R. 9.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>{\u00b6 40} . On Assignments I and II, however, I dissent. The majority ignores what, to my mind, is a glaring procedural error committed by the trial court and which, left unremedied by this court, strips appellant, Kenneth F. Seminatore, of his right to object to the Special Master\u2019s report and thus of his right to a judicial determination of whether the Special Master committed any errors in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">{\u00b6 41} The first and only pertinent question in this appeal is whether appellant should have been permitted an opportunity to file his objections and have them reviewed by the trial court. For the reasons set forth below, this question must be answered in the affirmative. Because the trial court did not provide appellant an opportunity to make meaningful objections to the Special Master\u2019s report, I would reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">{\u00b6 42} Between 1976 and 1999, appellant and appellees were partners in CCSL&amp;G, a general partnership. On November 15, 1999, pursuant to Ohio\u2019s Partnership Act, as codified in R.C. 1775.01 et seq., appellant filed a complaint for dissolution of the general partnership. In his complaint, appellant demanded an accounting of CCSL&amp;G\u2019s assets and liabilities and made a fraud claim under R.C. 1777.99, which was repealed on July 1, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">{\u00b6 43} Despite the fact that the criminal tax statute embodied in R.C. 1777.99 had been repealed, appellant filed a motion for summary judgment on that claim. Appellees opposed the motion and simultaneously filed a motion for sanctions, in which they argued that appellant should be sanctioned, pursuant to R.C. 2323.51, for filing a claim that no longer existed under Ohio law. The trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granted appellees\u2019 motion for sanctions. Following a sanctions hearing, the court granted sanctions against appellant in the amount of $1,732.50, dismissed appellant\u2019s claim for fraud, ordered dissolution of the partnership, including an accounting pursuant to R.C. 1775.21, and appointed a noncourt employee, Patrick D\u2019Angelo, as a special master to wind up the affairs of the partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">{\u00b6 44} Instead of a hearing, the parties, by agreement, submitted evidence to the Special Master regarding the wind-up of the partnership\u2019s affairs. In their respective briefs, the parties provided evidence relating to the valuation of the partnership\u2019s assets. On November 7, 2000, the Special Master filed his final report, in which appellant was to be disharged from any partnership liabilities and was found to have no claim to any of the partnership assets. <em>Two days later, </em>the trial court adopted the findings of the Special Master\u2019s report and dismissed the entire case. On November 21, 2000, appellant filed a \u201cMotion For Court to Vacate Order Adopting The Final Report Of The Special Master.\u201d In that motion, appellant argued that because the trial court did not wait the fourteen-day period specified in Civ.R. 53(E)(3)(a) before it adopted the Special Master\u2019s report, he was effectively robbed of his ability to file substantive objections to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>that report. In that same motion, appellant also requested an extension of time within which to file objections to the report. The court denied appellant\u2019s motion as moot. On December 5, 2000, this appeal was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">{\u00b6 45} In his complaint, appellant requested judicial dissolution of the partnership and an accounting of its assets. Judicial dissolution of a partnership is a special proceeding. R.C. 2505.02; <em>Celebrezze v. Netzley </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 89, 554 N.E.2d 1292, citing <em>Tilberry v. Body </em>(1986), 24 Ohio St.3d 117, 24 OBR 308, 493 N.E.2d 954. This request seeks relief in equity and is governed by R.C. 1775.01 et seq. As required by R.C. 1775.21, once the trial court entered its decree of judicial dissolution of the partnership, the court ordered an accounting of the partnership assets. For this purpose the court appointed D\u2019Angelo as Special Master to conduct the accounting and wind up the partnership\u2019s affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">{\u00b6 46} The trial court and the parties maintain that they conformed their conduct according to Civ.R. 53, which states as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">{\u00b6 47} \u201c(A) Appointment</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">{\u00b6 48} \u201cA court of record may appoint one or more <em>magistrates </em>who shall be attorneys at law admitted to practice in Ohio. A magistrate appointed under this rule may also serve as a magistrate under Crim.R. 19 or as a traffic magistrate.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">{\u00b6 49} This rule neither specifically mentions special masters nor authorizes the type of special master appointed in this case. Civ.R. 53 applies solely to magistrates.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">{\u00b6 50} In a previous decision in <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Gaul </em>(1999), 131 Ohio App.3d 419, 722 N.E.2d 616, this court explained that, following the 1995 amendments to Civ.R. 53, \u201cthe current rule * * * eliminated any alleged authority for the appointment of a non-court-employed special master in an individual case.\u201d <em>Allstate </em>at 434, 722 N.E.2d 616. The <em>Allstate </em>case relied upon the Staff Note to the 1995 amendment to Civ.R. 53(D):</p>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">{\u00b6 51} \u201cPrior language largely drawn from Federal Civil Rule 53 relative to special masters and largely applicable to situations where special masters were appointed for individual cases and were not court employees is eliminated. * * * \u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b658-12\">{\u00b6 52} The Staff Note makes it clear that any case referred by a trial court under the rule must be to a \u201cmagistrate,\u201d that is, \u201ca public civil officer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-13\">{\u00b6 53} D\u2019Angelo, so far as I can tell from the record, is an attorney in private practice. He is not a court employee or public civil officer and, therefore, by definition, he cannot be a magistrate as defined by Civ.R. 53. Civ.R. 53, therefore, does not apply to either the proceedings D\u2019Angelo conducted or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>final report he prepared, because he is not a magistrate. The majority, however, claims Seminatore waived this issue on appeal because he did not comply with Civ.R. 53(E)(4)(c). This rule applies only to \u201ca magistrate\u2019s decision.\u201d Since D\u2019Angelo is not a \u201cmagistrate,\u201d the rule cannot impose any requirement on Seminatore.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">{\u00b6 54} The next question is whether Civ.R. 53 should exclusively govern appointment of a person to monitor the wind-up of a partnership\u2019s affairs and whether a trial court may refer the winding up of a partnership\u2019s affairs to a nonjudicial person. Judicial dissolution of a partnership is a \u201cspecial statutory proceeding.\u201d Civ.R. 1(C) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">{\u00b6 55} \u201cThese rules, to the extent that they would by their nature be clearly inapplicable, shall not apply to procedure * * * (7) in all other special statutory proceedings * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">{\u00b6 56} As stated in Price <em>v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp. </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St.2d 131,133, 24 O.O.3d 237, 435 N.E.2d 1114:</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">{\u00b6 57} \u201c \u2018[T]he civil rules should be held to be clearly inapplicable only when their use will alter the basic statutory purpose for which the specific procedure was originally provided in the special statutory action.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>State ex rel. Millington v. Weir </em>(1978), 60 Ohio App.2d 348, 349,14 O.O.3d 310, 397 N.E.2d 770.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">{\u00b6 58} The question, then, is whether the rule alters the basic statutory purpose embodied in R.C. Chapter 1775, which governs the dissolution and winding up of partnerships. At the outset, it must be noted that part of the purpose of the statute is to allow parties, that is, partners and partnerships, to obtain prompt, orderly, and accurate determinations relating to dissolution and the winding up of the partnership\u2019s affairs. This legislative goal with regard to dissolution and winding up, however, would be thwarted if Civ.R. 53 were the exclusive means by which a settlement of the partnership\u2019s accounts could be accomplished.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">{\u00b6 59} Requiring only court-employed magistrates to deal with the settlement and final accounting of partnership accounts would burden the already overcrowded dockets of these civil officers. It is not clear, moreover, that the winding-up process even requires judicial powers. What is needed is more akin to accounting experience. I believe there would be little argument by litigants that the winding-up process should be conducted by someone with special expertise in such matters. I do not believe, therefore, that Civ.R. 53 is the exclusive means at the court\u2019s disposal in the specific matter of settling the final accounts of a partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>{\u00b6 60} In some special proceedings, particularly a judicial dissolution of a corporation or other type of association, the appointment of a master commissioner is expressly authorized. E.g., R.C. 1702.50 (corporate dissolution); R.C. 1729.61 (association dissolution).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Unlike other sections of R.C. Title 17, the section governing partnerships, however, does not expressly permit appointment of a master commissioner, although R.C. 1775.36 states that partners \u201cmay obtain winding up by the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">{\u00b6 61} R.C. 1702.50 was revised and became effective on April 10, 2001 and R.C. 1729.61 on August 5, 1998. The revision of both code sections went into effect after the changes in Civ.R. 53 became effective on July 1, 1998. The section on winding up a partnership, however, has not been revised since 1953. The nature of the proceeding that was referred here \u2014 that is, a winding up \u2014 is a process synonymous with the process of an accounting of or settling of the partnership accounts. Moreover, it is also an action in equity. 13 Ohio Jurisprudence 3d (1995), Business Relationships, Section 1241. I can see no reason to distinguish between the winding up of a partnership and the same process for a corporation or association dissolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">{\u00b6 62} It has been well established:</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">{\u00b6 63} \u201cWhere a petition for an accounting is one in which relief can be afforded only by a court of equity, the plaintiff is not entitled to a trial by jury and the court has the power to send the case to a referee.\u201d 1 Ohio Jurisprudence 3d (1998), Accounts and Accounting, Sections 38 and 41, citing <em>Kinkopf v. Scherer </em>(1932), 11 Ohio Law Abs. 422, 1932 WL 2310.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">{\u00b6 64} Even if there is no express statutory authority to appoint a nonemployee master in the particular instance of a partnership\u2019s winding up, a court in equity deciding a case as a special statutory proceeding in which the parties are not entitled to a trial by jury still retains its inherent power to refer a special proceeding to a special master. See <em>Cassidy v. Glossip </em>(1967), 12 Ohio St.2d 17, 41 O.O.2d 153, 231 N.E.2d 64. Such a person \u201cshall hear the evidence and prepare findings of fact and conclusions of law * * <em>McCann v. Maxwell </em>(1963), 174 Ohio St. 282, 283, 22 O.O.2d 339, 189 N.E.2d 143.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>{\u00b6 65} Accordingly, because the dissolution and winding up of a partnership\u2019s affairs are matters in equity and the fundamental work that needs to be done is more akin to an audit or an accounting, I conclude that a trial court may refer such matters to special masters, and that special masters do not fall under Civ.R. 53; they are nonjudicial persons, not magistrates.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>McConnell v. Hunt Sports Enters. </em>(1999), 132 Ohio App.3d 657, 725 N.E.2d 1193 (liquidating trustee appointed to wind up partnership affairs); see, also, R.C. 2311.04; <em>Allstate, </em>at 431, 722 N.E.2d 616, citing <em>Dillon v. Cleveland </em>(1927), 117 Ohio St. 258, 268, 158 N.E. 606; see <em>Nowak, v. Nowak </em>(May 4, 1977), Belmont App. No. 1199, unreported, 1977 Ohio App. LEXIS 10233; 80 Ohio Jurisprudence 3d (1988) 625, References, Section 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">{\u00b6 66} The central dispute in the case at bar is appellant\u2019s missed opportunity to object to the Special Master\u2019s report. Because Civ.R. 53 does not control the proceedings below, the trial court cannot be held to the procedure the rule provides for appellant\u2019s objections to that report.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">{\u00b6 67} There is no provision in R.C. Chapter 1775 as to when objections should be filed to a final accounting of a partnership\u2019s affairs. Absent such authority, one cannot simply borrow the \u201c14 days\u201d specified in Civ.R. 53 and arbitrarily impose it on litigants who want to file objections. There is clear legal authority, however, for the proposition that parties are entitled not only to file objections to a special master\u2019s final report, but also to receive a full review of any objections made, along with a decision from the trial court that affirmatively and finally determines the rights of the parties. <em>McCann v. Maxwell </em>(1963), 174 Ohio St. 282, 284, 22 O.O.2d 339,189 N.E.2d 143. See, also, <em>Crane v. Cheek </em>(1970), 27 Ohio App.2d 27, 56 O.O.2d 208, 272 N.E.2d 159 (advisory jury verdict, based upon issues of fact presented to them, is not conclusive or binding upon the court whose duty it is to determine finally the issues tried by the jury, their verdict being merely evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">{\u00b6 68} There is no authority allowing a trial court to simply \u201cadopt\u201d the final accounting report of a special master without first providing the parties with a reasonable period of time, following the filing of the report, within which to file objections, if any.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Burckhardt v. Burckhardt </em>(1885), 42 Ohio St. 474, 1885 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>WL 42. Then, if objections are submitted, the trial court must review and determine the validity of the report as it would any evidence in light of any objections made. The trial court may not delegate its duty to \u201cdecide\u201d the case to a special master, especially because the special master is not a court employee and invested with no judicial power.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>McCann, </em>supra; <em>Burckhardt, </em>supra; <em>Lavelle v. Pickett </em>(June 13, 1985), Cuyahoga App. Nos. 48978, 48982 and 49010, 1985 WL 6847; See 1 American Jurisprudence 2d (1964), Accounts and Accounting, Section 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">{\u00b6 69} The record here, scant as it is, indicates that appellant filed a motion to vacate the court\u2019s order adopting the Special Master\u2019s report and simultaneously requested an opportunity to file objections. The request for additional time to file substantive objections is, itself, a clear indication that appellant objected to the Special Master\u2019s report. I, therefore, disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that appellant failed to object and thus waived that issue here on appeal. The trial court erred in adopting the Special Master\u2019s final report before the parties, especially appellant, had an opportunity to submit objections to the findings set forth in that report. Accordingly, I would sustain appellant\u2019s Assignments of Error I and II.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b656-14\">. The parties in this case expressly waived any hearing on the merits before the Special Master. Because they agreed to submit their case on briefs, there was no hearing to transcribe and the only record required by App.R. 9 is the written documents the parties submitted to the Special Master. Everything the parties submitted and everything the special master reviewed in making his report is in this court\u2019s file.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b660-9\">. <em>Allstate, </em>supra, expressly acknowledged that the appointment of a special master under these two statutes and certain others is valid.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b660-10\">. In <em>Allstate, </em>supra, this court denied the sua sponte appointment of an agent in a personal injury case to gather information on behalf of one of the parties at the cost of the opposing parties. Reversing that appointment, this court distinguished between those facts and those in <em>McCann, </em>supra, in which a court in equity referred to a Master Commissioner an action in which the parties were not entitled to a trial by jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b661-8\">. At this juncture, it should be noted that persons appointed by trial courts to wind up the affairs of corporations or partnerships have been called by many names: \"special masters,\" \"referees,\u201d \"liquidating trustees,\u201d \"master commissioners,\u201d and \"special master commissioners.\u201d To achieve a uniform nomenclature in making such appointments, it is preferable that the term \"magistrate\u201d be reserved for the type of person specified in Civ.R. 53, that is, a court employee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b661-9\">. I refrain from suggesting a specific period of time that would be \"reasonable,\u201d but do note that a trial court's adoption of a final report, as in this case, without allowing for the filing or consideration of any possible objections is patently unreasonable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b662-12\">. A special master, unlike a magistrate, does not take an oath. Magistrates, on the other hand, are invested with executive or judicial power.
