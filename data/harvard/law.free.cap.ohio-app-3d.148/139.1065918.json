The trial court based its ruling on Ohio\u2019s equine liability immunity law, which defines an \u201cequine\u201d as \u201ca horse, pony, mule, donkey, hinny, zebra, zebra hybrid, or alpaca.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (A similar Florida statute<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> defines an equine as \u201ca horse, pony, mule, or donkey,\u201d leaving one to speculate whether hinny, zebra, zebra hybrid, and alpaca riding are more common \u2014 or more deserving of protection \u2014 in Ohio than in Florida.) But in our case, a horse is a horse.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-13\">{\u00b6 2} This is a case of first impression in Ohio, probably because no one before has been audacious enough to try to ride the statute to immunity in a case like this one. The trial court granted summary judgment. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>\n<em>Donahue\u2019s Dogs Chase Gibson\u2019s Horse, Causing it to Throw Gibson</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">{\u00b6 3} Appellant, Ann Sergeant Gibson, was injured after being thrown by her horse while riding in Clippenger Field, located in the City of the Village of Indian Hill (yes, that is its official name). Appellee Susan Donahue owned two full-grown Irish Setters that she allowed to run off-leash in the field, even though the field was clearly marked \u201cThis area restricted to Equestrian use only.\u201d Donahue\u2019s dogs chased Gibson\u2019s horse, causing the horse to throw Gibson into a tree with sufficient force to break her helmet. She suffered serious injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">{\u00b6 4} The facts are simple enough, but lawyers and legislators can make things seem complicated. Somehow, Donahue\u2019s lawyers found R.C. 2305.321, entitled \u201cImmunity as to equine activity risks,\u201d which is noteworthy mainly for using the word \u201cfarrier\u201d ten times. Because the statute is a bit obscure, we have included it here in its entirety, as an appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">{\u00b6 5} We have found only one Ohio case interpreting this gem of legislative drafting, but that case is not helpful to our issues here.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We have also searched in vain for any way that this statute has anything to do with this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">\n<em>Three Hurdles</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">{\u00b6 6} Gibson\u2019s first assignment of error asserts that summary judgment was improper. We review the grant of summary judgment in favor of Donahue de novo, using the same standard that the trial court applied.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under Civ.R. 56(C), summary judgment for Donahue was appropriate if (1) there was no genuine issue of material fact, (2) Donahue was entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) after construing the evidence most favorably for Gibson, reasonable minds could only reach a conclusion adverse to Gibson.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">{\u00b6 7} For Donahue to prevail, she had to clear three legal hurdles by establishing that (1) Indian Hill was the \u201csponsor\u201d of an \u201cequine event,\u201d (2) Gibson was engaging in an \u201cequine activity\u201d as defined by the statute, and (3) the immunity granted to the sponsor also shielded anyone else. And, as Judge Hildebrandt notes in his concurrence, even if all those hurdles were jumped, another section of the law might trump the equine act.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>{\u00b6 8} The first hurdle is questionable at best, the second even more so, but the third is insurmountable in this case. And, as far as we know, Donahue does not even have a horse, only two dogs.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">\n<em>Did Indian Hill Sponsor Gibson\u2019s Ride?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">{\u00b6 9} The trial court, in granting summary judgment, held that Indian Hill was immune as a \u201csponsor\u201d of an equine activity. That may or may not be so, but Indian Hill was not even sued. Donahue was sued.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">{\u00b6 10} While it is true that riders must pay a fee to Indian Hill to ride over <em>any </em>property in the city, we are skeptical that this fact alone would make Indian Hill a \u201csponsor\u201d of any person riding within the city. The city manager of Indian Hill testified as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cQ: Okay. Is it fair to say that you don\u2019t sponsor any type of equestrian events in Clippenger Field?</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cMR. SKINNER: Objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cMR. PHILLIPS: Objection. Calls for legal conclusion. You can answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cA: You know, I\u2019ve read that section of the law, it\u2019s \u2014 to me it\u2019s tough to read so\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b179-12\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cBY MR. DRINNON: I\u2019m trying to do the best I can.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-13\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cA: I really \u2014 I don\u2019t have a conclusion on that as to how we fit into that section of law in terms of what is sponsored and what is an activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-14\">{\u00b6 17} If the meaning of \u201csponsor\u201d calls for a legal conclusion, then it should be defined in the statute, which it is not. \u201cEquine activity sponsor\u201d is purportedly defined, but it is not a true, but a circular definition \u2014 one that uses the word itself to define itself. \u201cSponsor\u201d is not defined at all. Lacking a statutory definition, we resort to dictionaries. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary states that a sponsor is \u201c1. One who acts as a surety for another. 2. A legislator who proposes a bill. 3. <em>Civil law. </em>One who voluntarily intervenes for another without being requested to do so.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The only definition of sponsor in Webster\u2019s Third International Dictionary, Unabridged, that could be relevant here is \u201cone who assumes responsibility for some other person or thing.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>{\u00b6 18} Neither definition seems to help' Indian Hill, much less Donahue. \u201cSponsor\u201d as a verb is defined as \u201cto be or stand sponsor for: accept responsibility for.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Of course, the statute seeks to <em>avoid </em>responsibility, not to accept it.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">{\u00b6 19} Perhaps we can glean from the definitions and the statute that the latter seeks to immunize a person or entity that would otherwise be regarded as taking responsibility for an equine activity. Thus interpreted, it makes some sense \u2014 why write a statute to immunize activity that would give rise to no liability in the first place? If Indian Hill had indeed sponsored an event, and Gibson\u2019s horse had fallen because of a gopher hole in the field, she might have made a case against the sponsor of the event. In that instance, the statute arguably would have immunized Indian Hill, the sponsor, from that type of \u201cinherent risk of equine activity.\u201d The legislature obviously intended to grant just such immunity. (When the statute is digested, it seems only to immunize activity that would not have given rise to liability under the common law in the first place.) Even had Indian Hill sponsored an event, if Donahue had loosed her dogs to chase the horses in a sponsored event, the immunity would not have shielded her \u2014 only the sponsor.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">{\u00b6 20} But even were we to hold that the first hurdle \u2014 sponsorship\u2014could be jumped, there are still two more, each progressively higher.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Was <em>Gibson Engaged in an \u201cEquine Activity\u201d?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">{\u00b6 21} We are also skeptical that simply riding one\u2019s own horse is \u201cequine activity\u201d as defined in the statute. As we have seen, a ride that is \u201csponsored\u201d might fit, but an unsponsored ride would not, at least under Ohio\u2019s statute. Some states define \u201cequine activity\u201d much more broadly than does Ohio. For instance, North Carolina defines it as \u201cany activity involving an equine.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">{\u00b6 22} But, under the definition in Ohio\u2019s statute,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> just riding one\u2019s own horse in a non-sponsored event is not \u201cequine activity.\u201d But whether it could be or not, the next hurdle is far too high for Gibson to surmount.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">\n<em>\u201cAnyone in the World\u201d?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">{\u00b6 23} Donahue next contends that the language of the statute immunizes <em>anyone. </em>She cites this language: \u201can equine activity sponsor, equine activity participant, equine professional, veterinarian, farrier, <em>or other person </em>is not liable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>in damages in a tort or other civil action for harm that an equine activity participant allegedly sustains during an equine activity and that results from an inherent risk of an equine activity.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">{\u00b6 24} For Donahue to prevail, we would have to read the phrase as \u201cequine activity sponsor, equine activity participant, equine professional, veterinarian, farrier, <em>or any other person in the whole world.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">{\u00b6 25} A person who negligently crashes an airplane into the crowd at an equine event would thus be immune from liability, at least for injuries to thrown riders, as would someone who lets his or her dog run out in the middle of a steeplechase.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">{\u00b6 26} The old legal maximum ejusdem generis surely applies here: \u201cwhere general words follow the enumeration of particular classes of things, the general words will be construed as applying only to things of the same general class as those enumerated.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Words like \u201cany other person\u201d will be read as any other of like kind. \u201cThere is a general expression, \u2018other person whatsoever;\u2019 but, according to a well established rule in the construction of statutes, general terms following particular ones apply only to such persons or things as are <em>ejusdem generis </em>with those comprehended in the language of the legislature.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">{\u00b6 27} The Ohio Supreme Court has frequently applied ejusdem generis as a canon of construction: \u201cwhere in a statute terms are first used which are confined to a particular class of objects having well-known and definite features and characteristics, and then afterwards a term having perhaps a broader signification is conjoined, such latter term is, as indicative of legislative intent, to be considered as embracing only things of a similar character as those comprehended by the preceding limited and confined terms.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">{\u00b6 28} The newest edition of Black\u2019s Law Dictionary states, \u201cFor example, in the phrase <em>horses, cattle, sheep, pigs, goats, or any other barnyard animal, </em>the general language <em>or any other barnyard animal </em>* * * would probably be held to include only four-legged, hoofed mammals.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> (Emphasis sic.) Similarly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>\u201c* * *[b]y the words \u2018other things,\u2019 nothing shall be intended but things of the like nature with those mentioned.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">{\u00b6 29} In the present case, we could interpret the \u201cother person\u201d following the word \u201cfarrier,\u201d to include \u201cblacksmith,\u201d or perhaps \u201chorse of a different color\u201d; but we cannot interpret it to mean \u201cperson who lets dogs run loose in an equestrian area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\"> {\u00b6 30} The legislature intended to immunize people sponsoring an equine event \u2014 not strangers. The equestrian here was the victim of a third party. We do not read the statute as immunizing third parties. In fact, \u201cThe underlying purpose of these statutes is to protect equine professionals from liability by eliminating the risk of lawsuits that arise out of the inherent dangers of horseback riding, while not exonerating horse owners from liability for negligence.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> If those that the statute seeks to immunize \u2014 horse and stable owners, farriers and other equine professionals \u2014 are not exempt from negligence, it is difficult to imagine that the law immunizes owners of dogs who chase horses.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">{\u00b6 31} We have discovered one case on point, though it has not been cited by the parties. It seems that this very theory was tried in South Dakota, which has a similar statute. There, the defendant, a pipeline company, had left a trench partially unfilled. When the plaintiffs horse fell in the ditch, the pipeline company trotted out the equine liability statute. The South Dakota Supreme Court was not tricked and held, as do we, that \u201c[a]pplying the principle of <em>ejusdem generis, </em>\u2018any other person\u2019 is limited to other people involved in equine activities and does not extend blanket immunity. If the legislature intended to provide immunity to all people, it would not have specifically listed those entitled to immunity.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Just so.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">\n<em>A Hurdle Too High</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">(\u00b6 32} Thus, whether or not Donohue could jump the first two hurdles to immunity, which seems at best doubtful, the last one is a wall, not a hurdle. It is beyond cavil that the equine immunity statute was not intended to, should not, and does not apply to dog owners who allow their dogs to chase horses.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">{\u00b6 33} We do note, however, that the legislature has enacted statutes relevant to this case \u2014 see R.C. 955.22(C) (confinement or restraint of dogs); R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>955.28(B) (liability of dog owner for damages). We do not need to consider whether the latter statute would trump the equine statute, because we hold that the equine statute simply does not apply in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">{\u00b6 34} We sustain Donahue\u2019s first assignment of error and reverse the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. We remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. While we are tempted to address Donahue\u2019s second assignment \u2014 that R.C. 2305.321 is unconstitutionally vague \u2014 our holding makes that issue moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b183-7\">Gorman, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b183-8\">Hildebrandt, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b177-14\">.

R.C. 955.22(C) mandates that a dog owner shall restrain his or her dog by, inter alia, a leash except when the dog, accompanied by its owner, is lawfully engaged in hunting. Failure to keep a dog restrained, in violation of this statute, is a strict-liability offense.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Further, R.C. 955.28(B) imposes liability upon a dog owner for damages as a result of any injury or loss to a person that is caused by the dog unless the injured person has committed certain criminal acts against the dog owner or has abused the dog upon its owner\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-12\">{\u00b6 37} In my opinion, R.C. 2305.321 irreconcilably conflicts with the special provisions of R.C. 955.22 and 955.28. Accordingly, these special provisions prevail.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The trial court should have not entertained the equine statute as a defense to Donahue\u2019s claims but, instead, should have relied on R.C. 955.22 and 955.28, which impose strict liability upon a dog owner for damages caused by the dog. Accordingly, Donahue was not entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>\n<em>Appendix</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">{\u00b6 38} R.C. 2305.321.
