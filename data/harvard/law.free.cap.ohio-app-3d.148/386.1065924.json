Young, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b423-16\">{\u00b6 1} Defendants-appellants, Jasbir Singh, Inderjet Singh, Sohan Singh Bilk-hu, Naunder, Shashpal and Surjit Singh and the Guru Nanak Society Gurudwara, appeal from the decision of the Butler County Common Pleas Court, finding that appellants had improperly incorporated their religious society.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-17\">{\u00b6 2} Appellees, Pyrah Singh Bhatti, Santokh S. and Pushpinder Singh Bhatti, claim that they were members of the Guru Nanak Society (\u201cSociety\u201d). Appellees filed a complaint alleging that appellants violated their authority and power as trustees and executive committee members respectively by failing to follow the provisions of the Society\u2019s constitution and by illegally and improperly creating an Ohio nonprofit corporation, the Guru Nanak Society Gurudwara (\u201cCorporation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>{\u00b6 3} The trial court succinctly and orderly related the facts of the case in its decision as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">{\u00b6 4} \u201c[A]ll [parties] practice the Sikh religion. The Sikh religion was founded by Guru Nanak (1469-1539) in the form of the ten Gurus in India. Nanak\u2019s thought was shaped under the influence of the Hindu Sant tradition of Northern India. The idealistic approach of Sikhism is that it recognizes the existence of the same heavenly light in every human being, rich or poor, high or low, irrespective of caste, creed, color, race, sex, religion or nationality. Based upon that belief, the doors of the Sikh temple (Gurudwara) are open for all in the world without prejudice or social discrimination. Under Sikh belief, every person in this world has an equal right to enter and join the services in the Gurudwara. A discussion of the Sikh religion is relevant within the context of this decision because it is the driving force behind the organization under which the [parties] practice their religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cThe Guru Nanak Society was first organized in southwestern Ohio in the 1970\u2019s for the purpose of practicing the Sikh religion. In May of 1985, a formal constitution was adopted by the Guru Nanak Society listing its principal place of business to be in the city of Cincinnati, Hamilton County, Ohio. The stated purpose in the constitution was to propagate the teachings of Guru Nanak and the Sikh religion and to promote the religious, educational and cultural aspects of the Sikh religion. A final objective was to establish and maintain Sikh centers in the tri-state area.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cArticle Three of the constitution defined general memberships. It states that \u2018Any person irrespective of caste, creed, color, race or sex who subscribes to the objectives of the organization may become a member.\u2019 That section also provides that the annual membership fee shall be one dollar per person. Article Four defines the voting membership. Article Four (A) states, \u2018All members of at least three months standing and above the age of 18 shall be eligible to vote. All voting members shall constitute the General Body.\u2019 Article Five (A) of the constitution states, \u2018The General Body alone, as a primary organ of the organization, shall have the power to amend or revise this constitution and the by-laws for the management of the affairs of the organization.\u2019 Article Six (A) deals with the organization of the executive committee. It states, \u2018There shall be an executive committee consisting of at least five (5) and not more than seven (7) elected from the General Body membership.\u2019 This section further provides that any voting member of the organization can seek election to the executive committee. This article further provides that the executive committee has the authority to perform functions on behalf of the organization in accordance with the constitution and bylaws framed by the General Body from time to time.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>{\u00b6 7} \u201cArticle Twelve provides that, \u2018This constitution can be amended by a two-thirds <em>(%) </em>majority vote of the members either present at a General Body meeting or by votes submitted by and [sic] other means.\u2019 The constitution became the working frame work under which the Guru Nanak Society operated from its adoption through the present.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cIn 1993, the Sikh Temple of Greater Cincinnati came into existence through the filing of tax exempt forms through the state and local government. That organization co-existed at the same time as the Guru Nanak Society and both organizations continue to practice the Sikh religion. Starting in approximately 1993, an effort was made to build a gurudwara by members of the Sikh community. In March of 1994, property was deeded from a member of the Sikh community to the Guru Nanak Society to be used for the construction of a gurudwara.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cContemporaneously with the attempt to build the gurudwara there was also a significant fundraising effort going forward to attempt to obtain the funds for the construction of the temple. In addition, several efforts were underway by members of the Guru Nanak Society to amend the 1985 constitution and bylaws. Simultaneous to that, there were also discussions about formally incorporating the Guru Nanak Society under the laws of the state of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cIn June of 1996 additional land was purchased for the construction of the gurudwara. Subsequently, a mortgage was filed in April of 1988 financing the construction of the temple on the new land. As part of the fundraising efforts, the fundraisers promised that any member who made a donation of five thousand dollars or more would become a permanent member of the board of trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cAs previously mentioned, efforts were going on at the same time to incorporate the Guru Nanak Society to a non-profit corporation under the law of the State of Ohio. An attempt was made to file the Articles of Incorporation during this time. However, those Articles were rejected by the Secretary of State because they were improperly executed. It was not until February 26, 1999 that Articles of Incorporation were formally granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cThis followed a meeting at the gurudwara on January 17, 1999 in which [appellants] claim that the Articles of Incorporation were approved by the General Body of the temple. That issue [was] strongly contested by [appellees] in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">{\u00b6 13} The trial court found that the Corporation was improperly incorporated under the laws of the State of Ohio and thus was void ab inito. The trial court ordered that an interim executive committee be formed to organize and conduct an election in accordance with the Society\u2019s constitution to elect an executive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>committee. Also, the trial court ordered that all title to the property be placed back into the name of the Society and that the appellants provide a full accounting for the assets that they controlled. Finally, appellants were ordered to reimburse the Society for any money the Society expended for the costs of the litigation. Appellants now appeal this decision raising three assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Assignment of Error No. 1</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cThe lower court erred in granting judgment for the plaintiffs and ordering title to all property including the Gurudwara in the name of the Guru Nanak Society and related relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">{\u00b6 15} Appellants contend that the trial court incorrectly dissolved the Corporation by finding that it was void ab inito and ordering all title to property placed back in the name of the Society. Appellants assert that the trial court must follow R.C. 1702.52<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in order to dissolve a corporation, and that the trial court did not meet these statutory requirements. Furthermore, appellants claim that because the Corporation was a corporation under Ohio law and was incorrectly dissolved, they should not have to reimburse the Society for any costs incurred in defense of appellees\u2019 lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">{\u00b6 16} R.C. 1702.08 provides directions for a society or association wishing to incorporate. It states:</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cWhen an unincorporated society or association * * * authorizes the incorporation of such society or association, by the same procedure and affirmative vote of its voting members as the * * * constitution * * * of such society or association requires for an amendment to such fundamental agreement, or if no such vote is specified, by a majority vote of the voting members * * *, at a duly convened meeting the purpose of which is stated in the notice of the meeting, then upon the filing of the articles under section 1702.04 of the Revised Code setting forth such facts and that such required vote has been obtained, such society or association shall become a corporation * * R.C. 1702.08(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">{\u00b6 18} In the case sub judice, the trial court correctly determined that appellants did not follow R.C. 1702.08 in their quest to incorporate the Society. In 1985, the Society formally adopted a constitution. Among other procedural matters, the constitution describes how the Society determines general and voting membership, and conducts the voting and amendment processes.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">{\u00b6 19} Pursuant to Article Five of the constitution, \u201cThe General Body alone, as a primary organ of the organization, shall have the power to amend or revise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>this constitution and the by-laws for the management of the affairs of the organization.\u201d Article Twelve states, \u201cThis Constitution can be amended by a two-thirds (%) majority vote submitted by any other means, provided that the vote is acknowledged by two other members.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">{\u00b6 20} Appellants did not conform to the edicts of the Society\u2019s constitution when they attempted to incorporate the Society. Some of the trustees of the Society discussed and proposed incorporating the Society, but the record relates that no formal vote was taken by the General Body to affirmatively incorporate the Society. Appellants believed the General Body of the Society understood and consented implicitly to the incorporation of the Society. Accordingly, one of the appellants testified that \u201cthere wasn\u2019t any need [to] vote.\u201d Hence, by not conducting a vote among the General Body, appellants did not conform to the Society\u2019s constitution when they attempted to convert the Society into a corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">{\u00b6 21} Consequently, the trial court correctly found that the Society was not properly incorporated pursuant to R.C. 1702.08. Absent a legally created corporation, the trial court was not required to follow R.C. 1702.52. As such, the court did not err in ordering title to the Gurudwara to be placed back in the name of the Society or in ordering appellants to repay the Society for any of the Society\u2019s money used in the defense of the litigation. The Corporation did not legally represent the Society and appellants did not have the authority to use the Society\u2019s money for defense or encumber the Society\u2019s property. Accordingly, appellants\u2019 first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">Assignment of Error No. 2</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cThe lower court erred in granting judgment for the plaintiffs and ordering plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to submit a list of five members of the Guru Nanak Society to serve as an interim executive committee to deal with \u2018interim issues,\u2019 conduct an election, and determine who was eligible to vote.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">{\u00b6 23} Appellants maintain that the trial court erred in ordering an interim executive committee to be formed for the purpose of organizing and conducting an election in accordance with the Society\u2019s constitution. Appellants further contend that the individuals chosen to serve on the interim committee are all of appellees\u2019 choosing and do not represent the Society. They also maintain that it is wrong for this interim committee to determine who is a member of the organization under the Society\u2019s constitution. Finally, appellants contend that the trial court breached the \u201cChurch/State boundary\u201d of the First Amendment in ordering the election to be conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">{\u00b6 24} The government has an inherent power to regulate religious activities in a reasonable and nondiscriminatory manner in order to protect the safety, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>good order, peace, and comfort of society. 16A American Jurisprudence 2d (1998) 284, Constitutional Law, Section 47. However, civil courts lack jurisdiction to hear or determine purely ecclesiastical or spiritual disputes of religious organizations. <em>Tibbs v. Kendrick </em>(1994), 93 Ohio App.3d 35, 40, 637 N.E.2d 397. Where the dispute involves nondoctrinal contractual disputes, a civil court retains jurisdiction to hear the dispute. Id. at 42, 637 N.E.2d 397.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">{\u00b6 25} To determine whether a court has subject matter jurisdiction over a dispute, it must perform a two-step analysis by first determining whether the organization is hierarchical<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or congregational.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Id. at 43, 637 N.E.2d 397. If the organization is congregational in nature, then the court determines whether the dispute is ecclesiastical or secular in nature. Id. The court maintains jurisdiction over secular issues. Id. at 42, 637 N.E.2d 397.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">{\u00b6 26} The Society operates as a congregational Sikh religious organization. Although there are many other congregations that practice the Sikh religion, the many congregations are not controlled by an overall ruling organization of the Sikh religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">{\u00b6 27} A religious organization is governed by whatever constitution, rules, and processes it has put in place for itself. <em>Calvary Congregational Church, Inc. v. Eppinger </em>(Feb. 17, 2000), Cuyahoga App. No. 75011, 2000 WL 193216, at * 1. However, a congregational religious organization is not granted the \u201cunbridled right to disregard and to violate the provisions of [its] own written by-laws or constitutions.\u201d Id. Thus, conflicting claims as to the use or control of religious property are to be determined by the constitution of the religious organization. <em>Watson v. Jones </em>(1871), 13 Wall. 679, 80 U.S. 679, 706, 20 L.Ed. 666.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">{\u00b6 28} A thorough review of the record reveals that the Society and Corporation were not disputing doctrine or religion, but only who controlled the property, namely, the accounts and the Gurudwara. As such, the dispute did not hinge on an ecclesiastical or spiritual dispute, but a non-doctrinal property dispute. Thus, the civil court has proper jurisdiction over the case sub judice.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">{\u00b6 29} As the violence within the Gurudwara indicates,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the constitution of the Society needed to be enforced. By ordering an interim executive committee be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>formed to organize and conduct elections for the Society in accordance with the Society\u2019s constitution, the trial court was ensuring that the constitution of the Society would be enforced. The trial court did allow appellees to choose all five of the interim executive committee members. However, the appellees invited appellants to name a person to the interim committee. Appellants declined.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">{\u00b6 30} The interim committee also determined who were members of the Society. According to the record, the interim committee sent a list of members to appellees and received no feedback. The record further stated that proxies, as allowed by the Society\u2019s constitution, were sent to members who could not attend the election. The record also stated that appellants did not vote at the election.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">{\u00b6 31} The trial court did not err in ordering the formation of an interim committee to conduct an election of the executive committee. \u201cThe government of [religious organization] matters is entrusted to the membership.\u201d <em>First Baptist Church of Glen Este v. State </em>(S.D.Ohio 1983), 591 F.Supp. 676, 683. Thus, appellants\u2019 second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">Assignment of Error No. 3</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cThe trial court erred in denying defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss made at the close of plaintiffs\u2019 case (T.p. 691-705).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">{\u00b6 33} Appellants maintain that appellees did not pay the membership fee required by the Society\u2019s constitution and thus have no standing to file suit against appellants or the Corporation. They contend that the court may not determine who is a member of a religious organization, but that where membership is in dispute, it \u201cmust be decided by stipulation of the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">{\u00b6 34} Generally, civil court lacks jurisdiction to hear or determine purely ecclesiastical or spiritual disputes of a * * * religious organization. <em>Tibbs v. Kendrick, </em>93 Ohio App.3d at 40, 637 N.E.2d 397. Courts have made membership determinations in the past. See <em>Honey Creek Regular Baptist Church v. Wilson </em>(App.1950), 50 Ohio Law Abs. 52, 44 O.O. 50, 92 N.E.2d 419 (where a plaintiff was found to be a member of the church, where by custom a new member is received by the extending of the right hand in fellowship, even though he did not receive a hand because that custom had ceased to be practiced).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-11\">{\u00b6 35} Furthermore, a trial court\u2019s conclusions on a motion to dismiss pursuant to Civ.R. 41(B)(2) may not be set aside by a reviewing court unless it is \u201cerroneous as a matter of law or against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Fisher v. Rose Chevrolet, Inc. </em>(1992), 82 Ohio App.3d 520, 524, 612 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>N. E.2d 782, citing <em>Jamil, Inc. v. Woods </em>(1980), 70 Ohio App.2d 216, 217, 24 O.O.3d 266, 435 N.E.2d 1138. Moreover, \u201c^Judgments supported by some competent, credible evidence going to all the essential elements of the case will not be reversed by a reviewing court as being against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d <em>C.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr. Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 279, 8 O.O.3d 261, 376 N.E.2d 578, at the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">{\u00b6 36} In 1985, the Society adopted a constitution. As noted earlier, two of the articles within the constitution concern membership and voting. Article Three states that membership is for one calendar year to anyone who pays a one-dollar fee. Article Four states that those members of the Society who are over the age of 18, residents of the tri-state area, and members for at least three months constitute the voting membership.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">{\u00b6 37} The record relates that since the inception of the Society, the one-dollar fee was never separately collected or recorded. An early president and drafter of the 1985 constitution testified that one dollar was selected as the membership fee because \u201cit\u2019s the tradition of the Sikh religion that * * * when we come for worship we bow to the holy book, and traditionally, one dollar is the offering.\u201d Others also testified supporting the fact that when bowing to the holy book, the worshipper makes an offering.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">{\u00b6 38} After reviewing the record, weighing the evidence, and considering the credibility of the witnesses, we find that the trial court did not err in denying appellants\u2019 motion to dismiss. The decision is neither erroneous as a matter of law nor against the manifest weight of the evidence. Accordingly, appellants\u2019 third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">{\u00b6 39} The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b430-10\">Valen, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b430-11\">Walsh, P.J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b426-12\">.
