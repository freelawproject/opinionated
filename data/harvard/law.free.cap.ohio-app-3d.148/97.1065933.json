(\u201cBobb\u201d), located in Columbus, Ohio, had a business relationship with defendant-appellee, Jack\u2019s Used Cars, L.L.C. (\u201cJack\u2019s\u201d), owned by Jack Medlin in Rocky Mount, North Carolina. Bobb regularly sold used cars to Jack\u2019s for resale. When a shipment of cars was damaged by a hurricane, each believed the other to be liable for the damages. Under North Carolina law, Bobb\u2019s claims fail, and we thus affirm the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Jack\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-13\">\n<em>I. A Long Relationship</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b134-14\">{\u00b6 2} According to the practice that the parties had established, Bobb and Jack\u2019s would tentatively agree by phone on a price for some of Bobb\u2019s used cars. Bobb would then record the price that they had agreed upon for each particular car, fax that document to Jack\u2019s, and ship the cars from Ohio to North Carolina. Once the cars arrived in North Carolina, they would be inspected for acceptance. If the cars did not arrive in the condition that Jack\u2019s expected, the price would be renegotiated, or, if no agreement could be reached, then the car or cars not meeting expectations could be returned to Bobb. If the cars were accepted, then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>payment from Jack\u2019s usually crossed in the mail with title to the cars from Bobb. Nowhere in the process did the parties make an effective choice of the laws that would govern their transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">{\u00b6 3} While this practice apparently served the parties well for a number of years, a shipment of cars was damaged by a hurricane, leaving one party or its insurer responsible for the damages. The cars were delivered to Jack\u2019s lot on the afternoon that a hurricane had been forecast for the evening. Despite Medlin\u2019s request that the shipper wait to unload the cars until the next day, the driver was understandably eager to unload and leave the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">{\u00b6 4} The cars were unloaded onto an elevated portion of the lot. That evening, the hurricane struck, and torrential rains caused severe flooding. The newly arrived shipment of cars from Bobb, along with the rest of Jack\u2019s inventory of used cars, was damaged by the floodwaters. Apparently, this was the first time that the lot had flooded, though Jack\u2019s had occupied the same location for thirty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">\n<em>II. Contract Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">{\u00b6 5} Bobb claimed that, because the cars had been delivered, Jack\u2019s owned the damaged cars. Thus, Bobb argued that it was entitled to payment for the cars from Jack\u2019s despite the damage, because, as the owner, Jack\u2019s bore the risk of loss. Under an alternate theory, Bobb asserted that, if title had not transferred to Jack\u2019s, then Jack\u2019s was a bailee of the cars and liable for the damage. Jack\u2019s responded that it did not own the cars because a successful transfer of ownership had not occurred. Thus, according to Jack\u2019s, Bobb owned the cars and bore the risk of loss, and it owed Bobb nothing. As to the bailment, Jack\u2019s stated that it was not negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">{\u00b6 6} Bobb and Jack\u2019s reciprocal claims concerning the ownership of the flood-damaged cars were rooted in the conflicting laws of their respective states. According to Ohio law, under a valid purchase contract, delivery by the seller to the buyer effectively transfers ownership of a car.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But under North Carolina law, a buyer does not own a new car until its title has been successfully transferred from the seller to the buyer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">{\u00b6 7} Thus, the parties now view the outcome of this case as largely dependent upon determining which of the conflicting state laws concerning the owner<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>ship of the cars is applicable. While we hold that North Carolina law applies, we also note that the outcome would be the same in either state. There was no binding contract for the sale of the automobiles when they were damaged. Bobb had offered to sell the cars to Jack\u2019s, but Jack\u2019s had not accepted the offer. Even under Ohio law, Jack\u2019s would prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">{\u00b6 8} Both parties moved for summary judgment in the trial court, and the court awarded summary judgment to Jack\u2019s, applying North Carolina law to the ownership dispute. The court also held that, even if a bailment had been created by the delivery of the cars, there was no evidence that Jack\u2019s had been negligent in its duty to exercise ordinary care. Bobb now appeals, asserting that the trial court erred in its application of North Carolina law to the dispute and that summary judgment was improper since Bobb should have recovered because of both (1) a breach of its purchase contract and (2) the negligence of Jack\u2019s in the care of the bailed vehicles. The trial court was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">{\u00b6 9} We review the grant of summary judgment in favor of Jack\u2019s de novo, using the same standard that the trial court applied.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under Civ.R. 56(C), summary judgment for Jack\u2019s was appropriate if (1) there was no genuine issue of material fact; (2) Jack\u2019s was entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) after construing the evidence most favorably for Bobb, reasonable minds could only have reached a conclusion adverse to Bobb.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">{\u00b6 10} The parties do not dispute any of the meaningful facts in this case. The initial issue is whether the transaction should be interpreted according to the law of North Carolina or the law of Ohio. Bobb and Jack\u2019s agree on the criteria for making that determination. Where the parties have failed to make an effective choice of law to govern a contract, Ohio courts are to decide the issue of the applicable state law by evaluating which state has the most significant relationship to the transaction and the parties by considering the following: (1) the place of contracting; (2) the place of negotiation of the contract; (3) the place of performance; (4) the location of the subject matter of the contract; and (5) the domicile, residence, nationality, place of incorporation and place of business of the parties.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>{\u00b6 11} We affirm the trial court\u2019s decision to apply North Carolina law, primarily because the final act necessary to make the contract binding on the parties was to have occurred in North Carolina. Bobb offered to sell Jack\u2019s some used cars at a certain price. But an offer to sell is not a contract to sell \u2014 the recipient of the offer must accept it. Jack\u2019s was under no legal obligation to pay Bobb for the cars, and Bobb had no corresponding obligation to forward title to the cars, until they had been physically inspected in North Carolina. Thus, the \u201cplace of contracting\u201d for purposes of a choice-of-law analysis was North Carolina.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">{\u00b6 12} We also note that the location of the subject matter of the contract favors North Carolina law. While it is true that the cars started off in Ohio, the damage to the cars and, thus, the event that was the genesis of this case occurred in North Carolina. By contrast, the remaining three criteria are neutral. Each party was expected to perform its respective obligations within its home state. The parties negotiated by phone from within their home states, and neither party was situated in any location other than its home state. We, thus, affirm the judgment of the trial court and hold that North Carolina law governs Bobb\u2019s breach-of-contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">{\u00b6 13} Since the steps necessary to transfer the title for the cars from Bobb to Jack\u2019s had not occurred when the cars were damaged,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Bobb owned the cars. Further, as we have already held, Jack\u2019s was not contractually bound to purchase the cars when they were damaged, and Bobb could not seek to enforce the breach of a contract that had yet to legally bind Jack\u2019s. Thus, we affirm the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Jack\u2019s on Bobb\u2019s breach-of-contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">\n<em>III. Bailment Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">{\u00b6 14} Next, we turn to Bobb\u2019s alternative claim that Jack\u2019s was a bailee for the cars and that Jack\u2019s failed to exercise the ordinary care required to protect the cars and to keep them safe. In Ohio, a bailor may sue the bailee in tort- for failure to exercise ordinary care or in contract for breach of the bailee\u2019s promise to return the property undamaged.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It appears that Bobb intertwined the two causes of action in its pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">{\u00b6 15} We note the alternate claims only for the limited purpose of explaining that, in this case, under either a tort cause of action or a contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>cause of action, North Carolina law still governs the resolution. As we have already stated, North Carolina has the most significant relationship to the purported contract, and, as for a tort cause of action, \u201cthe law of the state where the injury occurred presumptively controls.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The injury in this case \u2014 the damage to the cars \u2014 occurred in North Carolina.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">{\u00b6 16} Under North Carolina law, no such dichotomy based on the underlying cause of action exists. A bailee\u2019s liability simply depends on the presence or absence of ordinary negligence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> A negligence claim may be premised on a tortfeasor\u2019s alleged failure to comply with a duty to provide ordinary care. And ordinary care has been defined in North Carolina, as elsewhere, as \u201cthat degree of care which men of ordinary prudence take of their own property of a similar kind under like circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">{\u00b6 17} In this case, under extraordinary circumstances, Jack\u2019s afforded at least the same care to Bobb\u2019s cars as it did to its own inventory. While the record indicates that Bobb\u2019s cars were unloaded in an elevated section of the lot \u2014 more protected than Jack\u2019s own inventory of vehicles- \u2014 -rising floodwaters damaged all of the cars. Further, it would have been difficult for Jack\u2019s to have foreseen the danger, since it had been doing business in the same place for thirty years, presumably surviving other hurricanes, without flood damage to its inventory. And it would be unrealistic to expect Jack\u2019s to have attempted to move the cars to higher ground, even if such storage had been available, in the midst of a hurricane. So even had a contract for bailment been created, the record does not demonstrate that Jack\u2019s was negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">{\u00b6 18} Bobb\u2019s assignments of error are overruled, and we affirm the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Jack\u2019s, both on Bobb\u2019s alternative bailment claim and on Bobb\u2019s claim for breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b138-8\">Peggy Bryant and Petree, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b138-9\">Mark P.
