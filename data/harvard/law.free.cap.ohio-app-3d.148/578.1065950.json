He contends that R.C. 2925.31 is unconstitutional because the statute is vague and overbroad, failing to clearly delineate what types of conduct will lead to criminal prosecution. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>He also argues that his conviction is not supported by sufficient evidence and is against the manifest weight of the evidence. He finally claims that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because his counsel failed to move for a directed verdict under Crim.R. 29, failed to call Reynolds to the stand, and failed to request a limiting instruction regarding a picture relating to a prior conviction for abusing harmful intoxicants.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">{\u00b6 2} We disagree with Reynolds\u2019s contentions. Reynolds failed to raise an issue regarding the constitutionality of R.C. 2925.31 in the trial court and has waived all review except under a plain error analysis. Likewise, we address Reynolds\u2019s sufficiency claims under a plain error analysis because he failed to move for acquittal under Crim.R. 29. We conclude that his conviction is supported by sufficient evidence and is not against the manifest weight of evidence. Finally, Reynolds\u2019s counsel rendered effective representation. Reynolds was not prejudiced by counsel\u2019s failure to move for a directed verdict, because it would not have been granted, sufficient evidence having been presented to prove that Reynolds abused a harmful intoxicant. Moreover, trial counsel\u2019s decisions relating to which witnesses to call and what evidence to submit do not rise to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel \u2014 calling Reynolds to the stand may have opened the door to unfavorable testimony. Finally, trial counsel\u2019s strategical decision to not request a limiting instruction also does not amount to ineffective assistance of counsel. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">{\u00b6 3} Officer John Moeggenberg was approached by an individual while on patrol on May 23, 2001. The individual alerted Moeggenberg to potential wrongful conduct by someone whom he recognized to be Reynolds. Reynolds was carrying a white bag in one of his hands. Moeggenberg asked Reynolds to come over and speak with him. Instead of complying with the officer\u2019s request, Reynolds fled the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">{\u00b6 4} Moeggenberg subsequently found Reynolds holding his bag and hiding in a nearby yard. Moeggenberg again requested that Reynolds speak with him. Reynolds attempted to climb a fence to escape. Moeggenberg and two other officers pulled Reynolds down from the fence and onto the ground. Reynolds was placed in handcuffs. At that time, the officers retrieved Reynolds\u2019s bag. Inside they found two bottles of beer, an aerosol paint can, and a white towel that smelled like aerosol paint. Moeggenberg approached Reynolds, who smelled of paint and alcohol and was dazed. Reynolds was later arrested for abusing harmful intoxicants under R.C. 2925.31. A jury found him guilty, a judgment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>conviction was entered, and Reynolds was sentenced accordingly. From his conviction and sentence, Reynolds appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">{\u00b6 5} Reynolds\u2019 first assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cO.R.C. \u00a7 2925.31 is unconstitutionally vague, and overbroad in construction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">{\u00b6 7} Reynolds argues that R.C. 2925.31 is unconstitutional because the statute fails to explain with sufficient clarity what conduct is prohibited to avoid criminal prosecution under its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">{\u00b6 8} Reynolds did not make this claim at the trial court level. \u201cFailure to raise at the trial court level the issue of the constitutionality of a statute or its applications, which issue is apparent at the time of trial, constitutes a waiver of such issue and a deviation from this state\u2019s orderly procedure, and therefore need not be heard for the first time on appeal.\u201d <em>State v. Awan </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 120, 22 OBR 199, 489 N.E.2d 277, syllabus. Nonetheless, Crim.R. 52(B) allows us to recognize \u201cplain errors or defects affecting substantial rights,\u201d although they have not been preserved at trial, in exceptional circumstances to prevent a miscarriage of justice. The test for plain error is whether the result of the trial would have clearly been otherwise had the error not occurred. If R.C. 2925.31 were deemed unconstitutional, then the outcome of the case would clearly be different because no conviction could be predicated upon violation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">{\u00b6 9} A properly enacted statute is presumptively constitutional, and the party challenging it bears the burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt that the statute is unconstitutional. <em>State v. Sinito </em>(1975), 43 Ohio St.2d 98, 72 O.O.2d 54, 330 N.E.2d 896. We will apply all presumptions and rules of construction so as to uphold the statute if possible. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-11\">{\u00b6 10} R.C. 2925.31 will only be held void for vagueness under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment if it does not contain \u201cascertainable standards of guilt.\u201d <em>State v. Young </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 370, 16 O.O.3d 416, 406 N.E.2d 499. When reviewing a challenged statute, we seek to ascertain if its terms are sufficiently explicit so as to inform those subject to it what conduct will render them liable to its penalties. Id., citing <em>Connally v. Gen. Constr. Co. </em>(1926), 269 U.S. 385, 46 S.Ct. 126, 70 L.Ed. 322. \u201c[A] statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application, violates the first essential of due process of law. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-12\">{\u00b6 11} R.C. 2925.31 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>{\u00b6 12} \u201c(A) Except for lawful research, clinical, medical, dental, or veterinary purposes, no person, with purpose to induce intoxication or similar physiological effects, shall obtain, possess, or use a harmful intoxicant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c \u2018Harmful intoxicant\u2019 does not include beer or intoxicating liquor but means any compound, mixture, preparation, or substance the gas, fumes, or vapor of which when inhaled can induce intoxication, excitement, giddiness, irrational behavior, depression, stupefaction, paralysis, unconsciousness, asphyxiation, or other harmful physiological effects, and includes, but is not limited to, any of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c(1) Any volatile organic solvent, plastic cement, model cement, fingernail polish remover, lacquer thinner, cleaning fluid, gasoline, or other preparation containing a volatile organic solvent;</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c(2) Any aerosol propellant;</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c(3) Any fluorocarbon refrigerant;</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c(4) Any anesthetic gas.\u201d R.C. 2925.01(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">{\u00b6 18} Reynolds claims that the statute\u2019s mandate against \u201cobtaining, possessing, or using, a harmful intoxicant, with purpose to induce intoxication or similar physiological effects\u201d does not provide guidance or a sufficient certainty regarding how a person obtains, possesses, or uses a harmful intoxicant. We disagree. The plain language of the statute does not prohibit the mere possession of a harmful intoxicant, but instead only punishes \u201cobtaining, possessing, or using, a harmful intoxicant, <em>with purpose to induce intoxication or similar physiological effects.\u201d </em>We find that the terms of R.C. 2925.31 are sufficiently explicit to provide notice of what conduct is prohibited, without requiring an individual to guess at its meaning or invoking arbitrary application.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-11\">{\u00b6 19} Reynolds also contends that the statute is unconstitutionally overbroad because it prohibits lawful as well as unlawful conduct. We must determine whether R.C. 2923.51 unreasonably impinges upon constitutionally protected freedoms. We conclude that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-12\">{\u00b6 20} We have previously stated that the overbreadth doctrine has no application to criminal statutes outside a First Amendment context. <em>State v. Mundy </em>(1994), 99 Ohio App.3d 275, 290, 650 N.E.2d 502. Even assuming, for purposes of analysis, that use of harmful intoxicants falls within the ambit of expression protected by the First Amendment, the statute does not unconstitutionally chill that protected conduct, because the statute does not criminalize any or all uses of harmful intoxicants. Rather, the statute contains a constitutional safeguard: that only use of those intoxicants to induce intoxication or similar physiological effects may constitute criminal conduct under the statute. There is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>no constitutionally protected right to use harmful substances to induce intoxication or similar physiological effects. Accordingly, R.C. 2928.51 properly distinguishes criminal conduct from innocent behavior and does not impinge upon constitutionally protected conduct. Thus, we conclude that R.C. 2923.51 is not facially vague or overbroad in violation of the United States and Ohio Constitutions. Reynolds\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">{\u00b6 21} Reynolds\u2019s second and third assignments of error are interrelated and provide as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cAppellant\u2019s conviction should be reversed because there was insufficient evidence in the record to sustain a guilty verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cThe guilty verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">{\u00b6 24} Reynolds complains that the trial court lacked sufficient evidence of his intent to \u201cinduce intoxication or similar psychological effects,\u201d an essential element of the charge of abusing harmful intoxicants, because the evidence showed only that he had spray paint and two beers in his possession, and his dazed state may have been a result of alcohol consumption. He claims this evidence does not demonstrate intent. Similarly, he argues that the verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">{\u00b6 25} Reynolds conced\u00e9s that he failed to move under Crim.R. 29 for acquittal during the trial of this matter. Thus, our review is limited to plain error. Crim.R. 52(B) allows us to recognize \u201cplain errors or defects affecting substantial rights\u201d although they were not preserved at trial in exceptional circumstances to prevent a miscarriage of justice. The test for plain error is whether the result of the trial would have clearly been otherwise had the error not occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-11\">{\u00b626} To reverse a criminal conviction under R.C. 2925.31 for insufficient evidence, we must conclude, after reviewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the state, that no rational trier of fact could have found that all elements of the statute have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 678 N.E.2d 541. In reviewing manifest weight arguments, the same test is applied. The verdict will not be disturbed unless the appellate court finds that \u201creasonable minds could not reach the conclusion reached by the trier of facts.\u201d <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 273, 574 N.E.2d 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-12\">{\u00b6 27} R.C. 2925.31(A) provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>{\u00b6 28} \u201cExcept for lawful research, clinical, medical, dental, or veterinary purposes, no person, with purpose to induce intoxication or similar physiological effects, shall obtain, possess, or use a harmful intoxicant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">{\u00b6 29} Based upon our review of the record we cannot conclude that no rational trier of fact could have found that all of the elements of the statute were not proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The record demonstrates that a rational juror could have found that Reynolds possessed a harmful intoxicant for the purpose of inducing intoxication:</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cA. [Officer Moeggenberg] Uh ... after a short scuffle, we \u2014 myself, Sergeant Heath, and Patrolman Wright were able to get [Reynolds] handcuffed. We were able to retrieve a white towel, uh ... with gold, uh ... \u2014at that time we didn\u2019t know what it was, but it was a substance that smelled like aerosol paint.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cQ. And what color was it?</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cA. Gold. And in [Reynolds\u2019s] left hand, he had a bag \u2014 a plastic bag, with two bottles of beer and a gold can \u2014 an aerosol paint can.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cQ. All right. Let me ask you this. Did you have an opportunity to observe [Reynolds]?</p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">{\u00b6 34} \u2022 \u201cA. Yes, I did.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-11\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cQ. Did you make any observations about his physical appearance?</p>\n<p id=\"b620-12\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cA. Yes, I did.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-13\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cQ. And what was that?</p>\n<p id=\"b620-14\">. {\u00b6 38} \u201cA. He had gold paint on his fingertips and around his nose and mouth area \u2014 [Indicating],</p>\n<p id=\"b620-15\">{\u00b6 39} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b620-16\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cQ * * * Did you smell anything?</p>\n<p id=\"b620-17\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cA. Yes, I \u2014 we\u2014when we first came into contact with [Reynolds] in the back yard, I was able to smell aerosol \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, spray paint \u2014 to what I know as spray paint and alcohol cornin\u2019 [sic] from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-18\">{\u00b642} \u201cQ. How far from [Reynolds] were you when you smelled these odors?</p>\n<p id=\"b620-19\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cA. Less than three feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-20\">{\u00b6 44} \u201c* * :]!</p>\n<p id=\"b620-21\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cQ * * * And could you describe [Reynolds\u2019s] demeanor when you saw \u2019 him [on the day of his arrest] * * *?</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>{\u00b6 46} \u201cA. He was very uncooperative. Uh ... seemed to be no re \u2014 he wasn\u2019t responding to our verbal or physical commands. Just, uh ... incoherent to what was going on around him, oblivious to us tellin\u2019 [sic] him, you know, get down on the ground and loosen your hands, that kind of stuff.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">{\u00b6 47} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">{\u00b6 48} \u201cQ. * * * And in your experience as a police officer, have you ever had any dealings with people that have been, uh ... sniffing paint?</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">{\u00b6 49} \u201cA. Yes, I have.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">{\u00b6 50} \u201cQ. And, uh ... based on your experience, what are some of the signs that someone\u2019s sniffing paint?</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">{\u00b6 51} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">{\u00b6 52} \u201cA. Just dazed, seem like they\u2019re confused. Stumbling around, uh ... you know, not paying attention to \u2014 can\u2019t hold a conversation with somebody.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-11\">{\u00b6 53} \u201cQ. And, uh ... on May 23rd, when you had that contact with [Reynolds], was he exhibiting any of those signs.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-12\">{\u00b6 54} \u201cA. Yes, he was.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-13\">{\u00b6 55} Further, Julie Browning, a forensic chemist and document examiner at the Miami Valley Regional Crime Laboratory, testified that the gold paint and rag on Reynolds\u2019s person when he was arrested contained harmful intoxicants. Specifically, she testified as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b621-14\">{\u00b6 56} \u201cQ. Okay. In regards to the towel, uh ... did you come to a conclusion as to what, uh ... the towel and the can [found on Reynolds\u2019s prior to his arrest] contained?</p>\n<p id=\"b621-17\">{\u00b6 57} \u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-18\">{\u00b6 58} \u201cQ. And what was that conclusion? .</p>\n<p id=\"b621-19\">{\u00b6 59} \u201cA. That the vapors that were coming from the rag within the can, uh ... contained toluene and xylene.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-20\">{\u00b6 60} \u201cQ. And for us who have no idea what those items are, can you tell us what those two....</p>\n<p id=\"b621-21\">{\u00b6 61} \u201cA. Uh......</p>\n<p id=\"b621-22\">{\u00b6 62} \u201cQ.... things are?</p>\n<p id=\"b621-23\">{\u00b6 63} \u201cA.... yes. Uh ... toulene and xylene are the, uh ... basically the \u2014 \u2022 solvent ingredients that are in Rustoleum paint, and they\u2019re both classified as volatile organic solvents.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-24\">{\u00b6 64} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>{\u00b6 65} \u201cQ. Would you describe for the Jury what a volatile organic substance \u2014 or solvent \u2014 excuse me \u2014 is?</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">{\u00b6 66} \u201cA. Uh ... yes. Uh ... volatile \u2014 volatile organic solvent is gonna be, uh ... a carbon-containing liquid that has a low boiling point. That\u2019s what makes it volatile. And because of this, it \u2014 it, uh ... gives off vapors that are gonna be very strong, chemically smelling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">{\u00b6 67} Reynolds seems to believe that because no one actually witnessed him huffing the paint or sniffing the rag he cannot be convicted of abusing harmful intoxicants. Additionally, he points to the facts that the spray can contained no nozzle and that drinking alcohol could have induced the same effects witnessed by the officer to demonstrate that no rational juror could find that he abused a harmful intoxicant. Again, we disagree. The evidence shows that Reynolds had a harmful intoxicant in his possession, the paint; that the paint was observed near his nose and mouth; and that he exhibited signs of someone who had been sniffing paint. Taken together, this evidence is sufficient to find him guilty under R.C. 2925.31. Moreover, although the jury could have reached a different conclusion based on the evidence presented, the weight given to the evidence and which of competing inferences should be drawn from that evidence are matters primarily for the trier of fact. <em>State v. DeHass </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 39 0.0.2d 366, 227 N.E.2d 212, paragraph one of the syllabus. Accordingly, Reynolds\u2019s second and third assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">{\u00b6 68} In his fourth and final assignment of error, Reynolds argues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">{\u00b6 69} \u201cDefendant was denied effective assistance of counsel to his prejudice and in violation of his Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights, as well as his rights under Article 1, Section 10, of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">{\u00b6 70} Reynolds claims his counsel committed several errors that resulted in prejudice to him. These errors include counsel\u2019s failure to (1) make a Rule 29 motion for acquittal, (2) call any witnesses or present evidence on his behalf, and (3) to request a limiting instruction regarding Reynolds\u2019s prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-11\">{\u00b6 71} To establish ineffective assistance of counsel, Reynolds must show deficient performance on the part of his counsel resulting in prejudice to him. <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373. Counsel\u2019s performance is deficient if it falls below an objective standard of reasonable representation. Id. To establish prejudice, \u201cthe defendant must prove that there exists a reasonable probability that, were it not for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the trial would have been different.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>{\u00b6 72} A licensed attorney is presumed to be competent, and, as a result of this presumption, a defendant must prove that counsel was ineffective. <em>State v. Pattin </em>(July 7, 1992), Lucas App. No. L-91-339, 1992 WL 185664, citing <em>State v. Hamblin </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 153, 524 N.E.2d 476. Additionally, there is also a \u201cstrong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Bradley, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">{\u00b6 73} With these standards in mind, we address Reynolds\u2019s contentions. Reynolds first challenges his counsel\u2019s decision not to move for an acquittal under Rule 29. As we previously discussed in connection with Reynolds\u2019s second assignment of error, we find that the evidence presented by the state was more than sufficient to sustain Reynolds\u2019s conviction. Consequently, if defense counsel had moved under Rule 29 for an acquittal, the trial court would have overruled the motion. <em>State v. Fields </em>(1995), 102 Ohio App.3d 284, 289, 656 N.E.2d 1383. Accordingly, Reynolds has failed to show any prejudice resulting from counsel\u2019s decision not to file a futile motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">{\u00b6 74} Reynolds next claims his counsel was ineffective because he chose not to call witnesses or present evidence on Reynolds\u2019s behalf. Our review of the record indicates that counsel did present some evidence on his client\u2019s behalf. Moreover, Reynolds has failed to point to any evidence counsel should have, but did not, present that would have changed the outcome of the trial. Additionally, he claims that counsel should have called witnesses on his behalf. According to Reynolds, his counsel should have, at a minimum, allowed him to testify. We disagree. A failure to call a witness is not ineffective assistance of counsel if calling that witness opens the door to unfavorable testimony that counsel might reasonably conclude would likely outweigh the value of any favorable testimony the witness might offer. <em>State v. Griffitts, </em>Montgomery App. No. 18755, 2002-0hio-921, 2002 WL 252786. We agree with Reynolds\u2019s counsel that calling Reynolds may have done more harm than good, because it would have allowed the state to cross-examine him concerning an extensive criminal record. Thus, Reynolds failed to establish that counsel\u2019s performance was ineffective based on this alleged failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">{\u00b6 75} Finally, Reynolds claims that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient because he failed to request a limiting instruction relating to an earlier photograph used to convict Reynolds of abusing harmful intoxicants. He claims that the effect of the photo was to incite the jury to convict based on prior misconduct and that counsel was ineffective for failing to request a limiting instruction under <em>State v. Lenoir </em>(Sept. 12, 1997), Montgomery App. No. 15469, 1997 WL 566155. But we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>{\u00b6 76} Unlike <em>Lenoir, </em>trial counsel in the case before us made a tactical decision to stipulate to Reynolds\u2019s prior conviction and admission of a photograph taken of Reynolds on March 3, 2000, for a prior charge of abusing harmful intoxicants. The March 3d photograph showed paint on Reynolds\u2019s nose, lips, and chin. A second photograph relating to this charge did not show any paint around Reynolds\u2019s nose or mouth. Counsel hoped to demonstrate that because the photograph relating to this charge was different from the March 3, 2000 photograph, Reynolds was not guilty on this occasion. If counsel had been successful, then Reynolds would not have been found guilty. Here, Reynolds has not overcome the presumption that trial counsel\u2019s actions were anything but sound trial strategy pursuant to <em>Bradley, </em>supra. While counsel\u2019s strategy ultimately did not work, it was not unreasonable, and certainly not the kind of incompetence necessary to support a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>State v.
