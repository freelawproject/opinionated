The case must be reversed. There is no information. The affidavit is made by one Buster and sworn to before J. D. Barker, county attorney of Randall county, which appears to be correct, \u2014 but what purports to be the information is no more than an unsigned affidavit starting out with the statement: \u201cI, J. D. Barker, do solemnly swear,\u201d etc., and concluding with a jurat which makes it appear that this was sworn to before J. D. Barker, county attorney. The form for an information is laid down in Forms 745-746, Willson\u2019s Texas Crim. Forms. An almost similar situation to this appears in Compton v. State, 71 Texas Crim. Rep., 7, 158 S. W., 515, and authorities there cited. The Compton case was reversed for the insufficiency of the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-15\">Inasmuch as the affidavit herein is sufficient to be the predicate for a prosecution, and a new information can be filed thereon, the cause will be reversed and remanded and not reversed and dismissed. Sims v. State, 72 Texas Crim. Rep., 533, 162 S. W., 1154.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-17\">In this connection attention is called to the fact that by the revised Penal Code of 1925, art. 1149, the word \u201cgross\u201d before the word \u201cnegligence\u201d in this statute was omitted. However, the pleader in this case has seen fit to charge that this assault was with \u201cgross negligence\u201d. Two methods of committing an assault of this character are set out in the statute, \u2014 one, that such assault was wilful; another, that it was with negligence. It is suggested that if the state does not file a new affidavit but contents itself with filing a new information, upon trial the state could rely upon either a claim that the assault was committed wilfully, or a claim that it was committed with negligence, \u2014 but if the latter is relied upon, the allegation being that the assault was committed with gross negligence, gross negligence should be defined in the charge of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-18\">The judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-19\">\n<em>Reversed ad Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
