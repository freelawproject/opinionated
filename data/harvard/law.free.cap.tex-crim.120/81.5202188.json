The \u201chome brew\u201d was discovered in a back room, while the whisky was found under the house. Touching the question as to whether the liquor found in the back room was beer or \u201chome brew\u201d, one of the officers testified as follows: \u201cI do not recollect where the stuff was, nothing but the beer. It was in an adjoining room from where he was sleeping. As to whether I mean \u2018home brew\u2019, this stuff they make, I will say it is beer. As to whether it was Budweiser or Schlitz, I will say it did not have any labels on it. As to what they call it, it was home made beer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">No effort was made by the state to prove that the home made beer was intoxicating.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Appellant did not testify in his own behalf. His wife testified that the thirty-six bottles of \u201chome brew\u201d found in the house belonged to her. She said that she had kidney trouble and was using the \u201chome brew\u201d for medicinal purposes. She testified that she and her husband had no whisky on the place. She said the officers brought some whisky into the house. Further, she testified that the officers did not find the whisky on her husband\u2019s place.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">The testimony of the officers was opposed on several grounds. The affidavit upon which the search warrant was based was fatally defective, in that it was not shown therein that appellant\u2019s residence was a place where intoxicating liquor was sold or manufactured. It was merely stated in the affidavit that affiants had reason to believe and did believe that appellant\u2019s property was being used as a means of \u201cviolating the intoxicating liquor laws of the state of Texas.\u201d In the statement of the facts upon which the belief of affiants was based, it was averred that affiants had purchased a pint of whisky from appellant. It was not stated that the whisky was purchased in appellant\u2019s residence. As far as the averments in the affidavit are concerned, the purchase might have been made at a place far remote from appellant\u2019s residence, and at a time so remote as to not afford ground for a reasonable belief that the premises were used as a place to sell intoxicating liquor at the time the affidavit for the search warrant was made. It is obvious that the allegations are not equivalent to an averment that appellant\u2019s residence was a place where intoxicating liquor was being sold. Under the statute, the affidavit for a warrant to search a private residence must show such residence to be a place where intoxicating liquor is sold or manufactured. Article 691, P. C.; Penny v. State, 114 Texas Crim. Rep., 303, 24 S. W. (2d) 1089; Green v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>State, 111 Texas Crim. Rep., 292, 12 S. W. (2d) 790; Torres v. State, 113 Texas Crim. Rep., 1, 18 S. W. (2d) 179.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The testimony of the officers was erroneously received. However, testimony of the presence of the \u201chome brew\u201d was given by appellant\u2019s wife. Her testimony having revealed to the jury the same facts that were disclosed by the officers relative to the \u201chome brew\u201d, appellant is in no position to seek a reversal on the ground that the officers were erroneously permitted to testify as to the finding of the \u201chome brew\u201d. Poteet v. State, 112 Texas Crim. Rep., 466, 17 S. W. (2d) 46. The situation is not the same as to the whisky.. Appellant\u2019s wife denied that there was any whisky on the place. She said she saw the officers bring some whisky into the house, but declared the officers did not find it on her husband\u2019s place. She did not testify as to the amount of whisky she saw in the possession of the officers. Manifestly, the testimony of appellant\u2019s wife did not embrace the same criminative facts as to the presence of the whisky as revealed by the testimony of the officers. In view of the fact that there was no proof that the \u201chome brew\u201d was intoxicating, the state\u2019s case rested upon the testimony of the officers as to the presence of the whisky in appellant\u2019s home. Hence it can not be said that the reception of the testimony touching the discovery of the whisky was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">The court instructed the jury that whisky and beer are known intoxicants. Following this instruction the jury were given a charge to the effect that proof of possession of more than a quart of intoxicating liquor is prima facie evidence of guilt. \u201cPrima facie evidence\u201d was then properly defined by the court. In applying the law to the facts, the jury were instructed to convict appellant if they believed from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that he possessed intoxicating liquor for the purpose of sale. Following this charge, the court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">\u201cNow, if you believe, or have a reasonable doubt thereof, that the whisky in question was placed where the officers are alleged to have found same, by some other person than the defendant and that the defendant had no interest in same; and that the beer in question was possessed for medicinal purposes, you will find the defendant not guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">Appellant timely and properly excepted to the use of the word \u201cbeer\u201d in the charge of the court, and to the instruction beer was intoxicating. Further, he excepted to that part of the charge submitting the affirmative defense, in which the court restricted his right to an acquittal on the finding that the beer was possessed for medicinal purposes. The opinion is expressed that the case should not have been submitted to the jury on the theory that appellant possesed beer for the purpose of sale. The state having failed to prove that the \u201chome brew\u201d was intoxicating, the jury would not have been warranted in predicating a verdict of guilty upon the possession of the \u201chome brew\u201d. The charge of the court had the effect of advising the jury that they might convict appellant for possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>of the \u201chome brew\u201d if they believed from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt he possessd it for the purpose of sale. The entire record makes it manifest that the liquid found in the house was \u201chome brew\u201d. Courts have no judicial knowledge that \u201chome brew\u201d is intoxicating. Minton v. State, 115 Texas Crim. Rep., 301, 29 S. W.
