According to his version, the parties drove their automobile practically against his car and forced him to 'stop. Exhibiting a pistol, appellant and his companion took his money and watch; threw his car keys away and punctured his casings. Appellant had a stub thumb; which the injured party observed while appellant was holding the pistol in his hand. A young lady who was in the car with the injured party had known appellant for several months, it appearing that she and appellant worked for the Harmon Motor Company in Amarillo.
