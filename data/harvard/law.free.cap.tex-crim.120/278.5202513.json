The court submitted the issue of suspended sentence and advised the jury regarding their option to recommend it. The verdict made no mention of it whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">In this court appellant assails the verdict on the ground that the jury failed to dispose of an issue submitted in the court\u2019s instructions. The decisions are against appellant\u2019s contention. Conatser v. State, 75 Texas Crim. Rep., 91, 170 S. W., 314; Bonds v. State, 92 Texas Crim. Rep., 394, 244 S. W., 382; Johnson v. State, 74 Texas Crim. Rep., 627, 169 S. W., 1151; Cook v. State, 73 Texas Crim. Rep., 548, 165 S. W., 573; Dawson v. State, 72 Texas Crim. R\u00e9p., 68, 161 S. W., 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">We observe that in pronouncing sentence the court overlooked the indeterminate sentence law and directed that appellant be confined in the penitentiary for two years. The sentence of the court ought to have directed imprisonment in the penitentiary for not less than one nor more than two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-12\">The sentence will be reformed to comply with the indeterminate sentence law and, as reformed, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-13\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b309-14\">Morrow, P.

Appellant pleaded guilty. There was no exception to the charge of the court. Where there is a plea of guilty we see no necessity for the court telling the jury that the burden of proof is on the state. By his plea of guilty appellant admits all the material allegations of the indictment, and the only object of the introduction of any testimony at all is, as said by our statute, to enable the jury to fix the punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-17\">The motion for rehearing will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-18\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
