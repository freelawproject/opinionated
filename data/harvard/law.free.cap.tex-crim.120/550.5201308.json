Appellant admitted having seen Hurst in Taylor and having talked to him, and drunk some intoxicating liquor with him there, but denied the trip to the country and participation in the robbery. The negro referred to as \u201cHot Foot\u201d Jones is shown to have been named Arthur Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Appellant through his counsel requested that Arthur Jones be brought from jail in order that he might be tendered as a witness by appellant in his behalf. Jones was then being held in jail under an indictment charging him with the same offense (robbery of Hurst) as that for which appellant was being tried. For that reason counsel for the state objected to Jones testifying and the objection was sustained. For some reason counsel for the state withdrew his objection, but the court adherred to his ruling that Jones could not testify. The bill recites that if permitted Jones would have testified that he and one Jay robbed Hurst and that appellant was not present and had nothing to do with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">The court correctly rejected Jones\u2019 proffered testimony, under article 711, C. C. P., which is as follows: \u201cPersons charged as principals, accomplices or accessories, whether in the same or different indictments, can not be introduced as witnesses for one another, but they may claim a severance; and, if any one or more be acquitted, or the prosecution against them be dismissed, they may testify in behalf of the others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">Many cases construing the statute in question will be found collated under said article in Vernon\u2019s Ann. Tex. C. C. P., vol. 2, and under section 732, Branch\u2019s Ann. Tex. P. C.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">The action of the court in excluding Jones\u2019 testimony was set up as a ground for new trial. The affidavit of Jones as to what his testimony would have been was attached to the motion for new trial. Upon the hearing of the motion the state produced Jones in court and he testified that the facts contained in his affidavit were false, and said he had been induced by appellant to make the false affidavit. He gave testimony on the motion which connected appellant with the robbery as a principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-11\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-12\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
