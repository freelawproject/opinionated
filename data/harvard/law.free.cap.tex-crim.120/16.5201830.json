As written, the judgment orders the appellant to confinement in the penitentiary for a period of ten years. The sentence orders his confinement in the penitentiary for not less than two nor more than fifteen years. In both instances the entry is incorrect. The judgment and sentence will be reformed to accord with the statute entitling one convicted of a felony of the benefit of the Indeterminate Sentence Law (Vernon\u2019s Ann. C. C. P., art. 775), under which the judgment and sentence should order the appellant to be confined in the state penitentiary for a period of not less than two nor more than ten years. As reformed, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">\n<em>Reformed, and as so reformed, affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
