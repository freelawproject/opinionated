When the case was called for trial appellant filed a plea of former jeopardy, setting up that she had been convicted of the same offense at a former time, and attaching as exhibits to the plea a copy of the charge of the court and the verdict of a jury, both dated in 1929. It was alleged in the plea that the verdict had never been set aside, and the trial court was asked to \u201cabate\u201d the trial because of the matters alleged. Appellant appears to have introduced proof of the fact that an indictment was returned against her and that a verdict was rendered. Neither the alie<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>gations nor the proof adduced are sufficient to support a plea of jeopardy. It is not shown that judgment was ever entered, or sentence pronounced. The learned trial judge heard the plea and overruled it. It appears that this cause was numbered in the trial court 5407. Examination of the records of this court discloses the fact that on November 11, 1929, there was filed with the clerk of this court a transcript on appeal from the district court of Cherokee county, Texas, in cause No. 5407, styled Orene Pond v. State of Texas, and that thereafter, in an opinion duly rendered by this court, the judgment in cause No. 5407 was ordered reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial. In our opinion the action of the trial court in declining to consider said plea of jeopardy is not shown to be erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Appellant asked a new trial on the ground of misconduct of the jury, attaching the affidavits of four jurors to her motion.

With reference to the plea of former jeopardy; this court suggested in the original opinion that this identical case was before this court once before and was reversed and remanded for a new trial. We think appellant is wrong in her position that the court should have entered a corrected judgment upon the verdict originally rendered and not have proceeded to re-try the case. The effect of the reversal was to send the case back for a trial de novo. Article 852, C. C. P., reads: \u201cWhere the Court of Criminal Appeals awards a new trial to the defendant, the cause shall stand as it would have stood in case the new trial had been granted by the court below.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-12\">In our original opinion we stated: \u201cCareful examination of the testimony of the jurors fails to reveal any misconduct on the part of any of them. Nothing in their testimony appears of sufficient materiality to call for a discussion.\u201d In her motion for rehearing appellant criticizes the latter part of the statement just quoted and refers to the testimony of the juror Dunham as found in the statement of facts on the hearing of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>motion for new trial. In her amended motion for new trial appellant avers that while the jury was deliberating upon their verdict \u201cother testimony was given in the jury room in the absence of defendant pertaining to the general reputation of this defendant as a bootlegger, and various other statements regarding this defendant and other trials and prosecutions aaginst her.\u201d Upon the hearing of the motion appellant signally failed to support the foregoing averment. After the testimony of the jurors had been taken the court permitted appellant to file a \u201csupplemental motion\u201d for new trial, in which it was averred that while the testimony was being introduced from the members of the jury it had developed that one of the jurors, to-wit: <em>G. C. Durrett, </em>had heard prior to the trial that appellant was engaged in the business of selling beer and whisky, and that said juror on his voir dire examination had withheld such information from appellant, and that the testimony of said Durrett upon the hearing of the motion had disclosed that he was a prejudiced juror. The state controverted this \u201csupplemental motion\u201d of appellant. An investigation of the evidence heard upon the motion for new trial fails to disclose either from the testimony of the juror Durrett or from any other juror that the averments with reference to the juror Durrett were sustained. In his motion for rehearing, however, appellant calls attention to the testimony of the juror Dunham. His testimony discloses that prior to the trial he had information regarding appellant, which, if it had been concealed from appellant upon the voir dire examination of the juror, might have furnished some basis for a claim that the juror Dunham was not an impartial juror. There was no pleading on the part of appellant challenging the juror Dunham\u2019s fairness. Appellant does set up in her supplemental motion that before the jury was selected appellant\u2019s counsel and the district attorney interrogated the jury as to whether they had any bias in favor of, or prejudice against appellant, o\u00ed whether they knew any fact or facts that might influence them in rendering a verdict in this case, and that each of the jurors answered that he knew nothing that might influence his verdict. Such averment in the motion, although supported by appellant\u2019s affidavit, would do no more than present a pleading upon which she would be privileged to present proof. See Lopez v. State, 84 Texas Crim. Rep., 422, 208 S. W., 167; Noble v. State, 98 Texas Crim. Rep., 463, 266 S. W., 412; Johnson v. State, 111 Texas Crim. Rep, 395, 13 S. W (2d) 114. This averment is in no way supported by any evidence heard upon the motion. The only proof we find regarding the examination of the jurors was from one who sat upon the jury; he said the jurors were asked if any of them was acquainted with appellant or had heard of her, and that several of them held up their hands, indicating that they knew her or had heard of her-There is nothing in the evidence to show that the inquiry was prosecuted further. Whatever the juror Dunham may have heard about appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>was not disclosed by him to the other jurors. The information Dunham had about appellant would not ipso facto brand him as an unfair or prejudiced juror. If he had sought to use such information to influence other jurors, or if he had purposely withheld from appellant the fact that he had such information, the question would be presented in a different light.</p>\n<p id=\"A3A\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-3\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
