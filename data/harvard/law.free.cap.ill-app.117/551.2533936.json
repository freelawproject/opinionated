Appellee recovered a judgment against appellant before a justice of the peace and appellant took an appeal to the Circuit Court. Pending the appeal appellant was adjudicated a bankrupt in the District Court of the United States. He then moved that the suit be stayed until the question of his discharge in bankruptcy should be determined and the court overruled his motion. The trial resulted in a verdict against appellant for $47.97. His motion for a new trial was denied and judgment entered on the verdict with an order that execution be perpetually stayed and that a writ of seire facias issue against the surety in the appeal bond, and from that judgment the defendant took this appeal.</p><attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b568-5\" pgmap=\"568\">Thomas J.

If he had failed to obtain a discharge, the plaintiff would have been entitled to a general judgment against him. Hill v.

Nothing is better settled than that one is not permitted in a court of review to take advantage of an error that does not injuriously affect himself. Bowman v. V. &amp; C. Ry.
