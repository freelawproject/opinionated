The Company sought specific approval of revised intrastate rate schedules it claimed were projected to increase intrastate revenues by approximately $47,600,000 and \u201cproduce [an] 8.6% rate of return on the average intrastate rate base for the test year 1982.\u201d After lengthy contested proceedings, the Commission approved instead rate schedules it found would increase revenues by $27,121,000 and produce a 9.18% rate of return. The Company appeals, charging the Commission erred: (1) \u201cin failing to find a fair rate of return,\u201d (2) \u201cin failing to provide the Company an opportunity to earn a fair return on its intrastate rate base,\u201d (3) \u201cby making an unsupported and unlawful \u2018Separation Adjustment,\u2019 \u201d and (4) \u201cin awarding a rate increase sufficient only to produce an annual revenue increase of $27,121,000.\u201d Finding no merit in the claims of error, we affirm the decision and order.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">After filing the required notice of an intent to seek rate increases in early June of 1981, Hawaiian Telephone submitted an application for approval of revised rate schedules in August of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>1981. The revised schedules, it claimed, were structured to generate increased intrastate revenues of $47,600,000, which in its estimation \u201crepresented] a 25% increase.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The application came on the heels of the approval in June of 1981 by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) of a 1980 agreement between American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T) and Hawaiian Telephone purporting to represent a \u201cresolution among the various interests involved of questions of jurisdictional separations, settlements, and rate integration for Hawaii.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The agreement was spurred by the federal agency\u2019s determination in 1972 that rates for interstate telecommunications services to and from Hawaii, which then were substantially higher than interstate rates on the mainland, should be integrated into the \u201cU.S. Mainland domestic rate pattern\u201d and the agency\u2019s 1976 decisions that this was to be achieved in three phases and accompanied by \u201ccost-based settlements based on prescribed jurisdictional separations procedures.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">The ordered integration was partially implemented by rate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>reductions in 1976, 1977, and 1979. Full integration, however, was to come after the prescription of procedures to be applied in determining \u201cjurisdictional separations and cost-based settlements\u201d with respect to Hawaii. Thus, a Federal-State Joint Board was convened by the FCC to examine existing procedures for possible modification to suit the situation. But before the Board submitted its recommendation, AT&amp;T and Hawaiian Telephone agreed they would request the Board to recommend and the FCC to decree that the method of separations described in the NARUC-FCC Separations Manual (Feb. 1971 ed.), which has been incorporated in the FCC\u2019s rules, would apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">The compact between the interstate and the intrastate carriers stipulated they would jointly seek sanction to delay full implementation of these procedures and full rate integration until 1985. The agreement also provided that cost-based settlements were to be effective from 1981 through 1984, but the local carrier was to receive \u201ctransitional supplements\u201d during this period.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>agreement called for parity thereafter in rates for telecommunications services to and from Hawaii and interstate rates on the mainland United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">In accord therewith AT&amp;T and Hawaiian Telephone moved in July of 1980 to have the Joint Board recommend the prescription of the NARUC-FCC Separations Manual for Hawaii and to have the FCC approve the agreement, asserting such actions would \u201cavoid the need for further proceedings . .. and ... result in implementation of full rate integration in a manner that will serve the overall public interest.\u201d Hawaiian Telephone sought the support of Hawaii\u2019s Congressional delegation and the Governor in seeking such approval. But before endorsing the carriers\u2019 pact, the Governor requested an explanation on how it would be of direct benefit to customers.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In responding to the pointed query, Hawaiian Telephone professed that the agreement provided a means to accomplish rate integration with minimum impact to Hawaii customers and \u201cthe accumulated cost to Hawaii and Mainland customers of delaying integration [would] be approximately $36 million compared to the $130 million in transition payments <em>which lessen the need for local rate increases.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Similar representations were made in a subsequent letter from a company vice-president to the Attorney General.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A formal expression of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>State support was transmitted thereafter to the chairman of the FCC.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The federal regulatory agency \u201caccepted and approved\u201d the agreement in July of 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">Hawaiian Telephone submitted its application for intrastate rate increases to the Public Utilities Commission on August 25, 1981. In accord with the mandate of Rule 8-3 of the Commission\u2019s Rules of Practice and Procedure, the petition was accompanied by \u201cwritten direct testimony\u201d and exhibits purportedly sustaining the requested rate increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">The Consumer Advocate of the State of Hawaii, whose duty it is to \u201crepresent, protect, and advance the interests of consumers of utility services,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> however, considered the submission wanting in essential respects and quickly moved for summary disposition of the application. He argued the testimony and exhibits neither established \u201ccost justifications\u201d nor reflected the Company\u2019s \u201cearn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>ings results\u201d on a county or divisional basis as mandated by the Commission\u2019s rules. After overruling the Advocate\u2019s motion for a finding of \u201cinsufficiency\u201d and disposing of other preliminary matters, the Commission commenced a series of public hearings on Hawaiian Telephone\u2019s plea for rate increases.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The utility proposed across-the-board price increases amounting to approximately thirty-five percent for most of the services it rendered the public and limited changes in rates and charges for other services. The Consumer Advocate maintained throughout the contested-case hearing, as he had earlier, that a need for rate increases had not been demonstrated. The large sums Hawaiian Telephone became entitled to in the form of \u201ctransitional supplements\u201d under the recently approved agreement with AT&amp;T were among the reasons urged for disallowing rate hikes.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">At one point in the protracted proceedings, the Company summarized its case through the testimony of an officer and the exhibits presented in conjunction therewith. It averred therein that \u201cthe rate relief requested [was] $47.6 million which will produce a rate of return on the intrastate rate base [of $485 million] of only 8.6%.\u201d (H.T.C. Exh. No. T-19, at 3-4). This estimate of necessary revenue, it explained, followed a determination \u201cthat a net operating income of $41.7 million would be required for intrastate operations in test year 1982.\u201d (H.T.C. Exh. No. T-19, at 4). \u201cThe Commission, based on the foregoing, [deemed] it [unnecessary] to make a finding on ... a specific fair rate of return for the test year 1982.\u201d P.U.C. Decision and Order No. 7412, at 96. And it approved new rate schedules designed to \u201cproduce an annual revenue increase of $27,121,000\u201d and yield the \u201cnet operating income of $41,700,000 . .. requested by HTC.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 113. The disparity in estimates of additional revenue likely to generate the desired net income resulted in part from a finding that \u201c[t]he intrastate rate base for test year 1982 [was] $454,129,000\u201d rather than $485,000,000 as claimed by Hawaiian Telephone. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">Hawaiian Telephone argues the Commission committed reversible error when it approved rate increases calculated to \u201cproduce an annual revenue increase of $27,121,000\u201d and yield a \u201cnet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>operating income of $41,700,000.\u201d The Commission, the Company claims, \u201cadopted an unprecedented and unlawful method of determining the rate increase and then reduced the already inadequate award by the unsupported and unlawful use of a so-called \u2018Separation Adjustment.\u2019 \u201d The initial specification of error is that \u201c[t]he Commission erred in failing to find a fair rate of return.\u201d But we are not convinced this was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">We are mindful, of course, that orthodoxy in public utility rate making suggests four sequential determinations should precede the ultimate rate decision; they are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-6\">(1) what are the enterprise\u2019s <em>gross utility revenues </em>under the rate structure examined; (2) what are its <em>operating expenses, </em>including maintenance, depreciation and all taxes, appropriately incurred to produce those gross revenues; (3) what utility property provides the service for which rates are charged and thus represents the base <em>(rate base) </em>on which a return should be earned and (4) what percentage figure <em>(rate of return) </em>should be applied to the rate base in order to establish the <em>return </em>(wages of capital) to which investors in the utility enterprise are reasonably entitled.[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">1 A. <em>Priest, Principles of Public Utility Regulation </em>45 (1969) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">The regulatory agency in this case acknowledged it did not determine \u201cwhat percentage figure <em>(rate of return) </em>should be applied to the rate base in order to establish the <em>return.\u201d Id. </em>The public utility asserts the neglect was fatal. It maintains our decisions in <em>Honolulu Gas Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, </em>33 Haw. 487 (1935), and <em>In re Hawaii Electric Light Co., </em>60 Haw. 625, 594 P.2d 612 (1979), \u201cma[k]e it abundantly clear that a fair rate of return finding is essential to the, regulatory process,\u201d directing us to statements therein that seemingly support the thesis. Still, the enforce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>ment of text-book orthodoxy in the rate-making process is not our function under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) Chapters 269 and 91; nor is it our practice to decide important questions of law by dicta from unrelated cases. <em>Cf. Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, </em>390 U.S. 747, 775 (1968) (the Supreme \u201cCourt does not decide important questions of law by cursory dicta inserted in unrelated cases.\u201d), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>392 U.S. 917 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Our function in rate making is a limited one. \u201c[T]he general supervision . . . over all public utilities\u201d has been delegated to the Public Utilities Commission. HRS \u00a7 269-6 (Supp. 1983). \u201cIt is the Commission that is authorized to fix \u2018just and reasonable\u2019 rates to be charged by public utilities, HRS \u00a7 269-16 (1976), and a reviewing court is not empowered to examine the case <em>de novo.\u201d In re Hawaii Electric Light Co., </em>60 Haw. at 629, 594 P.2d at 617 (citations omitted). Our role is circumscribed by the provisions of HRS \u00a7 91-14(g).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Section 91-14(g)(3), however, expressly provides that an administrative decision and order is subject to reversal or modification if \u201c[m]ade upon unlawful procedure.\u201d Since the claim of error here concerns the procedure employed in approving revised rate schedules for utility services, our task is to consider the challenged action in the light of pertinent procedural mandates.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">The procedural requirements relating to rate determinations are delineated in HRS \u00a7 269-16(b). The subsection requires that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>changes in rate schedules be preceded by notice and commission approval.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> And a rate increase can only be approved after \u201ca public hearing\u201d at which consumers or patrons of the utility are allowed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>to present their views regarding the increase and \u201ca contested case hearing.\u201d <em>See supra </em>note 11. Hawaiian Telephone does not dispute that the necessary \u201cpublic hearing\u201d and \u201ccontested case hearing\u201d were conducted; nor does it contend the subsection expressly calls for a fair <em>rate </em>of return finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">This aspect of the challenge of the rate order is purportedly grounded on the final portion of \u00a7 269-16(b), which \u201csums up the requirements of the entire ratemaking process\u201d and dictates \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d rates, \u201csuch as shall provide a fair return on the property . . . used or useful for public utility purposes.\u201d <em>See supra </em>note 11. Citing general principles of rate making, the Company argues a fair return determination can only follow a finding on a fair <em>rate </em>of return. And since no such finding preceded the decision on what the amount of the return would be, it would have us declare the rate order failed to meet the statutory standard enunciated in \u00a7 269-16(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Whether the rates set by the Commission are \u201cjust and reasonable,\u201d however, is by no means dependent on the procedure fob lowed by the rate-making body in deciding what return would be fair in the circumstances. \u201cUnder the statutory standard of \u2018just and reasonable\u2019 it is the result reached not the method employed which is controlling.\u201d <em>Federal Power Commission v. Hope Natural Gas Co., </em>320 U.S. 591, 602 (1944) (citations omitted); <em>In re Hawaii Electric Light Co., </em>60 Haw. at 637, 594 P.2d at 621. As the Supreme Court explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-7\">It is not theory but the impact of the rate order which counts. If the total effect of the rate order cannot be said to be unjust and unreasonable, judicial inquiry ... is at an end. The fact that the method employed to reach that result may contain infirmities is not then important.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-8\"><em>Federal Power Commission v. Hope Natural Gas Co., </em>320 U.S. at 602. Discerning no statutory basis for faulting the method employed by the Commission in determining the return the utility was entitled to, we proceed to the question of whether the rate order, in total effect, can be said to be unjust and unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">In Hawaiian Telephone\u2019s opinion the Commission failed \u201cto provide ... an opportunity [for the utility] to earn a fair return . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>by arbitrarily limiting the rate award to a certain amount of net operating income\u201d and also erred \u201cin awarding a rate increase sufficient only to produce an annual revenue increase of $27,121,000 instead of the $47,600,000 requested.\u201d Essentially, the claim is that the rate increases were not \u201csuch as shall provide a fair return.\u201d <em>See supra </em>note 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">The Commission acknowledgedly tailored rate increases to produce less revenue than sought and to yield \u201ca certain amount of net operating income.\u201d The resulting rate of return was 9.18% on the intrastate rate base rather than the 14.27% sought or the 11.3% and 12+% urged respectively by the Consumer Advocate and the Department of Defense, an intervenor in the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">\u201cRates which produce a return . .. more than 2% lower than the lowest rate of return [supported by an expert witness] in the case,\u201d Hawaiian Telephone contends, \u201cclearly are unjust, unreasonable and confiscatory.\u201d Still, \u201cthe reasonableness of [utility] rates is not determined by a fixed formula but is a fact question requiring the exercise of sound discretion by the Commission.\u201d <em>In re Hawaii Electric Light Co., </em>60 Haw. at 636, 594 P.2d at 620 (citations omitted); <em>see also Federal Power Commission v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co., </em>315 U.S. 575, 586 (1942). <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Furthermore, \u201c[i]t is . . . recognized that the ratemaking function involves the making of \u2018pragmatic\u2019 adjustments and .. . there is a \u2018zone of reasonableness\u2019 within which the [C]ommission may exercise its judgment.\u201d 60 Haw. at 636, 594 P.2d at 620 (citations omitted). Viewing the decision and order in context with these precepts in mind, we cannot say the Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>arbitrarily limited the rate award or clearly erred in any other respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">The rate award was obviously shaped to take account of uncommon circumstances. Admittedly it was influenced by significant events that anteceded the application for approval of rate increases, including assertions that \u201c$130 million in transition payments [would] lessen the need for local rate increases.\u201d And revised rate schedules designed to provide the $41,700,000 in net operating income Hawaiian Telephone said would be required in test year 1982, rather than those submitted earlier by the utility, were approved. To be sure, the Commission deviated from normal practice in several respects as alleged. Yet as we observed earlier, \u201c[a]gencies to whom [the rate-making] power has been delegated are free, within the ambit of their statutory authority, to make the pragmatic adjustments which may be called for by particular circumstances.\u201d <em>Federal Power Commission v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co., </em>315 U.S. at 586; <em>see also In re Hawaii Electric Light Co., </em>60 Haw. at 636, 594 P.2d at 620.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">The particular circumstances in the considered judgment of the rate-making agency called for practical adjustments to protect the public interest, and we perceive no grounds for a countermand of the ruling. Where approval by the FCC of a plan devised by AT&amp;T and Hawaiian Telephone to postpone ordered rate reductions for interstate services and to provide $130,000,000 in \u201ctransitional supplements\u201d for the latter over a four-year period was procured with the support of the State of Hawaii and such support was secured on a representation that telephone users in Hawaii would otherwise be subjected to \u201ca local rate case generating $30-35 million per year,\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> it would have been surprising if the Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>had not looked askance at a plea for approval of intrastate rate schedules calculated to produce $47,600,000 in additional revenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">We detect no basis for deeming the rate order confiscatory. Though witnesses testifying at the contested case hearing thought a fair rate of return would be several percentage points above the 9.18% return the approved rates were likely to provide, we think 9.18% was within the \u2018zone of reasonableness.\u2019 <em>In re Hawaii Electric Light Co., </em>60 Haw. at 636, 594 P.2d at 620 (citations omitted). \u201c[Reasonableness ... is not determined by a fixed formula but is a fact question requiring the exercise of sound discretion . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>When invoked as a guide, sound discretion is that \u201cexercised not arbitrarily or wilfully, but with regard to what is right and equitable under the circumstances and the law.\u201d <em>Langnes v. Green, </em>282 U.S. 531, 541 (1931) (quoted in <em>Cooke Trust Co. v. Edwards, </em>43 Haw. 226, 231 (1959)).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Here, the Commission allowed rate increases calculated to yield the net operating income Hawaiian Telephone decided it needed. The resulting rate of return for the utility was higher than the 8.6% it said would be yielded by the revised rate schedules submitted for approval. And we have recounted some of the other factors considered by the Commission in approving rate schedules structured to produce a net operating income of $41,700,000. Under the circumstances, we could not say the Commission was arbitrary; we would have to agree the rate order was fashioned with regard to what appeared right and equitable under the circumstances and the law. In the words of the Commission, \u201c[t]o insure that rates are \u2018just and reasonable\u2019 includes the power to take into consideration the interest of the ratepayers as well as that of the utility owners.\u201d P.U.C. Decision and Order No. 7412, at 27.</p>\n<p id=\"A4J\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">The foregoing conclusion that the rate order was just and reasonable in total effect would normally end our inquiry. Hawaiian Telephone, however, avers the decision under review is flawed in yet another respect; it alleges the Commission erred \u201cby making an unsupported and unlawful \u2018Separation Adjustment.\u2019 \u201d We have examined the claim that the State agency invaded a federally preempted area by varying a jurisdictional separation approved by the FCC, but find the claim to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Since the property of a telephone company is used in providing both intrastate and interstate telecommunications services and expenses are incurred in the joint rendition of such services, \u201ca separation of telephone property, revenues, and expenses between the intrastate and interstate operations of the company ... \u2018is essential to the appropriate recognition of the competent governmental authority in each field of regulation.\u2019 \u201d NARUC-FCC Separations Manual, <em>supra, </em>at 5 (quoting <em>Smith v. Illinois Bell Telephone Co., </em>282 U.S. 133, 148 (1930)). Hawaiian Telephone would have us rule the Commission intruded in an area reserved for federal regulation by adjusting the Company\u2019s intrastate rate base for the test year to reflect the consequences of its agreement with AT&amp;T which deferred rate reductions on interstate telecommunications services and stipulated that its share of the revenue generated by furnishing such services during the test year would consist of a cost-based portion and a \u201ctransitional supplement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">The Commission, of course, may not interfere with federal regulation of interstate telecommunications services; the Supremacy Clause does not countenance rulings by a state rate-making agency that \u201cmay produce a result inconsistent with the objective of the federal [regulatory] statute.\u201d <em>Maryland v. Louisiana, </em>451 U.S. 725, 747 (1981) (quoting <em>Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., </em>331 U.S. 218, 230 (1947)). Thus for example, a state agency may not adopt for its rate-making purposes a depreciation formula incompatible with the depreciation method decreed for such purposes by the FCC through a preemption order. <em>See New England Telephone </em>&amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number><em>Telegraph Co. v. Public Utilities Commission of Maine, </em>570 F. Supp. 1558 (D.Me. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Here, the Commission neither varied a formula, method, or procedure decreed by the federal agency nor tampered with interstate rates in any way. It expressly rejected the Consumer Advocate\u2019s thesis that the circumstances surrounding the approval of \u201ctransitional supplements\u201d by the FCC rendered it appropriate for those receipts to be considered as intrastate revenue, recognizing that \u201c[t]he use of interstate revenues to satisfy intrastate revenue requirements would violate the fundamental principles of jurisdictional separations.\u201d P.U.C. Order and Decision No. 7412, at 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">These precepts also impelled the Commission to take account of the federal prologue to the local rate case in fixing the intrastate rate base, for inequity could have been the result if the FCC\u2019s action and its effect on the apportionment of property, expenses, and revenue between jurisdictions were ignored. If each agency paid no heed to the action of the other in this area of mutual concern, a possible consequence could be that some costs of plant and expenses would not be included in the rate computations of either. In the situation above, the \u201ccarrier may be deprived of a fair rate of return when interstate and intrastate jurisdictions are both taken into account.\u201d <em>New England Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, </em>448 A.2d 272, 298 (Me. 1982). Conversely, where property and expenses are allocated to both jurisdictions or misallocated, the resulting rates may be unjust and unreasonable for the telephone user.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">Confronted by what appeared to be a misallocation of property and expenses, the Commission decided the circumstances called for an adjustment of the intrastate rate base. It initially observed the rate base claimed by the Company in this proceeding had been derived from an application of the separations method embodied in the NARUC-FCC Separations Manual (the Ozark Plan). P.U.C. Decision and Order No. 7412, at 23. But for the crucial agreement sanctioned by the FCC, the rate base would have been computed in accord with the separations method employed in the preceding rate case, Hawaiian Plan II. <em>Id. </em>Had this been done \u201cthe intrastate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>earnings under present rates,\u201d the Commission found, \u201cwould have been higher than that projected .. .

Thus, by changing from Hawaiian Plan II to Ozark there are considerably more allocations of expenses and rate base items from the interstate to intrastate operation. The end result is that the intrastate rate of return under present rates is reduced by 1.1% from the conversion of Hawaiian Plan II to Ozark with virtually no change in total company expenses and expenditures on an overall basis. Also, there is no evidence to show that there is a change in the relative use and operations of HTC and the cardinal rule in separations formulas is that plant and expenses must be assigned on the basis of relative use \u2014 not on the basis of revenues. Even though the transitional supplement is deemed interstate revenues, the fact of the matter is that by switching to the Ozark separations plan, there was an adverse effect on the earnings of the intrastate operations. The overall effect is the shifting of the expenses and plant from the interstate to intrastate operations <em>but </em>with no change in the relative use and no change in HTC\u2019s total operations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">P.U.C.
