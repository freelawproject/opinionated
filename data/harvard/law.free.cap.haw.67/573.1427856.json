He now contends the trial court erred in accepting his guilty plea, in refusing to allow him to withdraw the plea, and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>denying him the possibility of parole. We conclude that the trial court did not err in accepting the guilty plea or in refusing to allow its withdrawal, but that the court abused its discretion when imposing sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">Appellant and another man, Melvin Levi, were indicted in October 1981 for the 1969 murder of Gordon Scott. Count I of the indictment charged Levi with first degree murder, Count II charged Appellant with first degree murder, and Count III charged Appellant as an accessory before the fact to Scott\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">Appellant successfully moved to sever his trial from that of his co-defendant. Levi was brought to trial first and was found guilty of first degree murder by a jury verdict on September 24, 1982.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Soon thereafter, on November 29, 1982, Appellant tendered a plea of guilty to Count II of the indictment. His plea was the result of negotiations with the prosecution for certain concessions regarding bail and sentencing: the prosecution agreed not to seek any increase in Appellant\u2019s bail prior to sentencing; not to request the imposition of any particular sentence but to submit on the recommendation of the pre-sentence report; and not to oppose Appellant\u2019s motion to be sentenced under the provisions of the Hawaii Penal Code, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7\u00a7 701-100 <em>et seq. </em>(1976). At the change-of-plea hearing on November 29, 1982, the prosecution also agreed not to prosecute Appellant on Count III of the indictment. The court accepted Appellant\u2019s guilty plea and referred him for a pre-sentence diagnosis and report.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">At the sentencing hearing, the prosecution complied with its agreement by \u201cstanding silent.\u201d The sentencing judge, however, denied Appellant\u2019s motion to be sentenced under the 1973 Penal Code. The court instead sentenced Appellant under the law in effect in 1969 to a life term without any possibility of parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">On March 3, 1983, Appellant filed a motion to withdraw his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>guilty plea, which was subsequently denied by the trial court. Appellant then brought this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Appellant contends the trial court erred in accepting his guilty plea. He argues, first, that the court failed to adequately insure that he understood the finality of his plea. The transcript of the change-of-plea hearing does not support his argument. The court questioned Appellant as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-7\">THE COURT: Knowing what the maximum penalties are, is it stilf your intent to plead guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-9\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-10\">THE COURT: You understand that if you do not like what the Court does in regards to your sentence, you cannot change your mind; it would be too late at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-11\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-12\">Appellant\u2019s contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-13\">Appellant also argues that the court failed to ascertain that there was a sufficient factual basis for the plea, as required by Hawaii Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 11(f).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant claims that in the course of his plea interrogation, he did not admit to the requisite intent to bring about the death of Gordon Scott and lacking such admission, his plea of guilty cannot stand. Appellant simply ignores the fact that the court is not required to elicit the factual basis for a plea solely from him. Here, the court asked the prosecution to make a representation as to the facts which would be proved at trial, especially facts relevant to a determination of Appellant\u2019s intent. No objection was raised by Appellant to the prosecution\u2019s representation. Moreover, the court was aware of the testimony and other evidence previously introduced at the trial of Appellant\u2019s co-defendant, some of which was relevant to the charges against Appellant. Considering all of the information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>available to the court, there was a sufficient factual basis for the guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">We turn to the question of whether the court erred when it refused to permit Appellant to withdraw the plea after sentencing. HRPP Rule 32(d) allows a defendant to withdraw his plea after sentencing \u201cto correct manifest injustice.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">Appellant\u2019s argument rests on the central premise that it is \u201cmanifestly unjust\u201d to hold him to his bargain with the prosecution when his expectation that the court would concur in the prosecution\u2019s sentencing \u201crecommendation\u201d was not fulfilled.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">We addressed this issue in <em>State v. Gumienny, </em>58 Haw. 304, 568 P.2d 1194 (1977), in which the question was whether a defendant should have been permitted to withdraw a guilty plea made pursuant to a plea bargain, where the prosecution had fulfilled its part of the bargain by moving for deferred acceptance of the guilty plea but the court denied the motion and accepted the plea. We held that the defendant\u2019s unilateral expectation that the motion would be granted did not entitle him to withdraw his plea, in light of conscientious efforts by the court to make the defendant understand that he could not rely on any such expectation and the absence of any showing that the expectation was improperly induced.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">As in <em>Gumienny, </em>the trial court in this case made conscientious efforts to make Appellant understand that the court was not obliged to accept the prosecution\u2019s recommendations, <em>i.e., </em>that despite the prosecution\u2019s compliance with the agreement, the court could sentence Appellant to a life term without the possibility of parole. Moreover, there is no evidence or allegation that Appellant\u2019s expectation of the court\u2019s concurrence was improperly induced by anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>In keeping with the views we expressed in <em>Gumienny, </em>we hold that the trial court\u2019s failure to act in accordance with Appellant\u2019s unilateral expectations, however reasonable those expectations may be, does not give rise to any manifest injustice within the meaning of Rule 32(d). Therefore the trial court did not err in refusing to allow Appellant to withdraw his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Finally, Appellant challenges the trial court\u2019s decision to impose a sentence of life imprisonment not subject to parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">The Hawaii Penal Code, HRS \u00a7\u00a7 701-100 <em>et seq. </em>(1976), became effective on January 1, 1973. Section 701-101(1) of the Code provides that it \u201cdoes not apply to offenses committed before its effective date. Prosecutions for offenses committed before the effective date are governed by the prior law, which is continued in effect for that purpose, as if this Code were not in force.\u201d Therefore, Appellant was properly charged under the pre-Code law, HRS \u00a7 748-1 (1968).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">The Code also provides, however, that \u201c[i]n any case pending on or commenced after the effective date of this Code, involving an offense committed before that date .. . [u]pon the request of the defendant and the approval of the court. .. [t]he court may impose a sentence or suspend imposition of a sentence under the provisions of this Code applicable to the offense and the offender.\u201d HRS \u00a7 701-101(2) (1976). In other words, the Code\u2019s sentencing provisions may be applied in cases otherwise governed by pre-Code law.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">The Code brought about a significant change in the sentence for murder. Under pre-Code law, a conviction for first degree murder carried a penalty of life imprisonment not subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>parole.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under the Code, however, the sentence for murder is life imprisonment with the possibility of parole except in four specific types of cases, including murder for hire, in which a life term without the possibility of parole is mandated.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Therefore, Appellant was certain to receive a life term not subject to parole if he was sentenced under pre-Code law, but if the court acceded to his request to be sentenced under the provisions of the Code, he would receive a life term with the possibility of parole unless his case fell within one of the four exceptions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>Murder, first degree. Murder in the first degree is the killing of any human being without authority, justification, or extenuation by law done:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-12\">(1) With deliberate premeditated malice aforethought; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-13\">(2) With malice aforethought and with extreme atrocity or cruelty; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-14\">(3) In the commission of or attempt to commit or the flight from the commission of or attempt to commit arson, rape, robbery, burglary, or kidnapping.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>At the sentencing hearing, Appellant made a timely request that the court sentence him under the Code provisions. The court proceeded to state on the record the various factors which it felt to be pertinent to its decision on Appellant\u2019s request. The court first noted the testimony of the several witnesses at the sentencing hearing who gave their opinions of Appellant\u2019s character and stated their views that Appellant was not a threat to the community, possessed many positive attributes, and therefore deserved to be considered for parole. The court also noted Appellant\u2019s distinguished <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>career as a dentist, his background of community service, his lack of other criminal convictions, and his age and medical condition, all of which tended to support his request for leniency in sentencing. The court then proceeded to give two reasons why it felt Appellant should be sentenced under pre-Code law. First, the court made a \u201cfinding\u201d that Appellant had hired his co-defendant to kill Gordon Scott. Inasmuch as the Penal Code mandates a life term without possibility of parole in cases of murder for hire, the court concluded that the penalty applicable to Appellant under the Penal Code is the same as the applicable penalty under pre-Code law: in both cases the possibility of parole is denied. The second reason given by the court for sentencing Appellant under pre-Code law is that Appellant\u2019s co-defendant had already been sentenced to life imprisonment not subject to parole, and \u201c[a]s a matter of justice and as an example to others, this Court believes that a person who persuades and induces another to commit a murder should receive the penalty no smaller than the penalty imposed on the person who commits the murder.\u201d On this basis the court then sentenced Appellant under pre-Code law to life imprisonment not subject to parole. Both of the court\u2019s stated reasons for sentencing Appellant under pre-Code law are based on the court\u2019s finding that this was a murder for hire. The issue is whether the court was entitled to make such a finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">\u201cMurder for hire\u201d was not identified as a discrete offense under pre-Code law; rather, a person who hired someone to kill another was criminally liable for the murder by virtue of HRS \u00a7 704-3 and \u00a7 704-4 (1968) which establish the definition and liability of an accessory before the fact.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Appellant was charged under these pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>visions in Count III of the indictment. Appellant did not, however, plead guilty to Count III. He pled only to Count II which charged him as a principal in the murder. His admission of guilt to Count II can in no way be construed as an admission of murder for hire, and at no time in the course of these proceedings has Appellant ever admitted to hiring Levi to kill Gordon Scott. In fact, the presentence report contains a statement by Appellant in which he explicitly denied having any monetary agreement with Levi prior to the killing. There was evidence that Appellant made several monetary payments to Levi after the killing, but Appellant indicated that Levi extorted these payments from him under threat of exposure of their crime. The evidence that this was a murder for hire must be characterized as ambiguous at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Apao, </em>59 Haw. 625, 586 P.2d 250 (1978), we considered the question of whether it was error to include in an indictment for murder the allegation that the victim was known by the person being indicted to be a witness in a murder prosecution. The fact that the victim was a witness in a murder prosecution was not an essential element of the crime of murder, but it is an aggravating circumstance \u2014 like murder for hire \u2014 which gives rise to enhanced sentencing provisions under HRS \u00a7 706-606. We decided that \u201cthe better rule is to include in the indictment the allegations, which if proved, would result in application of a statute enhancing the penalty for the crime committed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 636, 586 P.2d at 258. We observed that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-7\">[w]here a factor aggravates an offense and causes the defendant to be subject to a greater punishment than would otherwise be imposed, due process requires that the issue of whether that factor is present, must be presented to the jury upon proper allegations and a verdict thereon rendered before the court can impose the harsher penalty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 635, 586 P.2d at 258 (quoting <em>State v. Frazier, </em>81 Wash. 2d 628, 633, 503 P.2d 1073, 1077 (1972)).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">By \u201cfinding\u201d that Appellant had in fact hired Levi to commit the killing, thus concluding that the enhancing provisions of HRS \u00a7 706-606(a) were applicable, the trial court adjudicated this disputed issue without the benefit of so much as an evidentiary hearing. Therefore, the court\u2019s imposition of the pre-Code penalty was an abuse of discretion at the least, if not a violation of Appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>due process rights.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A0j\"><em>Pamela J. Berman </em>for defendant-appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"ApN\"><em>Lynn L.
