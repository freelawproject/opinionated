Appellants contend that the State had to prove that the appellants were not 18 years of age or younger and that it failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-21\">Appellants\u2019 contention is based on HRS \u00a7 701-114(l)(c) which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>requires that the State prove facts establishing jurisdiction of the trial court beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AmI\"><em>Tyrus Buyama (Michael K. Tanigawa </em>on the opening brief for appellant Hasegawa and <em>Alvin T. Sasaki </em>on the opening brief for appellant Carreira), Deputy Public Defenders, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Ae0\"><em>Arthur E. Ross, </em>Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">However, there is no dispute that the trial court in both instances had jurisdiction to try the offense in question. Moreover, the appellants made no contention below, nor do they make any contention here, that they, or either of them, were in fact 18 years of age or younger and therefore triable only in family court.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The situation is analogous to the ancient privilege of \u201cbenefit of clergy\u201d existing at common law in England in medieval times. With respect to certain offenses, clergymen were triable only in ecclesiastical, not secular, courts. If they were accused of crimes of such a nature that the privilege applied, they raised the contention that they were clergymen by appropriate motion. <em>See </em>the definition of \u201cbenefit of clergy\u201d in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th ed.) at 144 (1979).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">We hold that there is no need for the State to prove in each criminal prosecution that the accused is over 18 years of age. If appellants had genuinely contended that they were 18 years of age or younger in these cases, it was their burden to raise the matter by appropriate motion. Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b103-10\"> They usually established that they were clergymen by demonstrating that they could read and write.
