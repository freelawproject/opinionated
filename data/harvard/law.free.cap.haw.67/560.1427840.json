The Department of Social Services and Housing (DSSH) found that Tanele was not medically disabled to engage in a substantial gainful employment, and concluded that Tanele was not qualified to receive benefits. A fair hearing officer upheld DSSH\u2019s decision. On appeal, the circuit court affirmed the decision and order of the hearing officer. Tanele appeals the circuit court\u2019s affirmance. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">In order to qualify for general assistance benefits under HRS \u00a7 346-71(b) a person must be: (1) between 18 and 65 years of age; (2) determined to be needy; (3) unable to qualify under the Federal Supplemental Security Income Program; and (4) unable to engage in any substantial gainful employment because of a physical or mental impairment determined and certified by a licensed physician.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> HRS \u00a7 346-71 (b)(3) defines \u201csubstantial\u201d to mean at least <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>thirty hours of work per week.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> DSSH\u2019s Administrative Rule \u00a7 17-637-2 similarly defines \u201cdisabled\u201d.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">The hearing officer found that Tanele was not medically disabled to engage in substantial gainful employment. The only evidence on Tanele\u2019s ability to perform any work were reports from Dr. Ramseyer and Dr. Kamada. Dr. Ramseyer\u2019s report was filed on a form provided by DSSH which asked whether Tanele could be expected to perform either manual or sedentary work at least 30 hours per week. Dr. Ramseyer responded that Tanele could not. Dr. Kamada\u2019s report was not made on the DSSH form. His report stated that Tanele \u201cis capable of doing light sedentary type of work.\u201d Nothing was reported by Dr. Kamada on the length of time per week that Tanele could do light sedentary work.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">There are only two findings made by the hearing officer pertinent to the issue of Tanele\u2019s eligibility for general assistance. Finding number 5 states: \u201cOn April 9, 1982, Dr. Ramseyer completed a General Medical Examination Report (DSSH 1000A) concluding the claimant was unable to work.\u201d Finding number 8 states: \u201cDr. Kamada concluded the claimant could do light sedentary work.\u201d In view of the requirement that the applicant be unable to perform 30 hours of work per week pursuant to the definition of \u201csubstantial\u201d under HRS \u00a7 346-71(b)(3) and \u201cdisabled\u201d under Administrative Rule \u00a7 17-637-2, and in light of finding numbers 5 and 8, we conclude that the hearing officer\u2019s conclusion is erroneous. Neither the findings nor any evidence in the record support the hearing officer\u2019s conclusion. To the contrary, the findings and the evidence in the record support Tanele\u2019s contention that he is incapable of engaging in a substantial gainful employment for at least thirty hours of work per week. <em>See Camara v.
