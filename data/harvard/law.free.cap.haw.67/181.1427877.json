The trial court suppressed the gun, ruling that the officer was not entitled to open the knapsack once it was removed from the immediate control of the defendant. The Intermediate Court of Appeals reversed, upholding the search under a \u201cplain feel\u201d rule. <em>State v. Ortiz, </em>4 Haw. App. 143, 662 P.2d 517 (1983). We affirm the intermediate court\u2019s result but vacate its \u201cplain feel\u201d ruling; instead we find that the warrantless search here was a valid protective weapons search under <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1 (1968) and its progeny.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">On August 12, 1981, at approximately 2 o\u2019clock in the morning, Officer Brad Bennett was driving alone in the Wahiawa business area in his police car. He observed defendant Ortiz carrying a knapsack across an empty parking lot adjacent to some business establishments. When Ortiz saw the police car he ran to the side of one of the buildings. Bennett drove into the parking lot, exited, and found Ortiz hiding next to some trash cans and boxes, seated on the ground with his knapsack about six inches to his right.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Bennett approached Ortiz and asked him what he was doing there. Ortiz responded that he didn\u2019t know. When asked by Bennett whose knapsack it was, Ortiz answered it was his, but when asked what was in it, he responded, \u201cNothing\u201d and grabbed for the knapsack with his right hand. Feeling \u201csomething was wrong,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Bennett reached down and took the sack away from Ortiz, immediately feeling \u201cwhat seemed like a butt to a handgun\u201d through the thin fabric. Bennett unzipped the bag and verified that it contained a handgun and holster. He then placed Ortiz under arrest and took Ortiz and the gun to the police station. At the station Bennett examined the gun and found it was loaded. Ortiz was subsequently indicted for possession of a firearm by a felon in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 134-7(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">Prior to trial Ortiz moved to suppress the handgun, contending that once a law enforcement officer reduces personal property to his possession, the officer may not search the property either as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>incident to a valid investigative stop, <em>see e.g., Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1 (1968) or as incident to a lawful arrest, relying on <em>United States v. Chadwick, </em>433 U.S. 1 (1977) and <em>State v. Jenkins, </em>62 Haw. 660, 619 P.2d 108 (1980). The State sought to justify the warrantless search under several exceptions to the warrant requirement: as a protective search for weapons under <em>Terry, </em>as incident to an arrest, and under a \u201cplain feel\u201d or \u201cplain touch\u201d analog of the \u201cplain view\u201d exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">The trial court suppressed the gun. In its modified findings, the court, concluded (1) Officer Bennett made a valid stop to question Ortiz; (2) Ortiz\u2019s claimed ignorance and furtive reach for the bag gave Bennett \u201creason to believe that criminal activity was afoot, and that defendant might be armed and dangerous;\u201d (3) Bennett properly seized the knapsack even though he lacked probable cause to make an arrest; (4) when Bennett felt the gun butt he then had probable cause to arrest Ortiz; and (5) \u201conce the bag was removed from the immediate control of the defendant Ortiz, that Officer Bennett exceeded the scope of the search incident to arrest, and he at that time violated defendant\u2019s rights under the Fourth Amendment,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> citing <em>State v. Kaluna, </em>55 Haw. 361, 520 P.2d 51 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">On appeal, the Intermediate Court of Appeals held (1) Ortiz had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the handbag; (2) Bennett\u2019s initial stop of Ortiz and seizure of the knapsack were valid under <em>Terry; </em>(3) the search was an invalid search incident to arrest under <em>Kaluna </em>and <em>State v. Jenkins, </em>62 Haw. 660, 619 P.2d 108 (1980) \u201cbecause the knapsack was in Bennett\u2019s exclusive control when it was searched,\u201d 4 Haw. App. at 159, 662 P.2d at 529; but (4) the search was valid under the \u201cplain feel\u201d doctrine, citing <em>United States v. Ocampo, </em>650 F.2d 421 (2d Cir. 1981). We granted certiorari to consider the wisdom of recognizing yet another exception to the warrant requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"A_P\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">We begin our discussion with the principle that warrantless searches are presumptively unreasonable unless they fall within a specifically-established and well-delineated exception to the warrant requirement. Jenk<em>ins, </em>62 Haw. at 662, 619 P.2d at 110; <em>State v. Elderts, </em>62 Haw. 495, 498, 617 P.2d 89, 92 (1980); <em>State v. Kender, </em>60 Haw. 301, 307, 588 P.2d 447, 451 (1978). The exception we find applicable here is the protective search for weapons incident to a valid investigative stop, first announced in <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 30-31. Because there is no question that the initial stop of Ortiz and seizure of his knapsack were valid,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the only issue presented to us for decision is the validity of the trial court\u2019s conclusion that a weapons search of the knapsack was improper once it was removed from Ortiz\u2019s immediate control.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">As noted in <em>Terry, </em>a protective weapons search must be \u201creasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place.\u201d 392 U.S. at 20. \u201c[A] seizure lawful at its inception can nevertheless violate the Fourth Amendment because its manner of execution unreasonably infringes possessory interests protected by the Fourth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on \u2018unreasonable seizures.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. </em>Jacobsen, _U.S. _, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>104 S. Ct. 1652, 1662 (1984). The reasonableness of a weapons search is determined by balancing the State\u2019s interest in searching against the individual\u2019s interest in freedom from unreasonable government intrusions. <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 21; <em>see also, Jacobsen, </em>104 S. Ct. at 1662-63: <em>United, States v. </em>Place, _ U.S. _, 103 S. Ct. 2637, 2642 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">Here, Ortiz argued and the trial court agreed that once Officer Bennett had the knapsack in his hand, he should have taken Ortiz and the unopened knapsack to the police station and there obtained a search warrant. Two strong interests, however, supported Officer Bennett\u2019s immediate search of the knapsack. First and foremost, a dangerous weapon was involved. Second, without opening the knapsack he may not have had the requisite probable cause to arrest Ortiz and obtain a search warrant and thus may have had to return the knapsack to Ortiz unexamined.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">The hallmark of the protective weapons search sanctioned in <em>Terry </em>is the probable presence of a dangerous weapon.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because a weapon is involved, the search need not be preceded by probable cause and a warrant if, from the specific conduct of the defendant, from reliable information, or from attendant circumstances, the police officer reasonably infers the person stopped is armed and presently dangerous. <em>State v. Madamba, </em>62 Haw. 453, 457, 617 P.2d 76, 78 (1980); <em>State v. Ward, </em>62 Haw. 459, 462, 617 P.2d 565, 567 (1980); <em>State v. Barnes, </em>58 Haw. 333, 338, 568 P.2d 1207, 1212 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>(1977); <em>State v. Uddipa, </em>3 Haw. App. 415, 419, 651 P.2d 507, 510 (1982). The search is judged by an objective standard of reasonableness, taking into account the totality of the circumstances. <em>See, Uddipa, </em>3 Haw. App. at 418-19, 651 P.2d at 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">In the present case, there are specific facts which support Bennett\u2019s objectively reasonable belief that Ortiz was armed and a search of the knapsack was necessary for his own protection: (1) Ortiz had made a quick grab for his allegedly empty knapsack; (2) Bennett was one-on-one with Ortiz, <em>c.f., Adams v. Williams, </em>407 U.S. 143, 147 (1972); (3) it was late at night, <em>cf, Adams, supra; State v. Kea, supra; </em>(4) Bennett had ho idea whether Ortiz had a hidden confederate who might suddenly appear;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and (5) after feeling what seemed like a gun butt Bennett had a strong firsthand suspicion the knapsack contained a gun. Taken together, these facts support Officer Bennett\u2019s legitimate interest in a protective search of Ortiz\u2019s knapsack. <em>Accord, State v. Madamba, </em>62 Haw. at 458, 617 P.2d at 79; <em>State v. Ward, </em>62 Haw. at 462-63, 617 P.2d at 567; <em>State v. Kea, </em>61 Haw. at 569, 606 P.2d at 1332; <em>see also, Nash v. State, </em>295 A.2d 715, 717 (Del. 1972) (officer seized and opened suspected gun case after detainee reached for it; held: opening the case \u201cwas the only reasonable course of action for the police officer to follow\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">Moreover, without searching the knapsack Bennett was in a catch-22 situation: if he arrested Ortiz and seized the knapsack on a suspicion it contained an unlicensed gun he might have made an illegal arrest and seizure on less than probable cause, but if he returned the bag unopened to Ortiz he put his life in danger. The only safe thing to do w\u00e1s open the knapsack, verify its contents, and arrest Ortiz.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">Although the trial and intermediate courts thought Bennett had probable cause to arrest Ortiz the instant he suspected he felt a gun butt, we are not so certain. Bennett could not be positive the knapsack contained a gun until he opened it. Indeed, Ortiz\u2019s coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>sel argued this point at the suppression hearings.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Furthermore, it is not illegal in Hawaii to carry a concealed gun if the carrier has a license. <em>See, </em>HRS \u00a7 134-9 (Supp. 1983). Thus, prior to opening the knapsack it is likely Bennett had grounds for a reasonable inference that Ortiz was armed rathfer than probable cause to believe Ortiz was committing a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Given the closeness of the question we find Bennett had a legitimate interest in searching the knapsack. Police officers need not risk a shot in the back by returning containers which they reasonably suspect contain a dangerous weapon but may lack probable cause to seize. <em>See, </em>3 LaFave, <em>Search and Seizure </em>\u00a7 9.4(d) at 132-133 &amp; n.128 (1978). As the United States Supreme Court has noted, \u201cthe policeman making a reasonable investigatory stop should not be denied the opportunity to protect himself from attack by a hostile suspect.\u201d <em>Adams v. Williams, </em>407 U.S. at 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Against Officer Bennett\u2019s interest in searching the knapsack, we must weigh Ortiz\u2019s interest in freedom from unreasonble police intrusions. A knapsack is, generally speaking, a recognized repository for personal effects and therefore deserves constitutional protection. <em>See, State v. Joyner, </em>66 Haw. 543, 546 (1983); <em>Jenkins, supra. </em>However, once Officer Bennett had properly seized the knapsack and inadvertently felt what he thought might be a gun, his further act of opening it was a <em>de minimis </em>intrusion on Ortiz\u2019s privacy. <em>Cf., Jacobsen, </em>104 S. Ct. at 1663 (field test of cocaine was <em>de minimis </em>intrusion). To a large extent, Ortiz\u2019s privacy interest in his knapsack was lost when, as a result of his own threatening actions, Officer Bennett properly seized the knapsack and felt the outline of its contents. At that point, opening the knapsack itself, although a \u201csearch,\u201d was only a minimal further infringement on Ortiz\u2019s right to keep the gun concealed. Officer Bennett\u2019s legiti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>mate interests in opening the knapsack therefore greatly outweighed Ortiz\u2019s rights in preventing the intrusion and the search was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Finally, excluding Ortiz\u2019s gun from evidence would do little to protect the average citizen from unreasonable police searches. As noted in <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 13-15, an encounter between a police officer and an armed detainee is a situation in which the exclusionary rule has little deterrent effect; where an officer is threatened by a concealed weapon, self-protection provides far more motivation to search than the exclusionary rule could ever deter. Rather than apply the exclusionary rule in a context where it would force police to choose between inordinate personal risk and the constitution, we find Officer Bennett\u2019s actions were reasonable and Ortiz\u2019s gun therefore should not be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">A separate issue is whether Officer Bennett\u2019s search of the knapsack was invalid because it was not on Ortiz\u2019s person when Bennett searched it. The range of a <em>Terry </em>search is limited to \u201caction [that] is required for the protection of the officer and others nearby.\u201d <em>Madamba, </em>62 Haw. at 457, 617 P.2d at 78. The present case raises the issue of to what extent the police may go beyond the detainee\u2019s person and make a protective weapons search of the area or a container nearby.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Again, the proper guideline is an objective standard of reasonableness: \u201cWould the facts available to the officer at the moment of the seizure or the search \u2018warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief \u2019 that the action taken was appropriate?\u201d <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">In the search incident to arrest context, we have limited searches to the area within the arrestee\u2019s conceivable grasp, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>have invalidated searches when the item or area searched was beyond the arrestee\u2019s reach, or within the exclusive control of the police. <em>State v. Haili, </em>63 Haw. 553, 632 P.2d 1064 (1981); <em>State v. Jenkins, </em>62 Haw. 660, 619 P.2d 108 (1980); <em>State v. Dias, </em>52 Haw. 100, 470 P.2d 510 (1970). For example, in <em>Jenkins, </em>we invalidated a search of a knapsack when it was within the officer\u2019s exclusive control. The search of Jenkins\u2019 knapsack, located in his van, took place while he was outside near the front of the van, under arrest, and guarded by another policeman. Thus, his knapsack inside the van was clearly beyond his possible reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">We hold now that the same limitation applies to protective weapons searches: if the police have an objectively reasonable belief a detainee is armed, they may make a protective weapons search of the area or a container reasonably within the detainee\u2019s conceivable grasp. <em>Accord, United States v. McClinnhan, </em>660 F.2d 500 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (closed case); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>637 F.2d 532 (8th Cir. 1980) (duffel bag); <em>United States v. Foster, </em>584 F.2d 997 (D.C.

By the same token, however, the police may not search an area or container within their exclusive control or outside the detainee\u2019s reach. <em>See, Williams, </em>19 Md. App. at 213-14, 310 A.2d at 599.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">In the present case the knapsack, though outside Ortiz\u2019s immediate control, remained within his conceivable reach. To place Ortiz under arrest Officer Bennett either had to bring the knapsack close to Ortiz or set it down and approach him, placing himself the same distance from the knapsack as Ortiz. Ortiz might have had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>a hidden accomplice, or one might have turned the corner at any moment. Under the totality of the circumstances, the knapsack was not within Bennett\u2019s exclusive control and he did not act unreasonably in searching it.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys id=\"A72\"><em>Arthur E.

Ct., 3469, 3481 (1983); <em>New York v. Belton, </em>453 U.S. 454, 460 (1981); <em>Adams v. Williams, </em>407 U.S. 143 (1972). In <em>Kaluna, </em>however, we noted that then article I, section 5 (now article I, section 7) of our Hawaii constitution may in some instances extend greater protection against warrantless searches than the Fourth Amendment. 55 Haw. at 369, 520 P.2d at 58-59. Because of the trial court\u2019s reliance on <em>Kaluna, </em>we view its suppression of the handgun as a ruling under article I, section 7 of the Hawaii constitution and review it accordingly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b218-7\"> Ortiz conceded their validity in his brief to this court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-8\">[A]t that moment, given the circumstances and Appellee\u2019s behavior, it was reasonable for Bennett to believe that criminal activity may be afoot and that Appellee may be armed. Bennett\u2019s seizure of the knapsack from Appellee\u2019s possession and control was therefore appropriate under the circumstances. Failure to do so would have been poor police' work by an officer in Bennett\u2019s situation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">Defendant\u2019s Answering Brief at 6. At oral argument, however, Ortiz\u2019s counsel attempted to repudiate this concession. Even if we were to allow this change of position, we would still agree with the trial court that Officer Bennett properly stopped Ortiz to question him and subsequently was justified in seizing the knapsack. An investigative stop is proper when the facts warrant an objectively reasonable belief that criminal activity may be afoot. <em>State v. Melear, </em>63 Haw. 488, 493, 630 P.2d 619, 624 (1981); <em>State v. Madamba, </em>62 Haw. at 456, 617 P.2d at 78; <em>State v. Barnes, </em>58 Haw. at 338, 568 P.2d at 1211. Here, Ortiz was in a business district at two o\u2019clock in the morning and ran away after seeing Officer Bennett\u2019s police car. Officer Bennett was therefore entitled to stop and question Ortiz. When Ortiz grabbed for his knapsack after denying it contained anything, Officer Bennett\u2019s suspicion of criminal activity was justifiably heightened and he properly seized the knapsack. We would not require him to wait until Ortiz pulled the gun out of the knapsack and perhaps fired it before acting to protect himself.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b219-10\"> In this case Officer Bennett had a strong firsthand suspicion the knapsack contained the most dangerous of weapons, a handgun. This fact distinguishes the present case from other cases involving <em>Terry </em>searches where the facts did not support an objectively reasonable belief the detainee was armed. <em>See, e.g., State v. Barnes, </em>58 Haw. 333, 568 P.2d 1207 (1977); <em>State v. Onishi, </em>53 Haw. 593, 499 P.2d 657 (1972); <em>compare, State v. Madamba, </em>62 Haw. 453, 617 P.2d 76 (1980); <em>State v. Ward, </em>62 Haw. 459, 617 P.2d 565 (1980) (bulge beneath shirt raised reasonable suspicion detainee was armed and therefore <em>Terry </em>search valid); <em>State v. Kea, </em>61 Haw. 566, 606 P.2d 1329 (1980). In this respect <em>Kaluna </em>is also inapposite. In <em>Kaluna </em>we held a warrantless search of a small folded tissue packet was improper because it almost certainly did not contain a weapon, contrary to the facts of this case. We did note in <em>Kaluna, </em>however, that if the concealed item had been a pistol instead of a small tissue packet a warrantless search would have been entirely proper. 55 Haw. at 370, 520 P.2d at 59. Thus, the present case is akin to <em>Terry </em>(gun felt during frisk admissible), while <em>Kaluna </em>was similar to <em>Terry\u2019s </em>companion case, <em>Sibron v. New York, </em>392 U.S. 40 (1968) (glassine envelope found during frisk inadmissible).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b220-10\"> In contrast, in <em>Jenkins </em>the search took place on a highway where the officers could be reasonably sure that accomplices would not drive up and attack. Likewise, in <em>Kaluna </em>the search took place in a police station where the officer was reasonably safe from blindsided attack.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b221-8\"> Ortiz\u2019s counsel argued: \u201cAs far as we\u2019re concerned, if the police officer felt a butt on the knapsack, it could have been a toy gun, we don\u2019t know.... Once the police officer felt the bag, he might have felt a butt of a gun. OK. It could have been a toy gun; it might have been a real gun.\u201d Later, the defense counsel reiterated this point: \u201cOfficer Bennett testified that he did feel the butt of a handgun, but we don\u2019t know for sure whether it was a real gun. It could have been anything else. It could be a toy gun.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b222-10\"> Some have argued that once a container is separated from a detainee it should not be subject to a protective weapons search. Note, 10 Ariz. L. Rev. 419, 430 (1968); Comment, 6 Houston L. Rev. 333, 347 (1968). We disagree. The critical factor is not whether the container is physically separate from the detainee, but whether it is within the detainee\u2019s conceivable grasp. For example, in <em>Terry </em>the officer felt a gun in the suspect\u2019s coat pocket, took the coat off and removed the gun from the pocket. 392 U.S. at 7. The United States Supreme Court found the officer properly removed the gun from the coat pocket even though the coat was physically separate from the suspect. 392 U.S. at 29-30.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b224-12\"> The trial court\u2019s findings as modified do not contain an express finding that the knapsack was within Bennett\u2019s exclusive control. Although cross-examined on exactly this point at the suppression hearing, Officer Bennett refused to acknowledge that he had exclusive control over the knapsack. Even if the trial court impliedly made such a finding, however, in view of the totality of circumstances we have a definite and firm conviction it was wrong and therefore overrule it as clearly erroneous. <em>State v.

Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1 (1968) and its progeny.\u201d I agree it would be unwise to adopt a \u201cplain feel\u201d rule, but fail to see how a warrantless search of a closed knapsack that occurred after the threat of harm to the police officer had been neutralized<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> can be justified as a <em>Terry </em>search.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">The intermediate appellate court summarized the dispositive facts as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-7\">On August 12, 1981, at approximately 2:00 a.m., uniformed police officer Brad Bennett was driving in his private, police-subsidized automobile with the customary blue light attached to the roof of the vehicle. While driving in the Wahiawa business area, Bennett saw Ortiz carrying a knapsack in an empty parking lot. Bennett testified that when Ortiz saw him, Ortiz ran towards the side of a building out of his view. After driving into the parking lot, Bennett saw Ortiz seated on the ground with his back to the building.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-8\">Bennett approached Ortiz on foot, asked him what he was doing there, and Ortiz responded that he \u201cdidn\u2019t know.\u201d When asked about the knapsack, Ortiz stated that it belonged to him and that nothing was in it. Ortiz then reached out for the knapsack with his right hand, and Bennett immediately grabbed the knapsack from him. While doing so, Bennett felt the butt of a handgun through the thin, canvas-type fabric. Ortiz stood up, and Bennett backed away from him, unzippered the knapsack and saw a handgun and holster therein. Bennett removed the gun from the knapsack, placed Ortiz under arrest, and took him to the police station where the gun was examined and found to be loaded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">4 Haw. App. at 144-45, 662 P.2d at 521. Viewing these facts in the light of controlling precedent, the appellate court like the trial court deduced \u201cthe warrantless unzippering of Ortiz\u2019s knapsack and the seizure of the gun therefrom . . . [could not] be justified under the incident to a lawful arrest exception to the warrant requirement.\u201d <em>State v. Ortiz, </em>4 Haw. App. at 150, 662 P.2d at 522. It therefore tailored a new legal justification for searching the knap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>sack without a warrant in a situation where the trial court correctly concluded that none existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">The majority avoids the labored and circuitous route followed below to validate the search and seizure and arrives at the same result by more expeditious means. It takes an exception to the rule that searches conducted outside the judicial process are per se unreasonable and stretches the narrowly defined exception to cover the situation. The exp\u00e1nsion of the <em>Terry </em>rule to validate the search of a closed container is no less flawed than the extension of the \u201cplain view\u201d concept the majority implicitly rejects.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">In <em>Terry v. Ohio, supra, </em>the Supreme Court established a \u201cstop and frisk\u201d exception to the warrant requirement. Thus a police officer may stop a person on less than probable cause if the officer observes unusual conduct leading to a reasonable suspicion that criminal activity may be afoot and if the officer can point to specific and articulable facts that warrant the suspicion. C. Whitebread, <em>Constitutional Criminal Procedure </em>145 (1978). And a \u201cprotective frisk\u201d is authorized if the officer reasonably believes the person may be armed and presently dangerous. <em>Id. </em>But \u201c[t]he search for weapons approved in <em>Terry </em>consisted solely of a limited patting of the outer clothing of the suspect for concealed objects which might be used as instruments of assault.\u201d <em>Sibron v. New York, </em>392 U.S. 40, 65 (1968). The search was valid because it was \u201creasonably limited in scope to the accomplishment of the only goal which ... justified its inception \u2014 the protection of the officer by disarming a potentially dangerous man.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">\u201cWhile <em>Terry </em>and <em>Sibron </em>were concerned on their facts with the problem of \u2018stop and frisk\u2019 on less than probable cause,\u201d we assumed the \u201crationale underlying those decisions .. . govern[ed] the whole range of problems in warrantless search and seizure cases,\u201d <em>State v. Kaluna, </em>55 Haw. 361, 367, 520 P.2d 51, 57 (1974). For we had been instructed that \u201c[t]he scope of the search must be \u2018strictly tied to and justified by\u2019 the circumstances which rendered its initiation permissible. <em>Warden v. Hayden, </em>387 U.S. 294, 310 (1967) (Mr. Justice Fortas, concurring); <em>see, e.g., Preston v. United States, </em>376 U.S. 364, 367-368 (1964); <em>Agnello v. United States, </em>269 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>U.S. 20, 30-31 (1925).\u201d <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. at 19. Subsequent decisions of the Court, however, impelled a re-examination of what we thought was fundamental in the law of search and seizure. <em>State v. Kaluna, </em>55 Haw. at 367, 520 P.2d at 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">We were disturbed particularly by <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>414 U.S. 218 (1973), and its companion, <em>Gustafson v. Florida, </em>414 U.S. 260 (1973). \u201cIn each case, under the reasoning of the . . . Supreme Court, the lawful custodial arrest alone gave the police authority to violate whatever privacy interest in the contents of the receptacles the arrestees may have had.\u201d <em>State v. Kaluna, </em>55 Haw. at 368 n.5, 520 P.2d at 58 n.5. We were troubled because the decisions \u201cseemingly sanctioned miniscule scrutiny by the police into any and all items an arrestee in custody may happen to have in his possession.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the case then at bar, \u201cthe search of. . . [the defendant\u2019s] body and all personal effects in her possession . . . [would not have] violate[d] her federal constitutional rights since \u2018the fact of [her] lawful arrest\u2019 alone gave the police plenary authority to subject her to a detailed search.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 368-69, 520 P.2d at 58 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">We were not prepared, \u201cas the ultimate judicial tribunal\u201d with \u201cfinal, unreviewable authority to interpret and enforce the Hawaii Constitution,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 369, 520 P.2d at 58, to hold \u201cthat since a lawful custodial arrest is a significant intrusion into an individual\u2019s privacy, further \u2018lesser\u2019 intrusions may be made without regard for their justifications. <em>Cf. Chambers v. Maroney, </em>399 U.S. 42, 61-65 (1970) (Harlan, J., dissenting).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 370, 520 P.2d at 59. \u201cIn our view, the right to be free of \u2018unreasonable\u2019 searches and seizures under article I, section 5 (now section 7) of the Hawaii Constitution [was] enforceable by a rule of reason which requires that governmental intrusions into the personal privacy of citizens of this State be no greater in intensity than absolutely necessary under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 369, 520 P.2d at 58-59 (footnote omitted). And we summarized our holding and the reasons supporting it in these terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-8\">In sum, we hold that a search incident to a valid custodial arrest does not give rise to a unique right to search; instead, the circumstances surrounding the arrest generate the authority to search without a warrant. If these circumstances show a legitimate basis for a search \u2014 such as protection of the arresting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>officer or preservation of evidence of the crime for which the arrest is made \u2014 then a search is lawful only if no broader than necessary in light of the justification. A search which exceeds this scope is a search without reason. And a search without reason we regard as manifestly \u201cunreasonable\u201d under the Hawaii Constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 372, 520 P.2d at 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">The trial court regarded <em>Kaluna </em>and its teachings as controlling and suppressed the handgun as evidence; in essence, it ruled the search in this case was \u201cbroader than necessary in light of the justification\u201d therefor. <em>See id. </em>While the majority of this court acknowledges we are expounding the search and seizure provisions of the Constitution of the State of Hawaii rather than the Fourth Amendment,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> it nonetheless finds <em>Kaluna </em>and our \u201cstop and frisk\u201d decisions<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> inapposite. It claims the cas\u00e9 at bar is distinguishable on the facts from other cases involving <em>Terry </em>searches and implies the intrusion here is not worthy of constitutional regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">If a distinction can be drawn as claimed, it is only because the majority places its own gloss on the facts<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and overrules a pertinent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>finding of the court charged with the responsibility for factual determinations. The unvarnished facts presented by the record, in the majority\u2019s view, are somehow unsuitable or inadequate for judging the validity of a <em>Terry </em>search. A possible \u201chidden accomplice\u201d who \u201cmight have turned the corner at any moment,\u201d <em>see </em>note 6 <em>supra, </em>is therefore conjured, presumably to facilitate an application of the \u201cobjective standard of reasonableness\u201d it purports to employ. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, 67 Haw. at 188, 683 P.2d at 828.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">But we have long maintained \u201c[i]t is for the trial judge as fact-finder to assess credibility of witnesses, including defendants, and to resolve all questions of fact.\u201d <em>Lono v.

Furthermore, \u201c[t]he trier of fact may draw all reasonable and legitimate inferences and deductions from the evidence adduced .. . , and findings of the trial court will not be disturbed unless clearly erroneous. <em>State v.

Findings, we have declared, \u201care not to be disturbed unless, after a review of the whole record, we are \u2018left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u2019 <em>Kim v. State, </em>62 Haw. 483, 493, 616 P.2d 1376, 1382 (1980) (quoting <em>United States v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395 (1948)); <em>accord Honda v.

Goebert, </em>52 Haw. 308, 310, 474 P.2d 537, 538 (1970).\u201d <em>Id. </em>Surely, a test demanding a definite and firm belief is not one to be met by mere conjecture about a \u201chidden accomplice\u201d who was not there.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">Calling on <em>United States v. Jacobsen, </em>_ U.S. _, 104 S. Ct. 1652, 1663 (1984), for support, the majority also rationalizes the search of defendant\u2019s knapsack as a <em>de minimis </em>invasion of privacy. We, of course, have not previously characterized the warrantless search of a closed container as a minimal intrusion; nor have we even intimated before that such a search is not regulated by Article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>I, \u00a7 7 of the Hawaii Constitution. <em>Kaluna </em>stands in testimony of our disagreement with the Supreme Court in this regard, <em>see </em>55 Haw. at 368 n.5, 520 P.2d at 58 n.5, and so does <em>State v. Rosborough, </em>62 Haw. 238, 244, 615 P.2d 84, 88 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">I would honor Article I, \u00a7 7 and hold the State has not met its burden of justifying the search under one of the few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions to the rule that searches conducted outside the judicial process are perse unreasonable, set aside the decision of the Intermediate Court of Appeals, and affirm the order of the Circuit Court of the First Circuit suppressing the seized firearm as evidence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b224-13\"> \u201cAn object may be considered to be \u2018in plain view\u2019 if it can be seized without compromising any interest in privacy.\" Texas v. Brown, 460 U.S. 730, 103 S. Ct. 1535, 1546 (1983) (Stevens, J., concurring). No interest in privacy is compromised in a \u201cplain view\u201d seizure because the rule applies only when a prior justification for an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>intrusion is extant. The Supreme Court decision most frequently cited in support of the rule is Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443 (1971), which in relevant part states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\">What the \u201cplain view\" cases have in common is that the police officer in each of them had a prior justification for an intrusion in the course of which he came inadvertently across a piece of evidence incriminating the accused. The doctrine serves to supplement the prior justification \u2014 whether it be a warrant for another object, hot pursuit, search incident to lawful arrest, or some other legitimate reason for being present unconnected with a search directed against the accused \u2014 and permits the warrantless seizure. Of course, the extension of the original justification is legitimate only where it is immediately apparent to the police that they have evidence before them; the \u201cplain view\u201d doctrine may not be used to extend a general exploratory search from one object to another until something incriminating at last emerges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">403 U.S. at 466 (citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b225-8\"> At the close of the hearing on the motion for reconsideration of the order suppressing the handgun as evidence, the trial court found the threat of harm to the police officer had been neutralized by his assumption of physical control over the knapsack.
