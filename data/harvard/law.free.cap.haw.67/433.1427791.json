(Honsador). The court concluded that the third party action brought by Honsador against Republic and CMS was not in the nature of assumpsit but, rather, in the nature of negligence, and therefore held that Republic and CMS could not avail themselves of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 607-14 (1976), which authorizes the assessment of attorney\u2019s fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>to the prevailing party only in assumpsit cases.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We think the circuit court was wrong in its characterization of the nature of the suit and we therefore reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">Plaintiff Uwe Schulz is an architect who purchased certain construction materials from Honsador in 1979 for use in the construction of his own home in Lahaina, Maui. After experiencing unsatisfactory results with the materials,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Schulz filed suit against Honsador. The complaint set forth two counts. The first alleged that Honsador had impliedly warranted the materials to be fit for Schulz\u2019s intended purpose, but that the materials were in fact defective. The second count alleged that Honsador was negligent in failing to warn Schulz of the dangers involved in the use of the materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">Honsador then filed a third-party complaint against CMS, from whom it had purchased the materials, and Republic, the manufacturer. The third-party complaint alleged that the materials were defective and alleged that if Honsador was found liable to Schulz \u201cfor any reason\u201d then Honsador would be entitled to recover from CMS and Republic. The third-party complaint did not allege that CMS and/or Republic were negligent for failure to warn of dangers associated with use of the materials, nor that they breached any implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. Rather, the third-party complaint alleged only that the materials sold to Honsador were defective \u2014 which implies a breach of warranty of merchantability \u2014 and stated a general claim for indemnification.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>The case was tried before a jury which received instructions regarding both warranty and negligence theories. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Schulz against Honsador and found that Schulz and Honsador were each 50% negligent. The jury also found that Honsador was not entitled to recover from either CMS or Republic.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">CMS and Republic then moved to tax attorney\u2019s fees against Honsador under HRS \u00a7 607-14. After a hearing on the motion, the court ruled that because the jury verdict included a finding that Schulz and Honsador were both partly negligent, the action was not in the nature of assumpsit and \u00a7 607-14 was inapplicable. CMS and Republic then brought this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">Assumpsit is a common law form of action which allows for the recovery of damages for the non-performance of a contract, either express or implied, written or verbal, as well as quasi contractual obligations. <em>See </em>1 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Actions </em>\u00a7 11 (1962). The original version of \u00a7 607-14 applied to all actions of assumpsit,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but with the adoption of modern rules of civil procedure in Hawaii it was no longer necessary to plead specific legal theories and all forms of action were merged into the \u201ccivil action.\u201d Accordingly, the statute was amended so as to provide for attorney\u2019s fees in all actions in the <em>nature </em>of assumpsit. Act 88, \u00a7 5(q), 1972 Haw. Sess. Laws 325, 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>An action for breach of warranty clearly is in the nature of assumpsit, inasmuch as a warranty arises from the contractual relationship between buyer and seller, and a breach of warranty constitutes a breach of contract. <em>Au v. Au, </em>63 Haw. 210, 219, 626 P.2d 173, 180 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">The question of how to determine the nature of an action has arisen in other contexts. For example, in deciding which statute of limitation applies to an action we said that \u201c[t]he nature of the right or claim is determined from the allegations contained in the pleadings.\u201d <em>Au v. Au, supra, </em>63 Haw. at 214, 626 P.2d at 177.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-8\">As a general proposition, the character of an action is determined from the facts stated in, and the issues raised by, the plaintiffs complaint, declaration, or petition. It is determined from the substance of the entire pleading, the nature of the grievance, and the relief sought, rather than from the formal language employed or the form of the pleadings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">63 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Products Liability </em>\u00a7 906 (1984). We think this holds true in the present context.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">Schulz\u2019s complaint is based on breach of warranty and negligence, and therefore combines assumpsit and non-assumpsit claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-11\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-12\">The nature of Schulz\u2019s action against Honsador may, of course, be different from that of Honsador\u2019s action against CMS and Republic. However, Honsador\u2019s third-party complaint incorporates Schulz\u2019s complaint by reference, and alleges that Honsador is entitled to recover from CMS and Republic if it is found liable to Schulz \u201cfor any reason.\u201d The third-party complaint also contains a specific allegation that the goods sold to Honsador were defective, implying a breach of warranty of merchantability. Under these circumstances, we conclude that Honsador alleged a bona fide contract claim against CMS and Republic, and the third-party action therefore is in the nature of assumpsit.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AgF\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number><em>Dennis Niles (Shelby A. Floyd </em>with him on the briefs, <em>Paul, Johnston Alston, </em>of counsel) for Third-Party Defendants-Appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Agp\"><em>Susan Oki Mollway (William M.

No such showing has been made by Honsador in this case. To the contrary, the record reveals that numerous instructions were given to the jury regarding warranty claims, indicating these claims were genuine.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">We do not find merit as to the other issues raised in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b468-9\"> HRS \u00a7 607-14 (1976) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-10\">Attorneys\u2019 fees in actions in. the nature of assumpsit. In all the courts, in all actions in the nature of assumpsit there shall be taxed as attorneys\u2019 fees, in addition to the attorneys\u2019 fees otherwise taxable by law, to be paid by the losing party and to be included in the sum for which execution may issue, a fee which the court determines to be reasonable ....</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b468-11\"> The product involved in this case is metal comer bead, which is used to form a hard, smooth comer where sheets of drywall are joined in constructing interior walls.

It read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak_\">In all the Courts of this Kingdom, in all actions of assumpsit there shall be taxed as attorneys\u2019 fees, in addition to the attorney\u2019s fees now taxable by law, to be paid by the losing party and to be included in the sum for which execution may issue, ten percent on all sums to one hundred dollars, and two and one-half percent in addition on all sums over one hundred dollars, to be computed on the excess over one hundred dollars. The above fee shall be assessed on the amount of the judgment obtained by the plaintiff and upon the amount sued for, if the defendant obtain judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">Act 29, \u00a7 5, 1872 Haw.
