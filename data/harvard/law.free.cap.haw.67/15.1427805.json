It is a source of continuing vexation to the court that many, if not a majority of the briefs filed, do not even approximate compliance with the rule. We take the opportunity by this opinion to inform the Bar that henceforth in all cases of substantial non-compliance with HSCR Rule 3(b), whether by appellants or appellees, sanctions up to and including dismissal of the appeals will be levied.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-16\">In the particular case, the appellants\u2019 brief is stricken. Counsel for the appellants is ordered to file an amended opening brief within 15 days from the date hereof, fully complying with HSCR Rule 3(b). In addition, a fine of $500.00 is levied against appellants\u2019 counsel.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
