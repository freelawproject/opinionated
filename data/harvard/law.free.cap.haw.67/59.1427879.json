In view of our holding herein, it is unnecessary to decide the cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">On the night of December 22, 1980, Kenneth Sugimoto\u2019s Mott-Smith Drive home was burglarized and his collection of samurai swords valued at approximately $35,000 was stolen. In connection with this burglary, Defendant was indicted on three counts: (1) criminal conspiracy; (2) burglary in the first degree; and (3) attempted theft in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">The prosecution\u2019s chief witness, Daniel Guy (Guy), took part in the burglary and theft, allegedly as a police informant. Guy provided the key testimony in implicating Defendant in the planning and commission of the crimes charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">Between the time of the burglary and the trial, Guy was placed in protective police custody somewhere on the mainland, U.S.A. His wife, Terry Guy (Terry), was relocated with him. For the trial, the prosecution arranged for Guy\u2019s return to Hawaii unaccompanied by Terry.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">Defendant, prior to the commencement of trial, orally moved for an order to compel the attendance of Terry as a witness for his defense. The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-11\">After a lengthy trial, the jury convicted Defendant of criminal conspiracy but acquitted him of the burglary and attempted theft charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-13\">The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>Article I, Section 14 of the State Constitution<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> confer upon the accused in criminal prosecutions the right to compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor. <em>Washington v. Texas, </em>388 U.S. 14 (1967); <em>State v. Valmoja, </em>56 Haw. 452, 540 P.2d 63 (1975); <em>State v. Bullen, </em>63 Haw. 27, 620 P.2d 728 (1980). That right, however, is not without limitations. <em>State v. Mitake, </em>64 Haw. 217, 638 P.2d 324 (1981). \u201cOne such limitation is that a defendant is only afforded the right to compel attendance and testimony of witnesses who can give relevant and beneficial testimony for the defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 225, 638 P.2d at 330.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">In <em>State v. Mitake, supra, </em>this court held that \u201cbefore this Court can overturn a conviction based upon a claim of denial of compulsory process, it must be shown that the testimony denied the defendant would have been helpful to him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 225, 638 P.2d at 330. Likewise, the U.S. Supreme Court recently stated that to establish a violation of his constitutional right to compulsory process, the defendant must \u201cmake some plausible showing of how [the] testimony would have been material and favorable to his defense.\u201d <em>United States v. Valenzuela-Bernal, </em>458 U.S. 858, 867 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Defense counsel made two offers of proof to the trial court. The first was that if Terry were called as a witness, she could establish that Defendant was not present at the scene of the burglary. Defendant, however, was acquitted of the burglary charge, thereby, disposing of the contention that the trial court erred in denying compulsory process based on this offer of proof. The other offer of proof was \u201cthat she [Terry] knew that Defendant was not involved in the burglary because she had been privy to conversations with the chief prosecution witness Daniel Guy and in all likelihood with the investigating officer Kaalele with the Honolulu Police Department.\u201d (Tr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>November 9 and 10, 1981, Vol. I at 14.) Whether Terry had participated in or had been privy to any conversations which would absolve Defendant from the criminal charges is purely conjectural and without any foundation nor supported by any basis in fact. <em>See State v. Mitake, supra.</em></p>\n<attorneys id=\"ASX\"><em>Keith Shigetomi (Keith Tanaka, </em>certified law student, and <em>Alvin T. Sasaki </em>on the briefs), Deputy Public Defenders, for defendant-appellant, cross-appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AtJf\"><em>Peter Van Name Esser (Shirley Smith </em>and <em>Gary A. Modaferri </em>on the briefs), Deputy Prosecuting Attorneys for plaintiff-appellee, cross-appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Defendant argues that Terry\u2019s testimony will reveal that she had sexual relations with Defendant and therefore Guy had a motive to implicate Defendant. At trial, Defendant testified that he had sexual relations with Terry. This statement was apparently made to impeach Guy\u2019s testimony by implying that Guy was \u201cout to get him.\u201d Testimony was also elicited from Guy that he [Guy] had struck a deal with the Prosecutor\u2019s Office for immunity on the burglary charge and leniency on a pending drug charge in exchange for his testimony. Terry\u2019s testimony would have been cumulative at best inasmuch as the question of Guy\u2019s motive was raised before the jury. When evaluated in the context of the entire record, <em>U.S. v. Valenzuela-Bernal, supra, </em>we conclude that Terry\u2019s corroborating testimony of having had sexual relations with Defendant is not material and relevant to his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">We find that Defendant has failed to adequately show that Terry\u2019s testimony would be relevant, material, and favorable to his defense. Accordingly, Defendant cannot now complain that his right to compulsory process was violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">The trial court\u2019s denial to compel the attendance of Terry as a witness is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b93-17\"> \u00a7 705-520 <em>(1972) Criminal conspiracy. </em>A person is guilty of criminal conspiracy if, with intent to promote or facilitate the commission of a crime:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-18\">(1) He agrees with one or more persons that they or one or more of them will engage in or solicit the conduct or will cause or solicit the result specified by the definition of the offense; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-19\">(2) He or another person with whom he conspired commits an overt act in pursuance of the conspiracy.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b93-20\"> Three others were indicted with Defendant.
