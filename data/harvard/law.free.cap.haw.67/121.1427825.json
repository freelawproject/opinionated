At trial, the prosecution sought to have Mercy Toro, the bartendress, testify and Miller\u2019s attorney objected, claiming surprise, prejudice and violation of Rule 16, H.R.P.P.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because the prosecution had failed to disclose her name as a witness. The issue on appeal is whether the lower court abused its discretion in allowing Toro to testify. Under the circumstances we find no abuse of discretion and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>The test for determining if a lower court has abused its discretion in handling a Rule 16 problem such as the one at bar is if after finding a violation of the rule, the court takes measures to alleviate any prejudice, such as making a full inquiry into the circumstances, and allowing the other side to interview the unlisted witness before the witness testifies. <em>State v. Morishige, </em>65 Haw. 354, 652 P.2d 1119 (1982); <em>State v. Sugimoto, </em>62 Haw. 259, 614 P.2d 386 (1980); <em>see </em>Rule 16(e)(8)(i), at n. 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Here the prosecution did not give defense counsel Ms. Toro\u2019s name as a witness, and defense counsel did not learn of her existence until the morning of the trial. However, defense counsel failed to request a continuance or object to the calling of Ms. Toro until the trial was well under way and Ms. Toro was about to take the stand. The lower court ruled that the prosecution violated Rule 16, and chose to fashion a remedy to alleviate any possible prejudice to the defense. He did so by making an extensive inquiry into the situation, interviewing Ms. Toro, and recessing the trial for ten minutes to allow defense counsel to speak with her before she testified. Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the lower court\u2019s actions constituted an abuse of discretion..</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">Nevertheless, the trial prosecutor\u2019s conduct in this case is disturbing. The duty of the prosecution is to seek justice, to exercise the highest good faith in the interest of the public and to avoid even the appearance of unfair advantage over the accused. Therefore we direct that if a trial judge determines that the prosecution has intentionally or flagrantly violated its duty, the judge should con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>sider imposing sanctions against the violating attorney and referring the matter to the Disciplinary Counsel for appropriate action.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ai9\"><em>Michael P.
