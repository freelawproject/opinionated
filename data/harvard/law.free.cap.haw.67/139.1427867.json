We affirm, but modify the amount of the surcharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-22\">Samuel M. Dwight and Harriet D. Ellis (beneficiaries or Appellees) are the two remaining income beneficiaries of the Trust in question. The trust estate consisted primarily of real property lo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>cated on the islands of Oahu and Molokai. One of these parcels was situated on Bethel Street, Honolulu (Bethel property).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">On November 12, 1968, the City and County of Honolulu filed suit to condemn the Bethel property for a public parking facility. On February 12, 1969, an order condemning the Bethel property together with a cash deposit was filed. The Trustee knew that a replacement of the condemned property would have to be found to defer any capital gains tax. On February 26, 1970, the Internal Revenue Service granted the Trust an extension to October 31, 1971 to reinvest the $290,500 received for the Bethel property.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">In October of 1971, the Trustee purchased in fee simple a building and land located at 1128 Nuuanu Avenue, Honolulu (Nuuanu property). The two-story building was fifty years old and in commercial use. The purchase price of $235,000 was paid in cash and this purchase deferred the capital gains tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">The Nuuanu property was subject to an existing five-year lease with the Salvation Army at $1,700 a month. In January of 1976, the Salvation Army notified the Trustee that it would not exercise its option to extend the lease. In the meantime, the Salvation Army continued to occupy the premises on a month-to-month basis until July 15, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">On February 25, 1977, the Trustee entered into a five-year lease with Gary D. Henig at a monthly rent of $2,000 with two options to extend the lease for additional five-year periods. Henig paid the March rent and a security deposit of $2,000. The lease provided that the lessee accept the premises in \u201cits present condition\u201d and required the lessee to maintain the building, except that the lessee was not responsible for structural repairs or for damage caused by forces beyond the lessee\u2019s control. On February 28, 1977, Henig sought to clarify the lessor\u2019s and lessee\u2019s responsibilities concerning possible building code violations and sent a letter agreement<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to the Trustee outlining each party\u2019s responsibility to cure any building code violations. This letter agreement was executed by the Trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>On June 9, 1977, the Trustee filed suit against Henig for summary possession in the District Court of the First Circuit alleging non-payment of rents. Henig filed an answer and counterclaimed against the Trustee for breach of the February 28th letter agreement. After trial, the district court held in favor of the Trust for repossession of the demised premises and for unpaid lease rent through November 30, 1977, court costs, and a portion of the Trust\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">On February 3, 1978, Henig filed a Notice of Appeal of the decision of the district court with the Hawaii Supreme Court. On February 28, 1978, Henig filed a petition under Chapter XII of the Federal Bankruptcy Act in the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii. Any further action on the District Court\u2019s judgment was stayed pending the resolution of Henig\u2019s bankruptcy petition. Thereafter, the Trustee and Henig settled their dispute, to-wit: Henig agreed to withdraw the appeal, and the Trustee agreed to waive its claim for back rent, costs and attorney\u2019s fees, and to sell the Nuuanu property.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">At the public auction, the Nuuanu property was sold to the highest bidder at the court approved upset price of $310,000. On February 15, 1980, the Trustee received the proceeds of the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">We note that in the years immediately following the purchase of the Nuuanu property, the masters who reviewed the Trust\u2019s Thirty-Ninth Annual Account (11/01/70 - 10/31/71) through the Forty-Third Annual Account (11/01/74 - 10/31/75) did not question the prudence or propriety of that purchase. The master for the Forty-Fourth Annual Account (11/01/75 - 10/31/76) was the first to question the purchase of the Nuuanu property.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">After a hearing on the master\u2019s report of the Trustee\u2019s Forty-Seventh Annual Account (11/01/78 - 10/31/79) and the Trustee\u2019s Response to Portions of the Master\u2019s Report,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the lower court held as follows: 1) the Trustee acted imprudently and negligently in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>purchase of the Nuuanu property without proper inspection or investigation; 2) by making this imprudent investment of trust assets, the Trustee breached its fiduciary duty owed to the income beneficiaries; 3) once purchased, the Trustee committed a further breach of its fiduciary duty by failing to preserve and make profitable the Nuuanu property as a trust asset; 4) the Trustee was liable for the damage incurred by the Trust as a direct and proximate result of its breach; 5) the Trust suffered the following losses: Property repair expenses in the sum of $14,437.68; lost rental income in the sum of $62,490; attorney\u2019s fees and costs in the amount of $17,240.93 and lost interest in the amount of $9,670.18, a total sum of $103,838.79; 6) the Trustee be surcharged $103,838.79.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">The Trustee contends the lower court erred in concluding that the Trustee acted imprudently and negligently in purchasing the Nuuanu property.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">Here, the lower court found as follows: The Nuuanu property was located in an older, deteriorated, depressed area of \u00a1Honolulu surrounded by bars and porno shops, and was designated for condemnation for urban renewal. The fifty-year old two-story building situated on the property was of an unprotected combustible type of construction which did not generally conform to the applicable building codes. At the time of the purchase, the building had a rusted-out marquee, leaking roof, sagging support beams, bad electrical wiring, sagging and holed plaster, missing wall and ceiling panels, water stains and rot, and termite damage along with live infestations. The Salvation Army Lease specifically noted the existence of marquee, roof and termite damages. However, the Trustee\u2019s officer handling the Trust failed to read the lease. Two officers of the Trustee inspected the building and despite noticing the marquee and termite damages and water stains, they failed to check the Salvation Army\u2019s maintenance records on the building. The Trustee neither questioned the Salvation Army about the condition of the building nor requested the tenant to sign a disclaimer of claims against the Trustee. The Trustee neither knew nor attempted to determine, whether the building conformed to applicable building, health, safety and fire code requirements. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>Trustee also did not secure any structural or termite inspections. Notwithstanding these physical defects in the building, the Trustee purchased the Nuuanu property on October 29, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Whether a trustee is liable for damages to a trust or an income beneficiary due to the trustee\u2019s breach of fiduciary duties will depend on the facts and circumstances on a case by case basis. <em>Hartmann v. Bertelmann, </em>39 Haw. 619, 626 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">The trust instrument in question vested the Trustee with \u201cfull power to invest, reinvest and keep invested in such manner as they in their discretion may think best any moneys belonging to me or to my estate that shall come into their hands other than income disposed of by this my Will.\u201d In the absence of specific directions in the trust instrument concerning the investment of trust funds, our court has held that the trustee\u2019s duties to the beneficiaries are controlled by statute. <em>Steiner v. Hawaiian Trust Co., </em>47 Haw. 548, 561-62, 393 P.2d 96, 105 (1964). The statute applicable to this case, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 406-22(a) (1968),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> codified the generally accepted \u201cprudent investment rule.\u201d In <em>Steiner, supra, </em>our court said: \u201cThus, by statute, defendant as trustee was not only bound to the duty of exercising the prudence of a reasonably prudent businessman but was also bound to use the higher degree of skill that it possessed as an expert professional fiduciary. Restatement (Second), <em>Trusts, </em>\u00a7 174 (1959). The standard is absolute and is not obviated or lessened because a particular breach was honest and well-intentioned.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 562, 393 P.2d at 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">Our court further held that a trustee had a duty to make such investments as a prudent man would make of his own property having primarily in view the preservation of the estate and the amount and regularity of the income to be derived from such investments. <em>Id. </em>at 573, 393 P.2d at 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>Based on the lower court\u2019s findings, we conclude that the legal conclusion reached by the court is not in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The Trustee\u2019s neglect in determining the reasonableness of the purchase price of $235,000 based on a net return was in clear violation of HRS \u00a7 406-22(a). The Trustee was under a fiduciary duty, when it invested trust funds on a permanent basis, to consider both probable income and probable safety of capital. <em>See </em>HRS \u00a7 406-22(a). The evidence indicates that the Trustee unduly relied upon the Salvation Army Lease and nothing else, without any reasonable justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">The Trustee-contends the lower court erred in concluding that the Trustee failed to preserve and make profitable the Nuuanu property.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">On this issue, the lower court found as follows: The building\u2019s poor condition was a prime factor in the Salvation Army\u2019s decision not to extend the lease. In fact, the Salvation Army regularly complained to the Trustee about the condition of the building, and at one point, it thre\u00e1tened to move out unless certain repairs were made. When the Salvation Army left the premises in July, 1976, the Trustee did not check the structural condition of the building and did not determine whether the building conformed to applicable building code requirements. After Henig took possession of the Nuuanu property in March of 1977, he called the building department of the City and County of Honolulu for an inspection. The building, fire and health inspectors issued notices of violation and notices to correct to the Trustee. The defects cited were bulges and holes in the walls, extensive rot damage to the wood frame, water markings, sagging and missing ceiling panels, sagging and cracked beams, leaking roof, missing plastering, bad electrical wiring, and bad plumbing. According to the Fire Inspector, the whole second floor should have been sealed off as unsafe. To correct all of the deficiencies covered in the \u201cNotice To Correct,\u201d the estimated cost would have been $30,000 to $40,000. Relying on the February 28th letter agreement with the Trustee, Henig refused to pay any further rent and used the substandard condition of the building as the reason for non-payment. After Henig\u2019s payment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>the March, 1977, rent and the security deposit, no income was derived from the Nuuanu property until it was sold at public auction and the proceeds were received by the Trustee on February 15, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">A trustee is under a duty to use the care and skill of a man of ordinary prudence to preserve the trust property. <em>Bishop v. Pittman, </em>33 Haw. 647, 654 (1935). The trustee has the power and the duty to use the funds of the trust to keep trust assets in repair. <em>Martin v. Eslick, </em>229 Miss. 234, 260, 90 So. 2d 635, 645 (1956). \u201cIf owing to the neglect of the trustee to keep the buildings in proper repair damage results to the trust estate, the trustee is subject to a surcharge; and if as a result of this neglect the premises become untenantable, he is liable for the loss of rentals which result.\u201d 2 A. Scott, The Law of Trusts \u00a7 176 (3d ed. 1967); <em>Annett-Mahnken Realty Co. v. Collin, </em>110 N.J. Eq. 469, 160 A. 400 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">A trustee is also under a duty to the beneficiary to use reasonable care and skill to make the trust property productive, <em>Ahuna v. Dept. of Hawaiian Homes Lands, </em>64 Haw. 327, 340, 640 P.2d 1161, 1169 (1982), and where the trust corpus is land, the trustee is normally under a duty to manage it so that it will produce income. <em>Vest v. Bialson, </em>365 Mo. 1103, 293 S.W.2d 369 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Here again, based on the lower court\u2019s findings, we conclude that the court\u2019s legal conclusion that the Trustee violated its duty is not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">The Trustee contends that the income beneficiaries are barred from contesting the propriety of the purchase of the Nuuanu property based on the doctrines of estoppel and laches. The Trustee argues that no one questioned the purchase of the Nuuanu property in the Thirty-Ninth through the Forty-Third Annual Accounts, and therefore, the income beneficiaries cannot question the purchase at this late date. This contention is without merit. <em>See Robinson v. McWayne, </em>35 Haw. 689 (1940). <em>Compare Hartmann v. Bertelmann, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">The Trustee contends that the surcharged amount of $103,838.79 is erroneous. We agree.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A4r\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number><em>Harold W. Nickelsen (D. Scott MacKinnon </em>and <em>Cheryl A. Nakamura </em>with him on the briefs; <em>Hamilton, Gibson, Nickelsen, Rush &amp; Moore, </em>of Counsel) for Appellant First Hawaiian Bank, Successor Trustee of the Estate of Samuel Castle Dwight, Deceased.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A-v\"><em>John Francis Perkin (Hoddick, Reinwald, O'Connor </em>and <em>Marrack, </em>of Counsel) for Appellee Beneficiary Samuel M. Dwight.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Alq\"><em>Earl S. Robinson </em>for Appellee Beneficiary Harriet D. Ellis.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">We hold that a net return of eight percent on the $235,000 would not have been an unreasonable investment. A $235,000 investment earning eight percent per annum would have yielded $18,800 per year, or $1,567 per month. The Trust held the vacant Nuuanu property from the time the Salvation Army vacated the premises to the day of the public sale for a total of thirty-nine months. For a thirty-nine month period, a rental income of $57,029.80 would have been realized, $61,113 less the $4,083.20 received from Henig. Interest on $1,567 for thirty-six months would have yielded $3,384, at the then legal rate of six percent per annum, without compounding. <em>See </em>HRS \u00a7 478-1 (1976). We hold that the expenditures totalling $9,320 for marquee, flashing, re-roofing and re-inforcing repairs, and for the cost of a structural inspection during the tenancy of the Salvation Army were reasonable under the circumstances. There is no evidence in the record to the contrary. We hold, however, that the expenditure of $5,117.28 for repairing the second floor joist and floor, and for repairing the electrical wiring unreasonable in view of the Trustee\u2019s failure to cure all of the cited code violations. The attorney\u2019s fees and costs amounting to $ 17,240.93 are allowed. We hold that the surcharge should have been $82,772.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">The Trustee\u2019s other contentions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">We hold that the findings of the lower court are not clearly erroneous inasmuch as the findings are amply supported by the evidence in the record. We affirm the lower court\u2019s conclusions, but modify the amount of the surcharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">A surcharge of $82,772.01 against the Trustee shall be entered as the judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b175-9\"> The letter agreement contained the following applicable provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-10\">\u201cAny building code violations which existed prior to March 1, 1977 and which were not caused by Gary Henig, Lessee [,] shall be cured by Lessor at Lessor\u2019s expense. Any Violations [sic] which occur after March 1, 1977 shall be Gary Henig\u2019s responsibility.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b176-10\"> Normally, the trustee\u2019s \u201cresponse\u201d would be entitled \u201cExceptions to Master\u2019s Report.\u201d Counsel for the trustee originally argued that this proceeding was an \u201cadversary\u201d proceeding, not a hearing on a master\u2019s report. However, he has not taken an appeal from the court\u2019s ruling that this proceeding was a hearing on a master\u2019s report, and in fact, he acquiesced in the validity of the order of the court. <em>See generally Lapahoehoe Sugar Co. v.
