The court con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>eluded after trial that it lacked power to adjudge \u201cthe propriety of the Trustees\u2019 exercise of discretion in their acquisition of Kawaiaha\u2018o Plaza\u201d since \u201cat least three of the Trustees [had not sought] a determination of that issue.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nevertheless, it proceeded to review the transaction and trustee conduct relative thereto, found a \u201cgenuine dispute continues to exist among the Trustees with respect to matters relating to their acquisition of Kawaiaha\u2019o Plaza,\u201d and ordered the Attorney General<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cpromptly to convey and transmit [its] Instructions to the Trustees.\u201d We conclude the circuit court erred in subjecting the Trustees\u2019 conduct to scrutiny and directing them to embark on a particular course of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">The Trustees of the Estate of Bernice Pauahi Bishop were given notice in late 1976 of the State of Hawaii\u2019s intention to institute eminent domain proceedings to acquire the site of the Estate\u2019s office building, which was within the Hawaii Capital District, for a public use. This came as no surprise, inasmuch as they had been aware of the State\u2019s plan to do so for some time and the relocation of the Estate\u2019s offices had been under study.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">They initially referred the problem for study in 1973 to the Estate\u2019s staff, who recommended the construction of an office <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>building on the campus of the Kamehameha Schools on Kapalama Heights. But the prevailing sentiment among the Trustees was for a headquarters location closer to downtown Honolulu, Ching being the lone Trustee favoring the staff suggestion. The factors tipping the balance in favor of the downtown location were easy access to government and business offices and a desire to replace what would be lost through condemnation with \u201ccommercial\u201d property capable of yielding a return on investment. The discussion of alternative relocation sites continued without decision between 1975 and 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">During this period, the Kawaiaha'o Plaza Associates, a limited partnership whose managing general partner was James Trask, was attempting to bring to fruition a project for the construction of an office building at the edge of downtown Honolulu, but was encountering difficulty. Early in 1977, Trask approached the Trustees with an offer to sell them an interest in the planned office building. Its location near the center of government and business activity in Honolulu engendered much interest in Kawaiaha'o Plaza among the Trustees. Takabuki, characterized by the circuit court as one with \u201cconsiderable competence, expertise and special skills in legal matters, business, and in development of real estate,\u201d was assigned the task of studying Trask\u2019s proposal and commencing negotiations with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">Though Takabuki assumed primary responsibility, he invited the participation of other Trustees. Trustees Thompson and Lyman attended the bargaining sessions at times, and Ching was present at a single session in October of 1977. Takabuki, however, kept his colleagues abreast of developments in his discussions with Trask.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">Trask was hardly a stranger to the Trustees, for he was a director of the Helumoa Corporation which they organized to develop estate-owned real property in Waikiki. They knew of his experience and expertise in matters related to real estate and property development. But they also knew Kawaiaha'o Plaza Associates and its principal partners, Trask and Francis Denis, were in financial straits. The bargaining between their representative and the developers thus entailed the discussion of numerous proposals and financing arrangements which took this into account. From August <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>of 1977, the discussions centered on a plan of co-ownership of Kawaiaha\u2019o Plaza.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The financial condition of the developers continued to deteriorate in September and October, and their project was on the brink of disaster. Takabuki and Trask stepped up negotiations and expedited the preparation of a draft agreement for the Trustees\u2019 perusal. The draft agreement reflected the developers\u2019 inability to complete the project without the participation of the Estate. It called for a purchase of the land in fee by the Trustees, a \u201clease back\u201d of the land to the developers, a purchase by the Trustees of a sixty percent interest in the \u201cleasehold premises\u201d consisting of the leased land and the building, and a complicated financing arrangement. In Takabuki\u2019s opinion, the developers\u2019 precarious financial plight and impending-legal actions against them rendered imperative a prompt decision, one way or the other, on the acquisition of the property. He therefore had the matter placed on the agenda of the Trustees\u2019 meeting scheduled for Thursday, October 27, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">The Trustees present at the meeting were Takabuki, Thompson, Lyman, and Frank B. Midkiff, who subsequently retired and has been replaced by William S. Richardson. Ching did not attend, since he customarily attended other business meetings on Thursdays; nor did he seek deferral of the matter to a more convenient time. Those present were apprised of the provisions of the draft agreement, and the significant aspects of the transaction, as well as its ramifications, were reviewed and discussed in detail. And on Takabuki\u2019s recommendation, the acquisition of Kawaiaha\u2019o Plaza was approved, subject to a confirmation of the staffs opinion of the value of the sixty percent interest in the \u201cleasehold premises\u201d by an independent appraiser and an approval of the form and substance of the agreement by the Estate\u2019s tax counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">When Ching learned his colleagues had tentatively approved the agreement, he quickly voiced objections to particular provisions therein. Ching, described by the circuit court as having \u201cconsiderable competence, expertise, and special skills in finance and business,\u201d was troubled by the developers\u2019 unstable financial situation and the Estate\u2019s potential liability in the event of their default. He subsequently put the objections in writing, outlining his concerns in detail, and also told his colleagues the acquisition of Kawaiaha\u2019o <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Plaza was not in the Estate\u2019s best interests. But the others were of the opinion that the agreement\u2019s default provisions protected them, and they signed it on December 6, 1977, after the conditions laid down at the meeting of October 27, 1977 had been fulfilled.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">The execution of the agreement did not write an end to the discord; and on Thompson\u2019s suggestion, a consultant, Gilbert Root, was engaged to evaluate the acquisition as an investment. In Root\u2019s opinion, several provisions of the agreement rendered the transaction \u201cquestionable as a sound fiduciary investment.\u201d He recommended a restructuring of the agreement in view of the apparent difficulties the developers had been experiencing in meeting their obligations and the Estate\u2019s potential liability on the long-term loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">As the project neared completion in late 1978, the developers\u2019 inability to meet their financial obligations became more pronounced. And the agreement was restructured so the Trustees would be the full owners of the \u201cleasehold premises,\u201d rather than of only a sixty percent interest. The developers were compensated by the grant of a prepaid lease of the former Libby cannery site in Kapalama. The Trustees in turn were accorded a preferred security position on the lease. Ching and Midkiff abstained from signing the amended purchase agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">Kawaiaha'o Plaza Associates, however, still could not fulfill its end of the bargain; it was unable to convey the property to the Trustees free of encumbrances. To relieve the developers of some of their financial burden and enable them to effect a transfer of title as agreed, a majority of the Trustees composed of Takabuki, Thompson, and Lyman relinquished the Estate\u2019s preferred security position in the \u201cLibby lease\u201d to a creditor. Takabuki agreed to personally indemnify the Trustees to the extent of $250,000 if KaWaiaha\u2019o Plaza failed to fulfill its obligations to creditors. Under the terms of an agreement with Midkiff, Thompson, and Lyman, he \u201cdeposited with the Trustees [certain] negotiable securities [he owned] and .. . grant[ed them] the irrevocable right to cash and/or sell all or any part thereof from time to time as is necessary to make good any moneys which KPA shall fail to pay or repay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">The developers were able thereafter to complete the project and convey the \u201cleasehold premises\u201d free of encumbrances to the Trustees. The Trustees and staff of the Estate moved into their new offices at Kawaiaha'o Plaza in June of 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The completion of the project did not abate the dissension at Kawaiaha'o Plaza. Ching\u2019s opposition to the transaction was steadfast, and he carried the conflict to other arenas. He lodged a protest with the Attorney General of the majority decision to acquire Kawaiaha'o Plaza. The State\u2019s highest legal officer, whose duties include the oversight of charitable trusts and their trustees, saw no reason to initiate State action.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But Ching was not deterred from his resolve to have the agreement set to naught.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">He retained private counsel and other consultants to review the transaction. Relying on their advice, Ching brought suit against Takabuki, Trask, Denis, and Kawaiaha'o Plaza Associates in the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii. He averred, <em>inter alia, </em>that Takabuki \u201cwas acting under color of state law to deprive the Estate and its beneficiaries of certain rights secured to them by the Constitution and laws of the United States\u201d and this conduct \u201cjeopardized the tax exempt status of the Estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">Purporting to rely on the federal court\u2019s pendent jurisdiction, Ching sought plenary review of the conduct of his fellow Trustees. He alleged: (1) Takabuki \u201crepeatedly breached his [fiduciary] duties as Trustee by the manner in which he participated in, negotiated, and purported to act on behalf of the Estate in the purchase ... of the Kawaiahao Plaza project\u201d; (2) \u201c[a]s recipients of an unconscionable and windfall profit to themselves, and to the detriment of the Bishop Estate, Defendants TRASK, DENIS and KPA are responsible for repaying such unconscionable and windfall profits\u201d; and (3) Plaintiff Ching \u201cis . . . under a compelling legal duty to bring the present action,\u201d for \u201cwhere he learns of any fact indicating or suggesting misconduct, mis-management or mis-application of trust funds by any of his co-Trustees, [he must] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>take all steps necessary to prevent such conduct, including the commencement of litigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">But Ching\u2019s efforts to overturn the decision of his colleagues were again frustrated. The federal court viewed the Trustees\u2019 dispute as a matter primarily of state concern and dismissed the complaint, finding \u201cPlaintiff failed to show that this Court has federal subject matter jurisdiction over the issues raised\u201d and \u201cthat it would be incongruous for the court to retain pendent jurisdiction [over the state claims].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">Takabuki filed his \u201cBill for Instructions and Claim for Surcharge Against Hung Wo Ching,\u201d concededly a defensive maneuver, shortly after the federal court refused to entertain his adversary\u2019s suit. He purported to sue \u201cin his capacity as a Trustee of the Bishop Estate . . . requesting] instructions from [the circuit court].\u201d He named as defendants the Attorney General of the State of Hawaii<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and Hung Wo Ching, \u201cin his capacity as Trustee of the Estate of Bernice Pauahi Bishop and individually.\u201d And he prayed for a determination \u201cthat the investment in the Kawaiaha'o Plaza was within the discretion of the trustees\u201d and \u201cDefendant Ching\u2019s claims [of a breach of trust] are unsound.\u201d Additionally, he sought an allowance of attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred in his defense of the federal suit, similar allowances for himself and the majority Trustees for fees and costs to be incurred in the instant suit, and a surcharge of the fees and costs against Ching.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">Ching quickly responded with a counterclaim, suing \u201cin his capacity as a Trustee of the Estate . . . against MATSUO TAKABUKI, in his capacity as a Trustee of the Estate.\u201d Its averments in essence reiterated those in the abortive federal suit. It prayed for a rescission or reformation of the amended Kawaiaha\u2019o Plaza purchase agreement and for instructions to the Trustees \u201cto take appropriate action ... to recover .. . any excessive profits received by [Kawaiaha\u2019o Plaza Associates and its partners] from the Bishop Estate incident to the [transaction].\u201d Like Takabuki, Ching further prayed that his opponent be surcharged \u201cin such amounts as the evidence at trial shall show the Estate to have been damaged, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>including the costs and attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in bringing this action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">After the feuding Trustees completed their discovery and the circuit court disposed of their pre-trial motions, including one in which Takabuki unsuccessfully sought the dismissal of Ching\u2019s counterclaim for want of indispensable parties,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the case proceeded to trial before the court. The lengthy bench trial portended by the extensive and exhaustive pre-trial search for evidence commenced on February 1, 1982, and continued until March 10, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">The court filed its \u201cFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Judgment and Order\u201d on October 20, 1982. It entered eighty-one findings covering all aspects of the dispute between Takabuki and Ching from its genesis in 1973 when the Estate\u2019s staff at the behest of \u201cthe Trustees conducted a study of possible areas for relocation of their offices.\u201d It concluded it had jurisdiction to act in the case by reason of \u201c\u00a7 560:7-201 and 560:7-306, HRS, as amended\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but \u201c[u]nder Decedent\u2019s trust and applicable statutory provisions, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>Court [could not] determine the question of the propriety of the Trustees\u2019 exercise of discretion in their acquisition of Kawaiaha'o Plaza.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus it held \u201cthe only proper questions before the Court relate[d] to the propriety of the conduct of Plaintiff, individually, as raised in the allegations of the Counter-Claim, and Counter-Claimant, individually, as raised in the allegations of the Complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">The court found neither blameworthy; the business and fiduciary judgments of the disputants were vindicated, but ironically, the judgment of the Trustees as a group was not. \u201cNeither the preponderance of the evidence nor the weight of the proof,\u201d the court concluded, \u201cindicates that Plaintiff acted in bad faith or broke <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>his individual fiduciary duties with respect to the Trustees\u2019 acquisition of Kawaiaha'o Plaza.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Regarding his opponent, its conclusion similarly was that \u201c[njeither the preponderance of the proof nor the weight of the proof suggests that Counter-Claimant acted in bad faith or broke his fiduciary duties either in his conduct relating to the Trustees\u2019 acquisition of Kawaiaha\u2019o Plaza or in asserting action against Plaintiff.\u201d Ching\u2019s concerns, the court said, \u201cwere genuine; he consulted with counsel and experts before taking action.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The upshot of the skirmishes in two courts was that each antagonist was cleared of the other\u2019s charges of misconduct, but the Trustees and the Attorney General were faulted for not being \u201cdiligent either with seeking instructions from the Court or promptly bringing their concerns to the attention of the Court.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Stating \u201ca genuine controversy continue[d] to exist among the Trustees .. . and there [were] matters yet to be settled,\u201d the court invoked \u201cits equitable supervisory powers over Trusts\u201d to direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>\u201cthe Attorney General promptly to convey and transmit [its] Instructions to the Trustees ... ; and if necessary, [to] obtain compliance with [the] Instructions by appropriate legal action against all Trustees and KPA and its principals.\u201d The instructions emanating from the court included express commands to \u201center into a proposed settlement with KPA and its principals under the settlement provisions of the Amended Purchase Agreement,\u201d seek \u201ca formal opinion from the Internal Revenue Service to determine whether [the agreement] jeopardize^] the charitable or tax-exempt status of the trust and beneficiary,\u201d and \u201crestructure the acquisition in a manner that will not jeopardize the charitable status of the Estate and beneficiary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Appeals by both Ching and Takabuki moved their battle to this court, and the major efforts here of both are centered on the circuit court\u2019s denial of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs for their efforts below.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">We begin our analysis where the circuit court did by considering whether it had power to act on the matters presented for decision by Takabuki and Ching. We begin with this fundamental precept in mind \u2014 one who \u201cis not before the court,. . . cannot be bound by the judgment rendered.\u201d <em>Provident Tradesmens Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Patterson, </em>390 U.S. 102, 110 (1968); <em>see also Mallow v. Hinde, </em>25 U.S. (12 Wheat.) 193, 198 (1827).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> And when a perusal of the record confirms just who was before the court, we are driven to a conclusion that the court erred in answering the question posed at the threshold.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">Invoking the jurisdiction vested in the circuit court by virtue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>HRS \u00a7 560:7-201(a)(3),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Takabuki brought suit against Ching and the Attorney General. His complaint, styled \u201cA Bill for Instructions and Claim for Surcharge Against Hung Wo Ching,\u201d sought instructions from the court \u201cthat the investment in the Kawaiahao Plaza was within the discretion of the trustees\u201d and \u201cDefendant Ching\u2019s claims [were] unsound,\u201d as well as attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. for the majority trustees and surcharges thereof against Ching.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">That the Trustees of the Estate of Bernice Pauahi Bishop may seek instructions from the court, of course, is beyond cavil. <em>See e. g., Midkiff v. Kobayashi, </em>54 Haw. 299, 302, 507 P.2d 724, 728 (1973); <em>Bishop v. Kemp, </em>35 Haw. 1, 2 (1939).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">The trustees of a charitable trust, like the trustees of a private trust, can maintain a suit for instructions. The trustees are entitled to instructions as to the proper construction of the trust instrument, as to the validity of the trust, and as to the extent of their powers and duties. The purpose of the giving of instructions by the court is to enable the trustees properly to discharge their duties under the trust and to protect them in the discharge of these duties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">4 Scott, <em>The Law of Trusts </em>\u00a7 394 (3d ed. 1967) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">But it is settled too that\u201c[t]he administration of charitable trusts is governed by majority rule.\u201d <em>Richards v. Midkiff, </em>48 Haw. 32, 40, 396 P.2d 49, 55 (1964). \u201cIf there are several trustees . . ., the powers conferred upon them can properly be exercised by a majority .. ., unless it is otherwise provided by the terms of the trust.\u201d <em>Restatement (Second) of Trusts </em>\u00a7 383 (1957); <em>see also </em>4 Scott, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 383. Here, the will of Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop declared that \u201cthree of them at least must join in all acts.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, \u201c[t]he determination of whether the [Bishop Estate] should maintain a legal action require[d] the requisite concurrence of the trustees just as the exercise of any other power.\u201d <em>Richards v. Midkiff, </em>48 Haw. at 41, 396 P.2d at 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>Takabuki neither averred nor established \u201cthe requisite concurrence\u201d in seeking review of trustee conduct relating to the acquisition of Kawaiaha'o Plaza and instructions from the circuit court. Nor does it appear anywhere in the record that at least three of the Trustees sought allowances of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs from the Estate and the assessment of surcharges for such allowances against Ching. Under the circumstances, there was no basis for the court to review the transaction upon Takabuki\u2019s solicitation, pass judgment thereon, and instruct the Trustees; for the Trustees were not before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">Ching likewise purported to act \u201cin his capacity as a Trustee\u201d when he filed a counterclaim against Takabuki \u201cin his capacity as a Trustee.\u201d He asserted he had \u201cboth the standing and the duty to protect the interests of the present and future beneficiaries of the Estate from having the Estate\u2019s assets depleted and/or mismanaged.\u201d Any question about his standing to sue, he claimed, had been settled by our decision in <em>Richards v. Midkiff, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">To be sure, \u201cthere is [a] principle of trust law which permits one trustee to bring an action against his co-trustee to compel the latter to perform his duties under the trust or to enjoin him from committing a breach of trust or to compel him to redress a breach of trust. Restatement (Second), <em>Trusts, </em>\u00a7 200, comment <em>e </em>(1959); 2 Scott, <em>Trusts, </em>\u00a7 200.2 (2d ed. 1956).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 42, 396 P.2d at 56. This is true also where charitable trusts are concerned. \u201cIt is clear . .. that where there [is a charitable trust with] several trustees, one of them may maintain an action against the others to enforce the trust or to compel the redress of a breach of trust.\u201d 4 Scott, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 391 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">But Ching did not sue \u201cthe others\u201d; he sued only one of them. And even when this was brought to the circuit court\u2019s attention by his opponent, he insisted \u201c[i]t [was] not necessary for any other parties to be named for him to bring such a suit.\u201d <em>See </em>Memorandum In Opposition To Motion To Dismiss For Failure To Name Indispensable Parties at 2. Though Ching sought relief by way of surcharges against Takabuki, he prayed further that the circuit court \u201crescind and/or reform the Amended Kawaiahao Plaza Purchase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>Agreement,\u201d find he \u201cha[d] satisfied his fiduciary duty,\u201d and \u201corder and instruct the Trustees ... to take appropriate action.\u201d Yet he failed to have \u201cthree of them at least\u201d summoned to appear and respond to his counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Granted, \u201c[t]he rule regarding indispensable parties is founded on equitable considerations and is not jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Midkiff v. Kobayashi, </em>54 Haw. at 324, 507 P.2d at 739 (citing 3A Moore, <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>\u00b6 19.19 (2d ed. 1967). Moreover, in <em>Midkiff v. Kobayashi </em>we said that where the \u201csubstantive issues [on appeal were] important,\u201d they would not \u201cbe sidestepped on technical considerations regarding indispensable parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Still, we were speaking there of third parties, privies to agreements made by the Trustees which were the subject of the litigation. We were not referring to the Trustees, or \u201cthree of them at least,\u201d whom the court was being importuned to advise and direct regarding their responsibilities.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">It was the better part of discretion for the court to have joined the rest of the Trustees as parties before proceeding to trial. Not having done so, the court ought not have \u201ctake[n] jurisdiction of a case where it [was] apparent on the record that [it could not] proceed to final judgment and execution.\u201d <em>Kaopua v.
