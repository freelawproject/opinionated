Those decisions dismissed appeals by the appellant from decisions awarding benefits to appellant\u2019s employees who were either residents of the County of Hawaii or whose last place of employment was the County of Hawaii because the appellant filed its notices of appeal with the Department\u2019s office on Oahu rather than on Hawaii as required by HRS \u00a7 383-38. Appellant contends that the filing requirement is a matter of venue rather than a matter of jurisdiction. We do not agree. The first sentence of HRS \u00a7 383-38 states where and when a notice of appeal will be filed. The second sentence deals with where it is to be heard. As appellant concedes, the time provision in the first sentence is jurisdictional. We think the place requirement is likewise jurisdictional. Appellant\u2019s other contentions we deem without substantial merit. Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
