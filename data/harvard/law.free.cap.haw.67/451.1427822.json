Land Use Commission, </em>55 Haw. 538, 545, 524 P.2d 84, 89, <em>reh. denied, </em>55 Haw. 677 (1974). In these appeals, Defendants Wayne Taro Tengan and Glenn Ichiro Akita challenge the use of the Intoxilyzer 401 IAS (the Intoxilyzer), a breath-testing device, to measure the concentration of alcohol in the blood of suspected drunken drivers on the ground that its use has not been authorized pursuant to a rule adopted in conformity with the Act. Tengan also questions the test results which were admitted as evidence in his case because \u201cthe breath test was not conducted by qualified personnel using the proper procedures specified under Hawaii law\u201d and Akita also claims the Director of Transportation improperly delegated part of his authority to a federal agency. Finding no merit in the defendants\u2019 contentions, we affirm their convictions of violations of HRS \u00a7 291-4.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The defendants were stopped by officers of the Honolulu Police Department on suspicion of driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor in unrelated incidents in 1982 and 1983. Each was arrested and transported to the police station after a roadside sobriety test yielded further evidence of his drunkenness. Apprised that drunk driving suspects who refuse to submit to either a breath or blood test to determine the alcoholic content of their blood are liable to have their driving privileges revoked under the \u201cimplied consent\u201d law,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> each chose to undergo a breath test. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>The testing instrument used by the police to verify the concentration of alcohol in the blood of both was the Intoxilyzer. In each case the blood alcohol concentration registered .18% by weight of alcohol, substantially higher than the .10% which then served as presumptive evidence of intoxication under HRS \u00a7 291-5.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Prior to trial in the District Court of the First Circuit, Tengan moved to exclude \u201call evidence obtained by the State in connection with the blood alcohol content breath test,\u201d alleging the use of the Intoxilyzer as a breath-testing device had not been authorized by a properly adopted rule. He also urged the court to suppress the evidence on the ground that the pertinent test was conducted by an unqualified person. The district court, however, denied the motion and convicted Tengan of driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor. Akita likewise averred the use of the Intoxilyzer to procure proof of drunkenness in his case had not been approved by the Director of Transportation pursuant to a duly adopted rule and further claimed the director had improperly redelegated his duty in this regard to a federal agency. He sought a dismissal of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>charge rather than an order suppressing the evidence. But the district court also rejected his claims of infirmity relating to the approval of the testing device and adjudged him guilty of a violation of HRS \u00a7 291-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">On appeal, the defendants essentially reiterate what was urged upon the district court. Our consideration of the issues posed for decision begins, as it must, with the relevant statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">The genesis of the State\u2019s efforts to deter drinkers from driving is traceable to a modest beginning in 1949 with the enactment of S.L.H. 1949, c. 283. Troubled by the prevalence of \u201caccidents and deaths involving persons driving under the influence of liquor\u201d and noting the lack of a \u201cTerritorial statute relating to this subject,\u201d the Territorial legislature \u201cenact[ed] into law provisions making it a misdemeanor to operate vehicles while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or of drugs.\u201d Hse. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 629, in 1949 House Journal, at 1652.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Concomitantly, it \u201cestablish[ed] certain [evidentiary] presumptions [relating to a person\u2019s intoxicated state] based upon the amount of alcohol in a person\u2019s blood.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Though substantially modified since, the basic proscription of drunk driving and the presumptions enacted by the Territorial legislature remain as part of the statutory scheme to curb drunk drivers. <em>See </em>HRS \u00a7\u00a7 291-4 and 291-5; <em>see also </em>notes 1 and 2 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">\u201cImplied consent\u201d was added to this scheme in 1967 when the Hawaii Highway Safety Act, now codified as HRS Chapter 286, was passed to comply with a congressional mandate in the Highway Safety Act of 1966, Pub. L. 89-564, \u00a7 402(a), 80 Stat. 731, 731 (1966), for states to adopt federally approved highway safety pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>grams. See S.L.H. 1967, c. 214, \u00a7 2 <em>and </em>Sen. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 234, in 1967 Senate Journal, at 952- Act 214 provided in part that one operating a motor vehicle on the public highways of the State would be deemed to have consented to being tested to determine the amount of alcohol in his blood.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It further provided a test could be administered only after a lawful arrest and the suspected drunk driver was informed of the consequences of refusal, which included a possible revocation of driving privileges.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Though modified, the essence of these provisions is retained in the calculus of laws dealing with the menacing presence of the intoxicated driver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>on the highways of the State, <em>see </em>HRS \u00a7\u00a7 286-151 and 286-155, and \u201cimplied consent\u201d to testing remains the linchpin of the program to keep him off the highways.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The responsibility of maintaining \u201cscientific and technical control of chemical testing for blood alcohol\u201d subsequently became that of the Department of Health. <em>See </em>S.L.H. 1973, c. 139, <em>and </em>Sen. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 692, in 1973 Senate Journal, at 924. The department was assigned the task of \u201cestablishing] and administering] a statewide program relating to chemical testing of blood-alcohol concentrations for the purposes of chapters 286, Part VII, 291 and 291C, with the consultation of the state highway safety coordinator.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> S.L.H. 1973, c. 139. It was directed to establish appropriate procedures for specifying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-6\">(1) The qualifications of personnel who administer chemical tests used to determine blood-alcohol concentrations;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-7\">(2) The procedures for specimen selection, collection, handling, and analysis; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-8\">(3) The manner of reporting and tabulation of the results.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHvS\"><em>Id. </em>The director of the department was further empowered to adopt the necessary rules and regulations pursuant to HRS Chapter 91 to implement these provisions. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">In conformity with the directives of Act 139, now codified as HRS \u00a7 321-161, the Director of Health has promulgated comprehensive rules governing the chemical testing of blood, breath and other bodily substances, in accord with HRS Chapter 91.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Initially the rules were compiled in Chapter 47 of the Public Health Regulations. But Chapter 47 has since been repealed and the applicable rules are now found in Title 11, Chapter 111, [of the State\u2019s] Administrative Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Thus, the history of the State\u2019s efforts to curb drunk driving has been one of amendments and accretions to the simply worded statutory provisions enacted in 1949. And while the primary duty of enforcing HRS \u00a7 291-4 has always rested with the police, the responsibility of implementing the expanded State program is now shared among several state and county agencies taking direction from several chapters of the Hawaii Revised Statutes, as well as from duly adopted rules and regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">The focus of the defendants\u2019 challenge of the use of the Intoxilyzer by the police to obtain evidence of intoxication is the language of HRS \u00a7 286-151 stating that anyone \u201cwho operates a motor vehicle on the public highways of the State shall be deemed to have given consent... to a <em>test approved by the director of transportation </em>[to determine] the alcoholic content of the person\u2019s blood.\u201d (Emphasis supplied). They assert the director was obliged thereunder to approve the testing instrument in accord with the rule-making provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act. Since he has not done so, they maintain the evidence of intoxication obtained through the use of the Intoxilyzer was fatally tainted.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">Reading the section in isolation, the defendants would have us rule a \u201ctest\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 286-151 encompasses a \u201ctesting device\u201d and its approval by the Director of Transportation is subject to the strictures of HRS Chapter 91. \u201cBut a statutory provision seldom may be read in isolation,\u201d <em>State v. Raitz, </em>63 Haw. 64, 71, 621 P.2d 352, 358 (1980); for \u201c[statutory language must be read in the context of the entire statute and construed in a manner consistent with the purposes of the statutes.\u201d <em>Pacific Insurance Co. v. Oregon Automobile Insurance Co., </em>53 Haw. 208, 212, 490 P.2d 899, 902 (1971) (citations omitted); <em>see also State v. Kaneakua, </em>61 Haw. 136, 140, 597 P.2d 590, 592 (1979). And when we read \u201ctest approved by the director of transportation\u201d in historical context with the purposes of the relevant statutes in mind, we can only conclude the approval by the Director of Transportation of the use of the Intoxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>lyzer in chemical testing for blood alcohol was not subject to the rule-making procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">This is not to say the Act does not apply to the adoption of testing procedures for detecting alcohol in the blood of drunk driving suspects; nor do we mean to suggest an agency is free to approve a testing instrument at its whim or fancy. \u201c[E]ach agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect that implements, interprets, or prescribes law or policy\u201d is a \u201crule\u201d within the meaning of HRS \u00a7 91-1(4), and the agency issuing the statement is bound by the procedural requisites of HRS \u00a7 91-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">We entertain no doubt that when an agency prescribes testing procedures to be employed in determining blood alcohol concentration, it is acting in a rule-making capacity. But we think the primary responsibility for implementing, interpreting, or prescribing law or policy in the area of our present concern, including the prescription of procedures and standards to ensure accurate testing results, has been delegated to an agency other than the Department of Transportation. This conclusion is inescapable when the relevant statutory provisions are viewed in perspective and construed in a manner consistent with their purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">As we have seen, consent implied from the operation of a motor vehicle to \u201ca test approved by the highway safety coordinator (director of transportation)\u201d has been an integral part of the legislative program to discourage drinkers from driving since 1967. <em>See </em>S.L.H. 1967, c. 214, \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Yet the task of exercising scientific and technical control over chemical testing for blood alcohol was not expressly delegated to an agency until 1973. <em>See </em>S.L.H. 1973, c. 139. Finding an absence of actual controls despite the presence of statutory language that could have been read as a grant of authority to the highway safety coordinator, the legislature then \u201cdesignate^] the Department of Health as the statewide administrator for the scientific and technical control of chemical testing for blood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>alcohol.\u201d Sen. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. <em>692, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Act 139, as we observed, called for the establishment and administration of a statewide chemical testing program to meet the needs engendered by highway safety legislation, and the Director of Health was vested with authority to set the necessary procedures and standards by rules and regulations adopted pursuant to HRS Chapter 91. See S.L.H. 1973, c. 139. The comprehensive rules now compiled in Title 11, Chapter 111 of the State\u2019s Administrative Rules clearly fulfill the mandate for the establishment of a statewide program under the aegis of the Director of Health, as Chapter 47 of the Public Health Regulations did prior to its repeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">The duly adopted rules provide for the approval of all breath testing instruments by the Director of Health<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and impose a duty on the Department of Health to evaluate instruments at the request of manufacturers or other agencies.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The performance standards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>for the instruments are also specified therein.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Chapter 47 of the Public Health Regulations, which were superseded by Title 11, Chapter 111 of the Administrative Rules, contained provisions of similar import. Under the circumstances, we can only conclude the demands of the rule-making provisions of HRS Chapter 91 relative to chemical testing for blood alcohol under the State\u2019s highway safety program have been satisfied. And the record discloses the Director of Health approved the use of the Intoxilyzer in accord with the requirements of Chapter 47 and informed the Director of Transportation of the approval on December 16, 1980.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">This information was communicated in turn to the Chief of the Honolulu Police Department by the Director of Transportation, his letter stating,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-7\">[i]n accordance with the Highway Safety Coordinator of the State of Hawaii\u2019s \u201cAn Agency Statement Concerning the Test<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>ing of Blood and Breath Samples to Determine the Alcoholic Content Thereof\u2019 Part II A and C, the enclosed Department of Health statement of approval of the CMI Intoxilyzer breath alcohol testing device is provided for your records.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Letter from Ryokichi Higashionna to Francis Reala (Jan. 23, 1981). The reference to an agency statement was to an earlier document issued by the Highway Safety Coordinator, which in relevant part provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-7\">A. <em>THE TEST APPARATUS</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-8\">The apparatus to be used in the approved test of breath samples to determine the alcoholic content of the blood of a person tested shall be one which qualifies for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Qualified Products List of Evidential Breath Testers for Alcohol Content under the Federal Standard for Devices to Measure Breath Alcohol (38 F. R. 30459 November 5, 1973 or any subsequent revision thereof).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">Hawaii Highway Safety Coordinator, <em>An Agency Statement Concerning the Testing of Blood and Breath Samples to Determine the Alcoholic Content Thereof </em>pt. 11(A) (1976). The letter of January 23, 1981 thus served as notice to the Chief of Police that the use of the Intoxilyzer had been approved by the Director of Health and it met the Federal Standard for Devices to Measure Breath Alcohol. In effect, the letter constituted the Director of Transportation\u2019s \u201capproval\u201d of a breath test following the testing procedures outlined in Title 11, Chapter 111 and employing an instrument approved for use by the Director of Health, which was also on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\u2019s Qualified Products List.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">The Director of Transportation\u2019s approval of the use of the Intoxilyzer could hardly be deemed rule making. For he set no policy and exercised no discretion with respect to the use of testing instruments; he merely coordinated State and federal efforts to maintain accuracy in chemical testing for blood alcohol. We would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>characterize his approval of tests pursuant to HRS \u00a7 286-151 as a ministerial rather than a quasi-legislative function. The implementation, interpretation, or prescription of law or policy in the particular area is clearly the province of the Director of Health, and he has promulgated the rules governing the use of chemical testing instruments in the enforcement of highway safety laws.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Turning to the remaining issues raised by the defendants, we first address Akita\u2019s contention that an impermissible delegation of legislative authority occurred when the Director of Transportation issued \u201cAn Agency Statement Concerning the Testing of Blood and Breath Samples to Determine the Alcoholic Content Thereof\u2019 in 1976.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The statement in question declared that the apparatus used in testing breath samples had to be on the Qualified Products List of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration \u201cor any subsequent revision thereof.\u201d This reference to subsequent revisions, Akita urges, resulted in the adoption by the State of future changes in federal law or policy. We find no merit in the proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">To be sure, the Intoxilyzer was not on the Qualified Products List in 1976; it was deemed fit for use in breath testing by the federal agency in 1979. We are mindful too that \u201cstate legislation which adopts by reference <em>future </em>legislation, rules, or regulations, or amendments thereof, which are enacted, adopted, or promulgated by another sovereign entity, [would constitute] an unlawful delegation of legislative power.\u201d <em>People v. Urban, </em>45 Mich. App. 255, 262, 206 N.W.2d 511, 516 (1973) (citations omitted) (emphasis in original). But here, we earlier concluded the legislature did not contemplate that the Director of Transportation would be acting in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>a quasi-legislative capacity where chemical testing for blood alcohol was concerned. Hence, he could not have adopted federal legislation, rules, or regulations, \u201cor any subsequent revision thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">The last issue posed for decision is whether the evidence of Tengan\u2019s intoxication obtained through the use of the Intoxilyzer was admissible at trial. The test in question, Tengan would have us hold, \u201cwas not conducted by qualified personnel using the proper procedures specified under Hawaii law.\u201d He further asserts the Honolulu Police Department\u2019s maintenance of the particular testing instrument was not up to the standards set by the Director of Health.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> These technical shortcomings, he claims, rendered the test unreliable and the results inadmissible.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ARQ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number><em>Gregory K.
