The State of Hawaii maintains a \u201cprobationer cannot expect to have the same rights and privileges as an ordinary citizen\u201d and the condition is reasonable in light of the circumstances surrounding its imposition. But we think it is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>entirely consonant with the objects of probation and constitutional demands. Thus, we set aside the offending condition and remand the case for the exercise of discretion consistent with the statute covering the grant of probation and constitutional provisions governing searches and seizures.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">The pertinent facts are simple and uncontested. The defendant was indicted on five counts of Promoting a Dangerous Drug in the Second Degree in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 712-1242(l)(c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Following plea bargaining between the prosecuting attorney and defense counsel, the defendant pleaded guilty to Counts I, II, and V of the indictment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The circuit court adjudged her guilty of the offenses described in those counts and placed her on probation for a period of five years on condition that she comply with the terms of probation outlined by the court. The Terms and Conditions of Probation encompassed the usual commands delivered to probationers. But they also included several \u201cspecial conditions of probation,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> including one, Condition 6(f), that ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>pears to strip the probationer of the guarantee against unreasonable searches and seizures afforded under the federal and state constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Although she has not been subjected to a warrantless search pursuant to Condition 6(f), the defendant appeals from the sentence of the circuit court. Her right to seek appellate review, however, is challenged by the prosecuting attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">The defendant seeks a declaration from this court that Condition 6(f) represents an undue infringement of her constitutional right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures. But her request for review comes before any effort by the government to exploit the particular condition of probation. We are, of course, reminded by the prosecuting attorney that the self-imposed rules governing the exercise of our statutory jurisdiction militate against a present review of the circuit court\u2019s order. The contention is not without merit; yet, we think there is reason for us to act here.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution of the United States confines the federal judiciary\u2019s authority to \u201ccases\u201d and \u201ccontro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>versies.\u201d <em>See </em>L. Tribe, <em>American Constitutional Law </em>52 (1978). \u201c[TJhose words limit the business of the federal courts to questions presented in an adversary context and in a form historically viewed as capable of resolution through the judicial process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 53. Thus, \u201ccourts created pursuant to Article III are barred . . . from deciding \u2018abstract, hypothetical or contingent questions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 56. This restriction of power stems \u201cdirectly from the \u2018case or controversy\u2019 requirement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 60. \u201cA further but closely related limitation . . ., that of <em>ripeness, </em>is a product both of the prudential considerations that influence federal courts and of the constitutional restrictions expressed in the advisory opinion ban.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">While the courts of the State of Hawaii are not bound by a \u201ccase or controversy\u201d requirement,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we nonetheless recognize that the \u201c \u2018prudential rules\u2019 of judicial self-governance \u2018founded in concern about the proper \u2014 and properly limited \u2014 role of courts in a democratic society\u2019 are always of relevant concern.\u201d <em>Life of the Land v. Land Use Commission, </em>63 Haw. 166, 172, 623 P.2d 431, 438 (1981) (citations omitted). For \u201ceven in the absence of constitutional restrictions, courts [must] still carefully weigh the wisdom, efficacy, and timeliness of an exercise of their power before acting.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">\u201c[R]ipeness is peculiarly a question of timing,\u201d <em>Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases, </em>419 U.S. 102, 140 (1974), and the relevant prudential rule deals with \u201c \u2018[p]roblems of prematurity and abstractness\u2019 that may prevent adjudication in all but the exceptional case. <em>Socialist Labor Party v. Gilligan, </em>406 U.S. 583, 588 (1972).\u201d <em>Buckley v. Valeo, </em>424 U.S. 1, 114 (1976). A ruling that an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>issue is not ripe ordinarily indicates the court has concluded \u201ca later decision [may be] more apt or ... that the matter is not yet appropriate for adjudication.\u201d L. Tribe, <em>supra, </em>at 61; <em>see also State v. Maxwell, </em>62 Haw. 556, 562, 617 P.2d 816, 820 (1980); <em>cf. State ex rel. McClung v. Fukushima, </em>53 Haw. 295, 298, 492 P.2d 128, 130 (1972) (\u201c[m]andamus may not be resorted to in anticipation of an omission to perform a duty.\u201d); <em>Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, </em>297 U.S. 288, 346 (1936) (Brand\u00e9is, J\u201e concurring) (the Supreme Court \u201cwill not \u2018anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">If the foregoing precepts were stricdy applied to the situation at hand, we could only conclude that problems of prematurity preclude an adjudication of the issue raised on appeal; for at the moment, Condition 6(f) merely poses a nascent threat to Shirley Lynn Fields. And until a police or probation officer conducts a warrantless search of her person, property, or place of residence, we would be hard put to say the dispute between the State and the defendant has ripened into a justiciable controversy. Other important considerations nevertheless lead us to believe we are confronted with the exceptional case demanding attention in advance of an actual attempt by the government to enforce the condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">Condition 6(f), we said, gives an appearance of stripping the defendant of protection against invasions of privacy by the government. To be sure, \u201cthere is considerable authority supporting the proposition that probationers may lawfully be subjected to searches which, absent their probation status, would be deemed unlawful because of the absence of probable Cause or a search warrant or both.\u201d 3 W. LaFave, <em>Search and Seizure </em>\u00a7 10.10, at 422 (1978) (citations omitted). Still, we were recently instructed by the Supreme Court that the deprivation of a fundamental right may not be lightly regarded, even when exacted as part of the price of conditional release. <em>See Minnesota v. </em>Murphy, _ U.S ___, ____, 104 S. Ct. 1136, 1142 (1984) (\u201c[a] defendant does not lose [his Fifth Amendment] protection by reason of his conviction of a crime\u201d and placement on probation).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>2.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">The condition in question is neither mandated nor expressly sanctioned by the statutory provisions governing the suspension of sentence and the grant of probation. <em>See </em>HRS \u00a7\u00a7 706-620 to 706-624. It is a creature of judicial ingenuity presumably founded on the discretion vested in the sentencing court to saddle a probationer with any condition \u201creasonably related to [his] rehabilitation . . . and not unduly restrictive of his liberty or incompatible with his freedom or conscience.\u201d HRS \u00a7 706-624(2)(l). Should we choose to subject it to present scrutiny, our inquiry would focus on the propriety of judicial action; we would not be venturing \u201cinto areas committed to other branches of government.\u201d <em>Life of the Land v. Land Use Commission, </em>63 Haw. at 172, 623 P.2d at 438. We think these circumstances give us reason to act before there is an attempt to enforce the sentencing court\u2019s order, since our bounden duty includes the prevention of serious judicial mistakes in situations where resort to appeal may be otherwise foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">We have been charged with \u201cthe general superintendence of all courts of inferior jurisdiction\u201d of the State of Hawaii. HRS \u00a7 602-4.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Concomitantly, we have been endowed with authority \u201cto <em>prevent </em>and correct errors and abuses therein where no other remedy is expressly provided by law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Emphasis added). However, a strong commitment to the prudential rules shaping the exercise of our jurisdiction has resulted in a sparing use of this extraordinary power. <em>See Gannett Pacific Corp. v. Richardson, </em>59 Haw. 224, 226-27, 580 P.2d 49, 53 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">Yet in our view the situation at hand represents the rare case where it \u201cwould not be in the public interest\u201d to compel the issue \u201cto wend its way through the appellate process\u201d after the sentencing court\u2019s order has been enforced, <em>id. </em>at 227, 580 P.2d at 53; for we have cause to believe the particular order has been adopted as a \u201cstandard condition of probation\u201d affecting a sizeable group of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>offenders.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> And if more than a few probationers are in constant jeopardy of being divested by judicial f\u00edat of statutory and constitutional protection that should rightfully be theirs, our supervisory duty would render the prevention of such error obligatory, though the prudential rules may counsel against the consideration of this appeal. Thus, we turn to the question of whether the deprivation can be justified as a condition of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">\u201cProbation is a judicial act whereby a convicted criminal offender is released into the community under the supervision of a probation officer, in lieu of incarceration.\u201d Note, <em>Fourth Amendment Limitations on Probation and Parole Supervision, </em>1976 Duke L.J. 71, 71 n.l. \u201cThe essence of probation is the <em>condition </em>\u2014 a judicially imposed restriction upon the convict\u2019s actions after release.\u201d Note, <em>Judicial Review of Probation Conditions, </em>67 Colum. L. Rev. 181, 181 (1967) (footnote omitted) (emphasis in original). And \u201cprobationers, like parolees and prisoners, properly are subject to limitations from which ordinary persons are free.\u201d <em>United States v. Consuelo-Gonzalez, </em>521 F.2d 259, 265 (9th Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">While several conditions to which an offender may be subjected have been prescribed by statute, the legislature has acknowledged that judicial discretion in fashioning others may contribute to the effectiveness of probation. <em>See </em>HRS \u00a7 706-624.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> But any other condition imposed in the exercise of this discretion is only valid to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>the extent that it may serve the ends of rehabilitation and is \u201cnot unduly restrictive of [the probationer\u2019s] liberty or incompatible with his freedom or conscience.\u201d HRS \u00a7 706-624(2)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Here, the release of Shirley Lynn Fields has been conditioned upon her submission at all times to warrantless searches for illicit drugs by any law enforcement officer. This may well serve one of the twin goals of probation, the protection of the public. Still, the pertinent legislative command is that the condition further the other objective, the rehabilitation of the offender, and that it be neither too restrictive of the offender\u2019s liberty nor incompatible with his freedom or conscience. We doubt that a near-total surrender of privacy could be reasonably related to rehabilitation, and we think the deprivation would be inconsistent with even the limited freedom afforded someone who but for the grace of the sentencing court would be in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">There unquestionably is a difference \u201cbetween correctional supervision which seeks to restore a released offender to society through.rehabilitation, and supervision which seeks ... to investigate and prosecute criminal activity.\u201d 1976 Duke L.J. <em>supra, </em>at 94. The police officer\u2019s principal role in our criminal justice scheme is related to the investigation and prosecution of criminal activity, and any search he may conduct of Shirley Lynn Fields would probably be \u201ctotally unrelated to either her prior conviction or her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>rehabilitation.\u201d <em>United States v. Consuelo-Gonzalez, </em>521 F.2d at 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Under the circumstances the relationship between warrantless searches at the whim of police officers and the rehabilitation of the probationer is tenuous at best. Indiscriminate invasions of privacy, in our opinion, would be unlikely to foster respect for the law; they could well be \u201cdestructive of the rehabilitative process.\u201d W. LaFave, <em>supra, </em>at 446. At any rate, they would be \u201cunduly restrictive of [her] liberty or incompatible with [her] freedom or conscience.\u201d HRS \u00a7 706-624(2)(l). For \u201c[a] probationer, like a parolee, has the right to enjoy a significant degree of privacy\u201d and liberty. <em>United States v. Consuelo-Gonzalez, </em>521 F.2d at 265 (citation omitted); <em>cf. Morrisey v. Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 482 (1972) (\u201c[t]hough the State properly subjects [the parolee] to many restrictions not applicable to other citizens, his condition is very different from that of confinement in a prison.\u201d) (footnote omitted). But we do not mean to suggest that warrantless searches to which Shirley Lynn Fields may be subjected by her probation officer should be viewed in the same light.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">After convicting Shirley Lynn Fields of three counts of Promoting a Dangerous Drug and finding she was \u201cin need of the supervision, guidance, assistance, or direction that the probation service can provide,\u201d HRS \u00a7 706-622, the circuit court released her into the community under the supervision of a probation officer in lieu of imprisonment. It thus became incumbent upon the probation officer to \u201ckeep [himself] informed [about] the conduct and condition of the defendant [, to] report thereon to the court [, to] use all suitable methods to aid the defendant and to bring about improvement in [her] conduct and condition.\u201d HRS \u00a7 806-73.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>short, he assumed \u201ccorrectional supervision [over a released offender] which seeks to restore [her] to society through rehabilitation.\u201d 1976 Duke L.J. <em>supra, </em>at 94. The question now is whether the vesting of power in the correctional supervisor to conduct warrantless searches of the person, property, and place of residence of the probationer serves a legitimate correctional purpose. We believe this may contribute to her rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The probation officer has been described as \u201ca social therapist in an authoritative setting.\u201d Newman, <em>Concepts of Treatment in Probation and Parole Supervision, </em>25 Fed. Prob. 11, 16 (Mar. 1961). The system he serves demands that he be a helper, a monitor, and an enforcer; it instructs him to aid and guide an individual who has displayed antisocial and criminal behavior, to evaluate and report on his progress toward integration into the community, and to curb his criminal tendencies.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The desired rehabilitation of the subject of therapy is largely dependent upon the therapist\u2019s ability to gain \u201ca thorough understanding of the [probationer] and his environment, including his personal habits, his relationships with other persons, and what he is doing, both at home and outside it.\u201d <em>Latta v. Fitzharris, </em>521 F.2d 246, 249 (9th Cir. 1975). In sum, the system gives the probation officer \u201ca special and unique interest in invading the [probationer\u2019s] privacy.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">His reason for intruding into the private world of the probationer, unlike that of the police officer, is her demonstrated need for correctional supervision, which she presumably accepted as the preferred alternative to imprisonment. Moreover, what has been expressly authorized as a correctional tool at the disposal of the correctional supervisor are quests for dangerous drugs and substances. Given her known proclivity for involvement in the trafficking of illicit drugs, we encounter no difficulty in finding the necessary connection between such searches and the rehabilitation of Shirley Lynn Fields.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">Our inquiry, however, does not end here, for the relevant statu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>tory provision further commands that the condition be neither too restrictive of the probationer\u2019s liberty nor incompatible with her freedom or conscience. And searches and seizures are, of course, subject to constitutional regulation as well. The statutory and the constitutional issues nevertheless boil down to a single issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The question remaining is whether warrantless searches of the person, property, and place of residence of Shirley Lynn Fields for dangerous drugs and substances would be unreasonable even when conducted by the correctional supervisor responsible for her guidance during the probationary term. We believe they would be, unless he is able to point to specific and articulable facts giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that illicit drugs are concealed on the person, in the property, or at the place of residence of the probationer.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">If anything is settled in the law of search and seizure, it is that a search without a warrant issued upon probable cause is unreasonable per se, \u201csubject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions.\u201d <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 357 (1967); <em>State v. Jenkins, </em>62 Haw. 660, 662, 619 P.2d 108, 110 (1980). Yet as we noted, \u201cthere is considerable authority supporting the proposition that probationers may lawfully be subjected to searches which, absent their probation status, would be deemed unlawful because of the absence of probable cause or a search warrant or both.\u201d W. LaFave, <em>supra, </em>at 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">In approving the searches, \u201c[s]ome courts ... stress that ... probation is an \u2018act of grace,\u2019 from which it is concluded that such beneficence may be attended by whatever restrictions upon privacy the government may deem appropriate.\u201d W. LaFave, <em>supra, </em>at 423. \u201cOr ... it is frequently concluded that searches of [probationers] are proper because consented to as a part of the \u2018contract\u2019 of release.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Granted that Shirley Lynn Fields may have been released rather than incarcerated as \u201can act of grace\u201d and she may have \u201cconsented\u201d to being searched at all times, searches limited only by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>their purpose of seeking illicit drugs, in our view, cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny. \u201c[T]he liberty of a parolee [or a probationer], although indeterminate, includes many of the core values of unqualified liberty,\u201d <em>Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 U.S. at 482, and \u201c[a] probationer, like the parolee, has the right to enjoy a significant degree of privacy.\u201d <em>United States v. Consuelo-Gonzalez, </em>521 F.2d at 265. Assuming the circuit court deemed the probationer\u2019s release \u201can act of grace\u201d and her freedom a privilege, \u201c[b]y whatever name, the liberty is valuable\u201d and entitled to constitutional protection. <em>Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 U.S. at 482. If the court proceeded on consent, it obviously was secured in a \u201csituation . . . instinct with coercion \u2014 albeit colorably lawful coercion. Where there is coercion there cannot be consent.\u201d <em>Bumper v. North Carolina, </em>391 U.S. 543, 550 (1968). Consequently, a warrantless search must meet a test of reasonableness even when carried out in fulfillment of a condition of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">\u201c[T]he right to privacy embodied in the Fourth Amendment is enforceable against the States,\u201d <em>Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 660 (1961), and we would ordinarily be guided by the pronouncements of the Supreme Court in deciding what may be reasonable in the circumstances. If the Court has spoken on the particular question before us, it has not done so in clear and commanding tones. But the Constitution of the State of Hawaii explicitly protects \u201cthe people . . . against unreasonable searches, seizures and invasions of privacy.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> And \u201cas the ultimate judicial tribunal in this state, this court has final, unreviewable authority to interpret and enforce the Hawaii Constitution.\u201d <em>State v. Kaluna, </em>55 Haw. 361, 369, 520 P.2d 51, 58 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">We said in <em>Kaluna </em>that \u201ceach case of search and seizure without a warrant must turn on its own facts, and that each proffered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>justification for a warrantless search must meet the test of necessity inherent in the concept of reasonableness.\u201d 55 Haw. at 371-72, 520 P.2d at 60. The rationale offered here for warrantless intrusions is the recognized need to redirect an offender and to curb further criminal conduct on her part. Our task, then, is to weigh this societal interest against the individual\u2019s interest in maintaining her privacy.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AiS\"><em>Anson O. Re go (Joanne M. Lanham </em>with him on reply brief; <em>Anson O. Reg\u00f3, </em>A Law Corporation, of counsel) for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AqV\"><em>Shirley Smith (Arthur E. Ross </em>on the brief), Deputy Prosecuting Attorneys, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">In addition to the general governmental interest above, the means selected to promote rehabilitation gives the probation officer \u201ca special and unique interest in invading the [probationer\u2019s] privacy,\u201d <em>Latta v. Fitzharris, </em>521 F.2d at 249. In contrast, the grant of probationary status presupposes at least a partial surrender of privacy; since close supervision by a correctional supervisor, as we have seen, is the mainspring of probation. When the substantial governmental interest in the success of a program designed to rehabilitate a convicted criminal is weighed against her diminished expectation of privacy, we would have to agree there is reason here for permitting searches for illicit drugs without a warrant issued upon probable cause. This is not to say the offender\u2019s interest in privacy is insignificant and that she may be subjected to searches at the supervisor\u2019s caprice or fancy.

I cannot agree with part IV for the reason that in my view it is pure <em>obiter dictum.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">No probation condition limited to searches by appellant\u2019s correctional supervisor has been laid down, and, ergo, no search pursuant to such a condition has yet occurred. Yet, in the absence of any factual situation whatever, the opinion, in part IV, formulates a constitutional test for such searches. That test, the opinion says, is whether the correctional supervisor is able to point to \u201cspecific and articulable facts giving rise to a reasonable suspicion\u201d that illicit drugs are concealed on the person, in the property or at the residence of the probationer, as distinguished from the test of \u201cprobable cause\u201d necessary to support a warrant. Constitutional issues should not be decided in a vacuum. Much less should new constitutional tests be adopted in a vacuum. Yet that is what the opinion does.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Absent a specific factual situation to test that new constitutional standard against, I do not know what the standard means, and, I submit, neither will anyone else. A myriad of different factual situations involving searches by a correctional supervisor may arise. For example, I harbor grave doubts as to whether it is constitutionally impermissible to require a probationer, convicted of a drug offense, to submit to a warrantless search of his or her person by a correctional supervisor, as a matter of routine, at any scheduled meeting with such a supervisor, but the opinion would forbid this. I believe we should have a concrete factual situation before us before we undertake to lay down a constitutional standard with respect to searches of a probationer by a correctional supervisor pursuant to a probation condition. I therefore cannot agree with part IV, not because I necessarily view the legal pronouncements therein as wrong, but because, without objective facts to test them against, I cannot say that they are either right or wrong.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
