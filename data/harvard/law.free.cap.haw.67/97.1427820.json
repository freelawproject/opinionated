We therefore vacate the summary judgment awarded the Hawaiian Insurance and Guaranty Company, Ltd. (HIG) and the order denying attorney\u2019s fees and costs, affirm the summary judgment in favor of the Department of Social Services and Housing, State of Hawaii (DSSH), and remand the case for the determination of the amount of benefits she should receive and her entitlement to an attorney\u2019s fee and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Ann Marie Lewis, then a recipient of public assistance under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program administered by DSSH, sustained an injury in a vehicular collision on March 6, 1980. Although she was insured under a \u201cno-fault policy\u201d as mandated by HRS \u00a7 294-8,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the policy issued by HIG without cost to her, when read in conjunction with HRS \u00a7 294-24(b)(2), did not provide payments to cover her rehabilitation expenses.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under the legislative scheme of reparations for injury re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>suiting from motor vehicle accidents, those, expenses were met through the public assistance program. Hence, Ms. Lewis had no reason to assert a claim against HIG as long as she remained an AFDC beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">In January of 1981, Ms. Lewis, now Mrs. Barcena, informed DSSH that the AFDC payments to her should be discontinued since her husband\u2019s income disqualified her for assistance. But after she and her husband were separated in November of 1981, she again sought and received public aid. In the interim, however, she continued to incur expenses related to the injury. And though she sought \u201cno-fault benefits\u201d from HIG or assistance from DSSH to cover the cost of physical therapy during the time she received no AFDC payments, neither responded affirmatively to her request. HIG disavowed responsibility for payment of \u201cno-fault benefits,\u201d since \u201cthe term, when applied to a no-fault policy issued at no cost under the provisions of ... [HRS \u00a7] 294-24(b)(2) . .. [did] not include benefits under subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) for any person receiving public assistance benefits.\u201d <em>See </em>note 2 <em>supra. </em>DSSH rejected the plea for aid on grounds that she was ineligible for AFDC payments when the therapy was administered.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>The negative responses led Mrs. Barcena to seek a judicial remedy, and she filed a two-count complaint in the circuit court. In the first, she prayed that the court decree performance of HIG\u2019s obligation under the policy to furnish \u201cno-fault benefits\u201d and for damages. In the second, she sought an order directing the payment of AFDC benefits by DSSH, as well as damages. She further prayed that attorneys\u2019 fees and costs be assessed against the insurer and the State agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Mrs. Barcena\u2019s application for judicial relief suffered a fate similar to the earlier requests made of the defendants; summary judgments were awarded to HIG and DSSH. Her subsequent motion seeking the payment of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs pursuant to HRS \u00a7 294-30(a)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was also disallowed. Appeals to this court from the summary judgments and from the disallowance of fees and costs followed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">\u201cThe purpose of. . . [HRS Chapter 294] is to create a system of reparations for accidental harm and loss arising from motor vehicle accidents, to compensate those damages without regard to fault, and to limit tort liability for these accidents.\u201d HRS \u00a7 294-1. \u201cIf the accident causing accidental harm occurs in this State, every person, insured under this chapter, and his survivors, suffering loss from accidental harm arising out of the operation, maintenance or use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>a motor vehicle has a right to no-fault benefits.\u201d HRS \u00a7 294-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">The statutory system of reparations embodied in the No-Fault Insurance Law is bottomed on the compulsory coverage of all motor vehicles and operators under no-fault insurance policies and the partial abolition of tort liability. <em>See </em>note 1 <em>supra </em>and HRS \u00a7 294-6.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Now, one to whom harm befalls from an auto accident, save in certain instances not relevant here, cannot seek recompense from a negligent perpetrator of harm; he must look instead to sources designated in the chapter. If the injured person has purchased the \u201cno-fault policy\u201d required of all motor vehicle owners and operators, the insurer is obliged to compensate him for damages to the extent they fall within \u201cno-fault benefits\u201d as defined by HRS \u00a7 294-2(10). If the insured accident victim is a public assistance recipient for whom the mandatory insurance coverage has been provided under the joint underwriting plan established by HRS \u00a7 294-22,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the \u201cno-fault benefits\u201d the insurer would be responsible for would not include payments for medical and rehabili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>tation expenses; in his case, the liability for such services is assumed by the government. <em>See </em>note 2 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">The accident victim here concededly suffered loss from accidental harm arising from the operation of a motor vehicle, and she was insured under a \u201cno-fault policy.\u201d Yet she was rebuffed when she sought reparations from her insurer or public aid to defray expenses incurred for therapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">HIG rationalizes its refusal to honor her claim on the language of HRS \u00a7 294-2(10) defining \u201cno-fault benefits.\u201d To be sure, \u201cthe term, when applied to a no-fault policy issued at no cost under the provisions of section 294-24(b)(2) . .. [does] not include benefits ... [for expenses incurred for occupational therapy and rehabilitation by] any person receiving public assistance benefits.\u201d <em>See </em>note 2 <em>supra. </em>On superficial examination, the foregoing proviso to HRS \u00a7 294-2(10) appears to preclude the payment of the claimed \u201cno-fault benefits.\u201d Still, the unavailability of benefits for Mrs. Barcena cannot be reconciled with Chapter 294\u2019s declared purpose to create a no-fault system of reparations, its limitation of tort liability, and its establishment of right to \u201cno-fault benefits\u201d for loss from accidental harm arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle. <em>See </em>HRS \u00a7\u00a7 294-1 and 294-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">Though it can be said that the proviso to HRS \u00a7 294-2(10) manifests a legislative design supportive of HIG\u2019s position, the language may also be read more restrictively as Mrs. Barcena suggests \u2014 \u201cno-fault benefits\u201d are withholdable only while a person is a recipient of public aid. \u201cThere are times when uncertain words are to be wrought into consistency and unity with a legislative policy which is itself a source of law.. . .\u201d <em>Van Beeck v. Sabine Towing Co., </em>300 U.S. 342, 351 (1937). <em>Cf. Dependents of Crawford v. Financial Plaza Contractors, </em>64 Haw. 415, 421, 643 P.2d 48, 52 (1982); <em>Montalvo v.

For the power to decide what the policy of the law shall be resides with the legislature; \u201cand if it has intimated its will, . .. that will should be recognized and obeyed.\u201d <em>Johnson v.

Hence, the proviso in question when \u201cwrought into consistency and unity\u201d with this intent can be applied to deny Mrs. Barcena \u201cno-fault benefits\u201d to cover the cost of her therapy only while she remained a recipient of public aid and the liability for her rehabilitation was assumed by the government. During the time she was ineligible for government assistance, it was incumbent upon HIG to furnish the benefits prescribed by the No-Fault Insurance Law. Otherwise, the promise of benefits in lieu of the right she possessed to seek reparations from a negligent perpetrator of harm would not be fulfilled.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">Having held HIG accountable and seeing no reason to promote a double recovery of rehabilitation expenses, we find it unnecessary to subject our public assistance laws to scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">The award of summary judgment to HIG and the order denying attorney\u2019s fees and costs are set aside, the award of summary judgment to DSSH is affirmed, and the case is remanded to the circuit court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b133-7\"> HRS \u00a7 294-8, in relevant part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-8\">No person shall operate or use a motor vehicle upon any public street, road, or highway of this State at any time unless such motor vehicle is insured at all times under a no-fault policy.
