The statute was incorrectly construed by the trial court and we reverse and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">On October 6,1983, Appellant was convicted of Robbery in the Second Degree in violation of HRS \u00a7 708-841. The State moved for revocation of probation and imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence under HRS \u00a7 706-606.5 because at that time, Appellant was serving a five year sentence of probation for an earlier conviction of First Degree Robbery and Burglary in violation of HRS \u00a7 708-840 and \u00a7 708-810, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">The trial court revoked probation and sentenced Appellant to concurrent terms of twenty and ten years for the prior offense and to a ten year consecutive sentence for the inst\u00e1nt conviction. It further sentenced Appellant to a three year mandatory minimum term under the repeat offender statute but ruled that it was to be served consecutive to the above sentence. Appellant was sentenced to a total of 33 years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">HRS \u00a7 706-606.5 provides that an individual who has a prior conviction for one or more of the enumerated offenses and who, within the time for the maximum sentence for the prior conviction is again convicted for an enumerated offense shall be sentenced to a minimum period of imprisonment without possibility of parole. HRS \u00a7 706-606.5(1) and (2). It is undisputed that Appellant is subject to application of a three year minimum sentence under HRS \u00a7 706-606.5(2)(a) but here that sentence was added to the statutory maximum ten year sentence imposed for a conviction of Robbery in the Second Degree, a class B felony.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> HRS \u00a7 708-841. The sole issue is whether the mandatory minimum term may be tacked as a consecutive sentence to that imposed for the underlying subsequent offense. We hold that it may not.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>The sentencing court ruled and the State argues that the \u201ctacking\u201d of the mandatory minimum is authorized by the statute. HRS \u00a7 706-606.5(3) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-6\">The sentencing court may impose the above sentences consecutive to any other sentence then or previously imposed on the defendant ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">In the absence of clearly expressed legislative language to the contrary, the language of a statute must be regarded as conclusive but this court\u2019s primary duty is to ascertain and implement the intention of the legislature. <em>Kaiama v. Aguilar, </em>67 Haw. 549, 696 P.2d 839 (1985). In ascertaining intent, the language of the provision must be read in the context of the entire statute and construed in a manner consistent with its purposes. <em>Foster Village Community Ass\u2019n. v. Hess, </em>4 Haw. App. 463, 667 P.2d 850 (1983). The construction propounded by the State is inconsistent with the sentencing scheme of the Hawaii Penal Code as articulated by HRS Chapter 706, providing for the disposition of convicted defendants, particularly its maximum term and extended term sentencing requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">Maximum indeterminate sentences for felony convictions are provided for under HRS \u00a7 706-659 (Supp. 1984) and HRS \u00a7 706-660 (Supp. 1984). Thereunder, the court has no discretion to increase or decrease the specified terms.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> With the exception of special problems calling for extended terms of imprisonment, the statutes are intended to allow imposition of only one maximum length <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>of imprisonment for each class of felony. Commentary, HRS \u00a7 706-660. Maximum extended terms are provided for under HRS \u00a7 706-661 and may be imposed only upon proper motion and hearing, and specific findings by the sentencing court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> HRS \u00a7\u00a7 706-663 and 706-662. The court in effect extended the maximum sentence by three years without compliance with the extended term provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">In enacting the repeat offender law, the legislature stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-6\">In particular your Committee concurs that necessary steps should be taken so that any person convicted for some of the most serious and reprehensible felonies as defined by the Hawaii Penal Code <em>be sentenced, for each conviction after the first conviction to a mandatory sentence without the possibility of parole. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">Sen. Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 33-76 in 1976 Senate Journal at 883, Hse. Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 32 in 1976 House Journal at 1141. The mandatory minimum sentencing provisions are intended to apply to sentences imposed for the underlying subsequent conviction which triggered application of the statute. Logically, the required period of unparoled imprisonment is subsumed within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>maximum sentence imposed for that offense. This is in harmony with the statutory scheme. The consecutive sentencing language of HRS \u00a7 706-606.5 necessarily must be read to allow the sentence on the underlying offense to be served consecutive to the sentence imposed for the prior offense or offenses.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys id=\"Atd\"><em>Richard Pollack (Lynette Mah </em>on the brief) Deputy Public Defenders for defendant-appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AZlD\"><em>Willard Peterson (!Thalia B.
