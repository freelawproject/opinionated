We affirm the ICA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">Okubo and Yamamoto were indicted in January of 1981 for bribing two policemen in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 710-1040(l)(a). Evidence against them was obtained through the warrantless taping and transmission of approximately forty face-to-face and telephone conversations Okubo and Yamamoto had with the officers over a seven month period. The police used four methods to obtain evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-8\">(1) A participant-police officer wore a \u201cNagra\u201d brand <em>body tape recorder </em>which recorded face-to-face conversations;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-9\">(2) A participant-police officer permitted telephone conversations to be recorded with an <em>audio recorder attached to the phone </em>which the officer was using;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-10\">(3) A participant-police officer wore a <em>transmitter, </em>which simultaneously broadcasted face-to-face conversations to other police officers who monitored and recorded the conversations, sometimes in conjunction with videotape recordings and sometimes not; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-11\">(4) The monitoring police officers <em>video-tape recorded </em>the face-to-face conversations among Officers Nagao and Higa and the defendants. <em>See </em>3 Haw. App. at 398; 651 P.2d at 497-98 (1982).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-12\">The two participant police officers consented to the recordings and videotapes. Okubo and Yamamoto did not know of, or consent to, any of the tapings, although they testified that they did know that they were speaking with police officers. A meeting and conversation that occurred at a public restaurant, the Beretania Saimin, on January 9, 1980 was taped, transmitted and videotaped. Okubo and Yamamoto moved to suppress all of the tapes under Rule 12(b), Hawaii Rules of Penal Procedure (1977), and on September 4, 1981 the circuit court partially granted the motion, suppressing the taped conversations but allowing in the soundless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>videotapes. The lower court found that the warrantless taping of the conversations violated Article I, \u00a7 7 of the Hawaii Constitution,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and HRS \u00a7 803-42(b)(3).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">On appeal by the State, the case was assigned to the ICA. The ICA reversed the circuit court\u2019s suppression under <em>State v. Lester, </em>64 Haw. 659, 649 P.2d 346 (1982) and held that since the tapes were made with the consent of one of the parties to the conversation, a warrant was not required. 3 Haw. App. 396, 409, 651 P.2d 494, 504 (1982). The ICA also held that HRS \u00a7 803-42(b)(3) expressly allows the interception of a wire or oral communication if one party to the conversation consents to the interception. Okubo and Yamamoto argue once again in this appeal that they have a protected privacy interest under Article I, \u00a7 7, and that the circuit court\u2019s suppression was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">In <em>Lester, supra, </em>two members of the court found no violation of either Article I, \u00a7 7 or HRS \u00a7 803-42(b)(3). 64 Haw. at 668, 649 P.2d at 353. One justice concurred because the conversation between Lester and the government agent occurred in a public park. The concurrence expressed reservations over the propriety of such a recording if it had occurred in a private place, or if the conversa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>tion had been simultaneously recorded and transmitted to other hidden agents. 64 Haw. at 674-75, 649 P.2d at 356-57. The two dissenting justices found a violation of Section 7 of the Hawaii Constitution. 64 Haw. at 676; 649 P.2d at 357-58.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AX-\"><em>Gary T. Hayashi (James E.T.

Kubo, Jr., </em>on the brief), Deputy Prosecuting Attorneys, for respondent-appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Because of the change in the composition of this court, we granted certiorari only to review the important issues. We affirm the reasoning in the plurality opinion of <em>Lester, supra, </em>and the IC A\u2019s decision in <em>Okubo, supra, </em>and find the consensual monitoring of the conversation valid under Article I, \u00a7 7 of the Hawaii Constitution and HRS \u00a7 80S-42(b)(3).

Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 55, in Proceedings of the Constitutional Convention of Hawaii of 1968, Vol. I, at 233. Thus, Article I, \u00a7 7 of the Constitution now provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-12\">The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects against unreasonable searches, seizures <em>and invasions of privacy </em>shall not be violated; and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized <em>or the communications sought to be intercepted.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-13\">(Emphasis supplied). What the convention proposed and the people of Hawaii accepted is set to naught by the majority of the court in summary fashion; but \u201cI cannot believe that the framers in 1968 amended section 7 to accomplish nothing,\u201d <em>State v. Okubo, </em>3 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Haw. App. 396, 414, 651 P.2d 494, 507 (1982) (Tanaka, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The issue here is not whether Article I, \u00a7 7 outlaws electronic eavesdropping \u2014 there unquestionably is room for electronic technology in criminal law enforcement. \u201cThe critical question . . . is whether ... we should impose on our citizens the risks of the electronic listener or observer without at least the protection of a warrant requirement.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>401 U.S. 745, 786 (1971) (Harlan, J., dissenting). The majority of this court relies on the reasoning of the plurality in <em>State v. Lester, </em>64 Haw. 659, 649 P.2d 346 (1982), in concluding Article I, \u00a7 7 does not afford such protection where the surveillance is conducted with the consent or cooperation of a participant in the conversation. The plurality there like the Intermediate Court of Appeals in this case reasoned such surveillance is of no constitutional consequence since society has displayed no inclination to treat as reasonable the subjective expectation of a person engaged in a private conversation that it will not be repeated. <em>Id. </em>at 668, 649 P.2d at 353; <em>State v. Okubo, </em>3 Haw. App. at 409, 651 P.2d at 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Still, \u201cit is one thing to subject the average citizen to the risk that participants in a conversation with him will subsequently divulge its contents to another, but quite a different matter to foist upon him the risk that unknown third parties may be simultaneously listening in\u201d qr recording the conversation. <em>United States v. White, </em>401 U.S. at 777 (Harlan, J., dissenting). \u201cThe latter risk is not yet rooted in [our] common. . . experience,\u201d <em>Holmes v. Burr, </em>486 F.2d 55, 72 (9th Cir.) (Hufstedler, J., dissenting), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 1116 (1973), and the framers of the crucial language of Article I, \u00a7 7 intended it should not be thrust upon us without limitation. By imposing the requirement of a warrant \u201cdescribing the communications sought to be intercepted,\u201d they limited the risk of one\u2019s conversation being monitored to situations where his conduct provides a judge with cause to suspect his probable involvement in crime.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The majority, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>however, embraces \u201ca rule of law that permits official monitoring of private discourse limited only by the need to locate a willing assistant.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>401 U.S. at 789 (Harlan, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">The warrant requirement, despite protestations to the contrary, is not designed \u201cto protect those who would engage in illegal activity.\u201d <em>People v. Beavers, </em>393 Mich. 554, 566, 227 N.W.2d 511, 515, <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 878 (1975). The interposition of the requirement would not have shielded the criminal activities of the defendants here or in <em>State v. Lester, supra. </em>The \u201cbugged\u201d meetings were arranged beforehand by the police, as electronically aided forays for evidence are likely to be.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">I find the decision that \u201cconsensual monitoring\u201d is not subject to constitutional regulation unacceptable because it does not \u201cgive effect to the intention of the framers and the people [who] adopt[ed]\u201d the crucial language of Article I, \u00a7 7. <em>HGEA v. County of Maui, </em>59 Haw. 65, 80-81, 576 P.2d 1029, 1039 (1978). The ruling \u201cdoes not simply mandate that criminals must daily run the risk of unknown eavesdroppers prying into their private affairs; it subjects each and every law-abiding member of society to that risk.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>401 U.S. at 789 (Harlan, J., dissenting). But knowledge that government must justify its need to engage in electronic eavesdropping would definitely \u201csecure a measure of privacy and a sense of personal security throughout our society\u201d as intended by the framers. <em>Id. </em>at 790 (Harlan, J., dissenting).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b235-8\"> This is confirmed by the history of the 1968 addition to the search and seizure provisions of the Hawaii Constitution as oudined in the dissenting opinion in <em>State v.
