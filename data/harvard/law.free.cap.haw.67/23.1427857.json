The district judge has stated that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>course followed in that proceeding was an extraordinary one brought on by the peculiar circumstances of that particular proceeding. He has taken the position that, in the future, once a witness has testified at a preliminary hearing, normally he will order the production of that witness\u2019 prior statement so that the defendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s cross-examination of the witness can be effective. This is in accord with the law as we have announced it in <em>Toledo v. Lam, </em>67 Haw. 20, 675 P.2d 773 (1984).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AiH\"><em>Peter Van Name </em>Esser,. Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, for petitioner.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AyGO\"><em>Walter G. Chuck </em>for respondent Salz.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AoA\"><em>Mark R. Zenger, </em>Deputy Public Defender, for respondent Siaosi.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Because of the recent amendment to our State Constitution permitting the State to proceed in felony cases by way of preliminary hearing and complaint in the circuit court as an alternative to grand jury indictment, we will not treat the present case as moot. However, what we have said today in <em>Toledo v. Lam, </em>applies equally to this case. The matter of the production of such statements is one for the discretion of the district judge and normally should be exercised in favor of the defendant. Accordingly, the petition for a writ of prohibition is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
