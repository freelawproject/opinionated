(Maui Land). The Circuit Court of the Second Circuit held that the transfer, effected as part of a plan to liquidate Dillingham\u2019s commercial real estate operating assets in Hawaii, \u201cconstitute[d] an assignment\u201d and awarded Maui Land summary judgment in the declaratory action brought against Dillingham and Ala Moana. But we think the court\u2019s summary disposition of the question was improper, inasmuch as the crucial language of Paragraph 15(a) can be read to sustain either the position of the plaintiff or the defendants\u2019 thesis that the paragraph did not apply to the transaction and there was no evidence of its intended meaning. Thus, we vacate the judgment and remand the case for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-11\">The controversy at bar stems from the Plan of Partial Liquidation adopted by Dillingham\u2019s stockholders on June 30, 1981 upon recommendation of the corporation\u2019s Board of Directors. The plan\u2019s purpose was \u201cto terminate . .. [Dillingham\u2019s] commercial real estate development, management, and ownership activities in Hawaii and enable ... [stockholders] to receive substantially all of the net proceeds . . . from the disposition of the assets related to such activities.\u201d One of the properties proposed for liquidation was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>Kaahumanu Shopping Center at Kahului, Maui, which the corporation had constructed on land owned by Maui Land pursuant to a \u201cLease\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> executed on August 31, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">The partial liquidation plan outlined by the Board of Directors involved the initial transfer by the corporation of the properties designated for liquidation to Ala Moana, a limited partnership expressly created to facilitate the process, and the distribution to stockholders of depository receipts evidencing ownership of partnership units equal to the number of shares of common stock they owned. The plan contemplated a subsequent disposition of the properties by Ala Moana and an eventual prorata distribution of the net proceeds among Dillingham\u2019s stockholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">Although it conveyed the \u201cLease\u201d and all of its \u201cestate right, title, and interest in the demised premises, and in all improvements thereon, and in all subleases of portions of the property\u201d to Ala Moana by a document entitled \u201cAssignment of Lease,\u201d Dillingham did not seek Maui Land\u2019s consent thereto. It did not consider the transaction an assignment of the \u201cleasehold interest or any interest therein ... to an institutional lender or any other purchaser\u201d for which consent was required under Paragraph 15(a) of the \u201cLease.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>But the liquidation plan, which received extensive media coverage, did not escape Maui Land\u2019s attention. It promptly apprised Dillingham by letter of the necessity for the lessor\u2019s consent to the transfer of the lease from the corporation to the limited partnership and assured Dillingham that the necessary consent would not be withheld. The communication also carried a suggestion that a subsequent assignment of the lease would not be viewed as favorably.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Dillingham responded by reiterating its belief that \u201ca transfer without consideration to a limited partnership formed to assist in the partial liquidation of some of... [its] assets\u201d did not \u201cfall within the coverage of either paragraph 15(a) or paragraph 15(b) of the lease.\u201d Undaunted by the negative response, the lessor nevertheless recorded its unsolicited and unwanted consent to the transaction in a letter to the lessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Maui Land followed through with an action in the circuit court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. It sought a declaration that the transaction in question \u201cwas an assignment of the Kaahumanu Leasehold Estate within the scope of\u2019 Paragraph 15(a) and an \u201cinjunction that prohibits. . . [Ala Moana] from making any further assignment . .. without first obtaining plaintiffs prior consent, as provided by\u201d Paragraph 15(b).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>After the submission of responsive pleadings by the defendants, Ala Moana, alleging the absence of genuine issues as to any material fact, moved for partial summary judgment. It prayed for the entry of a judgment that consent to the transfer of the lease from Dillingham to Ala Moana was unnecessary, arguing that the pertinent lease provision unambiguously declared consent was required only for an assignment to an \u201cinstitutional lender\u201d or a \u201cpurchaser\u201d and Ala Moana fit \u201cneither of these categories.\u201d Maui Land countered with a Motion For Preliminary Injunction, seeking to enjoin a reported sale of the leased premises. It averred an agreement for the sale of the shopping center by Ala Moana had been reached but Dillingham had not requested the lessor\u2019s \u201cconsent to the assignment of the Kaahumanu Shopping Center Lease\u201d to Ala Moana; it claimed irreparable damage would ensue from a sale of the center during the pendency of the action.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Dillingham submitted its motion for summary adjudication after the foregoing plea for temporary injunctive relief. And Maui Land also moved thereafter for summary judgment, claiming entitlement to judgment because Ala Moana \u201cwas a \u2018purchaser\u2019 of the Kaahumanu Shopping Center within the customary meaning given that word.\u201d Citing the definitions of \u201cpurchase\u201d in legal dictionaries<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in support of the foregoing proposition, Maui Land asserted the court \u201cmust assume that the attorneys who drafted the Kaahumanu Shopping Center Lease consulted the standard legal dictionaries and thus used the word \u2018purchaser\u2019 in the customary legal dictionary sense.\u201d It further directed the court\u2019s attention to the definition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>\u201cpurchase\u201d and \u201cpurchaser\u201d in the Uniform Commercial Code.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The circuit court after reviewing the memoranda submitted by the parties and hearing oral argument, found that \u201cit was an intent of the parties that.. . [Ala Moana] came [sic] within the definition of \u2018any other purchaser\u2019 \u201d as the term is employed in paragraph 15(a). Summary judgment in favor of Maui Land was entered thereafter, and the appeals of Dillingham and Ala Moana to this court followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">Since the appeals are from an award of summary judgment, our analysis centers on whether there was no genuine issue as to any material fact and whether Maui Land was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) 56(b); <em>see also Hulsman v. Hemmeter Development Corp., </em>65 Haw. 58, 61, 647 P.2d 713, 716 (1982); <em>Silver v. George, </em>64 Haw. 503, 507, 644 P.2d 955, 958 (1982); <em>Lau v. Bautista, </em>61 Haw. 144, 146-47, 598 P.2d 161, 163 (1979). The parties agree there was no issue of material fact to be determined by the court below. But of course, the purported agreement ends there.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">Dillingham and Ala Moana would have us reverse the circuit court on grounds that there was no \u201cassignment\u201d within the purview of paragraph 15(a) because the \u201cplain and ordinary\u201d meaning of the word \u201cpurchaser\u201d is \u201cone who acquires either real or personal property by buying it for a price in money\u201d and Ala Moana \u201cdid not \u2018buy\u2019 the Kaahumanu leasehold interest for money.\u201d \u201cObviously,\u201d they say, \u201cthe parties to the Kaahumanu lease were thinking of the ordinary meaning of the term\u201d when the lease was executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-10\">Relying on dictionary definitions and the Uniform Commercial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Code as it did below, Maui Land urges an affirmance of the judgment because Ala Moana was \u201ca \u2018purchaser\u2019 of the Kaahumanu Shopping Center within the customary meaning of that word.\u201d The \u201cknowledgable attorneys who drafted the Lease, and sophisticated persons who negotiated the Lease terms\u201d could not, it claims, have been \u201cignorant of the common meaning of the word \u2018purchase.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AE\">Thus, the issue in the view of the litigants boils down to whether the appellants\u2019 \u201cplain and ordinary\u201d meaning or the appellee\u2019s \u201ccustomary and common\u201d meanings should be applied. Yet we are not directed to proof in the record manifesting that the persons who bargained for and set down the conditions of the lease actually had one or the other in mind when their tasks were done.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">We would be inclined to adopt Maui Land\u2019s thesis that Ala Moana\u2019s acquisition of the lease by means other than descent rendered it a \u201cpurchaser\u201d if we could say the lease in question is primarily a conveyance. But the document before us \u201cis both a conveyance and a contract.\u201d C. Moynihan, <em>Introduction to the Law of Real Property </em>69 (1962). Like the typical modern lease, it \u201cis a highly complex instrument in which the contract element is a substantial, if not the predominant ingredient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 70; <em>cf. Lau v. Bautista, </em>61 Haw. at 149, 598 P.2d at 165 (A lease is \u201cessentially a contractual <em>relationship.\u201d); Lemle v. Breeden, </em>51 Haw. 426, 433, 462 P.2d 470, 474 (1969) (A lease is, \u201cmore importantly, a contractual relationship.\u201d). Hence, we think it more appropriate to seek guidance from pertinent precepts of contract law.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">When called upon recently to lend meaning to an insurance policy, we noted \u201c[\u00a1Insurance policies are subject to the general rules of contract construction\u201d and said \u201cthe terms of the.policy should be interpreted according to their plain, ordinary, and accepted sense in common speech unless it appears . . . [therefrom] that a different meaning is intended.\u201d <em>First Insurance Co. v. State, </em>66 Haw. 413, 424, 665 P.2d 648, 655 (1983). Though a reading of \u201cpurchase\u201d and \u201cpurchaser\u201d consistent with their ordinary and accepted meaning in common speech may favor Dillingham and Ala Moana, we cannot see our way clear to rule they are entitled to judgment. For when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts are viewed in the light most favorable to Maui Land, as they must, we cannot say there is no genuine issue as to a material fact and Dillingham and Ala Moana are deserving of judgment as a matter of law, any more than Maui Land is. <em>See Technicolor, Inc. v. Traeger, </em>57 Haw. 113, 118-19, 551 P.2d 163, 168 (1976); <em>Gum v. Nakamura, </em>57 Haw. 39, 42, 549 P.2d 471, 474 (1976); <em>Abraham v. Onorato Garages, </em>50 Haw. 628, 631, 446 P.2d 821, 825 (1968).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AdC\"><em>JohnJubinsky (Rosemary T.

Crockett (Crockett Nakamura, </em>of counsel) for plaintiff-appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">A key word in paragraph 15(a), \u201cpurchaser,\u201d remains open to more than one reading, and we have no alternative but to conclude the word \u201cis ambiguous and its use requires further inquiry to determine the intention of the parties.\u201d <em>Di Tullio v. Hawaiian Insurance &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>1 Haw. App. 149, 155, 616 P.2d 221, 226 (1980). Moreover, \u201c[a]n agreement should be construed as a whole and its meaning determined from the entire context and not from any particular word, phrase or clause.\u201d <em>Ching v. Hawaiian Restaurants, Ltd., </em>50 Haw. 563, 565, 445 P.2d 370, 372 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">The award of summary judgment to Maui Land is set aside, and the case is remanded to the circuit court for trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b40-8\"> Three distinct terms or periods with different conditions and obligations are set forth in the lease. During the \u201cInitial Term\u201d Dillingham agreed, at its own expense, to \u201cengage in and prosecute all relevant investigations and procedures for the purpose of determining\u201d the feasibility of developing a shopping center. The \u201cSecondary Term\u201d commenced with Dillingham\u2019s election to proceed with the project, and during this term it was obliged, again at its own expense, to \u201cconstruct and complete ... a first class regional shopping center.\u201d During the first two periods Dillingham paid rent in a nominal sum. The \u201cRegular Term\u201d of fifty-five years began with the completion of construction and the occupancy of a substantial portion of the premises by tenants and will extend to the year 2028. During this period Dillingham is obligated to pay fixed sums as \u201cground rent\u201d as well as \u201cpercentage rent\u201d based on the gross rent it receives from tenants. The \u201clease\u201d may be characterized as both a conveyance and a contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b40-9\"> Paragraph 15(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-10\">(a) In addition to the right provided in Paragraph 21 and otherwise herein, at any time during any term of this Lease, Lessee shall have the right to assign its leasehold interest or any interest therein under this Lease to an institutional lender or to any other purchaser, with Lessor\u2019s consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
