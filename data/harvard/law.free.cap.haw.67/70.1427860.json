Appellant claims, and we agree, that there was sufficient evidence presented so as to require the judge to present the issue of sanity to the jury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We also decide that a defense of multiple personality syndrome (MPS) does not per se require a finding of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Defendant was indicted on November 20,1979, on three counts of sodomy in the first degree (HRS \u00a7 707-733(l)(a)(i)) and one count of rape in the first degree (HRS \u00a7 707-730(l)(a)(i)). His victims were all young girls, whom he would lure into secluded areas. He filed a notice of intention to rely on the defense of mental disease, disorder or defect under HRS \u00a7 704-404(1) on March 12, 1980. Defendant had previously been examined by Vadim P. Kondratief, M.D. in California, who referred defendant to Bernauer W. Newton, Ph.D., also in California, both of whom testified for the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">On March 17, 1980, the court pursuant to HRS \u00a7 704-404(2), ordered further mental examination of the defendant to be performed by three court appointed psychiatrists: Drs. Creighton U. Mattoon, Emily Khaw and Gene Altman.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">On October 16, 1980, the defendant filed a motion for judgment of acquittal. Hearings on that motion and a motion for closure of the hearings were held intermittently beginning December 1, 1980. On December 2, the court consolidated the hearing on the motion for acquittal with a motion for determination of fitness to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">On January 9, 1981, the judge found defendant unable to assist i\u00f1 his defense, and pursuant to HRS \u00a7 704-406 suspended the proceedings, deferring the matter of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">For the next year and a half, State psychiatrist Dr. Morgan treated defendant at Hawaii State Hospital in Kaneohe, and on June 25, 1982, the defendant was brought back into court. The defendant was presented as fit to proceed, so the court renewed hearings on the motion for the judgment of acquittal. On August 27, 1982, the judge granted the motion, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"Adv\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-3\">In every criminal case there exists a presumption that a defendant is sane. This presumption can be overcome by evidence to the contrary, and then the State has the burden of proving a defendant\u2019s sanity beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Valentine, </em>1 Haw. App. 1, 612 P.2d 117 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">The defendant in the case at hand introduced testimony from five psychiatrists to rebut the presumption of sanity. There was no contention that this was not sufficient to rebut the presumption. Accordingly, the burden of proof shifted to the State to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that appellant was sane at the time of the offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">The testimony introduced by the defense addressed the fact that under HRS \u00a7 704-408, a defendant will be relieved of criminal responsibility if at the time of the alleged conduct the defendant suffered from a mental disease, disorder, or defect which substantially impaired his capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. In support of his motion for acquittal, the defendant raised the defense that at the time of the offense he was suffering from multiple personality syndrome, which should exclude his responsibility for his actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Multiple personality syndrome (MPS) is a disorder where there are within one individual, two or more distinct personalities, each of which is dominant at a particular time. Each individual personality is complex and integrated with its own behavior pattern and the personality that is dominant at any particular time determines the individual\u2019s behavior. Often there is amnesia on the part of one personality for the existence of the other.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">The defense of MPS was raised in connection with HRS \u00a7 704-408 because one personality often cannot control the actions of another personality. This disorder is extremely rare, and has recently come to the attention of several courts. The trend in these courts is toward examining the sanity of each personality presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>in an individual, or at least the personality which allegedly committed the offense.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-5\">The law adjudges criminal liability of the person according to the person\u2019s state of mind at the time of the act; we will not begin to parcel criminal accountability out among the various inhabitants of the mind.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-6\"><em>Kirkland v. State, </em>166 Ga. App. 478, 304 S.E.2d 561, 564 (1983). Recent cases dealing with the multiple personality defense have held that it is immaterial whether the defendant was in one state of consciousness or another, so long as in the personality then controlling the behavior, the defendant was conscious and his or her actions were a product of his or her own volition. <em>State v. Darnall, </em>47 Or. App. 161, 614 P.2d 120 (1980); <em>State v. Grimsley, </em>3 Ohio App. 3d 265, 444 N.E.2d 1071 (1982); and <em>Kirkland, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">The cases dealing with MPS can be examined in a similar fashion as other defenses of insanity. If a lunatic has lucid intervals of understanding he shall answer for what he does in those intervals as if he had no deficiency. The law governs criminal accountability where at the time of the wrongful act the person had the mental capacity to distinguish between right and wrong or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. Since each personality may or may not be criminally responsible for its acts, each one must be examined under the American Law Institute (ALI)-Model Penal Code (MPC) competency test. <em>See State v. Nuetzel, </em>61 Haw. 531, 606 P.2d 920 (1980); and <em>Kirkland, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">Before we examine the testimony relating to the competency of the alleged personalities of the defendant elicited from the psychiatrists, we must address defendant\u2019s claim that the court erred in not striking the testimony of one of the psychiatrists, Dr. Khaw.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">Generally, in determining whether the conclusions or opinions of an expert witness are admissible, the court must exercise a large measure of discretion with which an appellate court is reluctant to interfere unless that discretion has been manifestly abused to the prejudice of the complaining party. <em>State v. Torres, </em>60 Haw. 271, 589 P.2d 83 (1978); 31 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Expert and Opinion Evidence </em>\u00a7 3. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>The determination of qualification is in the first instance for the court, and is discretionary. But qualifications also go to weight, and Hawaii Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 702.1, expressly provides for cross-examination on this subject. <em>See, State v. Okura, </em>56 Haw. 455, 541 P.2d 9 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The standard of review therefore, is whether the court abused its discretion in failing to strike the testimony. Defendant argues, and we agree, that the qualifications and methodology of the doctor had been seriously called into question, and we also agree that the trial court gave little, if any weight to Dr. Khaw\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5H\">Court: I\u2019ll find her qualified as a psychiatrist, and in that capacity, with expertise to render diagnosis and treatment of people who may or may not be affected with a mendal [sic] disorder, which includes multiple personality. But it\u2019s always for the trier of fact to weigh and evaluate the opinion of any expert, and the trier of fact may accept or reject it. So the question is again to the weight and effect for trier of fact to give to the testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AuO\">Tr. 1/6/81 at 49. But we disagree with defendant\u2019s contention that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqA\">[h]ad Defendant\u2019s motion (to strike Dr. Khaw\u2019s testimony) been granted, the court below would have been entirely without any evidence or inferences required to be drawn therefrom pursuant to <em>State v. Freitas, supra, </em>and <em>State v. Summers, supra, </em>other than the exensive [sic] evidence of insanity and lack of penal responsibility adduced by Defendant. On that state of the record, the judgment of acquittal below would have been compelled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">Defendant\u2019s Answering Brief at 30. Defendant has failed to show a clear abuse of discretion or any resulting prejudice from the introduction of the testimony, because as will be noted below, the question of acquittal was one for the jury or trier of fact, who could have given Dr. Khaw\u2019s testimony the weight it deserved. There was also other evidence elicited from the other psychiatrists which could support an inference that defendant was sane.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">An examination of the testimony of the psychiatrists reveals that few of the experts agreed as to any of their opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-11\">Dr. Kondratief, the first to examine the defendant, had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>treated nor diagnosed anyone who had MPS, and had only seen two or three cases of MPS. Before he referred the defendant to Dr. Newton, he had formed a diagnosis that the defendant was suffering from fugue, temporary amnesia or MPS. After discussing the matter with Dr. Newton, he formed a final diagnosis of MPS. His opinion was that defendant as a whole lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct and also lacked substantial capacity to control his conduct to the requirements of the law. He testified that personality A had no control or knowledge of personality B. He also testified that B was not capable of understanding the proceedings against him, but never expressed his opinions as to whether A or B could control their actions or appreciate the wrongfulness of their conduct as separate personalities.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Dr. Newton treated the defendant through hypnosis, and prepared tapes of his sessions which allegedly showed defendant\u2019s several personalities. He had diagnosed seventeen cases of MPS and had treated eleven patients for MPS, and stated that the defendant as a whole was capable of appreciating the wrongfulness of his<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> conduct, but was not capable of conforming his conduct to the requirements of the law. He stated that personality A understood the charges against him and could conform his behavior to the requirements of the law. He testified that defendant was in the B state when he committed the acts, and that B could appreciate the wrongfulness of his acts but could not conform his behavior to the requirements of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Dr. Altman, one of the court appointed psychiatrists, had never treated or diagnosed any cases of MPS. After viewing a summary tape prepared by Dr. Newton, and discussing the case with Dr. Newton, he came to his diagnosis that defendant suffered from MPS. He stated that personality B had committed the offenses, that B knew that what he was doing was wrong, and that B had some degree of volitional control over his actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">Dr. Khaw, another court appointed psychiatrist, had never treated nor diagnosed nor even seen a case of MPS. After viewing the summary tape prepared by Dr. Newton, she still claimed to never have seen a case of MPS. Her diagnosis was that defendant\u2019s mental condition was sexual perversion, pedophilia. She stated that defendant knew what was wrong and could conform his behavior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>to the requirements of the law, although it was difficult for him to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Dr. Mattoon, the last of the court appointed psychiatrists, testified that he had never diagnosed, treated, nor seen anyone with MPS. He diagnosed defendant as having MPS after talking with Dr. Newton for four hours in the court halls before testifying. He stated that both A and B could understand that the acts were wrong, but that it did not matter to B. He testified that A could control himself to the requirements of the law, as could B, and that it was B who performed the acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Finally Dr. Morgan, who had treated six cases of MPS, stated that he wasn\u2019t sure that the defendant had MPS until after he began treating him. (Dr. Morgan had testified earlier that defendant had MPS, but after treating the defendant he testified that during his earlier testimony he actually was unsure of whether defendant had MPS.) After treating him for approximately six hundred hours, Dr. Morgan came to the conclusion that defendant had in fact three personalities: personality A, named Pod, was defendant\u2019s normal waking state; personality B, named David, emerged at age sixteen and was the mediating personality between Rod and the final personality; the last personality\u2019s name was Lucifer, who emerged at age three, and who had taken over at the times of the offenses. Dr. Morgan testified that the defendant as a whole lacked the capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct and to conform his behavior to the requirements of the law. He testified that A and B knew that the acts were wrong but that C did not care whether they were right or wrong and that A and B had the capacity to conform their conduct to the requirements of the law but C did not care about his conduct or the consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">A summary of the testimony of all the psychiatrists reveals that: defendant had anywhere from one to three personalities; A could appreciate the wrongfulness of his acts and conform his behavior to the requirement of the law, but could not control B; B could understand the wrongfulness of his conduct but could or could not (depending on whose testimony was more persuasive) control his behavior to the requirements of the law; and C did not care whether what he did was right or wrong or about the consequences of his conduct. Dr. Khaw, theorizing there was one personality, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>testified A committed the acts; four doctors theorizing there were two personalities, testified B committed the acts; and Dr. Morgan testified that C executed the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">In light of the above testimony, we find merit to the appellant\u2019s claim that the judge erred in granting the acquittal without giving the matter to the jury. The standard of review on appeal is that it is a jury question unless a reasonably minded jury viewing the facts and inferences in a light most favorable to the prosecution would necessarily possess a reasonable doubt as to defendant\u2019s sanity. <em>State v. Nuetzel, </em>61 Haw. 531, 606 P.2d 920 (1980). <em>State v. Freitas, </em>62 Haw. 17, 608 P.2d 408 (1980), held that where the evidence is such that a jury might fairly have or not have a reasonable doubt as to defendant\u2019s sanity, the issue becomes a question of fact for the jury, and a motion for judgment of acquittal will be denied. The testimony in this matter is disjointed and:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-7\">[w]hat psychiatrists may consider a mental disease or defect for medical purposes where clinical treatment is the main concern may not be the same as mental disease or defect for the jury\u2019s purpose where an accused\u2019s criminal responsibility is at issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AY5\"><em>State v. Nuetzel, </em>61 Haw. at 543, 606 P.2d at 928. The expert may testify as to mental states, but they are not competent to render an opinion as to the impact of the mental state on legal accountability. This is a question for the jury where, as here, there are divers opinions as to which personality performed the acts and whether that personality was sane or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">The purpose of expert testimony is to assist the trier of fact on matters not of common knowledge, where the witnesses have knowledge, training and experience enabling them to form a better opinion on a given state of facts than that formed by those not so well equipped. 31 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Expert Opinion and Testimony </em>\u00a7 16. The jury is entitled to know the facts on which an expert bases his opinion in order to make its own assessment of the expert\u2019s opinion and the reliability of the diagnostic and analytical process employed. <em>State v. Summers, </em>62 Haw. 325, 614 P.2d 925 (1980).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-9\">It is well settled that we are not bound by expert testimony as to the sanity or mental state of an accused, even where it is undis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>puted, but the fact finder may reject it out of hand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-6\"><em>Kirkland, supra, </em>at 565; see <em>also, Bachran v. Morishige, 52 </em>Haw. 61, 469 P.2d 808 (1970). Since the jury may reject an expert\u2019s testimony, it would appear axiomatic that they could reject part of the testimony of an expert. Thus they could accept one psychiatrist\u2019s testimony as to whether a defendant could appreciate the wrongfulness of his actions, and accept another psychiatrist\u2019s testimony regarding the capability of the defendant to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. They could therefore arrive at a conclusion conjectured by no one expert alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">It also appears in this case, that the trial judge improperly weighed the testimony of the doctors, and acted as a trier of fact rather than a judge on the motion for acquittal.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-9\">The Court: The only question that the Court had in that regard was Dr. Khaw\u2019s testimony. But in review of her testimony, giving full weight and effect to her testimony, the Court placed some emphasis on her testimony to the effect that she believed that it was very, very hard for the defendant to control his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law. She used phrases such as \u201cvery, very hard.\u201d \u201cI think he can.\u201d \u201cDifficult.\u201d And, when the Court weighs that testimony along with the testimony of Dr. Newton and the other doctors who have testified, the Court has reached the conclusion that necessarily a judgment of acquittal is required in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">Tr. 8/27/82 at 60-61.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-12\">The Court: The impact, the effect of the weight of the testimony is for the trier of facts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-13\">The Court: I can weigh it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-14\">Tr. 12/16/80 at 54. The weighing of testimony is reserved for the jury or trier of fact unless no reasonable juror could disagree as to an outcome. <em>State v. Summers, supra. </em>The sanity issue before this court and the role of the jury was discussed in <em>Nuetzel.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-15\">The jury, as the trier of facts, remains the sole sentinel in the protection of both the rights of the accused and the welfare of society, enabled finally to consider all relevant facts pertaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>to the defendant\u2019s state of mind at the time the act was committed, and being thereby better qualified to render its ultimate moral judgment under the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-5\"><em>State v. Nuetzel, </em>61 Haw. at 543, 606 P.2d at 928. The judge acted improperly in granting the motion for acquittal in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">We hold therefore, that the question of defendant\u2019s sanity at the time of the offense and the corresponding question of which personality was present at the time of the offense were questions properly for the jury or the trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">While defense counsel at oral argument conceded that this court probably had jurisdiction under HRS \u00a7 641-13(2) to hear this case because no jury had been impanelled, we feel it necessary to discuss the issue of double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">Under HRS \u00a7 641-13(2), an appeal may be taken by and on behalf of the State \u201cfrom an order or judgment, sustaining a special plea in bar, or dismissing a criminal case where the defendant has not been put in jeopardy.\u201d Double jeopardy does not attach unless there is a risk of a determination of guilt. <em>Serfass v. United States, </em>420 U.S. 377, 95 S. Ct. 1055, 43 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1974). In <em>State v. Hagerud, </em>174 Mont. 361, 570 P.2d 1131 (1977), defendant was acquitted by reason of mental defect excluding responsibility in a pretrial evidentiary hearing to determine whether defendant at the time of the offense.charged was so clearly unable to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or conform his conduct to the requirements of the law that trial would be useless. On appeal, the court held that the defendant was never once put in jeopardy as he was never subjected to the possibility of conviction of the crime charged and, thus, to permit the State to obtain review of the district court\u2019s decision acquitting defendant did not put defendant in double jeopardy in violation of his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">Hawaii case law has recognized two inquiries which must be made to determine whether double jeopardy has attached. The first is to determine when jeopardy attaches, and the second is to determine if, on the facts of the case, a retrial is barred by the double jeopardy clause. <em>State v. Miyazaki, </em>64 Haw. 611, 645 P.2d 1340 (1982). Here no jeopardy attached. This was a pretrial motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>to determine whether defendant at the time of the offense charged was unable to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to control his conduct to the requirements of the law. There was no possibility of a conviction, and thus a trial is not barred by the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Am_\"><em>Arthur E. Ross (Ernest J.

Thereupon, the proceedings against him were suspended, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>and the circuit court appointed two psychiatrists and a psychologist to examine the defendant. Although the three examiners initially found the defendant\u2019s capacity to understand the proceedings and assist in his own defense as well as his capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law were unimpaired, two of them subsequently submitted amended reports indicating the presence of an impairing mental disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Relying on these reports, the defendant asserted he could not be held responsible for the criminal acts charged and moved the court for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to HRS \u00a7 704-408.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the hearing on the motion, testimony supporting the claim of insanity was adduced from the members of the court-appointed panel of examiners who earlier found substantial impairment in defendant\u2019s capacity to appreciate the criminal nature of his conduct and from several other psychiatrists and psychologists. On the first day of the hearing on the motion to acquit, however, defense counsel also requested a determination of defendant\u2019s \u201ccapacity to understand the proceedings against him or to assist in his own defense.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The hearing on this motion was consolidated with that already in progress, with the understanding that the court\u2019s ruling on defendant\u2019s fitness to proceed would be rendered prior to its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>consideration of the issues related to criminal responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">After hearing the parties out on the question of defendant\u2019s fitness for trial, the circuit court decided he was then incompetent to proceed; it further found he posed a substantial danger to others in his mental state. Consequently, proceedings were suspended, and defendant was committed to the custody of the State Director of Health \u201cfor detention, care, and treatment for so long as such unfitness . . .

Jamieson, </em>48 Haw. 247, 256, 397 P.2d 575, 582 (1964); and save in a certain instance not applicable here,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201c[rjulings prejudicial to the State and leading to an acquittal are never reviewed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, despite the defendant\u2019s concession \u201cthat this court probably had jurisdiction under HRS \u00a7 641-13(2) to hear this case,\u201d the pertinent inquiry at the very outset must be whether an appeal lies.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> I would say it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">The statute authorizing appeals by the State in criminal cases confers a right of appeal \u201cin a limited number of enumerated instances,\u201d but \u201cdoes not include in its enumeration a judgment of acquittal.\u201d <em>State v. Shintaku, </em>64 Haw. 307, 310, 640 P.2d 289, 292 (1982). Claiming the appeal is actually from an order sustaining a special plea in bar, the State purports to seek review on the strength of HRS \u00a7 641-13(2) which sanctions an appeal \u201c[f]rom an order or judgment, sustaining a special plea in bar, or dismissing the case where the defendant has not been put in jeopardy.\u201d But \u201c[t]he availability of appellate review sought by the State in a criminal case can be based only on clear statutory authority,\u201d <em>State v. Johnson, </em>50 Haw. 525, 526, 445 P.2d 36, 37 (1968), and \u201c[sjtatutes granting the State the right of appeal in criminal cases must be strictly construed. They are not to be enlarged by construction and cannot be extended beyond their plain terms.\u201d <em>Territory v. Balarosa, </em>34 Haw. 662, 665-66 (1938); <em>see also State v. Shintaku, </em>64 Haw. at 310-11, 640 P.2d at 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">HRS \u00a7 641-13(2) sanctions an appeal from an order sustaining \u201ca special plea in bar.\u201d At common law, such a plea \u201cwas ordinarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>used to raise three defenses <em>\u2014autrefois acquit, autrefois convict, </em>and pardon.\u201d <em>United States v. Sisson, </em>399 U.S. 267, 300 n.53 (1970) (emphasis in original). We have said it \u201cordinarily presents some matter extrinsic of the record which completely bars the proceeding, such ... as a plea of insanity,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> a plea of pardon, or a plea of former acquittal, conviction or jeopardy... .\u201d <em>State v. Johnson, </em>50 Haw. at 526, 445 P.2d at 37, quoting <em>Territory v. Anderson, </em>25 Haw. 55, 58 (1919). But as the Supreme Court points out, \u201cthere is no warrant for its use to single out for determination in advance of trial matters of defense either on questions of law or fact.\u201d <em>United States v. Murdock, </em>284 U.S. 141, 151 (1931). <em>Cf. United States v. Sisson, </em>399 U.S. at 301 (\u201ca mo tion in bar cannot be granted on the basis of facts that would necessarily be tried with the general issue in the case.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">What was presented in support of the motion to acquit was hardly \u201csome matter extrinsic of the record.\u201d What the court heard and evaluated was evidence of defendant\u2019s mental impairment that covered \u201cmatters of defense ... on questions of law or fact.\u201d \u201cCompelled as we are to strictly construe HRS \u00a7 641-13,\u201d <em>State v. Shintaku, </em>64 Haw. at 310-11, 640 P.2d at 292, there is no warrant for reading \u201ca special plea in bar\u201d expansively to cover a motion for acquittal premised on a mental disorder sufficient to exclude criminal responsibility. Though the majority finds no cause to address the obvious discrepancy between a plea in bar and a motion to acquit, the significant difference between the two divests this court of jurisdiction to consider the State\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">Proceeding with the appeal, nonetheless, the majority finds the defendant has yet to be put in jeopardy, and concludes a reversal of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>the circuit court and a remand of the case for a redetermination of criminal responsibility would not run afoul of constitutional commands. The record, however, cannot sustain the finding, and a rerun of the hearing on mental impairment would transgress the cardinal rules of double jeopardy jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">\u201cJeopardy denotes risk. In the constitutional sense, jeopardy describes the risk that is traditionally associated with criminal prosecution.\u201d Breed <em>v. Jones, </em>421 U.S. 519, 528 (1975). The majority accepts the State\u2019s thesis that the defendant has not been in jeopardy even though he moved for acquittal on a ground that he was deranged when the criminal acts were committed and evidence in support of and in opposition to the motion was adduced. It assumes the \u201cpre-trial motion\u201d did not expose the defendant to a risk of conviction since the circuit court was not empowered to enter a judgment of conviction pursuant to HRS \u00a7 704-408.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Yet in fact, the defendant was in jeopardy when he sought acquittal and brought forth evidence on an essential element of the crimes charged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">\u201cImplicit in a motion for judgment of acquittal by reason of mental irresponsibility is the admission that the defendant committed the offense charged.\u201d <em>State v. Lee, </em>61 Haw. 313, 314, 602 P.2d 944, 946 (1979). Here, what may have been implicit was rendered explicit by evidence submitted in support of the plea for acquittal. The testimony and the opinions of the psychiatrists and psychologists who examined the defendant were grounded in part on accounts furnished by him of the events leading to the prosecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>tion. The videotaped interviews, tapes of which were made available to the State, undeniably implicated the defendant in the offenses charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">His involvement is undeniable because the parties agreed, with court approval before the defendant submitted a plea for acquittal, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-7\">in the event the case proceeds to trial on the merits and the Defendant takes the stand and directly contradicts, in the defense case in chief, statements made by him during any of the audio cassette or video cassette interviews, the prosecution may introduce said portions of the audio-video cassette interviews for the purpose of seeking to impeach the Defendant\u2019s testimony .. . [and] if the Defendant takes the stand and if relevant, the Prosecution may cross examine the Defendant relative to any statements made by him during any audio or video interviews and that if relevant the Prosecution may introduce those portions of the audio or video interviews in rebuttal for the purpose of contradicting or impeaching him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">Thus, the die was cast when the claim of irresponsibility was advanced. The defendant committed himself thereby to pursue the defense of insanity to judgment, for he could not hope thereafter to controvert testimony that he had engaged in the proscribed conduct.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Realistically, he ran a substantial risk of conviction by moving for an early determination of part of the general issue in the case and proceeding to a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">Built as it is on a misreading of \u201ca special plea in bar\u201d and an infirm factual foundation, the court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant would not be twice put in jeopardy by a second adjudication of an issue once adjudicated in his favor cannot be reconciled with prescribed constitutional standards in the area of concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-11\">Our concern here is with a judgment of acquittal and further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>jeopardy. \u201cPerhaps the most fundamental rule in the history of double jeopardy jurisprudence has been that \u2018[a] verdict of acquittal .. . could not be reviewed, on error or otherwise, without putting [a defendant] twice in jeopardy and thereby violating the Constitution.\u2019 <em>United States v. Ball, </em>163 U.S. 662, 671 (1896).\u201d <em>United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., </em>430 U.S. at 571. \u201c[T]he law attaches particular significance to an acquittal. To permit a second trial after an acquittal, however mistaken the acquittal may have been, would present an unacceptably high risk that the Government, with its vastly superior resources, might wear down the defendant so that \u2018even though innocent he may be found guilty.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>437 U.S. 82, 91 (1978) (quoting <em>Green v. United States, </em>355 U.S. 184, 188 (1957)).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">But it is not only a verdict of acquittal returned by a jury that triggers the protection against the potential risk associated with further prosecution. A directed verdict of acquittal suffices in this regard, <em>Fong Foo v. United States, </em>369 U.S. 141, 143 (1962), and so does \u201ca judge\u2019s acquittal after the jury disagrees and is discharged.\u201d <em>United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., </em>430 U.S. at 574. And the governing principle formulated by the Supreme Court is: \u201cA judgment of acquittal, whether based on a jury verdict of not guilty or on a ruling by the court that the evidence is insufficient to convict, may not be appealed and terminates the prosecution when a second trial would be necessitated by a reversal.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>437 U.S. at 91 (footnote omitted).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Although a direct acquittal on a motion submitted before actual trial has not been discussed in the relevant case law, the Court has made it clear that the substance of the judge\u2019s action determines whether the acquittal would terminate the prosecution. The determinative question, the Court said, is \u201cwhether the ruling of the judge, whatever its label, actually represents a resolution, correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged.\u201d <em>United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., </em>430 U.S. at 571. Viewing what transpired below in the light of the Supreme Court\u2019s teach<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>ings, I would declare there was an acquittal that rules out further prosecution of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">The defendant was accused of crimes for which a culpable state of mind is a necessary element. He sought a ruling from the circuit court on whether insanity prevented him from forming the required intent. The applicable statute, HRS \u00a7 704-408 as it read before its amendment in 1980, vested the court with full authority to directly acquit him if \u201csatisfied\u201d after a hearing that his mental impairment was sufficient to exclude responsibility,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and the court did so. In effect, it weighed the evidence adduced by the parties and arrived at a decision that the State had failed to submit enough evidence \u201cto rebut. . . [the] defendant\u2019s essentially factual defense of insanity.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, 437 </em>U.S. at 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>The circuit court, notwithstanding the majority\u2019s conclusion that the court was without power to do so, had clear authority to enter the judgment of acquittal. <em>See </em>note 13 <em>supra. </em>That the acquittal may have resulted from an erroneous application of controlling legal principles as the majority holds, may affect \u201cthe accuracy of that determination, but .. . does not alter its essential character.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>437 U.S. at 98. It still \u201crepresents a resolution [in the defendant\u2019s favor], correct or not, of some ... of the factual elements of the offense[s] charged.\u201d <em>United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., </em>430 U.S. at 571.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">\u201cThe notion that the prosecution, having failed to make a sufficient case against . . . [the] accused, should be given a second opportunity to do better seems fundamentally inconsistent with the Double Jeopardy Clause.\u201d 2 C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: <em>Criminal 2d </em>\u00a7 470, at 677-78 (1982) (footnote omitted). I would dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b115-6\"> Prior to its amendment in 1980, HRS \u00a7 704-408 read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-7\">Determination of irresponsibility.

A hearing thereon would not be to determine responsibility for the charged offense; it would only cover the defendant\u2019s fitness to stand trial. A determination of unfitness in this regard would constitute a <em>bar </em>to proceedings, since \u201c[i]t has long been accepted that a person whose mental condition is such that he lacks the capacity to understand the nature and object of the proceedings against him, to consult with counsel, and to assist in preparing his defense may not be subjected to a trial.\u201d Drope v.

A judgment of acquittal, of course, would not be deemed an infringement of this right. For while a \u201ctrial judge is ... barred from attempting to override or interfere with the jurors\u2019 independent judgment in a manner contrary to the interests of the accused,\u201d this \u201climitation on the role of a trial judge ... has never inhibited his ruling in favor of a criminal defendant.\u201d United States v.

For a reversal there would result in a reinstatement of the verdict, not a retrial. <em>See </em>United States v. Wilson, 420 U.S. 332, 344-45 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b122-8\"> The applicable statute on its face empowered the court to directly acquit the defendant if \u201csatisfied\u201d his mental impairment was \u201csufficient to exclude responsibility.\u201d <em>See </em>note 2 <em>supra. </em>This more than implies the court was to weigh the evidence and rule on a factual element of the offenses. Any doubts on this score are laid to rest by the Penal Code Commentary on HRS \u00a7 704-408; it read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-9\">This section provides for the direct qualified acquittal of the defendant when the report filed pursuant to \u00a7 704-404 satisfies the court that at the time of the conduct alleged the defendant suffered from a physical or mental disease, disorder, or defect which precluded responsibility. A hearing shall be had on the issue of the defendant\u2019s responsibility if it is requested by either party or the court. If the court is satisfied on the basis of the report or the hearing or both that the defendant should not be held responsible for the conduct alleged, it shall, upon motion by the defendant, acquit the defendant. Thus, a trial in such cases will be avoided. If the defendant maintains that he did not engage in the conduct alleged, or has a defense in addition to that excluding responsibility, he can, of course, withhold the motion and the case will proceed to trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-10\">The section changes the prior law in that it <em>vests the power of direct acquittal in the court </em>and does not make it dependent on prosecutorial discretion. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-11\">That HRS \u00a7 704-408 prior to its amendment was to be interpreted in the foregoing manner was reaffirmed when the section was amended. <em>See </em>Sen.
