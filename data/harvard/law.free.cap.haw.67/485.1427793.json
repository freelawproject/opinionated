Komatsu, an employee of the City and County of Honolulu, to become permanently incapacitated for duty and concluded he should be awarded service-connected disability retirement benefits pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 88-79(a) (1976). Purporting to be bound by the holding in <em>Lopez v. Board of Trustees, Employees\u2019 Retirement System, </em>66 Haw. 127, 657 P.2d 1040 (1983), where we interpreted the language of HRS \u00a7 88-77(a), the Intermediate Court of Appeals reversed the circuit court. <em>Komatsu v. Board of Trustees, Employees\u2019 Retirement System, </em>5 Haw. App. 279, 687 P.2d 1340 (1984). Certiorari was granted because it appeared <em>Lopez </em>had been applied in a manner departing substantially from our intendment. A review of the record confirms our initial impression; thus, we vacate the decision of the Intermediate Court of Appeals and reinstate the order of the circuit court awarding retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-12\">Ralph Y. Komatsu was employed as the executive assistant to the City and County Physician from 1969 to October 16, 1981, when his employment was terminated by the City. During the early years of this tenure, the principal situs of his work was an office located at the Maluhia Hospital. But from 1974 until 1979, when he stopped working, he occupied an office in the Pawaa Annex, a municipal office building housing the police and traffic departments and the administrative offices of the Department of Health. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>He encountered no serious respiratory problems while his office was at the Maluhia Hospital, though he admittedly experienced occasional \u201cnasal stuffiness\u201d and frontal headaches.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Several years after moving to the Pawaa Annex, Komatsu was beset with severe respiratory disorders and became incapacitated for work. In his application for disability retirement submitted on March 25, 1980, Komatsu claimed he was permanently incapacitated for further performance of duty and the disability was the natural and proximate result of a \u201cbronchial attack\u201d he suffered at home on April 21, 1977.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He attributed the attack to his work environment, particularly to an improperly functioning air conditioning system. The onset of his respiratory problems, however, is dated at least a year earlier in several medical reports subsequently submitted to substantiate the claim for retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Upon receipt of Komatsu\u2019s application, the State Employees\u2019 Retirement System solicited the customary \u201cEmployer\u2019s Statement Concerning Service-Connected Disability\u201d from the Department of Health. The department acknowledged the episode of April 21, 197.7 had been reported, albeit tardily; it agreed the applicant was disabled for duty as a consequence of the accident and the disability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>was not a result of his willful negligence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But it denied he was actually engaged in the performance of duty when the accident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Thereafter, Komatsu was examined by two physicians at the Retirement System\u2019s behest. Each ascribed his medical problem to asthmatic bronchitis. One further characterized Komatsu\u2019s ailment as \u201cprobable \u2018air conditioning lung\u2019 the other furnished this additional comment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-7\">The obstructive defect is most probably caused by his work environment as adequately demonstrated by the fungal cultures, skin testing, and inhalational challenge. This obstructive defect most probably will be permanent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">Since HRS \u00a7 88-79(a)(4) makes certification of the applicant\u2019s incapacity for the further performance of duty and the permanent nature of such incapacity by the Retirement System\u2019s Medical Board a prerequisite for service-connected occupational disability retirement, Komatsu was examined by the three-member board. It found he was indeed incapacitated for duty and the disability was probably permanent. In the Medical Board\u2019s opinion, \u201cthe claimant\u2019s ... physical defect of airway obstruction of his pulmonary system [was] the result of being allergic to the air conditioning system environment at his job.\u201d But it found his condition did not arise from the actual performance of work, and recommended a denial of the application by the Board of Trustees of the Employees\u2019 Retirement System.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">The Trustees rejected the application and apprised Komatsu of a right to \u201cappeal\u201d from the Medical Board\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>pealed, averring the Board\u2019s \u201cdecision clearly [mistook] both the law and facts relating to [his] condition\u201d and that he was \u201cpermanently incapacitated for duty as the natural and proximate cumulative result of the environment at his work place.\u201d He further alleged the disability was \u201ca natural and proximate cumulative result of an occupational hazard.\u201d The appeal was referred to a hearing officer who conducted the only full-scale hearing provided by the Retirement System\u2019s procedural rules for a benefit claimant whose claim is contested. <em>See supra </em>note 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">The Hearing Officer\u2019s formulation of the issue before him was: \u201cWhether the appellant\u2019s [Komatsu\u2019s] respiratory dysfunction is the result of an accident or the cumulative result of some occupational hazard.\u201d In his Recommended Decision, he discussed the substantial proof adduced in support of the claim, highlighting the testimony of Dr. Bruce Soil, a pulmonary specialist, and Dr. Benjamin Gordon, as well as the documentary evidence consisting of reports from other physicians versed in pulmonary medicine, internal medicine, and immunology. That the Medical Board\u2019s consultant, Dr. Ernie Yim, who examined Komatsu shortly after the application for retirement was filed, had rendered an opinion supporting the claimant\u2019s position was also noted. And the scanty evidence offered in opposition by the chairman of the Medical Board, the sole medical witness called by the Retirement System, was recounted.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">After weighing this evidence, the Hearing Officer outlined his recommended \u201cfindings,\u201d among which were the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-7\">H. That the respiratory trauma Appellant experienced on April 21, 1977 was not the result of an accident occurring while in the actual performance of duty within the meaning of Chapter 88, H.R.S.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>I. That the poor circulation from the air conditioning system of the mold contaminants which caused Appellant\u2019s respiratory dysfunction constituted an occupational hazard within the meaning of Chapter 88, H.R.S.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">And his recommended \u201cconclusions\u201d included one to this effect:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AO9H\">F. That Appellant has established by the preponderance of the evidence a causal connection between his respiratory dysfunction and his office environment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">His final suggestion to the Trustees was that \u201cthe Report of the Medical Board dated December 15,1980 be reversed in that Appellant is incapacitated for further performance of duty and that such incapacity is service-connected under Section 88-79, H.R.S.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">The Board of Trustees, however, chose not to heed this counsel. Instead, it fashioned a decision with findings and conclusions reiterating those in the recommended decision for the most part but departing therefrom in a salient respect. The Board \u201cfound\u201d the \u201cpoor circulation from the air conditioning system of the mold contaminants which caused Appellant\u2019s respiratory dysfunction does not constitute an occupational hazard within the meaning of Chapter 88, HRS,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and \u201cconcluded\u201d Komatsu failed to meet the burden imposed by HRS \u00a7 91-10(5) upon a benefit claimant \u201cto establish that he meets all of the necessary statutory criteria for entitlement to service-connected disability retirement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">Rebuffed in his quest for retirement benefits by the Board of Trustees despite the favorable findings and conclusions recommended by the hearing officer who heard the evidence, Komatsu sought judicial review of the agency determination pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>HRS \u00a7 91-14. The circuit court reviewed the record, considered the memoranda submitted by the parties, and heard argument. Concluding that the pertinent finding and conclusion of the Board were not supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence and therefore clearly erroneous, it held Komatsu\u2019s \u201cworking conditions or employment environment constitute[d] an occupational hazard under HRS \u00a7 88-79\u201d and his \u201cpermanent incapacity [was] service-connected.\u201d The Board was therefore directed to award Komatsu disability retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">But the entry of judgment against the Trustees some three and one-half years after the submission of his application for retirement did not write an end to Komatsu\u2019s pursuit of the benefits provided for occupationally disabled public employees. Further judicial review was sought by the Trustees, and the appeal was assigned to the Intermediate Court of Appeals for decision. The primary issues raised on this appeal were: \u201cWhether Appellant [the Board] correctly interpreted the statutory term \u2018occupational hazard\u2019 as it appears in Hawaii Rev. Stat. \u00a7 88-79\u201d and \u201c[w]hether Appellant\u2019s determination that Appellee is not entitled to an award of service-connected occupational disability retirement benefits under Hawaii Rev. Stat. \u00a7 88-79 is correct.\u201d Briefly, the Trustees\u2019 thesis on the first issue was that the circuit court \u201cerred when it did not follow the <em>Lopez </em>interpretation of the term \u2018occupational hazard.\u2019 \u201d With respect to the second, the Trustees argued the evidence in the record failed to establish a necessary connection between Komatsu\u2019s job and his disability and the circuit court had not accorded their decision the presumptive validity to which it was entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Adverting to the absence of a legislative definition of the term in question, the intermediate court agreed <em>Lopez </em>was controlling. <em>Lopez, </em>it said, \u201cteaches that \u2018occupational hazard\u2019 means, in effect, a hazard peculiar to an occupation which, upon repeated and cumulative exposure to it, will result in a disease causally related to the occupation.\u201d <em>Komatsu v. Board of Trustees, Employees\u2019 Retirement System, </em>5 Haw. App. at 284, 687 P.2d at 1344. It read our ruling there as imposing a requirement of \u201cproof that the incidence of the claimant\u2019s disabling condition ... \u2018is substantially greater in [the claimant\u2019s] occupation than in the general population.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 284, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>687 P.2d at 1345 (quoting <em>McHale v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, </em>56 Pa. Commw. 344, 348, 425 A.2d 34, 36 (1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Presumably guided by these pronouncements in reviewing the evidence presented to the Hearing Officer, the intermediate court decided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-7\">There [was] no substantial evidence proving that (1) office workers in general were subjected to equivalent amounts of mold contaminants or fungi from air conditioning systems as was Komatsu in his office, (2) the average office worker has a tendency to contract asthmatic bronchitis because of mold contaminants or fungi in the air conditioning system, and (3) the incidence of asthmatic bronchitis is substantially greater among office workers than the general population.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 284-85, 687 P.2d at 1345. \u201cAt best,\u201d it said, \u201cthe evidence show[ed] that Komatsu\u2019s employer failed to furnish him with a proper and safe place in which to work, considering his allergic predisposition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 285-86, 687 P.2d at 1345. The evidence in its view, could \u201cnot support a finding or conclusion that asthmatic bronchitis is a \u2018danger or risk which is inherent in, and concomitant to\u2019 the occupation of office workers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the intermediate appellate court ruled Komatsu\u2019s disability was not the cumulative result of an \u201coccupational hazard\u201d within the meaning of HRS \u00a7 88-79(a) and reversed the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">When application for a writ of certiorari was made, we saw reason to grant the petition. There was no dispute about Komatsu\u2019s disability for duty, and the Trustees, as well as the appellate court, apparently had no doubt that there was a connection between his employment and the disabling condition.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Yet disability retirement was not approved. If the criteria for benefit entitlement established by <em>Lopez </em>could be applied to withhold retirement benefits from someone in his plight, we did not contemplate such a consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"AIuM\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">The applicant for retirement in <em>Lopez v. Board of Trustees, Employees\u2019Retirement System, </em>66 Haw. 127, 657 P.2d 1040 (1983), was an industrial safety engineer employed by the State Department of Labor and Industrial Relations whose disabling condition had been diagnosed as \u201cmanic depressive psychosis.\u201d He sought service-connected total disability retirement benefits pursuant to HRS \u00a7 88-77 rather than the occupational disability benefits provided by HRS \u00a7 88-79, which were sought by Komatsu.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Though several physicians who examined Lopez were of an opinion that the stress and pressures he experienced at work contributed to his disability, the Board of Trustees ruled that \u201cdisability caused by work pressures and frustrations did not constitute an accident or an occupational hazard within the meaning of HRS \u00a7 88-77.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 128, 657 P.2d at 1041. The circuit court agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">On appeal to this court, Lopez \u201ccontend[ed], in effect, that any job-related condition which results in incapacitation for gainful employment or further performance of duty is an occupational hazard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 129, 657 P.2d \u00e1t 1042. But we feared that if \u201coccupational hazard\u201d could be read so broadly, the term would be \u201cmeaningless and without operative effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For pressures and frustrations, we knew, were inherent in employment generally, as they are in life generally. Hence, we strove to give useful meaning to \u201coccupational hazard\u201d for disability retirement purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>\u201cAn occupational hazard,\u201d we said, \u201cis a danger or risk which is inherent in, and concomitant to a particular occupation. <em>Cf. Detenbeck v. General Motors Corporation, </em>309 N.Y. 558, 132 N.E.2d 840 (1956).\u201d <em>Id. </em>We added in elucidation, \u201cthe [disability\u2019s] causative factors must be those which are not ordinarily incident to employment in general and must be different in character from those found in the general run of occupations. <em>Fruehauf Corp., Etc. v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation, </em>31 Pa. Commw. Ct. 341, 376 A.2d 277 (1977).\u201d <em>Id. </em>That the inhalation of smoke, toxic gases, chemical fumes, and other toxic vapors by firefighters, police officers, and sewer workers had been statutorily recognized as an \u201coccupational hazard\u201d was also noted. <em>Id. </em>at 130, 657 P.2d at 1042. But since the work pressures and frustrations experienced by Lopez \u201cwere not exceptionally different from those experienced by other employees in other occupations,\u201d we concluded the demands of his job did not constitute an \u201coccupational hazard\u201d for purposes of disability retirement pursuant to HRS \u00a7 88-77. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">Purporting to apply our definition of the relevant term, the Intermediate Court of Appeals concluded Komatsu could not prevail because of a lack of substantial proof that all office workers worked in environments where air-conditioning systems spewed mold contaminants or fungi, the average office worker would have been affected in the same way he was by the unhealthy situation in his office, and the incidence of bronchial asthma was much higher among office workers than in the general population. <em>See Komatsu v. Board of Trustees, Employees\u2019 Retirement System, </em>5 Haw. App. at 284-85, 687 P.2d at 1345.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The requirement of such proof would, of course, rule out service-connected disability retirement for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>Komatsu; and the imposition of similar requisites in other situations would render \u201coccupational hazard\u201d well-nigh meaningless, save for firefighters, police officers, and sewer workers. We neither intended nor envisioned that <em>Lopez </em>would be so inhibitive.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AAr\"><em>Jeffrey S. Portnoy (Milton M. Yasunaga </em>with him on the writ and brief) for Petitioner Komatsu.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Where, as in this case, the employee was exposed to mold or fungi in his particular work environment over a lengthy period and the causal nexus between the exposure and his disability is undisputed,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> entitlement to service-connected disability retirement benefits is clear. For a danger that accompanies a particular job is an \u201coccupational hazard\u201d if it is not a risk common to employment in general. <em>Lopez v. Board of Trustees, Employees\u2019 Retirement System, </em>66 Haw. at 129, 657 P.2d at 1042. And since the peril of noxious organisms emitting from faulty air-conditioning systems is hardly incident to employment generally, we are led to the ineluctable conclusion that the intermediate court erred in holding Komatsu\u2019s disability was not the cumulative result of an \u201coccupational hazard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The decision of the Intermediate Court of Appeals is vacated, and the decision and order of the Circuit Court of the First Circuit is reinstated.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b530-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number><em>Harriet Yoshida Lewis, </em>Deputy Attorney General, contra, on the brief for Respondent Board of Trustees.</attorneys>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b521-7\"> Komatsu claimed he was incapacitated for further performance of duty.
