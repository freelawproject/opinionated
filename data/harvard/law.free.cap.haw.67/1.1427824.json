We agree with the result and with the reasoning of the court below and, accordingly, deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">However, in the course of rendering its opinion, the Intermediate Court of Appeals adopted the \u201cright/wrong\u201d standard with respect to review of the circuit court\u2019s decision in affirming an administrative agency determination and expressly rejected the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard in such a situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">Since the circuit court\u2019s affirmance of the action of the Land Use Commission was clearly on the record, supportable under either the right/wrong or clearly erroneous standard, we do not reach the question of what should be the correct standard of review to be applied with an appeal of this nature. Petition denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
