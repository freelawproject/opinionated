C. Outen, for the appellants:</attorneys><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-7\" pgmap=\"355\">The principal question is, whether, under the bond by McClellan for his term as clerk, commencing in December, 1880, there is a liability for fees collected by him as such clerk during previous terms, and remaining in his hands when the bond .sued on was executed. The law of 1881 makes it the duty of such clerk, at the expiration of his term of office, to pay to the county treasurer \u201call costs and fees collected and remaining in his hands,\u201d etc. It does not distinguish between fees and costs collected by him and those received by him from his predecessor, or held by him at the time as successor of himself.</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-8\" pgmap=\"355\">There is no claim on the part of the defense that these fees and costs were not in the hands of the clerk when he entered upon the term for which the bond sued on was given, but they .are, by the pleas, admitted to have been in his hands at that time. If they were, then a liability arises on the bond sued on, as there is no default in duty during the prior terms. Kagay v. Trustees, 68 Ill. 75; Pinkstaff v. People, 59 id. 148; Morley v. Town of Metamora, 78 id. 394; Roper v. Trustees, 91 id. 518; Bruce v. United States, 17 How. 596.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b356-3\" pgmap=\"356\">None of the pleas in question answers the charge of the first breach in the declaration. The fourth and sixth pleas are by their express terms confined to the second breach. The fifth \u25a0plea is not in express terms so confined, but its averments can have no relation to any but the second breach. They make no pretense of an answer to the charge made in the first breach. As the fifth plea, however, is not expressly directed to the second breach, it may be held to be intended as an answer to the whole declaration. If so, it is obnoxious to demurrer, and the demurrer should have been sustained as to. it. People v. McCormack, 68 Ill. 226.</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b356-4\" pgmap=\"356\">If it should be held that the fifth plea was only directed to the second breach, then there was no plea of any kind to thefirst breach, and plaintiff was entitled to judgment thereon, and it was error for the court to enter judgment against the plaintiff for costs.</p><attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b356-5\" pgmap=\"356\">Messrs. Crea &amp; Ewing, Messrs. Johns &amp; Randolph, and Mr. I. A. Buckingham, for the appellees:</attorneys><p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b356-7\" pgmap=\"356\">Before the passage of the act of 1881 the clerk of a circuit court was the sole custodian of the fees of witnesses after reaching his hands. A refusal by him to pay a witness his fees would have made him liable to a suit on his bond. But. we urge that in the absence of any law providing for the taking out of the hands of the clerk of witness\u2019 fees, except by payment to witnesses or their assignees, the clerk became bound to hold the same as against all others.</p><p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b356-8\" pgmap=\"356\">Witnesses had full right to bring suit, if suit should become necessary, against the clerk and his .sureties, at any time, within the statute of limitations applicable to suits on official-bonds. No law of the State existed under which the earnings of witnesses could be wrested from them to become the property of any other person or of the county.</p><p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b356-9\" pgmap=\"356(20) 357(138)\">The act was not intended to have a retrospective operation. We quote from Potter\u2019s Dwarris on Statutes, page 162: \u201cThe American authorities are quite uniform on the retroactive effect of statutes. The general rule is, that no statute, however positive in its terms, is to be construed as designed to interfere with existing contracts, right of action or suits, and especially vested rights, unless the intention that it shall so operate is expressly declared; and courts will apply new statutes only to future cases, unless there is something in the very nature of the case, or in the language of the new provision, which shows that they were intended to have a retroactive operation. And although the words of the statute are broad enough, in their literal extent, to comprehend existing cases, they must yet be construed as applicable only to cases that may thereafter arise, unless a contrary intention is unequivocally expressed therein.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b357-4\" pgmap=\"357\">The fifth section of the act of 1881 provides, that unless witnesses shall claim their fees within five years next after such fees shall have reached the county treasurer\u2019s hands, the right to claim such fees shall be terminated\u2014that is to say, the witness\u2019 money shall be confiscated. No such law was in force before 1881. The right of witnesses to their fees for services rendered, and involved in the case at bar, accrued when no such confiscation law stared them in the face. Such a confiscation law formed no part of the contract under which they rendered the services for which their fees stand as equivalents.</p> <opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b357-5\" pgmap=\"357\">Mr. Justice Craig</author> <p id=\"AZv\" pgmap=\"357\">delivered the opinion of the Court:</p> <p id=\"b357-6\" pgmap=\"357\">It will be observed that the fourth and sixth pleas are interposed as an answer to the second breach of the declaration. They will first be considered.</p> <p id=\"b357-7\" pgmap=\"357(47) 358(36)\">McClellan was elected clerk of the circuit court of Macon county in the fall of 1880. He gave bond as required by law, and entered upon the discharge of his duties on the first Monday of December of that year, and the question raised by the demurrer to the pleas is, whether he was required to pay over witness fees which came into his hands prior to the first Monday of December, 1880, while he held the office under prior elections.</p> <p id=\"b358-5\" pgmap=\"358\">On the 28th day of May, 1881, the legislature passed an act which went into force on the first day of July of that year. Section 1 of the act provides: \u201cThe clerk of any court of record or sheriff of any county of this State shall, at the expiration of his office, \u2019pay to the treasurer of the county in-which his court is held, all costs and fees collected and remaining in his hands, together with a statement of names of persons and amount due to each: Provided, however, that nothing in this section shall apply to any costs and fees of such clerk and sheriff, and belonging to him.\u201d The act contains four other sections, but no one of the sections contains any provision manifesting an intention to give the act a retrospective operation.</p> <p id=\"b358-6\" pgmap=\"358(205) 359(145)\">It is not claimed that this action could have been maintained prior to the passage of the act of 1881, but reliance is placed on the first section of the act to sustain the action. Before the passage of the act the practice had been uniform in this, State for the clerk of the circuit court to receive witness fees and hold them for the party interested until called upon for payment, and it has always been supposed that the clerk and his sureties were liable on the official bond of the clerk, for a failure to pay over fees to the proper party. The legislature had the right, no doubt, to change the practice which had grown up in such cases, and require the clerk to pay such fees into the county treasury; but such a statute could not have a retroactive effect, unless such an intention was plainly expressed in the act. In Potter\u2019s Dwarris on Statutes, (p. 162,) in a note, it is said: \u201cThe American authorities are quite uniform on the retroactive effect of statutes. The general rule is, that no statute, however positive in its terms, is to be construed as designed to interfere with existing contracts, right -of action or suits, and especially vested rights, unless the indention that it shall so operate is expressly declared; and \u2022courts will apply new statutes only to future cases, unless there is something in the very nature of the case, or in the language of the new provision, which shows that they were intended to have a retroactive operation. And although the words of the statute are broad enough, in their literal extent, to comprehend existing eases, they must yet be construed as applicable only to cases that may thereafter arise, unless a contrary intention is unequivocally expressed therein.\u201d (See, also, Thompson v. Alexander, 11 Ill. 54; People v. Thatcher, 95 id. 109.) Here, as said before, the act contains no clause indicating an intent that it should control the action of the \u2022clerk in regard to costs collected by him before its passage.</p> <p id=\"b359-5\" pgmap=\"359\">We think it is plain that the words of the act requiring the \u2022clerk, upon the expiration of the term of his office, to pay the treasurer of the'county all costs and fees collected and remaining in his hands, has reference solely to such costs and fees as might come into his hands after the act went into effect.</p> <p id=\"b359-6\" pgmap=\"359\">We now come to the fifth plea. This plea professes to answer both breaches in the declaration, but it contains nothing which can be regarded as an answer to the first breach. The rule is well settled that a plea which assfimes to answer two or more counts of a declaration, but answers only one, is bad. (1 Chitty, 523; Goodrich v. Reynolds, 31 Ill. 495; People v. McCormack, 68 id. 230.) Here each breach is to be treated as a distinct count, and the plea was manifestly bad in failing to answer that which it assumed to answer.</p> <p id=\"b359-7\" pgmap=\"359\">The judgments of the Appellate and circuit courts will be reversed, and the cause remanded, with directions to the circuit court to sustain the demurrer to the fifth plea.</p> <p id=\"b359-8\" pgmap=\"359\">Judgment reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
