A writ of mandamus to compel the payment of bonds by a town, issued under a law imposing a clear legal duty to take the necessary steps to make payment, will not be refused merely for the reason that the county clerk, town collector and county collector are not shown to have refused to extend, collect or take any steps required of them. The remedy is for a failure of the corporate body to pay or discharge its legal duty, and not for that of the individual officers.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b234-17\" pgmap=\"234\">4. Where corporate bonds are issued by a town under a law making it the dirty of its proper officers to levy and collect a tax for their payment, mandamus will lie to compel the levy and collection of such tax, and its payment, without a judgment against the town fixing the amount of its liability.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b234-18\" pgmap=\"234\">5. While a corporate debt remains in its original form, as a simple \u25a0contract debt, the creditor will have no legal right to a mandamus to compel the levy and collection of a tax for its payment, without first having reduced the debt to a judgment, unless it was contracted under a law or vote requiring such proceeding to enforce payment. In such case the creditor has no right to any previously ascertained specific part of the general revenue, and the corporate authorities have a discretion in respect to the purpose and amount of the annual tax they may levy and collect.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b234-19\" pgmap=\"234(53) 235(67)\">6.

D. 1869, the county of Ogle, in the State of Illinois, had theretofore been and then was duly organized under the township laws of said State, and that the town of Mount Morris had been created, and then was, \u2022one of the towns of said county, and that on that day there went into force and effect a certain act of the General Assembly of said State, chartering the Chicago and Iowa Eailroad Company, which corporation thereafterward organized, and proceeded to construct a railroad through said town of Mount. Morris; that by the 12th section of that act a special method of holding an election was prescribed, whereby towns, villages. or cities along or near where it was proposed by said railroad \u00a1company to construct its railroad, might aid such company by a donation of their bonds, and should issue to said railroad-company their bonds, in such denominations as said company might designate, not less than $100, and bearing interest as. should be determined at such election, not to exceed ten per \u25a0cent per annum, payable annually,\u2014which bonds were to be-signed by the supervisor and countersigned by the clerk in towns organized under the Township Organization law; and .that when bonds had been so donated, for the purpose of paying the interest and principal thereof, it was further by said section enacted, that any town, village or city so donating; as-aforesaid, should, by its proper corporate authority, annually thereafter assess and levy a tax upon the taxable property of such town, village or city, sufficient to pay and liquidate the annually accruing interest on such bonds, and so much of the principal thereof as from time to time should become due,\u2014 which taxes were to be levied and collected in the same manner as other corporation taxes in such town, village or city, it-being provided that for the payment of the principal thereof .said tax should not exceed two per cent per annum; (See '2 Private Laws of 1869, p. 964;) that on the 30th day of June, :A. D. 1870, pursuant to petitions made, among other things, setting forth that said bonds were to be made payable within ten years from the date of their issue, and to bear interest, from the date of their issue, at the rate of ten per cent per .annum, payable annually, and notices given under that act, an election was held in the said town of Mount Morris, whereby a donation of the bonds of that town, to the amount of $75,000, was voted to said railroad company, and on the \u2022faith of such donation said railroad company proceeded with the construction of their railroad through that town; that about the 30th day of June, 1870, the date when the donation of said bonds was voted, said railroad company commenced the construction of its road through said town, and carried forward that work up to and until the 11th day of November, 1871, when the road was very nearly completed; meantime, the issuance of bonds to the railroad company was awaiting the completion of the road, when, on the last named day, before the bonds so voted had been issued, certain tax-payers,\u2014 one Daniel J. Pinckney, John W. Hitt, Jacob Mauma, John F. McCoy, Milton Getzendaner and John Sprecher, owners of real and personal estate situated in that town, which property, they alleged, was liable, in common with the other taxable property in said town, to taxation for State, county and township purposes,\u2014exhibited their bill in chancery in the Ogle county circuit court, against said railroad company, the town of Mount Morris, Charles Newcomer, its then supervisor, and Henry H. Clevidence, its then clerk, stating the said act chartering said railroad company, the organization of the company under said act, and that by the 12th section it was provided that on the petition of twenty legal voters of the town along or near which it was proposed to construct the railroad, * * * requesting an election to be held to determine whether such town should * * * make a donation to that company, the town clerk should file such petition, and twenty days before holding the election should post notices stating the object of the election and when it should be held; and it was further expressly provided, that such election should be held and conducted, and returns thereof made, as was provided by the Township Organization law in towns organized under said law.</summary><summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-5\" pgmap=\"237(57) 238(380)\">\u201cIt was further alleged in that bill, that on the 9th day of June, 1870, a petition was received by Frederick B. Brayton, then town clerk of that town, praying that an election be held to determine whether that town would make a donation of $75,000 of its bonds in aid of that company; that said town clerk posted notices for an election, to be held on the 30th day of June, 1870. It was further charged, that on that day voters assembled at the place mentioned in the notices, and between nine and ten o\u2019clock in the forenoon said assemblage- or meeting was called to order by said Frederick B. Brayton, acting as town clerk of said town, and .thereupon one M.

It was further charged in that bill that all the ballots cast were illegal and. void, in that the voters voting had no power to determine whether the town should make any donation, or to bind or obligate the town to make the donation or to issue its bonds, and that, in truth and in fact, there were no legal and valid votes or ballots cast at said election.</summary><summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-5\" pgmap=\"239\">\u201cThe relief prayed was, that the issue of said bonds be perpetually enjoined, and that the assessment or collecting of any taxes upon the taxable property in said town of Mount Morris, to pay said bonds, or any part thereof, be perpetually restrained.</summary><summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-6\" pgmap=\"239\">\u201cOn the 11th day of November, 1871, when that bill was filed, the property owners and tax-payers of the town of Mount Morris were very numerous, consisting of a great number of persons.</summary><summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-7\" pgmap=\"239\">. \u201cOver four months afterwards the railroad company answered separately. The town, her supervisor and clerk joined in their answer. In both these answers it was explicitly admitted that the method by which that election was held was, that the town clerk called the meeting to order; one M. T, Eoher was, by the legal voters present, chosen moderator, then sworn to discharge his duties as such; that the polls were then opened, the voters cast their ballots for and against the donation, and that the polls remained open until six o\u2019clock in the evening, and that in this manner was the donation of $75,000 voted, and that the company had, in all respects, fulfilled its obligations.</summary><summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-8\" pgmap=\"239(22) 240(75)\">\u201cOn hearing that cause on its merits, the circuit court per- \u2022 petually enjoined the town and its officers from issuing, and the railroad company or its agents from receiving, the bonds in question. Thereupon those defendants took that case, by appeal, to the Supreme Court of the State of Illinois, where, \u25a0on a second hearing on the merits, the judgment of the circuit \u2022court was reversed and the bill dismissed.

Communications in writing, dated November 14, 1874, signed by property owners and tax-payers in the town, were addressed to the complainants in that suit, advising a compromise with the company, and pledging the influence of the subscribers to induce the town to assume the expenses of the litigation. Two of these communications were signed, respectively, by Eeuben S. Marshall and Samuel Domer. At a special town meeting, held on March 19, 1875, resolutions were passed accepting a previous proposition made \u2022by the president of the railroad company to the town supervisor, to take bonds to the amount of $50,000 in lieu of the bonds amounting to $75,000, agreeing that the town would pay all the expenses of that suit, amounting to $1600, and thanking their supervisor for his efforts in making the settlement.

D. 1885, to the said Chicago and Iowa Eailroad Company, or bearer, at the Third National Bank of Chicago, Illinois, with interest at the rate of ten per cent per annum, payable, annually, on the 1st day of May, upon the delivery of the coupons severally hereto annexed,\u201d and the contention on behalf of the respondents is, inasmuch as no coupons were issued for interest to accrue- . after the maturity of the bonds, it was not intended the bonds- ' should bear interest, after their maturity. We are committed to a contrary rule. In Phinney v. Baldwin, 16 Ill. 108, the-question was, whether a promissory note, payable thirty days after date, and bearing interest from date at the rate of five-per cent per month,- bore that rate so long as the principal remained unpaid, and it was held that it did. This ruling was re-affirmed in Etnyre et al. v. McDaniel, 28 Ill. 201, and it was followed by the Supreme Court of the United States in Ohio v. Frank, 103 U. S. 697, where the question was,-whether a township bond, payable at a time mentioned, with interest from date at a specified rate, bore the same rate of interest after maturity, in the absence of an express promise to that effect, and it was held that it did.</p> <p id=\"b259-3\" pgmap=\"259\">Pruyn v. City of Milwaukee, 18 Wis. 367, is, so far as concerns this question, precisely analogous to the present case, and it was there ruled that the bonds bore the agreed rate of interest after as well as before maturity, and notwithstanding no coupons were issued for that interest. It was, among other things, said in the opinion: \u201cIt is said that the bonds in this case were made payable on a specified day, \u2018together with interest thereon at the rate of ten per cent per annum, payable annually, on presentation of the annexed warrants,\u2019 and that this language manifests an intention of the parties that the rate of interest stipulated should cease on the maturity of the bonds. We confess we are unable to discover any such intention or design, express or implied, in this language. By the clause in the bond above cited, the parties provided for the payment of interest annually, at the rate specified, on the presentation of the coupons. Quite likely the parties expected the bond would be paid at maturity; but if it were not so paid,, we have no manner of doubt but that it was expected and intended that the bond should draw interest at ten per cent until paid.\u201d See, also, Tiedeman on Com. Paper, sec. 412, and eases cited in note 3; Jones on Corp. Bonds and Mortgages, sec. 260, and cases cited.</p> <p id=\"b259-4\" pgmap=\"259(99) 260(258)\">But it is contended on behalf of counsel for respondents, that, conceding the relator is lawfully entitled to the amount claimed in its petition, yet, inasmuch as its claim has never been reduced to a judgment, it is not entitled to proceed by mandamus. It is provided in the twelfth section of the act to incorporate the Chicago and Iowa Railroad Company, (2 Private Laws of 1869, p. 962,) that \u201cany town * * * so * * * donating its bonds shall, by its proper corporate authority, annually thereafter assess and levy a tax upon the taxable property of such town * * sufficient to pay and liquidate' the annually accruing interest on such bonds, and so much of \u25a0 the principal thereof as from time to time shall become due,\u2014. which taxes shall be levied and collected in the same manner as other corporate taxes in such town.\u201d There is, therefore, here presented a lawful debt against the town, for the pay- - ment of which it is the duty of its proper officers to assess and levy a tax upon the taxable property of the town, and the failure of those officers to perform that duty; and it is clearly; settled by the weight of authority that mandamus lies in such case to compel the levy and collection of the requisite tax,. and its payment to the lawful holders of the indebtedness.

Anderson County, 8 Baxter, 249; Flagg v. Mayor, 33 Mo. 440; The People v. Mead, 24 N. Y. 114.</p> <p id=\"b260-6\" pgmap=\"260(130) 261(24)\">The cases cited by counsel for respondents from the Reports of the United States courts, (Jerome v. Comrs. of Rio Grande County, 18 Fed. Rep. 873, County of Green v. Daniel, 102 U. S. 187, Davenport v. County of Dodge, 105 id. 237, and Chickamauga v. Carpenter, 106 id. 663,) rest upon the fact, that the Circuit Courts of the United States are creatures of. statute, and have only so much of the judicial power of the. United States as the acts of Congress have conferred upon them, and those acts have conferred upon them no power to \u2022 issue writs of mandamus as an original proceeding, but they, are empowered to issue them only when such writs are necessary to the proper exercise of their existing jurisdiction, as, in the enforcement of judgments at law against municipal corporations. See Bath County v. Amy, 13 Wall. 244; High on Extraordinary Remedies, sec. 302.</p> <p id=\"b261-4\" pgmap=\"261\">In Rogers v. The People, 68 Ill. 154, cited by counsel for respondents, the statute prescribed a specific mode for the collection of the judgment against the school directors, which was adequate, and held to be exclusive, and so mandamus would not lie.</p> <p id=\"b261-5\" pgmap=\"261\">In Coy v. City Council of Lyons, 17 Iowa, 7, also cited by counsel for respondents, the ruling is, simply, that \u201cwhere a debt remaining in its original form as a simple contract debt, the creditor has no legal right to a mandamus to compel the city to levy and collect a tax for its payment, unless the debt is contracted under a special law or vote authorizing such proceeding to enforce payment; but where the debt has been reduced to judgment, there is then devolving upon the city authorities a perfect legal duty and obligation to provide for its payment.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b261-6\" pgmap=\"261\">There was like ruling in this court in The People ex rel. v. Clark County, 50 Ill. 214, where it was sought, by mandamus, to compel the levy and collection of a tax for the payment of a county order drawn upon the general revenue fund, and it was held that mandamus would not lie, but that the holder of the order must first reduce it to judgment. In such cases no single general creditor has a right to any previously ascertained specific part of the general revenue, and there is, moreover, judgment and discretion to be exercised by the municipal authority with respect to the purpose and amount of general revenue which they shall annually cause to be collected by taxation upon the taxable property of the municipality; and they are therefore in nowise analogous to cases like the present, where there is a specific duty to levy and collect taxes for the payment of particular debts, in which there is neither judgment nor discretion to be exercised by the municipal authority.</p> <p id=\"ARG\" pgmap=\"262\">We have often held, that to authorize a mandamus to be issued, the petitioner must show a clear legal right. The People v. Forquer, Beecher\u2019s Breese, 104; The People v. Chicago and, Alton Railroad, Co. 55 Ill. 95; The People v. Glann, 70 id. 232; The People v. Village of Grotty, 93 id. 180; Lavalle v. Soucy, 96 id. 467; The People v. Dulaney et al. id. 503. And all of the cases cited by counsel for the respondents which we have not herein commented upon, belong to this class,\u2014the facts were not admitted, and the amount or the right involved presented an issue of fact. \u201cIt is not the province of mandamus,\u201d says High in his work on Extraordinary Remedies, (see. 339, 2d ed.) \u201cto settle the differences of opinion between municipal authorities and claimants, as to the amount due for services rendered. All such cases of disputed accounts or claims against the municipality should be referred to the arbitrament of a jury or to the ordinary process of the courts, and they can not be determined by proceedings in mandamus.\u201d (See, also, Barnett v. Auditor, 12 Ohio, 54, and Commonwealth v. Comrs. of Allegheny County, 16 S. &amp; R. 317, cited by the author in support of his statement.) But there are here no facts in dispute. The allegations of the petition are admitted by the demurrer to be true, and the only contention is in regard to a conclusion of law, as to which, in our opinion, there is no-doubt, and the case is therefore clearly within the authority of Maddox v. Graham, and other cases cited supra, holding that mandamus will lie.</p> <p id=\"b262-4\" pgmap=\"262(103) 263(366)\">It is further contended by counsel for the respondents, that as to the county clerk, town collector and county collector, (treasurer,) mandamus will not lie, because it is not made to appear that those officers, or either of them, have or has, up to this time, refused to extend, collect or take any steps re-_ \u00a1quired of them, or either of them, by law, in reference to the :matter in dispute. This loses sight of the controlling fact, here, that the duty to pay is that of the town, as a corporate .body, and not of individuals, although that duty can only be discharged through the acts of individuals. The failure to pay is that of the corporate body, and it is because of that failure only, and to compel the performance of the corporate \u25a0duty in that respect, that a mandamus will be awarded. Were a like duty required to be performed by a natural person instead of by an artificial person, under such circumstances that mandamus would lie, no one would suppose it necessary to prosecute a separate suit to enforce the performance of each distinct step necessary in the collection and paying over of the money; and yet there can, in theory, be no difference between a natural and an artificial person, in this respect. The different officers appointed by law as the agencies and instrumentalities through which corporate action shall be taken, are to the corporate body but as the members of the natural person, through which he or she can alone act, are to that person; and in either case, to coerce action of the parts it is only necessary to inquire, is there a right to coerce action of the person, either natural or artificial, the person being responsible for the failure to act. It would, therefore, in the present \u25a0case, doubtless, have been sufficient to have filed the petition against the town, without naming individuals, to have obiained a peremptory mandamus to each of the agencies and instrumentalities through-which it must act to make payment \u2022of the claim due the relator; but it was competent to make the individuals whose d\u00faty it is to act, parties, as was here done. (Village of Glencoe v. The People, 78 Ill. 386; Sheaff v. The People, 87 id. 189.) But it is, obviously, in either \u25a0event, the action of a corporate body, and not the action of natural persons, as such, merely, that is to be enforced. The question involved in this contention of counsel for the respondents is exhaustively discussed, and decided against them, in Labette County v. Moulton, 112 U. S. 223. See, also, Farnsworth v. Boston, 121 Mass. 173; Attorney General v. Boston, 123 id. 123; King v. Mayor of Tregony, 8 Mod. 111.</p> <p id=\"b264-3\" pgmap=\"264\">The person acting as town clerk was not personally served, with the summons. It is claimed, and with some show of reason, that he avoided personal service in order to defeat the-awarding of the peremptory writ. We do not think it necessary to inquire into this, and ascertain what is the fact. All. of the town auditors except the town clerk were personally-served. It is competent for them to proceed to act, and if,, when they do so, the town clerk shall be absent, and not performing the duties of his office, it will be their duty to declare-the office vacant, and to appoint a town clerk in his stead..</p> <p id=\"b264-4\" pgmap=\"264\">(2 Starr &amp; Curtis\u2019 Stat. chap. 139, art. 10, secs. 1, 2; art. 13,. secs. 1, 2, same chapter.) And the same is true with regard to any other member of the board.</p> <p id=\"b264-5\" pgmap=\"264\">The demurrer is overruled, and judgment is rendered awarding a peremptory writ, as prayed in the petition.</p> <p id=\"b264-6\" pgmap=\"264\">Mandamus awarded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
