Contract\u2014construed as to consideration. A brewing company, for the purpose of increasing the sale of its own beer, entered into a written contract with a party engaged in the saloon business, by which' the latter leased his saloon building to the former for five years, and' obligated himself not to engage in such business within the term, nor, allow that business to be carried on in that particular locality on prem-] ises owned or controlled by him or which he might purchase within' that time, and also not to sell his property to any one without a provision in the deed that the purchaser would not engage in the liquor traffic on the premises sold. The contract provided that the lessee' should pay, for the whole time, $3000, in monthly installments of $50, on the first day of each month. It was also therein provided, that on default in the payment of any installment of rent for ten days, the lessee should, on request, give peaceable possession of the premises to the lessor, but for such cause the obligation to pay should not cease : Held, that the sum agreed to be paid was not merely for the rent, but was the consideration for a.11 the stipulations and agreements on the part of the lessor, and that a determination of the demise for non-payment of the installments- would not affecfc-the lessee\u2019s liability to pay, the residue of the stipulated consideration.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b310-3\" pgmap=\"310\">2. Lease\u2014default in payment\u2014rights of lessor. In consideration of a lease of a building for a term of years, and other covenants of the lessor made for the benefit of the lessee, the latter agreed to pay the former $3000, in monthly installments of $50, and it was provided that for ten days\u2019 default in any monthly payment, the lessee, on the lessor\u2019s request, should surrender possession of the premises leased, but for such cause the obligation to pay should not cease. On default of payment the lessor took possession, and brought suit for the next installment maturing after taking possession : Held, that the surrender of possession for a default in payment on the demand of the lessor was not a rescission of the contract, but that the lessor, by action, might enforce payment of the remaining installments as they fell due, and that the lessee might enforce the covenants of the lessor.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b310-4\" pgmap=\"310\">3.

On the first day of October following this suit was commenced before a justice of the peace, where the plaintiff recovered $50, the justice reciting in his docket that said judgment was for the \u25a0\u201crent for the month of September, 1889.\u201d The cause having been removed to the Circuit Court of St. Clair county by appeal, a trial was had before the court, a jury being waived, and on such trial the issues were found for the plaintiffs, and' their damages' assessed at $50, and for that sum and costs the plaintiffs had judgment. Said judgment has been affirmed by the Appellate Court on appeal, and the judges of that court having awarded the defendant the necessary certificate of importance, the record is now brought here by appeal from' the judgment of that court.</summary><summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-7\" pgmap=\"314(110) 315(104)\">At the trial the plaintiffs gave evidence tending to show that prior to the execution of said lease they were keeping a saloon' on said premises, the profits of which averaged $200 per month, and that the defendant wished to rent said premises for the purpose of placing a tenant therein who would sell its beer; that after the execution of said lease, the defendant had several occupants in possession, but that for a considerable portion of the time the premises were vacant, and that such was their condition at the time of the service of said notice to quit; that after the lease was modified the plaintiffs took all their beer from the defendant, until May, 1889, at which time the defendant sold its brewery to some other party; that since said surrender of possession, the plaintiffs had made no use of the premises, but had notified the defendant that, upon compliance with the terms of the lease, they would restore to it the possession, and on the trial a formal offer to the same effect was made, which the defendant refused to accept. The defendant read in evidence its articles of incorporation, that portion of said articles in which were stated the objects for which said corporation was formed being as follows:</summary><summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-5\" pgmap=\"315\">\u201c2.

The defendant, at the time said contract was entered into, was a corporation engaged in the manufacture and sale of beer, and the premises covered by the lease were and for a considerable time had been occupied and used by the plaintiffs as a saloon, where, as the evidence tends to show, large quantities of beer had been and were being sold at retail. The purpose of the defendant, in entering into said contract, as plainly appears both from the contract itself and from the surrounding circumstances, was to increase the sale and consumption of beer of its own manufacture. This was sought to be accomplished, first, by getting control of the premises where the plaintiffs had established and were carrying on a large saloon business, and, secondly, by obtaining from the plaintiffs a contract not to engage in the saloon business themselves, nor allow that business to be carried on in that locality on premises owned or controlled by them. This agreement was to run for the term of five years, and during that time the plaintiffs were prohibited from selling any of their said property without a provision prohibiting its use for carrying on the liquor business, and the same stipulation was made to apply \u25a0to any property the plaintiffs might purchase during the term of said lease.</p> <p id=\"b317-7\" pgmap=\"317\">The consideration to be paid for all these various concessions made by the plaintiffs was $3000, payable in installments of $50 each, at the end of each month. This manifestly was agreed to be paid, not merely as rent for the premises demised, but as the consideration for all the stipulations and agreements on the part of the plaintiffs contained in the contract. It was accordingly stipulated that a termination of the demise for non-payment by the defendant of the installments as they should fall due should not affect the defendant\u2019s liability to pay the residue of the stipulated consideration.</p> <p id=\"b317-10\" pgmap=\"317(34) 318(59)\">The provisions of the contract on this subject are, that in .default of the payment of any one installment of rent for ten days after the same shall become due, the defendant will, at the request of the plaintiffs, quit and surrender to them peaceable possession of the demised premises, \u201cbut for this causo the obligation to pay shall not cease.\u201d A subsequent clause-provides for the payment of double rent in ease the defendant should hold over after the termination of said lease or its forfeiture for non-payment of rent.</p> <p id=\"b318-5\" pgmap=\"318\">When all the provisions and circumstances of said contract are taken into consideration, there seems to be no reasonable-doubt as to the intention of the parties that, the mere surrender of possession of the building leased, though made upon demand by the plaintiffs based upon a default in the payment of an? installment of the rent, should not terminate said contract altogether, but only the defendant\u2019s right to the possession of' the building leased, thus leaving all the other provisions of the contract, as well as the defendant\u2019s obligation to pay the stipulated consideration, in full force. The agreements on the part of the plaintiffs unaffected' by the surrender, and which the defendant may still enforce constitute a substantial and material part of the consideration of the defendant\u2019s covenant to pay the $3000, and it is not for the defendant to insist that a forfeiture, by reason of its own default, of only its leasehold interest in said building, leaving all the other provisions-of the contract valid and enforceable, shall be held to work, in its favor, a total rescission.</p> <p id=\"b318-6\" pgmap=\"318\">The parties have covenanted that the obligation on the part-of the defendant to pay the stipulated consideration should not cease by reason of the surrender of the building. This was a contract which violated no principle of law, and which the parties were clearly competent to make, and no reason is apparent why it should not be enforced.</p> <p id=\"b318-7\" pgmap=\"318(39) 319(25)\">The defense of ultra vires can not avail the defendant. Even admitting that entering into said contract was in excess-of the defendant\u2019s corporate powers, yet having entered into said contract and enjoyed its benefits, it should be estopped to appeal to the limitations imposed by its charter for the purpose of escaping payment of the stipulated consideration. Bradley v. Ballard, 55 Ill. 413.</p> <p id=\"b319-5\" pgmap=\"319\">We think the case was properly disposed of by the Appellate Court, and its judgment will be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b319-6\" pgmap=\"319\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
