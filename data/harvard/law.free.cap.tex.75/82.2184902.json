Final Judgment \u2014 Beconvention. \u2014 A temporary injunction was granted. The defendant answered under oath denying the material allegations in the petition; also in reconvention sought to recover damages for the wrongful suing out of the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>junction. A motion to dissolve was sustained. The plaintiff then waived its right to have the cause tried upon the merits, and asked that final judgment be entered, which the court refused to do. Plaintiff then asked that its petition be dismissed, which was done, and costs adjudged to defendants, who also at the time brought the attention of the court to the fact that they desired a hearing upon the matters in their reconvention. <em>Held, </em>no disposition having been made of the plea in reconvention, there was no final judgment.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b105-4\">3.

That no right might be waived these pleas were brought to the attention of the court, and the bills of exception show that only the plaintiff\u2019s case was taken into consideration by the court in entering judgment.
