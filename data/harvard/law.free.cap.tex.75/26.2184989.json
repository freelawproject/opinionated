Damages\u2014Mental Anguish.\u2014The mere continued anxiety of one who has been informed of the dangerous sickness of a near relative, and which is caused by the failure of a telegraph company to deliver a message conveying information of the improved condition of the sick relative, furnishes of itself no ground for recovery against the telegraph company on account of its negligence. Such mental anxiety can not of itself constitute an element of damage.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b48-19\">3.

A lawful and valid contract is-shown between appellant, through his agent, and appellee, through its agents.

Co., 70 Texas, 243.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b49-5\">GAINES, Associate Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"AS3\">The following statement of this case is taken sustantially from appellant\u2019s brief:</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Appellant and his wife reside at Jefferson, Texas, and on the night of October 7, 1887, received through the defendant the following telegram:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-7\">\u201cAthens, Texas, October 7, 1887.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-8\">\u201c <em>To Mrs. Josie Rowell, Jefferson, Texas, care of J. II. Rowell:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-9\">\u201cYour mother is worse; come if you can; dangerously sick.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-10\">[Signed] \u201cW. C. Scott.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-11\">Early next morning appellant delivered to and paid appellee the regular charge (forty-five cents) to send the following telegram:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-12\">\u201c <em>To -W. G. Scott, Athens, Texas:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-13\">. \u201cHow is mother? If no better, Josie comes to-night. Answer\u2014my expense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-14\">[Signed] \u201c J. H. Rowell.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-15\">This telegram, constituting said Scott as appellant\u2019s agent \"to convey to him this information, was promptly delivered, and at once in reply thereto, and in pursuance of such agency, the said W. C. Scott delivered to and contracted with appellee to send immediately the following reply:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-16\">\u201cAthens, Texas, October 8, 1887.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-17\">\u201c <em>To J. H. Roto ell, Jefferson, Texas:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-18\">\u201c Telegram received. Mother some better. Doctor said not dangerous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-19\">[Signed] \u201cW. C. Scott.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-20\">This message appellant charges was never delivered at all, through the negligence of appellee\u2019s agents and servants. Appellant alleges actual damages from the failure of appellee to perform its contract undertaken at Athens, from loss of time and business to himself and mental distress, at $100, and for mental and physical sufferings of his wife, $2400.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>The appellee filed a general demurrer anil a general denial. The court upon the general demurrer dismissed the petition and the cause, and appellant prosecuted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">The only assignment is: \u201cThe court erred in sustaining defendant\u2019s general demurrer to plaintiff\u2019s petition and cause of action, and in dismissing the case over plaintiff\u2019s exception.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">We are of the opinion that the demurrer was properly sustained. The damage here complained of was the mere continued anxiety caused by the failure promptly to deliver the message. Some kind of unpleasant emotion in the mind of the injured party is probably the result of a breach of contract in most cases, but the cases are rard in which such emotion can be held an element of the damages resulting from the breach. For injury to the feelings in such cases the courts can not give redress. Any other rule would result in intolerable litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">We regard this case as differing in jmnciple from that of Stuart v. Telegraph Company, 66 Texas, 580, and others in which damages for mental suffering have been allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">The only damages recoverable under the petition was the price of the message\u2014a sum of which the court had no jurisdiction. The suit was therefore properly dismissed, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b50-11\">Delivered November 5, 1889.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
