If the objection had been then made an opportunity would have been furnished the court to have removed any improper effect that they were likely to produce, by proper explanation to the jury. Hot having been then taken, the objection ought not to be considered now.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-14\">The remaining assignments of error relate to charges given and refused. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>by the court and to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-3\">The charge of the court furnished the jury with a full, clear, and correct exposition of the law applicable to the issues made by the pleadings and evidence, and the findings of the jury are sufficiently supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">The case was once before, before this court and was reversed and remanded. The trial from which this appeal is taken appears to have been conducted in accordance with the opinion then expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The judgment is affirmed. \"</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Delivered January 17, 1890.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
