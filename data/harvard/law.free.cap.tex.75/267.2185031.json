It is gross negligence for persons operating a train, who see one on the track in front of said train, to fail to exercise ordinary care and caution to avoid running over such person, and to operate such train in a manner showing an entire want of care, such as would raise a presumption of conscious indifference to the consequences that might follow.

Where the circumstances in proof are sufficient for a jury to infer .a want of the exercise of ordinary care and a reckless disregard of human life on the part of the persons operating a train, a verdict finding them guilty of gross negligence can not be said to be contrary to law and evidence.

He had \"been in a town about four miles distant from where the accident occurred \u25a0during the day, and it was contended by appellant that while there, or on his way from the town to place he was found, he became intoxicated and from this cause had fallen on the track.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">There was evidence tending to show that he was drinking while in the town, and a bottle of whisky partly emptied was found on his person after he was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">There was some other evidence tending to show that he may have been intoxicated when he fell on the track, where evidence was found of a fact which might be attributed to intoxication or other sickness.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">Appellee contended, and offered some evidence to show, that his son was threatened with measles or some kindred disease and went to town for medicine, and his theory was that by reason of fever resulting his son became unconscious and fell on the track.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-12\">The accident occurred at a place where there was no reason to expect any one to be on the track, and at a time when the law imposed on railway companies a liability for an injury resulting in death from the negligence of an employe only when that negligence was gross.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-13\">In applying the law to the facts the court charged the jury as follows: \u201cIf the jury believe from the evidence that A. J. Brown was killed by the passenger train of defendant, and if you further believe from the evidence that the proximate cause of the injury was the gross negligence of the defendant\u2019s employes who were operating its train\u2014that is, if you believe that A. J. Brown was on the track of defendant, and the employes operating the train saw him, or could, taken in connection with such other duties as they were called on to perform, by the exercise of proper care and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>attention have seen him, and could hy the use o\u00ed ordinary care and caution have avoided injuring him, and that such employes failed to exercise reasonable care and caution, and operated the train in a manner showing an entire want of care, such as would raise a presumption of conscious indifference to the consequences, and ran the train over A. J. Brown and killed him\u2014and if you further believe that plaintiff had a reasonable expectation of receiving pecuniary assistance from his said son, you should find for plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">\u201cBut if you believe from the evidence that as soon as the employes operating the train discovered A. J. Brown on the track, and that as soon as they could by the use of proper care, in connection with the performance of their other duties, have seen him they did see him, and that they then did all they could to warn him of the approach of the train, and endeavored, with such means as they could, to stop the train and prevent said injury, and that they were unable to stop the train, but same ran over and killed A. J. Brown, you should find for defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The jury was authorized from this charge to believe that the proximate cause of the injury was the gross negligence of the appellants employes-if they could, in connection with their other duties, \u201cby the exercise of <em>proper care </em>and attention have seen him, and could by the use of <em>ordinary care and caution </em>\u201d have avoided injuring him, and that a failure to use this <em>\u201creasonable care and </em>caution\u201d might evidence an entire want of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">The charge contains inconsistent propositions. By \u201cproper care and attention\u201d the jury would most likely understand to be meant such care and attention as would have avoided the accident, or at least such care as is in another place termed \u201c ordinary care and caution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">If such proper care and attention or ordinary care and caution was used there could not have been an entire want of care or such slight degree of care as could raise a presumption of indifference to the safety of the deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">It may be that by the exercise of ordinary care and caution the employes could have seen the deceased in time to have stopped the train before it reached him, but the failure to use that degree of care could not fix liability on appellant, for it would only be responsible if its employes failed to use a less degree of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">That part of the charge which informed the jury under what state of facts appellant would be entitled to a verdict was subject to the same objections, for it informed the jury that appellant would be entitled to a verdict if its employes \u201cas soon as they <em>could by the use of proper care\u201d </em>have seen him, did see him, and then used such means as they could to stop the train.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-11\">It seems to us that the charge was misleading, and that under it the jury could have had no proper conception of the law applicable to the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>It is probably true that juries often fail to apply correctly to the facts a correct charge in which it becomes necessary to explain to them the different degrees of negligence, but it is the right of a defendant who is liable only when its employes have been grossly negligent to have a charge correct in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">It is urged that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the verdict, but in view of the fact that the charge given will require a reversal of the judgment, it is neither proper nor necessary that we should express any opinion on that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">For the error mentioned the judgment will be reversed and the cause . remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">Delivered November 26, 1889.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
