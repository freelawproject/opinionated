This can not be \u25a0done in trespass to try title by merely showing a levy under writ of attachment, judgment, execution, and sheriff\u2019s deed to plaintiff, and then showing that defendant claims under the defendant in execution. The plaintiff must go further, and show that the \u25a0defendant\u2019s claim originated after the levy of the writ of attachment.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b313-10\">Appeal from Bock wall.

Proof of common source of title can not be made in a trespass to try title suit by oral testimony without first accounting for nonproduction of better testimony when proper objection is taken to such oral testimony on trial of cause.

The defendant pleaded not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-21\">In proof of his title plaintiff introduced a judgment in an attachment suit in the District Court of Tarrant County in its favor against one S. L. Sebastian, an order upon said judgment to the sheriff of Bockwall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>County, commanding him to sell the land in controversy as the property of the defendant in the judgment in satisfaction thereof, and a sheriff\u2019s d\u00e9ed to itself, conveying the land in pursuance of a sale made by virtue of that order. The plaintiff then proved by two witnesses who were present at the sale that when the property was <em>offered </em>the appellant gave notice that he claimed it by purchase from the defendant in execution, and that whoever bought the land would buy a law suit. The plaintiff then closed its evidence and the defendant offered none.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-3\">The testimony of the witnesses as to defendant\u2019s declarations at the sheriff\u2019s sale were objected to by the defendant and an exception to its admission taken. The assignments of error raise the question of the court\u2019s ruling in admitting this testimony and in rendering judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">The plaintiff in an action of trespass to try title can only recover upon the strength of his own title. He may succeed in his action either by showing a consecutive chain from the sovereignty of the soil or by showing that both he and the defendant claim from the same source, and that his is the superior right as derived from that source. Keys v. Mason, 44 Texas, 143. Waiving the question whether the plaintiff can show the common source by the parol admissions or declarations of the defendant, we are opinion that the plaintiff here did not bring his case under the rule. Before the burden of proof shifts in any case the plaintiff must establish his cause of action at least by prima facie proof. In action of trespass to try title in which he claims under a sheriff\u2019s deed he does not make a prima facie case merely by introducing his judgment, execution, and deed, and by proving that his adversary claims under the defendant in execution, without showing that the latter\u2019s title is inferior to his own.</p>\n<p id=\"A8Z\">In Hill v. Allison, 51 Texas, 390, it was held by this court in effect that when the plaintiff shows that the defendant claims under a sheriff\u2019s deed, which if valid conveys the paramount title from the common source, he must not only prove title to himself from the common source, but must also show the invalidity of the sheriff\u2019s deed. It seems to us that the same principle applies in the present case. Here the plaintiff introduced in evidence his judgment, execution, and sheriff\u2019s deed, together with testimony tending to show that defendant claimed title from the defendant in execution. Whether the latter\u2019s title had its origin before or after the plaintiff acquired his lien on the land by the levy of the writ of attachment does not appear. We conclude that the testimony that the defendant in this suit gave notice at the sheriff\u2019s sale that he claimed the land under the defendant in execution was of itself irrelevant and should have been excluded, and that the evidence is insufficient to support the findings and judgment of the court, because it fails to show prima facie that the plaintiff had the superior title.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>The other questions discussed in appellant\u2019s brief will probably not arise upon another trial and need not be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-3\">Bor the errors pointed out the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Delivered December 3, 1889.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
