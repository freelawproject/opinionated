Deed from Margaret Forshee and her husband John W. Forshee to Samuel C. Davis &amp; Co., dated May 13, 1887, and filed for record in Hunt County, Texas, May 16, 1887. This deed ratifies that of the grantors to Farrier, also reciting that Farrier had paid them at the execution of the defective deed of January 12, 1872, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-13\">Plaintiff objected to the introduction of the above deed for the following reasons:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-14\">(1) Because it does not appear that it was made for a valuable consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>eration, and it must pass therefore only such title as the grantors then had, which was no title of any kind.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-5\">(2) Plaintiff\u2019s title from the grantor\u2019s deceased father having been correctly recorded in Hunt County, Texas, prior to the execution of this deed, it is <em>inoperative </em>and can have no effect against them and their prior recorded' title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-6\">(3) Plaintiff objects to the said instrument as proof of the execution of a deed by said grantors to Joseph W.

Deed between John 0. O\u2019Neal and Joseph W. Farrier, dated July 12,1876, and recorded in Hunt County, Texas, same day. Plaintiff objected \"to the introduction of above instrument because Joseph W. Farrier had no title or interest in the land sought to be partitioned; therefore there was no consideration for its execution and it is therefore void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-8\">Defendants then offered in evidence judgment foreclosing attachment lien by Hunt County County Court on the land and other land in a suit in which Samuel 0. Davis &amp; Co. were plaintiffs and Joseph W. Farrier and James C. Gardner were defendants. Also order of sale and agreement concerning same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-9\">Defendants also offered in evidence deed by the sheriff of Hunt County to Samuel C.

That at the time defendants purchased at the sheriff\u2019s sale they had no actual notice of the plaintiff\u2019s title papers. Neither did W. M. Patterson or John C. O\u2019Neal have any actual notice of any of plaintiff\u2019s title papers when they purchased, and neither knew that the plaintiff or any of her vendors had any title to the land, and each of them paid a valuable valid consideration for the land conveyed to them and believed they were getting good titles.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-11\">When Samuel C. Davis &amp; Co. bought the land at sheriff\u2019s sale they had an attorney to examine the records of deeds of Hunt County, Texas, and they and their attorney believed the title to said land to appear from said records to be in Joseph W. Farrier, and that they were getting good titles at sheriff\u2019s sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-12\">It was admitted by the defendants that plaintiff proved by John C.

The facts are these: O\u2019Neal deraigned under Ephriam Woodrow as above set out to an undivided half interest in the land, and Joseph W. Farrier had a deed under Margaret Forshee to an undivided half interest in same. The only deed Farrier had being the one with defective acknowledgment, which deeds are herein set out above, and in order that-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>each party might have his land set out by metes and bounds, O\u2019Neal executed the deed specified in finding 7 to Farrier, and Farrier executed a similar deed to other parts of the land to O\u2019Neal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-5\">Plaintiff recovered judgment for the land and costs of suit against all of the defendants.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b189-6\"><em>R.

When the property sought to be partitioned belongs to the estate of a deceased person being administered upon, the Probate Court has exclusive jurisdiction to make the partition. To make a decree of partition valid, the proceedings must show the parties to the suit, the date thereof, the style of the suit, the property partitioned, and the party to whom decreed, and unless it so shows the proceedings must show that the court determined the interest of the parties, appointed commissioners, and that they reported the property incapable of division, before the court would have the power to appoint an agent to sell.

Where a creditor sues the debtor and attaches his land, prosecutes his suit to judgment, forecloses his lien, buys the land, pays the cost and attorney fees in cash, pays the taxes for the year in which the suit was filed and judgment rendered and sale made, which was legally due by the debtor, and credits the excess of his bid over the cost on his debt put in judgment, the consideration and deed were sufficient to sustain the plea of innocent purchaser in 1876.

The land involved in this suit not being patented when it was conveyed by the ancestor, and that deed being withheld from the record thirty-seven years, and until the patent issued and defendants acquired the legal title from the apparent owners, defendants acquired the superior legal title to the equitable one held by plaintiff under the ancestor.

The deed from Mrs. Forshee to Samuel C. Davis &amp; Co., made in 1887, related back to and cured the defects in the deed to Farrier made in 1872, and the first deed was a sufficient contract upon which to base the deed made in 1887, which deed takes the place of the deed made in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>1872, and relates back to that date.

The District Court is one qf\u00bb general jurisdiction over land, and its. orders and judgments are conclusive in such matters and can not be collaterally attacked. The record shows a suit to partition the land in the District Court of Fannin County, and an order for its sale, and appointing an agent to sell, and an order confirming the agent\u2019s sale and ordering him <em>to </em>make deed. These acts are presumed to be regular, and all acts preceding are presumed to have been done that were necessary and within the jurisdiction of the court, and the agent\u2019s deed conveys title. It is too late to raise the objection in the Supreme Court for the first time. Grassmeyer v. Beeson, 18 Texas, 753; Davis v. Wells, 37 Texas, 606.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b190-5\">2. In order for a defendant to recover as an innocent purchaser, etc., against a legal title it must be proven by evidence other than and independent of the recitals in the deeds that a valuable consideration was really paid.

The acknowledgment to the deed from Margaret Forshee and husband to Jos. W. Farrier was decided by this court in Davis v. Agnew, 67 Texas, 206, to be void. This deed was dated January 12, 1872, and was the only conveyance from Mrs. Forshee to any one on March 9, 1882, when appellee\u2019s claim of title was regularly recorded. On May 13,1887, after the decision of the cause of Davis v. Agnew, the appellants herein obtained a conveyance from Mrs. Forshee, and insist that it cures the defect in the original deed of January 12, 1872. Appellee announces as a proposition that the last deed of May 13, 1887, could only serve as a conveyance at that time from Mrs. Forshee to appellants and could not be held to relate back and give them a title superior to that which they bought at sheriffs sale in 1872.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b190-8\">STAYTON, Chief Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"AJZ\">The estate represented by appellee shows title to the land in controversy, which in its regular deraignment from the original grantee is not questioned except in one particular by appellants Davis &amp; Co., who are the real defendants, who seek to show that they are purchasers in good faith without notice of the outstanding chain of title through which appellee claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-12\">It is urged that the proceedings had in the District Court for Fannin County in the partition of the estate of T. D. Jones and the deed made in pursuance thereof are insufficient to show title from the estate of Jones to Haley.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-15\">The proceedings had in the District Court are not set out in full, but the statement of facts shows that a suit was pending in the District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>for Fannin County to partition the estate of T. D. Jones, who held title to the land in controversy hy regular chain of title from the original grantee; that on March 15, 1880, that court made an order directing a person named to sell the land at public auction to the highest bidder; that on August 17, 1880, the same court confirmed1 a sale made by the person named, and directed him to make a deed to plaintiff\u2019s intestate, which was done.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">The District Court had jurisdiction to render such decrees as are shown to have been rendered, and in the absence of evidence to the contrary it must be presumed that it acquired jurisdiction of all persons necessary to empower it to make decrees that would bind ail persons interested in the estate of T. D. Jones, and that every step was taken required by law to authorize the court to cause the land to be sold for purpose of partition.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Appellee then shows title to the land in the estate represented by her, and was entitled to recover unless appellants showed that they were innocent purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">The case of Davis v. Agnew, 67 Texas, 206, involved the title to the south half of 320 acres of land, part of the same tract of which that now in controversy is the north half.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">Appellants\u2019 title to the land in controversy in -this action is the same in all respects, except one, as was it in the case above referred to, and the title of appellee is the same as that shown by Agnew, except in the proceedings had in the District Court for Fannin County before referred to. In so far as the questions are the same in this case as were they in the case referred to, it is unnecessary again to discuss them.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">In the case of Davis v. Agnew it was held that appellants showed no title, holding as they did through a deed from a married woman, a \u2022daughter of the original grantee, not acknowledged as deeds are required to be to pass title to land, the separate estate of a married woman. Appellants, in the case of Davis &amp; Co. v. Agnew, claimed title through a deed made hy a daughter of the original grantee, dated January 12,1872, to Joseph W. Farrier, and through a purchase made by them under a judgment in their favor against Farrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">The daughter of the original grantee was a married woman at the time \u2022she and her husband attempted to convey her interest in the land to Farrier by deed which, for want of sufficient acknowledgment, was inoperative.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-12\">The original grantee, by warranty deed of date September 4,1845, conveyed the entire tract to one under whom appellee holds by regular .chain of title.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-13\">That deed and the subsequent deeds through which appellee holds were not recorded in the county in which the land is situated until March 9, 1882, except the deed to her intestate, which was. recorded February 15. 1881.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>On May 13, 1887, appellants obtained a deed from the daughter of the original grantee, who before had attempted to convey to Farrier, intended to be a confirmation of the deed inoperative because not properly acknowledged. f</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">That deed is sufficient to pass to appellants whatever title its makers' had at the time it was executed, and it contains recitals that Farrier p\u00e1id valuable consideration for the land at the time \"the inoperative deed was. executed to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">The deed last referred to was admitted in evidence, and there was evidence showing that Davis &amp; Co., when they bought under execution against Farrier, paid the costs which had accrued in their action against-him.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">On these facts appellants claim that they are innocent purchasers for value, and that their right relates to the date of the attempted conveyance to Farrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">There is no proof that Farrier paid any sum or gave anything of value-when the daughter of the original grantee and her husband attempted to convey to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">As against appellee, whatever right appellants have grows out of the-deed made to them by the daughter of the original grantee, of date May 13, 1887. Before that date the deed from the original grantee, the father of appellants* vendor, had been placed on record, and they were thus affected with notice that their vendor nad no title when they received a deed from her.</p>\n<p id=\"A79\">This is conclusive of the rights of the parties, but were it not so we do-not see that appellants could acquire any right or equity by reason of the fact that Farrier may have paid a valuable consideration.when he received the deed not properly acknowledged.</p>\n<p id=\"A6Us\">At the sale made under the execution against Farrier and in favor of app\u00e9llants, they only acquired such right to the land as Farrier had, and not\" any equities which may have existed between the latter and the daughter of the original grantee growing out of transactions between them; but were this not so, proof that Farrier paid a valuable consideration, as against apipellee, could not be proved by recitals in the deed to appellants of date May 13, 1887.</p>\n<p id=\"AWQ\">Appellant King was in possession of the land at the time the action was brought as the tenant of his codefendants, and the court did not err in rendering judgment against him for the land and costs, notwithstanding his disclaimer.</p>\n<p id=\"ALD\">There is no error in the judgment and it will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AWZ\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AeM\">Delivered November 19, 1889.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
