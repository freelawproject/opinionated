J.\n </judges>\n <opinion>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In late 2012, our Legislature enacted the California Public Employees' Pension Reform Act of 2013 (PEPRA, Stats. 2012, ch. 296, \u00a7 15; see\n   Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 7222 et seq. ), substantially revising the laws governing public employee pensions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   This decision addresses the constitutionality of one of the changes effected by PEPRA, the elimination of the opportunity for public employees to purchase additional retirement service credit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The amount of a public employee's pension benefit is typically calculated as a fraction of the employee's annual compensation near the end of his or her career. The size of the fraction is generally determined by the employee's years of public employment, known as \"service credit,\" and his or her age at retirement. The greater the service credit of an employee and the greater his or her age at retirement, the larger the fraction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Beginning in 2003, many public employees were granted the opportunity to\n   <em>\n    purchase\n   </em>\n   up to five years of service credit by making appropriate payments to their pension fund. This purchased credit, known as additional retirement service (ARS) credit, is treated like ordinary service credit upon an employee's retirement. Participating employees could therefore receive pension benefits calculated on the basis of up to five years' more public employment than they actually worked. PEPRA effectively repealed the statute granting public employees the opportunity to purchase ARS credit, although it did not alter the rights of employees who had already purchased such credit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The parties present two issues for decision. The first is whether the opportunity to purchase ARS credit was a \"vested right\" - that is, a right protected by the\n   constitutional contract clause. The terms and conditions of public employment are ordinarily considered to be statutory rather than contractual, and they are subject to modification at the discretion of the governing legislative body. Constitutional protection can arise, however, (1) when the statute or ordinance establishing a benefit of employment and the circumstances of its enactment clearly evince an intent by the relevant legislative body to create contractual rights or, (2) when, even in the absence of a manifest legislative intent to create such rights, contractual rights are implied as a result of the nature of the employment benefit, as is the case with pension rights. The second issue, which arises only if we conclude that the opportunity to purchase ARS credit is entitled to constitutional protection, is whether the Legislature's elimination of that benefit in PEPRA constituted an unconstitutional impairment of public employees' vested rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We conclude that the opportunity to purchase ARS credit was not a right protected by the contract clause. There is no indication in the statute conferring the opportunity to purchase ARS credit that the Legislature\n   intended to create contractual rights. Further, unlike core pension rights, the opportunity to purchase ARS credit was not granted to public employees as deferred compensation for their work, and here we find no other basis for concluding that the opportunity to purchase ARS credit is protected by the contract clause. In the absence of constitutional protection, the opportunity to purchase ARS credit could be altered or eliminated at the discretion of the Legislature. We therefore affirm the decisions of the trial court and the Court of Appeal, which concluded that PEPRA's elimination of the opportunity to purchase ARS credit did not violate the Constitution.\n   Because we reach this conclusion, we have no occasion to address the second issue raised by the parties: whether the elimination of the opportunity to purchase ARS credit was an unconstitutional impairment of public employees' vested rights. The scope of constitutional protection afforded public pension rights by our prior decisions, beginning with\n   <em>\n    Allen v. City of Long Beach\n   </em>\n   (1955)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4391393\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-2d/45/128/\">\n    45 Cal.2d 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=287%20P.2d%20765\">\n    287 P.2d 765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   ), has come to be referred to as the \"California Rule,\" in part because its breadth has not been widely adopted by other jurisdictions. (See, e.g., Monahan,\n   <em>\n    Statutes as Contracts? The \"California Rule\" and Its Impact on Public Pension Reform\n   </em>\n   (2012)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=97%20Iowa%20L.%20Rev.%201029\">\n    97 Iowa L.Rev. 1029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1032, 1071-1074 (Monahan) [referring to our doctrine as the \"so-called California Rule\" and noting that, of the twelve states to adopt the rule, three have since modified it].) The state and many amici urge us to use this decision as a vehicle to reduce the protection afforded pension rights by modifying or abandoning the California Rule, while plaintiffs and many other amici urge us to leave the California Rule intact. Because we conclude that the opportunity to purchase ARS credit was not a term and condition of public employment protected from impairment by the contract clause, its elimination does not implicate the Constitution. For that reason, we have no occasion in this decision to address, let alone to alter, the continued application of the California Rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    A. State Employee Pensions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Although a number of different pension plans cover public employees in California, governed by a variety of statutes, local regulations, and agreements, the plans tend to operate in a similar manner. Here, we discuss provisions relating to state\n   workers as an illustrative example.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   State employees are members of the California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS),\n   the state pension system. Both state employees and their employers are required to make contributions to CalPERS during the course of their employment. (\u00a7\u00a7 20170 [creating the Public Employees Retirement Fund]; 20176; 20671 et seq.; 20790 et seq.) With some exceptions, a state employee does not become eligible to receive a pension until he or she has worked for the state for at least five years and has attained the age of 50. (\u00a7 21060, subd. (a).) Persons who leave state service without five years of service or who otherwise are \"permanently separated\" from state employment prior to taking retirement can elect to have their pension contributions returned to them, rather than remaining a member of CalPERS. (\u00a7\u00a7 20731, subd. (b)(3); 20734.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Once vested state employees reach the minimum retirement age, they are eligible to retire and begin receiving monthly retirement benefits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\u00a7 21250 [benefits paid in monthly installments].) As noted, the amount of the benefit is generally determined by the individual employee's compensation, age at retirement, and years of service. As an example, the pension benefits of one subgroup of state and university employees are determined from a table in section 21354.1. The table sets a covered employee's yearly pension\n   benefit at 2 percent of the employee's \"final compensation,\" multiplied by the member's years of service credit, further multiplied by a number derived from the table.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The latter number is determined by the member's age at retirement and increases from a minimum of .550 at age 50 to a maximum of 1.250, applicable to retirees of age 63 and over. (\u00a7 21354.1, subd. (a).) The net effect is to grant a pension equal to 2 percent of a member's final compensation per year of service for retirement at age 55, rising to 2.5 percent of final compensation per year of service for retirement at age 63 or above; retirement between the ages of 50 and 55 results in a less generous\n   pension benefit. (\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   .) At least a dozen similar schedules are found in the Government\n   Code, applicable to different categories of public employees but offering benefits calculated in the same general way.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Additional Retirement Service Credit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   State employees and other members of CalPERS were granted the opportunity to purchase ARS credit in 2003 by the enactment of section 20909 (Stats. 2003, ch. 838, \u00a7 1); teachers had been granted the opportunity in 1997 ( Ed. Code, \u00a7 22826 ; Stats. 1997, ch. 569, \u00a7 2). The concept of purchasing service credit did not originate with ARS credit. Members who had performed military service or other \"public service,\" as defined by statute, had long been able to obtain pension service credit for that time by making appropriate payments to CalPERS. (\u00a7 21020; See \u00a7\u00a7 20997, 21010 et seq.;\n   <em>\n    Marzec v. Public Employees Retirement System\n   </em>\n   (2015)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6843548\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/236/889/#p897\">\n    236 Cal.App.4th 889\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 897,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=187%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20452\">\n    187 Cal.Rptr.3d 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Section 20909, however, was the first opportunity for state employees to acquire \"nonqualified\" service credit, or service credit that did not reflect any type of service. (See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20415\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (n)(3)(C) [defining \"nonqualified service credit\"]; \u00a7 7522.46, subd. (a).) Because ARS credit is untethered to actual service, it acquired the nickname \" 'air time.' \" (Assem. Com. on Pub. Employees, Retirement and Social Security, Analysis of Assem. Bill 719 (2003-2004 Reg. Sess.) Apr. 23, 2003, at p. 2.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Under section 20909, a public employee with at least five years of public employment could, at any time prior to his or her retirement, make a one-time election to purchase from one to five years of ARS credit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   subds. (a), (b).) These conditions of purchase are consistent with the requirements of federal tax law, which authorizes a tax-qualified retirement plan to provide for the acquisition of up to five years of nonqualified service credit after a member has participated in the plan for at least five years. (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20415\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (n)(3)(B) ; see Sen. Rules Com., Off. of Sen. Floor Analyses, 3d reading analysis of Assem. Bill 719 (2003-2004 Reg. Sess.) as amended Aug. 18, 2003, p. 3 (hereafter, Sen. Rules Analysis).) To acquire ARS credit, the member was required to pay CalPERS, either in a lump sum or installments, \"an amount equal to the increase in employer liability, using the payrate and\n   other factors affecting liability on the date of the request for costing of the service credit,\" a figure calculated by CalPERS. (\u00a7\u00a7 21050, subd. (a); 21052.) In other words, the employee was required to pay the present value of the increase in his or her pension benefits that\n   would result from the purchased ARS credit, at least to the extent that increase could be estimated from circumstances prevailing at the time the employee exercised the opportunity to purchase ARS credit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   When section 20909 was enacted, the purchase of ARS credit was viewed as particularly beneficial to employees who joined public service comparatively late in life or who left public employment temporarily to raise children or to further their\n   education, and therefore had been unable to acquire sufficient service credit for a \"livable retirement income.\" (Sen. Rules Analysis,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at p. 4.) It was anticipated that the financial burden on employees of purchasing ARS credit would be partially mitigated because ARS credit could, and presumably often would, be financed with funds withdrawn from tax-qualified retirement savings accounts, such as 401(k) accounts. (\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Legislature anticipated that ARS credit would be \"cost neutral\" to public agencies, since employees were required to pay CalPERS the full present value of the future benefits. (Sen. Rules Analysis,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at p. 3.) Yet even then, it was recognized that the eventual cost of ARS credit might exceed the purchase price paid by pensioners, most obviously for employees who experienced a significant increase in salary between the time of purchasing ARS credit and their retirement. (State and Consumer Services Agency, Enrolled Bill Rep., Assem. Bill 719 (2003-2004 Reg. Sess.) p. 4.) As the Department of Finance pointed out in opposing the enactment of section 20909, CalPERS was required to make a variety of assumptions in calculating the present value of ARS credit, all of which \"contain a high degree of inaccuracy.\" (Department of Finance, Bill Analysis/Enrolled Bill Rep., Assem. Bill 719 (2003-2004 Reg. Sess.) Mar. 24, 2003, at p. 2.) In an analysis performed for the years 1997 to 2007, CalPERS found that, in practice, its methodology for calculating the price of ARS credit had underestimated its actual cost by 12 percent to 38 percent for various categories of state workers. (CalPERS, Review of Additional Retirement Service Credit Purchases (undated) p. 6.) CalPERS recommended revising its calculations to increase prices accordingly. (\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    C. PEPRA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The centerpiece of PEPRA was a pension plan applicable only to newly hired public employees that is less expansive, and therefore less burdensome for the state and local governments, than the plans covering then-existing\n   public employees. As compared to existing employees' pensions, the new plan increased the age at which employees could claim equivalent pension benefits, set a cap on the total compensation on which pension benefits could be based, required employees to pay one-half of the cost of funding their pensions, and required the annual compensation used to calculate pension benefits to be determined by averaging over a three-year period, rather than using a single year. (\u00a7\u00a7 7522.02, subd. (b); 7522.10, subds. (c), (g); 7522.20, subd. (a); 7522.30, subd. (a); 7522.32, subd. (a).) All of these are less favorable than the equivalent benefits typically available to then-existing public employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   PEPRA also modified certain statutes governing the pensions of existing employees. One of these provisions, section 7522.46, eliminated the purchase of ARS credit by public employees after December 31, 2012. (\u00a7 7522.46, subds. (a), (b); Stats. 2012, ch. 296, \u00a7 15.) In clean-up legislation initiated by CalPERS the following year, this provision was incorporated into section 20909 itself, which now states, in part, \"This section shall apply only to an application to purchase additional retirement credit that was received by the system prior to January 1, 2013, that is subsequently approved by the system.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . subd. (g), as amended by Stats. 2013, ch. 526, \u00a7 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   So far as we have been able to ascertain, there is nothing in the legislative history that explains the Legislature's decision to terminate the purchase of ARS credit. Its likely intent, however, can be inferred\n   from a 12-point plan for pension reform that formed the foundation for PEPRA, published by Governor Edmund G. Brown, Jr. in October 2011.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In recommending the termination of\n   ARS credit, the Governor's plan stated, \"Many pension systems allow employees to buy 'airtime,' additional retirement service credit for time not actually worked. When an employee buys airtime, the public employer assumes the full risk of delivering retirement income based on those years of purchased service credit. Pensions are intended to provide retirement stability for time actually worked. Employers, and ultimately taxpayers, should not bear the burden of guaranteeing the additional employee investment risk that comes with airtime purchases.\" (Governor Edmund G. Brown, Jr., Twelve Point Pension Reform Plan, Oct. 27, 2011, p. 4 &lt; https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Twelve_Point_Pension_Reform_10.27.11.pdf&gt; [as of Mar. 4, 2019]; all Internet citations in this opinion are archived by year, docket number, and case name at &lt; http://www.courts.ca.gov/38324.htm&gt;.)\n   <strong>\n    D. This Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Plaintiff and appellant Cal Fire Local 2881 (Union) is a labor association whose members are employees of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as \"Cal Fire.\" The four individual plaintiffs are Cal Fire employees. Plaintiffs filed a petition for a writ of mandate against CalPERS challenging the elimination of ARS credit, contending that the opportunity to purchase ARS credit was a vested right protected by the contract clause of the California Constitution. The trial court approved a stipulation permitting the state to intervene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The trial court denied the petition, ruling that the opportunity to purchase ARS credit was not protected by the Constitution and, even if it were, its elimination was a \" 'permissible modification to the pension plan' \" because it was \"materially related to the theory and successful operation of a pension system.\" (See\n   <em>\n    Cal Fire Local 2881 v. California Public Employees' Retirement System\n   </em>\n   (2016)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12452409\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-5th/7/115/#p123\">\n    7 Cal.App.5th 115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 123, 129,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=212%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20471\">\n    212 Cal.Rptr.3d 471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Cal Fire\n   </em>\n   ).) The Court of Appeal affirmed on both grounds in a published decision. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 127, 129,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=212%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20471\">\n    212 Cal.Rptr.3d 471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) That court based its conclusion that the opportunity to purchase ARS credit was not constitutionally protected on the absence of any indication of legislative intent to create a contractual right.

It also held that the opportunity was properly eliminated, even if it was protected by the constitution, on reasoning similar to that of the trial court.

Given that conclusion, we have no occasion to reach the further question whether, if it were so protected, its elimination would have worked an unconstitutional impairment of public employees' contractual rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The only change made by PEPRA relating to ARS credit was to eliminate the opportunity to purchase ARS credit after the end of 2012. PEPRA does not purport to affect the rights of employees who took advantage of the opportunity to purchase ARS credit while it was still available. Persons who actually purchased ARS credit therefore remain in precisely the same position as they were prior to PEPRA, and we need not consider their circumstances further. What is claimed here to be a vested right is the\n   <em>\n    opportunity to purchase\n   </em>\n   ARS credit, rather than any of the rights conferred by its purchase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   As discussed above, it was critical to\n   <em>\n    Retired Employees\n   </em>\n   ' holding that the legislative enactment on which the implied contractual rights were premised was a resolution approving an express contract of employment.

The county board's ratification of this contract provided the requisite clear manifestation of intent to create contractual rights. Nothing of the sort occurred in connection with the opportunity to purchase ARS credit. The Legislature did not engage in any sort of negotiation with the public employees covered\n   by section 20909, let alone ratify an express or implied contract reflecting its terms. The Legislature simply enacted a statute granting the opportunity to purchase ARS credit. As\n   <em>\n    Retired Employees\n   </em>\n   noted, such statutes, which announce a policy rather than create a contract, \" 'are inherently subject to revision and repeal.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Retired Employees\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at p. 1185,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=134%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20779\">\n    134 Cal.Rptr.3d 779\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=266%20P.3d%20287\">\n    266 P.3d 287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Plaintiffs' characterization of ARS credit as \"promised when employees provided service\" suggests the existence of an affirmative commitment by the Legislature\n   to make the opportunity to purchase ARS credit available indefinitely, but they cite no persuasive evidence of such a commitment. Plaintiffs rely primarily on a clause of section 20909, the statute conferring the opportunity to purchase ARS credit, which states that \"[a] member may elect to receive this additional retirement service credit at any time prior to retirement by making the contributions as specified in Section 21050 and 21052.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   subd. (b).) They contend that this provision manifests the Legislature's intent to permit existing employees to exercise the opportunity to purchase ARS credit at any point prior to their retirement by (1) working for the five-year period and (2) thereafter making the required payments to CalPERS. Although we recognize that the language, read in isolation, can be interpreted as plaintiffs urge, we agree with the trial court and Court of Appeal that this construction reads too much into subdivision (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Rather than a commitment to maintain the opportunity to purchase ARS credit for the duration of the employment of existing public employees, this portion of subdivision (b), when read in the context of the remainder of\n   section 20909, simply established that the one-time election to purchase ARS credit could be made at any point during an employee's career and that the election to purchase was not complete until the required payments to the pension system had been made. (See\n   <em>\n    Elk Hills Power, LLC v. Board of Equalization\n   </em>\n   (2013)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4237350\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/57/593/#p610\">\n    57 Cal.4th 593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 610,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=160%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20387\">\n    160 Cal.Rptr.3d 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=304%20P.3d%201052\">\n    304 P.3d 1052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [\" ' \"[every] statute should be construed with reference to the whole system of law of which it is a part so that all may be harmonized and have effect\" ' \"].) The remaining provisions of section 20909 establish conditions applicable to the purchase of ARS credit - the requirement of written notice, the maximum number of years available for purchase, the minimum service time required before a purchase can be made, the requirement to purchase in whole-year increments, the limitation to one purchase event, restrictions on the applicability of ARS credit for non-pension purposes, and the type of employees eligible to make the purchase.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . subds.

It is therefore consistent with the statute's remaining\n   provisions to read the portion cited by plaintiffs as establishing other, similar conditions, specifying the time during an employee's career when ARS credit can be purchased and the manner of completing that election. Given the existence of this more\n   plausible reading, plaintiffs' interpretation does not \"clearly evince a legislative intent to create private rights of a contractual nature,\" which is required before such rights will be found.

As the Court of Appeal persuasively explained, \"this phrase means just what it says and no more - to wit, eligible employees could opt to purchase the service credit at any time,\" rather than being required to purchase ARS credit\n   at a particular point in their public careers.

To convert \"this straightforward reading of this statutory phrase [into a] promise by the Legislature\n   <em>\n    not to modify or eliminate\n   </em>\n   the option to purchase service credit\" would fly in the face of \"the legal presumption\n   <em>\n    against\n   </em>\n   the creation of a vested contractual right.\" (\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   . ) Beyond this provision, plaintiffs have pointed to no text, legislative history, or other evidence suggesting that the Legislature intended to make ARS credit an irrevocable feature of the employment of then-existing public employees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In arguing for an implied contract, plaintiffs rightly note that \"[p]ension statutes have rarely, if ever, explicitly stated that a vested right is being created.\" As discussed below, our cases holding that the pension rights of public employees are protected by the contract clause have done so even without a manifest indication of legislative intent.

The opportunity to purchase ARS credit was not a form of deferred compensation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   We first consider whether the opportunity to purchase ARS credit was a form of deferred compensation, in the nature of pension benefits, and entitled to contract clause protection on that basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Pension benefits, the classic example of deferred compensation, flow directly from a public employee's service, and their magnitude is roughly proportional to the time of that service. Just as each month of public service earns an employee a month's cash compensation, it also earns him or her a slightly greater benefit upon retirement. In this way, pension benefits are, literally, earned by an employee's work. Upon retirement, this additional component of his or her compensation is paid to the employee in the form of pension benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In contrast, the opportunity to purchase ARS credit, when it existed, was made available at the option of each individual employee. If not taken\n   advantage of, the opportunity expired upon an employee's retirement or\n   termination of employment. Further, the amount of an eligible employee's service was entirely irrelevant to his or her exercise of the opportunity. Once the five-year qualification period was served, further public employment did not increase the amount of ARS credit that an employee could purchase or in any other way affect his or her opportunity. In contrast with pension benefits, in which a critical determinant is an employee's term of public employment, the factor that determined the benefit received through the purchase of ARS credit was simply the number of years of ARS credit an employee purchased. And as noted, all vested employees, regardless of service time, had the same opportunity to purchase from one to five years of ARS credit. In fact, the opportunity to purchase ARS credit was so unconnected to actual service time that a public employee who had worked just the minimum of five years' public employment and was otherwise eligible to retire could, at least in theory, have doubled his or her pension benefit by purchasing five years' ARS credit and retiring soon after.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that it was necessary for employees to \"earn,\" in a sense, the right to purchase ARS credit by working in public employ for five years. (\u00a7 20909, subd. (a).) We are not persuaded, however, that the imposition of this requirement created a constitutionally protected right. As the state points out, the five-year requirement was required to make section 20909's authorization of ARS credit compliant with federal tax law, which limits the purchase of nonqualified service credit to persons who have participated in a pension\n   plan for at least five years. (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20415\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (n)(3)(B)(ii).) Further, five years of service is generally required for an employee to qualify to receive a pension. (E.g., \u00a7 21060, subd. (a).) The five year requirement simply precluded the purchase of ARS credit by employees who had not yet established their eligibility for a pension. In light of these independent policy justifications for the existence of the requirement, we find no basis for concluding that the opportunity to purchase ARS credit was granted as deferred compensation for an employee's work during the five-year period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The opportunity to purchase ARS credit was not different in form from a variety of other optional benefits offered to public employees in connection with their work. In addition to their salary or hourly pay, it is not unusual for public employees to be offered the opportunity to purchase different types of health insurance benefits from a variety of providers; to purchase life and long-term disability insurance; and to create a flexible spending account, by which certain medical and child care expenses can be paid with pre-tax income. We have never suggested that this type of benefit is entitled to protection under the contract clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <em>\n    3.

(a) ) and (2) make appropriate payments to the retirement system (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   subd. (b) ). Accordingly, even if section 20909 were treated as establishing the offer of a unilateral contract, the Legislature was entitled to revoke that offer as to all public employees who had yet to make a written election and the required payments. In PEPRA, the Legislature did just that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that engaging in public employment was sufficient to prevent revocation of the section 20909 offer because an offeror's right to revoke or modify a unilateral contract ends once partial performance\n   occurs.

Agostini\n   </em>\n   (1956)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2171983\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-2d/139/909/#p914\">\n    139 Cal.App.2d 909\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 914,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=294%20P.2d%20769\">\n    294 P.2d 769\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [\" 'If an offer for a unilateral contract is made, and part of the consideration requested in the offer is given\n   <em>\n    or tendered\n   </em>\n   by the offeree in response thereto, the offeror is bound by a contract' \"].) We disagree, however, with the\n   premise of their argument, that public employment constituted partial consideration for the acquisition of ARS credit. The opportunity to purchase ARS credit was\n   <em>\n    conditioned on\n   </em>\n   public employment, but it was not offered\n   <em>\n    in exchange for\n   </em>\n   public service. For those employees who had already been publicly employed for five years at the time section 20909 was enacted in 2003, no public service was required to qualify for an election to purchase ARS credit. Such employees' mere status as public employees on the effective date was sufficient. Once other public employees had served the five years necessary to qualify to receive a pension, they were also qualified for full rights under section 20909. Although continuing public employment was necessary to retain the qualification to make an election, that continuing service did not bring an employee any closer to acquiring ARS credit. Performance - the consideration for the acquisition of ARS credit - required the filing of a written election and payment of the necessary sums.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Our conclusion in this regard is bolstered by the requirement in section 21052, which sets the terms of payment for ARS credit, that an employee contribute the full amount of \"the increase in employer liability\" in order to acquire ARS credit. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . ) An employee's public service appears not to have been viewed by the Legislature as constituting partial consideration for an election under section 20909, since the employee received no offsetting credit for the value of that service in purchasing ARS credit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   In this regard, plaintiffs argue that a contractual right with respect to the opportunity to purchase ARS credit should be found because public employees reasonably expected that the opportunity would continue to be made available for the duration of their employment. The only cited basis for those \"reasonable expectations,\" however, is the belief that the opportunity to purchase ARS credit would continue to exist in the future because it \"was in effect for ten years.\" The argument proves too much. We have never held that statutory terms and conditions of public employment gain constitutional protection merely from the fact of their existence, even if they have persisted for a decade.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Such a rationale would directly contradict the general principle that such terms and conditions are not a matter of contract and are generally subject to legislative change.

That portion of the pension benefit is the same for employees who elect to purchase ARS credit and those with the identical employment experience who decline to purchase it. Acquiring ARS credit merely adds an amount attributable to the purchased service credit to the monthly benefit payable as deferred compensation. Rather than compensation for public employment, the increase in pension benefits from the purchase of ARS credit is a return of, and perhaps a return on, the funds used to make the purchase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Plaintiffs cite\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"453014\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/52/1109/#p1128\">\n    52 Cal.App.4th 1109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=61%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20207\">\n    61 Cal.Rptr.2d 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in support of their position, arguing the decision\n   rejected a distinction between \"pension benefits\" and \"pension rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   addressed the constitutionality of a change in the manner in which the state made its contributions to the state pension fund, from funding on a current basis to funding a year in arrears.

Compared to salary benefits, the subject of\n   <em>\n    Olson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   the opportunity to purchase ARS credit was a minor part of the benefits available to public employees. Although it might have been a desirable optional benefit for some employees, its significance was likely minimal in comparison to salary, vacation, health care, and pension benefits. Even if\n   <em>\n    Olson\n   </em>\n   were to be applied outside the context of state officers serving for a fixed term, we would be unwilling to extend its holding to all of the terms and conditions of a public employee's employment, without regard to the significance of those benefits. As discussed above, we have never held that the terms and conditions of public employment are protected by the contract clause merely because of their existence. If\n   <em>\n    Olson\n   </em>\n   were applied to protect a relatively minor benefit, such as the opportunity to purchase ARS credit, there would be little left of that principle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <em>\n    d. A legal opinion expressed by CalPERS did not create contractual rights\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   As a final note, plaintiffs argued in the courts below that the opportunity to purchase ARS credit should be found a vested right because CalPERS once characterized it as such in a publication. (CalPERS, Vested Rights of CalPERS Members: Protecting the Pension Promises Made to Public Employees (July 2011).) The publication presented this conclusion as the result of \"[CalPERS's] understanding of the current state of vested rights law in California.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 13.) Plaintiffs do not explicitly repeat their argument in this court, but they cite the CalPERS publication occasionally in their briefs as supporting the protected nature of ARS credit rights. Whether the opportunity to purchase ARS credit is a constitutionally protected right is an issue of constitutional law, not pension law. With due respect to CalPERS, its interpretations of the state Constitution are not entitled to the same deference as its interpretations of California's pension laws. (See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Yamaha Corp. of America v. State Bd. of Equalization\n   </em>\n   (1998)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1709348\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/19/1/#p12\">\n    19 Cal.4th 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 12,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%201\">\n    78 Cal.Rptr.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=960%20P.2d%201031\">\n    960 P.2d 1031\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [agency\n   entitled to deference when interpreting statutes and regulations within its \" 'expertise and technical knowledge' \"].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DISPOSITION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The state and many amici curiae have urged us to use this decision as an occasion to re-examine the California Rule, the doctrine developed in our prior decisions defining the scope of constitutional protection afforded pension rights. Our holding that the opportunity to purchase ARS credit is not a vested right precludes such a re-examination. Underlying the California Rule\n   is the constitutional contract clause, which prohibits state laws that impair contractual obligations. Because we conclude that California's public employees have never had a contractual right to the continued availability of the opportunity to purchase ARS credit, the question of whether PEPRA worked an unconstitutional impairment of protected rights does not arise. Necessarily, if there was no contractual right to ARS credit in the first place, a law eliminating ARS credit could not have impaired a contractual right. Our decision in this matter therefore expresses no opinion on the various issues raised by the state and amici curiae relating to the scope of the California Rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   For the reasons stated above, we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   We Concur:\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    Unless indicated otherwise, all further statutory citations are to the Government Code.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    Although we discuss state employee pensions, the ban on ARS credit enacted by PEPRA applies to all \"public retirement system[s],\" defined broadly by PEPRA as \"any pension or retirement system of a public employer.\" (\u00a7\u00a7 7522.04, subd.

(a) [banning ARS credit for all public retirement systems].)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    The use of the term \"vested\" is potentially confusing here because the term is used in two different ways in discussing pensions. As noted, public employees become eligible to receive a pension only after some minimum period of public employment, typically five years. (E.g., \u00a7 21060, subd. (a).) Once an employee has become qualified to receive a pension by satisfying the minimum service requirement, he or she is said to be \"vested\" with respect to the receipt of a pension. That is not the same as having a \"vested right.\" That term has come to refer to a benefit of public employment whose repeal or other divestment is constrained by the constitutional contract clause. Public employees acquire a vested right in their pension at the inception of employment, even though they generally do not become vested with respect to its receipt until after five years of employment.

Under those principles, an implied-in-fact unilateral contract can arise from the government's offer of an employment benefit in exchange for the public employee's acceptance by entering into or continuing in public service. When the benefit is one that will be provided only in the future-like a pension-the formation of such a contract vests the right to that benefit, making the government's offer irrevocable as to employees who have worked for the deferred benefit and earned it as part of the employment bargain.

(Maj. opn.,\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , 244 Cal.Rptr.3d at pp. 160, 169-170, 435 P.3d at pp. 442, 450-451.) Our cases have treated deferred compensation programs, such as pension plans, as special in this regard. An understanding of why these programs create implied vested rights is important to our understanding of why the particular program at issue here does not.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    Deferred compensation programs provide a particularly clear case for formation of an implied unilateral contract. Monetary compensation, whether received periodically for work performed during the period or deferred until retirement in the form of a pension benefit, is the central consideration for which public employees, like other workers, enter and continue in employment. An implied contractual promise protecting this type of pension right arises because neither party could reasonably understand a deferred compensation offer to be revocable at will after employment.

California Dairies, Inc.\n    </em>\n    (1935)\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2200140\" index=\"227\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-2d/4/128/#p133\">\n     4 Cal.2d 128\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 133,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20P.2d%2013\">\n     48 P.2d 13\n    </extracted-citation>\n    [intent of contractual parties determined objectively from their words and conduct];\n    <em>\n     Meyer v.

No reasonable employee would agree to defer significant portions of his or her compensation without a vesting guarantee, and no reasonable employer would imagine that employees had agreed to work on such terms.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    None of this is true of the opportunity to purchase ARS credits provided by Government Code section 20909. For reasons the majority opinion discusses, the parties could not reasonably have understood that opportunity as an offer that could be accepted simply by employment in a participating California Public Employees' Retirement System agency. (Maj. opn.,\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , 244 Cal.Rptr.3d at pp. 168-169, 435 P.3d at p. 450.) Among other things, no new service was required of public employees who had already served five years when section 20909 was enacted (a period corresponding to the general pension vesting period and to the requirements of\n    federal tax law) and purchasers had to pay the full estimated value of the additional credits under Government Code sections 20909 and 21052. Objectively speaking, a party looking at this arrangement\n    would understand that the ARS purchase option was not offered in exchange for any period of public service but rather in exchange for the statutorily mandated purchase price.

The offer was one that could be accepted only by the employee's election and actual purchase of ARS credits, not simply by staying on the job.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    For these reasons, I agree with the majority: No implied unilateral contract arose simply from an employee's entering or continuing in public service during the period the ARS program was in force.
