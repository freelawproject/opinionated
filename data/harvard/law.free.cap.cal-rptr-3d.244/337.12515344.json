He confessed to doing so while meeting privately with the child's mother in a police interview room, and the trial court admitted the confession at trial. That meeting, however, was orchestrated by police and occurred just hours after defendant had been questioned by police, had proffered an innocent explanation for the infant's death, and had thereafter repeatedly asked for a lawyer. This appeal presents three questions bearing on the admissibility of confessions in\n   criminal cases: (1) Does a suspect's invocation of his right to counsel under\n   <em>\n    Miranda v. Arizona\n   </em>\n   (1966)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/\">\n    384 U.S. 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/\">\n    86 S.Ct. 1602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/\">\n    16 L.Ed.2d 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   ) preclude the admission of a confession a suspect subsequently makes to a person he is unaware is functioning as an agent of law enforcement, (2) Does continued questioning of a suspect after invocation of the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   right to counsel automatically taint any subsequent confession, and (3) Does the above described law enforcement conduct otherwise violate due process? We conclude that the answer to all three questions is \"no,\" and affirm the trial court's ruling admitting his confession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Underlying crime\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mia was a little over six months old at the time of her death. Mia died from blunt trauma. She had 29 bruises, seven rib fractures, a punctured right lung, bruised lungs, and a lacerated liver. Most of these injuries had been inflicted in the hours prior to Mia's death, as a pediatrician's appointment earlier the same day revealed only a few bruises and no internal bleeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Just hours before her death, however, Mia was playing with toys and \"look[ing] fine.\" That was how her mother Nathaly Martinez (Martinez) last\n   saw Mia, when she left the infant in the sole custody of her boyfriend and Mia's father, Edward Orozco (defendant).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A few hours later, defendant called Martinez to report that Mia was not breathing. Martinez rushed back home, but Mia's body was cold to the touch and attempts at CPR by defendant, Martinez, and Martinez's relative did not resuscitate her. Administering CPR did not inflict any of Mia's injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Someone called 911, and emergency medical personnel responded. A paramedic had to carry Mia out of the home while defendant, Martinez and other family members quarreled among themselves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Attempts to revive Mia failed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Subsequent interviews\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Law enforcement interrogates defendant (the first interview)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A little before dawn the day after Mia's death, defendant voluntarily accompanied police to the police station. He met with three officers in an interview room, and they told him he was \"not in custody\" and was \"free to leave.\" One of the officers nevertheless read defendant his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights, and defendant indicated that he understood them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant then proffered his account of what happened. He said he gave Mia some baby Motrin when she was crying; that he put her in her crib; and that when he came back upstairs a few hours later to check on her, her face was up against the side of the crib and she was no longer breathing. Defendant had no explanation for how Mia got so bruised up.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The interviewing officers expressed some skepticism, pointing out that defendant was \"the last one with her\" and pressing for an explanation of the numerous bruises on her body. However, defendant stuck to his account of what happened and said he \"would never hurt [his] daughter.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   An officer then asked if defendant would be \"willing to sit down and repeat the story on a polygraph machine.\" Defendant responded by asking, \"Can I have an attorney?\" The officer responded, \"Sure you can have an attorney,\" but that officer and\n   another officer then proceeded to ask defendant at least four times, \"Why would you need an attorney\"? In the midst of these further questions, defendant requested an attorney four more times, all the while maintaining that his account was truthful and that he had no explanation for Mia's injuries.\n   At that point, one of the officers placed defendant under arrest for Mia's murder. Another officer told defendant, \"[Y]ou ask[ ] for your attorney ... but we're asking for your honesty.\" The officer then told defendant, \"[i]f you're willing to talk to us right now\" \"[w]ithout your attorney present\" \"and [to] explain what happened[,] I'm not going to take you to jail.\" Defendant repeated his request for an attorney and the officer said, \"All right. Go to jail. Done.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At that point, the interview ended. Defendant had not made any incriminating statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    The conversation between defendant and Martinez\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   a. Pre-conversation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Several hours after the first interview, the police allowed defendant and Martinez to meet in an interview room at the police station. It is not clear who suggested the meeting. Before placing Martinez in the interview room, one of the police officers told her that maybe \"you can get the full explanation out of [defendant].\" The officer reminded her, \"You are the mother of Mia and that you ha[ve] a right to know, that you ha[ve] to know, and that you ha[ve] to know everything.\" The officer did not give Martinez specific questions to ask or describe the particular information to get from defendant, but Martinez felt like she had to report back to the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   b. First portion of conversation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The officer escorted Martinez into the interview room and immediately left, leaving Martinez alone with defendant. Their conversation was recorded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Martinez asked defendant what happened while he was watching Mia. Defendant gave Martinez the same explanation he had previously given the police. Defendant said he was \"scared,\" but Martinez assured him that \"[she] knew\" he \"didn't do anything.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   c. Interruption regarding autopsy and subsequent discussion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   One of the officers then entered the interview room. He said he had received a call from the coroner's office. The autopsy, he reported, showed that Mia had \"died at the hands of [an]other,\" that Mia \"didn't suffocate,\" and\n   that her bruises were caused by \"a beating.\" The officer then told defendant, \"[Y]ou were the last one with your daughter and there's [no] doubt [about] it. She suffered major injuries. This may be the last time you guys get to talk to each other in person, okay?\" He stated that \"right now both of you are looking at going to jail for child neglect; causing the death of that baby.\" He then asked, \"Did either of you have anything you want to say to me?\" Martinez said, \"No\"; defendant was silent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The officer left the interview room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Martinez again asked defendant, \"What happened?\" Defendant said he \"want[ed] [the police] to leave [her] alone\" and that he did not want \"them to take\" Martinez. Martinez again reassured him, \"We're ... going to get through this.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   d. Officer momentarily pulls Martinez out of the room\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The same officer who announced the autopsy results re-entered the room and\n   asked Martinez to step outside. He asked if she would take a polygraph test, and informed her that defendant had refused to do so. The officer then escorted Martinez back to the interview room. The officer later admitted that his purpose in doing this was to \"stimulate conversation\" between Martinez and defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   e. Resumption of conversation and confession\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Once they were alone again, Martinez asked defendant, \"[W]hy don't [you] want to take [the] polygraph?\" Martinez reminded defendant that she was \"Mia's mother,\" that she \"need[ed] to know what happened to her,\" and that, \"If you love me, you need to tell me the truth.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendant at first replied that he \"didn't do it,\" but moments later said he \"did it.\" While sobbing, he went on to confess that he \"hit her\" \"once\" and that he \"fucking killed Mia,\" their \"little baby.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   A few minutes later, the officer returned, said \"Time's up,\" and escorted Martinez from the interview room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Charges\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The People charged defendant with (1) murder ( Pen.

Substantial evidence supports the trial court's findings that Martinez was an agent of the police when she met with defendant (because the officers implored her to \"get an explanation\" from defendant) and that defendant did not know Martinez was such an agent (because there is no evidence defendant knew of any of the conversations between Martinez and the officers). Accordingly, this case squarely presents the question: When a suspect invokes his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   right to counsel and law enforcement subsequently orchestrates a conversation between the suspect and someone the suspect does not know is an agent of law enforcement, which decision controls-\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Perkins\n   </em>\n   ?\n   We conclude that\n   <em>\n    Perkins\n   </em>\n   controls, and we do so for three reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   First, the language in\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   itself dictates that\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   is inapplicable.\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   fleshed out what\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   meant when it said that \"[i]f the individual states that he wants an attorney, the interrogation must cease until an attorney is present.\" (\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 384 U.S. at p. 474,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/\">\n    86 S.Ct. 1602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)

For support, he cites two sources. He cites a footnote from Justice Brennan's concurrence in\n   <em>\n    Perkins\n   </em>\n   , where Justice Brennan opined that \"[i]f [Perkins] had invoked either [his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   right to remain silent or his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   right to counsel], the inquiry would focus on whether he subsequently waived the particular right\" and then proceeded to cite\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   .

(E.g.,\n   <em>\n    Maryland v.

Justice Brennan also makes no attempt to reconcile\n   <em>\n    Edwards's\n   </em>\n   limitation to post-invocation \"interrogations\" with his concession elsewhere in his concurrence that the \"questioning\" of Perkins in that case \"does not amount to 'interrogation.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Perkins\n   </em>\n   , at p. 300,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12122654\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/292/\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Defendant also cites the state appellate decision on remand from\n   <em>\n    Perkins\n   </em>\n   , where the court held that Perkins's conversation with the undercover agent constituted \"interrogation.\" (\n   <em>\n    People v.

Curiously, however, that decision nowhere addressed the Supreme Court's prior decision in\n   <em>\n    Perkins\n   </em>\n   and, as a result, is simply incorrect in holding that the conversation constituted \"interrogation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Second, defendant asserts that the law otherwise dictates that conversations between a suspect and people he does not know are agents of the police constitute \"interrogation,\" such that\n   <em>\n    Guilmette\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Plyler\n   </em>\n   were wrongly decided. For support, he again cites two sources. He cites Justice Marshall's dissent in\n   <em>\n    Perkins\n   </em>\n   , where he opines that \"[t]he Court does not dispute\n   that the police officer here conducted a custodial interrogation of a criminal suspect.\" (\n   <em>\n    Perkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 496 U.S. at p. 304,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12122654\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/292/\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (dis. opn. of Marshall, J.).) Beyond the\n   obvious facts that what is said in a dissenting opinion is usually the\n   <em>\n    opposite\n   </em>\n   of the court's holding and is in any event dicta, Justice Marshall's characterization of the\n   <em>\n    Perkins's\n   </em>\n   majority decision is at odds with both the majority opinion itself and, as noted above, with Justice Brennan's concurrence. Defendant also cites language in a footnote in\n   <em>\n    Patterson v.

In each case, he points out, the suspect had been the one to initiate the post-invocation conversation that resulted in a confession.

In this case, the evidence is conflicting over whether defendant was the one to suggest speaking with Martinez. But even if we assume that the police orchestrated the conversation, what makes\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   apply rather than\n   <em>\n    Perkins\n   </em>\n   is whether the suspect\n   <em>\n    knew\n   </em>\n   he was talking to a police agent, not who initiated that talk in the first place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Fourth, defendant urges that even if his conversation with Martinez did not start out as an interrogation, it became one once the officer returned with a summary of the autopsy findings and asked if either parent had \"anything [they] want[ed] to say.\" Had defendant answered the officer's question with an incriminating statement, he would have been interrogated. But he did not. Instead, defendant said nothing, and the officer left. At that point, defendant resumed his one-on-one conversation with Martinez, completely unaware she was an agent of the police. His subsequent confession to her was accordingly not the product of an interrogation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Lastly, defendant argues that the police engaged in a \"persistent, underhanded attempt ... to obtain a confession\" by blatantly disregarding his repeated requests for counsel and then orchestrating a tearful confrontation with his girlfriend and the mother of his now-dead infant. The police conduct in this case was deplorable. (Accord,\n   <em>\n    Missouri v.

The officers' conduct in emphasizing the severity of the crime at issue and telling defendant that he was \"looking at going to jail\" for that crime did\n   not transgress these limits. The officers' promise not to arrest defendant immediately if he confessed presents a closer question, but there is no causal link between that promise to give defendant a temporary reprieve from custody if he confessed for the simple reason that that promise did not produce any confession. To the contrary, defendant steadfastly stuck to his\n   initial story and continued to request an attorney.
