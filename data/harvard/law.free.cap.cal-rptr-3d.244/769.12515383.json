(\n   <em>\n    Connell v. Superior Court\n   </em>\n   (1997)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"261178\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/59/382/#p395\">\n    59 Cal.App.4th 382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 395,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=69%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20231\">\n    69 Cal.Rptr.2d 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Connell\n   </em>\n   ).) In the event a local agency believes it is entitled to subvention for a new unfunded state mandate, the agency may file a \"test claim\" with the Commission on State Mandates (Commission). The Commission hears the matter and determines whether the statute or executive order constitutes an unfunded state mandate for which subvention is required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Here, the Commission denied consolidated test claims for subvention by appellants Paradise Irrigation District (Paradise), South Feather Water &amp; Power Agency (South Feather), Richvale Irrigation District (Richvale), Biggs-West Gridley Water District (Biggs), Oakdale Irrigation District (Oakdale), and Glenn-Colusa Irrigation District (Glenn-Colusa). We refer to appellants collectively as the Water and Irrigation Districts, except when addressing individual appellants' separate claims. The Commission determined the Water and Irrigation Districts have sufficient legal authority to levy fees to pay for any water service improvements mandated by the Water Conservation Act of 2009 (Stats. 2009-2010, 7th Ex. Sess., ch. 4, \u00a7 1 (Conservation Act) ). The trial court agreed and denied a petition for writ of mandate brought by the Water and Irrigation Districts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On appeal, the Water and Irrigation Districts present a question left open by this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Connell, supra,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"261178\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/59/382/#p395\">\n    59 Cal.App.4th 382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=69%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20231\">\n    69 Cal.Rptr.2d 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Connell\n   </em>\n   addressed the statutory interpretation of Revenue and Taxation Code section 2253.2 (Stats. 1982, ch. 734, \u00a7 10, pp. 2916-2917) that has been recodified in pertinent part without substantive change in Government Code section 17556 (added by Stats. 1984, ch. 1459, \u00a7 1, pp. 5113-5119).

Based on the statutory language,\n   <em>\n    Connell\n   </em>\n   held local water districts are precluded from subvention for state mandates to increase\n   water purity levels insofar as the water districts have legal authority to recover the costs of the state-mandated program.

In so holding,\n   <em>\n    Connell\n   </em>\n   rejected an argument by the Santa Margarita Water District and three other water districts (collectively Santa Margarita) that they did not have the \"practical ability in light of surrounding economic circumstances.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 401,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=69%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20231\">\n    69 Cal.Rptr.2d 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) This court reasoned that crediting Santa Margarita's argument \"would create a vague standard not capable of reasonable adjudication.

Nov. 6, 1996 &lt; https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/sov/1996-general/official-declaration.pdf&gt; [as of March 19, 2019], archived at &lt; https://perma.cc/F23E-P2KA&gt;) (Proposition 218) meant that \"the authority of local agencies to recover costs for many services [is] impacted by the requirement to secure the approval by majority vote of the property owners voting, to levy or to increase property related fees.\" (\n   <em>\n    Connell\n   </em>\n   , at p. 403,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=69%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20231\">\n    69 Cal.Rptr.2d 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) This appeal addresses that issue by considering whether the passage of Proposition 218 changed the authority of water and irrigation districts to recover costs from their ratepayers so that unfunded state mandates for water service must now be reimbursed by the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Water and Irrigation Districts argue Proposition 218 removed their prerogative to impose fees because any new fees may be defeated by a majority of their water customers filing written protests. They also challenge the Commission's ruling it lacked jurisdiction to consider reimbursement claims by Richvale and Biggs because those two districts have not shown they collect any taxes. In support of the Water and Irrigation Districts' position, we have received and considered two amicus curiae briefs: one from the California State Association of Counties and League of California Cities (collectively the Counties and Cities), and one from the California Special Districts Association, Association of California Water Agencies, and California Association of Sanitation Agencies (collectively the Special Districts). We also have received briefing from real parties in interest, the Department of Finance and Department of Water Resources.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We affirm. The Water and Irrigation Districts possess statutory authority to collect fees necessary to comply with the Water Conservation Act. Thus, under Government Code section 17556, subdivision (d), subvention is not available to the Water and Irrigation Districts. The Commission properly denied the reimbursement claims at issue in this case because the Water and Irrigation Districts continue to have legal authority to levy fees even if subject to majority protest of water and irrigation district customers. Under the guidance of the California Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Bighorn-Desert View Water Agency v. Verjil\n   </em>\n   (2006)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3583080\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/39/205/#p211\">\n    39 Cal.4th 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 211,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%2073\">\n    46 Cal.Rptr.3d 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=138%20P.3d%20220\">\n    138 P.3d 220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Bighorn\n   </em>\n   ), we conclude that majority protest procedures are properly construed as a power-sharing arrangement between the districts and their customers, rather than a deprivation of fee authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Water and Irrigation Districts' Test Claims\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In 2011, the Water and Irrigation Districts filed a joint test claim with the\n   Commission. The Water and Irrigation Districts asserted the Conservation Act \"imposes unfunded state mandates to conserve water and achieve water conservation goals on local public agencies that are 'urban retail water suppliers' and/or 'agricultural water suppliers.' \" In 2013, Richvale and Biggs filed a second test claim asserting various regulations implementing the Conservation Act also constitute reimbursable state mandates. The Commission consolidated the test claims. After consolidating the test claims, the Commission determined Richvale and Biggs did not have standing to bring the second test claim. The Commission reasoned Richvale and Biggs are not \"subject to the tax and spend limitations of articles XIII A and B of the California Constitution\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   because they are funded solely from service charges, fees, and assessments. Thereafter Oakdale Irrigation District and Glenn-Colusa Irrigation District substituted in as claimants for the second test claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Commission's Decision\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In December 2014, the Commission denied the consolidated test claims \"on the grounds that most of the code sections and regulations pled do not impose new mandated activities, and all affected claimants have sufficient fee authority as a matter of law to cover the costs of any new requirements.\" The decision states that \"[t]he Commission finds that the Water Conservation Act of 2009 ..., and the Agricultural Water Measurement regulations promulgated by the Department of Water Resources ... to implement the Act, impose some new required activities on urban water suppliers and agricultural water suppliers, including measurement requirements, conservation and efficient water management requirements, notice and hearing requirements, and documentation requirements, with specified exceptions and limitations. [\u00b6] However, the Commission finds that several agricultural water suppliers are either exempted from the requirements of the test claim statutes and regulations or are subject to alternative and less expensive compliance alternatives because the activities were already required by a regime of federal statutes and regulations, which apply to most agricultural water suppliers within the state.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Commission's decision concludes that, \"to the extent that the test claim statute and regulations impose any new state-mandated activities, they do not impose costs mandated by the state because the Commission finds that urban water suppliers and agricultural water suppliers possess fee authority, sufficient as a matter of law to cover the costs of any new required activities. Therefore, the test claim statute and regulations do not impose costs mandated by the state pursuant to Government Code section 17556(d), and are not reimbursable under article XIII B, section 6 of the California Constitution.\" The Commission rejected the Water and Irrigation Districts' arguments that after the enactment of Proposition 218 \"they are now 'authorized to do no more than\n   <em>\n    propose\n   </em>\n   a fee increase that can be rejected' by majority protest.\" (Fns. omitted.) The Commission reasoned that \"[i]n order for the Commission to make findings that the claimants' fee authority has been diminished, or negated, pursuant to article XIII D, section 6(a), the claimants would have to provide evidence that they tried and failed to impose or increase the necessary fees, or provide evidence that a court determined that Proposition 218 represents a constitutional hurdle to fee authority as a matter of law.\" The Commission determined it could not make either finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As to the second test claim, the Commission determined these water and irrigation districts \"are not subject to the taxing and spending limitations of articles XIII A and XIII B, and are therefore not eligible for reimbursement under article XIII B, section 6 of the California Constitution.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Trial Court Proceedings\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In February 2015, the Water and Irrigation Districts filed a petition for writ of administrative mandate under Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 to challenge the Commission's denial of their test claims. The trial court heard the matter and denied the Water and Irrigation Districts' writ petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The trial court's decision noted that \"[w]hile the court agrees with [the Water and Irrigation Districts] that the Commission abused its discretion in dismissing the test claims of Richvale and Biggs-West, the court shall deny the petition because [the Water and Irrigation Districts] have failed to show how they incurred reimbursable state-mandated costs.\" Noting the Water and Irrigation Districts admitted \"that, but for Proposition 218, they would have sufficient authority to establish or increase fees or charges to recover the costs of any new mandates,\" the trial court determined it was \"unwilling to conclude that [the Water and Irrigation Districts] lack 'sufficient' fee authority based on the speculative and uncertain threat of a majority protest. Thus, in the absence of a showing that [the Water and Irrigation Districts] have 'tried and failed' to impose or increase the necessary fees, the Commission properly concluded that [the Water and Irrigation Districts] have sufficient fee authority to cover the costs of any mandated programs.\" Continuing with this reasoning, the trial court stated that \"[l]ogically, then the limitations period for filing a test claim cannot begin to run until after the agency has 'tried and failed' to recover the costs through fees or charges subject to a majority protest requirement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The trial court also concluded the Commission abused its discretion in determining Richvale and Biggs are ineligible for subvention because they do not receive ad valorem property tax revenue. However, the trial court declined to make a determination of these districts' entitlement to reimbursement for lack of an adequate record. In the trial court's view, \"[d]etermining whether Richvale and Biggs-West receive 'proceeds of taxes' will require a comprehensive account of the revenues received by them, and a subsequent determination as to whether those revenues constitute 'taxes' within the meaning of Article XIII B. No simple feat.\" Nonetheless, the trial court determined the ability of Richvale and Biggs to levy fees supported the conclusion they are not eligible for subvention for their test claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As the California Supreme Court has explained, \"Courts review a decision of the Commission to determine whether it is supported by substantial evidence. ( Gov. Code, \u00a7 17559.) Ordinarily, when the scope of review in the trial court is whether the administrative decision is supported by substantial evidence, the scope of review on appeal is the same.

Instead, the Water and Irrigation Districts deny they have the ability to impose fees because of the existence of protest procedures. For example, Government Code section 53755 delineates the procedural requirements for notice and hearing applicable to changes in property-related fees and charges. Section 53755, however, does not divest the Water and Irrigation Districts of the ability to raise fees for subvention purposes simply because it allows a majority protest procedure. ( Gov. Code, \u00a7 53755, subds. (a)(1) &amp; (b).) Instead, sections 22280 and 35470 expressly grant the Water and Irrigation Districts authority to impose fees and do so without prior voter approval. The existence of a power-sharing arrangement between the Water and Irrigation Districts and voters does not undermine the fee authority that the districts have under sections 22280 and 35470.

As with the statutory protest procedures, the\n   <em>\n    possibility\n   </em>\n   of a protest under article XIII D, section 6, does not eviscerate the Water and Irrigation Districts' ability to raise fees to comply with the Water Conservation Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   As a constitutionally sound power-sharing arrangement, the protest procedure implemented by Proposition 218 is not properly construed as a deprivation of fee authority as the Water and Irrigation Districts urge.

Consequently, we reject the Water and Irrigation Districts' proposition that the existence of the majority protest procedure enacted through Proposition 218 represents the evisceration of water and irrigation districts' legal authority to levy fees necessary to comport with state water laws. Proposition 218 implemented a power-sharing arrangement that does not constitute a revocation of the Water and Irrigation Districts' fee authority.

That case did not examine the effect of the majority protest procedure on the ability of government agencies to levy fees.

That decision did not consider whether the majority protest procedure had any effect on the Water and Irrigation Districts' power to collect fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Commission has brought to our attention the Legislature's passage of Senate Bill No. 231 (2017-2018 Reg.

SB 231 amended Government Code section 53750, subdivision (k), to expand the definition of \"sewer\" to include storm water systems for purposes of Article XIII C and XIII D.

Such an argument would be untenable because SB 231 added\n   Government Code section 53751, subdivision (h), to declare that \"Proposition 218 exempts sewer and water services from the voter-approval requirement.\" (Stats. 2017, ch. 536, \u00a7 2.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    III\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Subvention Eligibility for Richvale and Biggs\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Our conclusion that Proposition 218 does not undermine the statutory authority of the Water and Irrigation Districts to levy fees to pay for the costs of complying with the Conservation Act, obviates the need to consider whether the Commission erred in dismissing the test claims of Richvale and Biggs on grounds Richvale and Biggs are not eligible for subvention because they do not receive tax revenues.
