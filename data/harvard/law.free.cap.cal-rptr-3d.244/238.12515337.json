We accept Laker's factual assertions as true for the purpose of resolving whether the trial court erred in its denial of the defendants' special motion to strike. (See\n   <em>\n    Park v. Board of Trustees of California State University\n   </em>\n   (2017)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513468\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/217/130/#p1067\">\n    2 Cal.5th 1057\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1067,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513468\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/217/130/#p1067\">\n    217 Cal.Rptr.3d 130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513468\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/217/130/#p1067\">\n    393 P.3d 905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Park\n   </em>\n   ).) Laker is a professor in the University's Department of Counselor Education (Department). In the summer of 2015, a student approached Laker claiming that the then-Chair of the Department, Dr. Lewis Aptekar (Aptekar), had sexually and racially harassed her. The student brought a formal Title IX\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   complaint against Aptekar under the University's policies and procedures.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The investigator ultimately concluded that Aptekar had sexually harassed the student.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In a memorandum dated December 21, 2015, the investigator stated that she had \"completed the formal investigation of the complaint.\" Aptekar was disciplined but was allowed to remain the chair of the Department until May 2016. Aptekar was later placed on paid leave and, according to Laker's complaint, the University President made a statement in September 2016 that the University was looking into how the Aptekar matter was handled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Overall, the parties dispute the propriety, thoroughness, and duration of the Aptekar investigation. Laker claims that the University and certain administrators, including McVey, covered up prior student complaints about Aptekar. In his complaint and in the declaration he submitted to the trial court in connection with the anti-SLAPP motion, Laker stated he had \"heard rumors of troubling interactions between Aptekar and multiple students\" prior to the summer of 2015, and he had expressed concern to McVey in January 2014 that Aptekar was making students \"uncomfortable\" and \"was lacking in sufficient cultural sensitivity.\" When Laker later reviewed the draft investigation report\n   made during the Aptekar investigation, he discovered it contained a mischaracterization of his prior communication with McVey, because McVey stated (incorrectly, in Laker's view) that Laker had told her that \" 'things would come out' about Aptekar if he became Department Chair.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In any event, there is no dispute that, in February 2016, Beth Pugliese, the Associate Vice President of Human Resources, and certain other University administrators received an e-mail from the student who had originally filed the Title IX complaint against Aptekar. The e-mail was titled \"Investigation Outcome Follow-up/Concern\" and noted that the \"incident and case\" related to Dr. Aptekar \"has been going on for almost 8 months.\" In the e-mail, the student stated she was experiencing stress and anxiety from continuing to see Aptekar, who was still the chair of the Department. The student noted that the \"process has been very long and drawn out\" and \"[b]ased on the [investigator's] report, at least two professors were aware of his behaviors and at least one expressed these concerns to the university.\" A few days later, Pugliese responded to the student by e-mail. Pugliese's e-mail stated, \"As you note, it is concerning that other faculty members, including a previous chair of the department, appear to have received information regarding troubling behavior with other student(s) as early as 2013. Those individuals should have notified appropriate administrators, but they did not.\" Pugliese's e-mail further noted that \"Personnel action against Dr. Aptekar ... cannot be taken until certain processes are completed as required by law and by the faculty Collective Bargaining Agreement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In March and April of 2016, the University investigated Laker, as well as other members of the University's faculty, in response to various complaints. As to Laker specifically, three University employees, including Aptekar, made separate complaints pursuant to university regulations. Aptekar claimed that Laker harmed him by \"inspiring students to come forward to report sexual and racial harassment by Aptekar.\" The other complaints were from two different faculty members and related to, respectively, complaints that Laker failed to make breast-feeding accommodations and made intimidating statements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After exhausting administrative remedies,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Laker filed the lawsuit at issue here against the University and several university administrators for defamation and retaliation under the California Fair Employment and Housing Act. As to the defamation claim, Laker alleged he was falsely accused by defendants when they stated that Laker \"knew of sexual harassment and failed to report it.\" He also alleged that McVey and other University officials called him a \"liar\" when he said other students had complained of sexual harassment by Aptekar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As to his retaliation claim, Laker stated that the University and others retaliated against him because he had opposed Aptekar's harassment \"and/or\" had assisted the student with her complaint against Aptekar. In terms of the means of retaliation,\n   Laker alleged that the defendants retaliated against him by making defamatory statements with the intent of \"scapegoating\" him for failing to report Aptekar and by causing employees to file against Laker three \"meritless Grievances,\" which the University then investigated. The retaliatory actions caused Laker \"emotional distress, including fear, humiliation and chronic anxiety, based on the ongoing scapegoating of Laker.\" Laker also alleges in his complaint that he was \"red flagged\" by a university administrator as \"someone who should not be allowed to meet with the new [University] President.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The defendants responded to Laker's complaint with an anti-SLAPP motion to strike the complaint in its entirety. They argued that Laker's complaint should be stricken because the defamation and retaliation causes of action arose from protected activity and Laker had no probability of prevailing on either of his two claims. Their motion was accompanied by declarations and exhibits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   McVey submitted a declaration denying she ever made any defamatory statements about Laker. She acknowledged that she \"did respond to investigators' questions about Dr. Laker within the context of the Dr. Aptekar matter but [has] not made public negative statements about Dr. Laker.\" Pugliese also submitted a declaration testifying about her e-mail of February 2016, and disavowing that she had made any defamatory remarks in the e-mail or otherwise about Laker. Pugliese stated \"to the extent that I said anything that could be construed as negative about Dr. Laker, I made the statements for the purpose of an investigation regarding Dr. Aptekar's conduct, and my statements would have been entirely limited to San Jose State University administration and investigators who were involved in the investigation. I have not made any public negative statements about Dr. Laker.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Julie Paisant, the Executive Director of the University's Office for Equal Opportunity and Employee Relations, who was designated to investigate the University's EO 1096 complaints, confirmed that three EO 1096 complaints were filed against Laker \"between March and April 2016\" and the University \"investigated\" all three complaints \"as required by Article III.A [of EO 1096].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Laker filed a written opposition to the anti-SLAPP motion and submitted a declaration that largely repeated the allegations in his complaint. In his declaration Laker stated, \"I believe that both McVey and Chin reiterated their defamatory remarks as recently as July and August 2016 when I was communicating to SJSU Provost Andrew Feinstein, attempting to expose their cover-up of the prior reports of sexual misconduct by Aptekar.\" Laker also submitted a declaration from Jonathan Karpf, a lecturer at the University. Karpf's declaration stated that, contrary to what the University claimed, not all EO 1096 complaints had to be investigated. In Karpf's opinion, the three EO 1096 complaints made against Laker were \"highly unusual\" and did not meet \"the threshold for investigation under EO 1096.\" Laker additionally filed in the trial court a request for judicial notice that attached several e-mails between himself and a prosecutor for the Public Integrity Unit of the Office of the District Attorney for Santa Clara County regarding concerns that University administrators (including McVey) had lied to investigators during the Aptekar investigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The defendants filed a reply brief, along with an additional declaration from Paisant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   In her second declaration, Paisant stated that the University applied\n   a consistent threshold for EO 1096 complaints, which was also applied consistently to the complaints made against Laker, and that, generally, \"[t]he threshold for investigation under Executive Order 1096 is intentionally low because it would be unfair to summarily dismiss an adequately described complaint without at least some probe into the merits of the complaint.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The trial court issued a written order denying the defendants' anti-SLAPP motion. The trial court found that the University and the other defendants had not met their initial burden of showing that the defamation and retaliation causes of action \"arise from protected activity.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The University and McVey filed a timely notice of appeal of the trial court's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The University and McVey contend that the trial court erroneously concluded that they failed to meet their threshold burden under the anti-SLAPP statute of showing that Laker's defamation and retaliation claims arise from protected activity. They assert that Laker's defamation claim arises from the protected activity of statements made by McVey and others during the Aptekar investigation, and his retaliation claim arises from the protected activity of the University's investigation of the three complaints against Laker. Laker counters that the anti-SLAPP statute does not protect any of these activities because the University acted illegally by conducting \"sham\" investigations; the principal e-mail that forms the basis of Laker's defamation claim falls outside the scope of the Aptekar investigation; and the University's decision (which Laker claims constituted retaliation) to pursue three investigations into his own conduct does not meet the test for claims arising from protected activity set out by the California Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Park v. Board of Trustees of California State University\n   </em>\n   (2017)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513468\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/217/130/#p1067\">\n    2 Cal.5th 1057\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513468\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/217/130/#p1067\">\n    217 Cal.Rptr.3d 130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513468\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/217/130/#p1067\">\n    393 P.3d 905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Park\n   </em>\n   ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that, with respect to Laker's defamation claim, the University and McVey have met their initial burden under the anti-SLAPP statute of showing that the conduct underlying the allegations in Laker's complaint arises from protected activity. Turning to the merits of Laker's defamation claim, we determine that Laker has failed to show his defamation claim has the requisite merit, because the statements supporting its allegations are absolutely privileged under Civil Code section 47, subdivision (b)(3), which protects statements made in \"official proceedings.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The analysis with respect to Laker's retaliation claim is more complex, because the complaint alleges retaliation arising from both protected and unprotected activity. To the extent that Laker's retaliation claim arises from the University's decision to pursue investigations into Laker's own conduct, Laker's claim does not rest on protected conduct. However, Laker's allegation that the University retaliated by\n   publishing false and defamatory statements about him is not merely incidental to his retaliation claim and arises from protected activity. Therefore, it falls within the anti-SLAPP statute. Turning to the merits of this aspect of Laker's retaliation claim, we conclude that the statements supporting this allegation are inadmissible under the absolute litigation privilege. We therefore strike the defamation allegation from Laker's retaliation cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The Anti-SLAPP Statute\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"We review de novo the grant or denial of any anti-SLAPP motion.

(b)(1).) If a defendant brings a special motion under the anti-SLAPP statute to strike a cause of action, the trial court evaluates that motion using a two-step process: the first examines the nature of the conduct that underlies the plaintiff's allegations to determine whether the conduct is protected by section 425.16 ; the second assesses the merits of the plaintiff's claim.

As to McVey in particular, Laker alleges that she falsely told the investigator during the course of the Aptekar investigation that Laker was aware of, but failed to report, prior sexual harassment by Aptekar.

More specifically, he points to the February 2016 e-mail from Pugliese to the student who had initiated the Aptekar investigation, in which Pugliese wrote that \"it is concerning that other faculty members, including a previous chair of the department, appear to have received information regarding troubling behavior with other student(s) as early as 2013,\" and that \"[t]hose individuals should have notified appropriate administrators, but they did not.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   b.

Here, the University states that its investigation was statutorily authorized by section 89030 of the Education Code, which provides that the University may adopt rules or regulations for the government of their employees, and Laker does not dispute this statutory mandate. Moreover, several courts have found that similar internal investigations were an \"official proceeding authorized by law\" under section 425.16(e)(1) and (e)(2).

We decline to hold as a matter of law that statements made directly to investigators during an investigation into discrimination (such as the statement Laker alleges McVey made) are not protected under this first step of the anti-SLAPP analysis. Such a conclusion would almost certainly have a chilling effect. Witnesses to allegedly discriminatory conduct might be more reluctant to actively participate and share their candid views and recollections, based on a fear that any statements might later be used in a baseless defamation case against them. Such a chilling effect would in turn thwart the self-government function that the anti-SLAPP statute aims to protect, as well as prevent the University from achieving its mission under EO 1096 and EO 1097 to \"effectively\" respond to and investigate allegations of harassment and other forms of discrimination. Therefore, we conclude that the investigations that are the subject of Laker's complaint are \"official proceeding[s] authorized by law\" within the meaning of section 425.16, subdivision (e) and consequently are protected conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Laker does not seriously dispute this general proposition. Instead, he argues, first, that the investigations were \"illegal\" (an argument we have already rejected) and, second, that certain key statements, such as Pugliese's February 2016 e-mail, were made after the Aptekar investigation had concluded and thus were not made \"in connection\" with it. Section 425.16, subdivision (e)(2)\"protects only those 'written or oral statement[s] or writing[s] made in connection with an issue under consideration or review.' The subdivision thus appears to contemplate an ongoing-or, at the very least, immediately pending-official proceeding.

One of the key statements allegedly made by McVey-that she falsely told the investigator during the course of the Aptekar investigation that Laker was aware of, but failed to report, prior sexual harassment by Aptekar-was made during or in connection with that investigation. With respect to the February 2016 e-mail, the original e-mail from the student who had filed the complaint against Aptekar had the subject line of \"Investigation Outcome Follow-up/Concern,\" and noted that the \"incident and case\" related to Dr. Aptekar \"has been going on for almost 8 months,\" and further indicated that the student was continuing to experience \"stress\" and \"anxiety\" from continuing to see Dr. Aptekar who remained the department chair at the time. Pugliese's response to that e-mail, which contains the allegedly defamatory remark that \"other faculty members, including a previous chair of the department ... should have notified appropriate administrators, but they did not,\" also notes that \"[p]ersonnel action against Dr. Aptekar, however, cannot be taken until\n   certain processes are completed as required by law and by the faculty Collective Bargaining Agreement.\" This statement suggests that Aptekar was still being reviewed and investigated. In addition, Laker's own complaint bolsters our conclusion when it alleges that, as late as September 2016, the University was looking at the \"handling of Aptekar.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In summary, we conclude that Laker's defamation claim involves protected conduct in the form of statements, including the Pugliese February 2016 e-mail, made during and in connection with issues relating to the ongoing Aptekar investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   c.

Laker also alleges that the University decided to \"red flag\" him, preventing his access to the University President, which restricted his opportunities for promotion. The retaliatory actions caused\n   Laker \"emotional distress, including fear, humiliation and chronic anxiety.\" For purposes of this appeal, we accept Laker's factual assertions as true.

Nevertheless, we observe that many of the cases relied upon by the University involve claims of action asserted against individuals engaging in investigations, rather than claims based on the decisions made by organizational defendants such as the University. The outcome of the \"arising under\" analysis articulated by the Supreme Court and developed by the Courts of Appeal appears to differ between institutional and individual defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The University also argues that Laker's retaliation claim does not arise from unprotected activity because \"no adverse employment action occurred.\" However, the University cites no case for the proposition that an adverse employment action is a necessary element of the first step of the anti-SLAPP analysis. To the contrary, the\n   <em>\n    Park\n   </em>\n   decision notes that the initiation of an investigation can itself constitute abusive conduct unprotected by section 425.16.

Importantly, Laker's retaliation cause of action is premised on his allegation that the University's decision to pursue three \"meritless\" investigations of Laker was itself conduct in retaliation for actions Laker had previously taken in the Aptekar investigation. According to Laker, the University's investigations into his own conduct was not a good-faith investigation into employee wrongdoing but itself constituted a retaliatory action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   For these reasons, we conclude that the University cannot make a prima facie showing that Laker's retaliation claim, insofar as it is based on the allegations that the University pursued three meritless investigations of him and decided to red flag him, \"arise[s] from any act ... in furtherance of [their] right of petition or free speech under the United States Constitution or the California Constitution in connection with a public issue.\" ( \u00a7 425.16, subd.

In paragraph 90(a) of his complaint, Laker alleges that the University retaliated against him by \"multiple means\" including by \"publishing false and defamatory statements about Laker to punish him for his ongoing efforts to protect SJSU students\n   from sexual harassment by Aptekar, with the intent of scapegoating Laker as the person who had failed to report Aptekar's misconduct.\" Although this allegation references multiple \"statements,\" Laker does not identify any statements as retaliatory other than those he cited in the defamation claim. On this basis, we assume that the defamatory statements described in the retaliation claim are the same as those discussed above in the context of his defamation claim, including Pugliese's February 2016 e-mail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The defamation allegation is \"not merely incidental\" to Laker's retaliation claim in that it does more than merely \"provide context.\" (\n   <em>\n    Baral\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 1 Cal.5th at p. 394,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=205%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20475\">\n    205 Cal.Rptr.3d 475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=376%20P.3d%20604\">\n    376 P.3d 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Bel Air Internet\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    LLC v.

This allegation appears as the first item in Laker's list of retaliatory actions taken against him by the University rather than in the background section of his complaint. Furthermore, if Laker could prove this allegation with admissible evidence, it could support his retaliation claim. We have already determined, in our analysis of the defamation cause of action, that the statements Laker identifies as defamatory were part of the protected activity of the Aptekar investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Applying the test articulated in\n   <em>\n    Park\n   </em>\n   , we conclude that the defendants' conduct underlying the defamation allegation in Laker's retaliation claim arises from\n   protected activity. ( \u00a7 425.16, subd. (b).) Just as in\n   <em>\n    Okorie\n   </em>\n   , protected speech forms the basis of the defamation allegation in Laker's retaliation claim. The defamatory statements were explicitly alleged to be the \"injury-producing conduct.\" (\n   <em>\n    Okorie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 14 Cal.App.5th at p. 593,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513761\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/222/475/\">\n    222 Cal.Rptr.3d 475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Therefore, Laker's allegation that the University retaliated against him by defaming him is \"subject to section 425.16.\" (\n   <em>\n    Sheley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 9 Cal.App.5th at p. 1170,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=215%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20606\">\n    215 Cal.Rptr.3d 606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) With respect to this aspect of Laker's retaliation claim, the University has met the prima facie test required by the anti-SLAPP statute, and the trial court erred in its finding to the contrary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Turning to the second step of the anti-SLAPP analysis, we review whether Laker has shown that he has a probability of prevailing on his retaliation claim based on the defamatory statements. In cases such as this where there are allegations of \"both protected and unprotected activity, the plaintiff is required to establish a probability of prevailing on any claim for relief based on allegations of protected activity. Unless the plaintiff can do so, the claim and its corresponding allegations must be stricken.\" (\n   <em>\n    Baral\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 1 Cal.5th at p. 395,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=205%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20475\">\n    205 Cal.Rptr.3d 475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=376%20P.3d%20604\">\n    376 P.3d 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) We conclude that Laker cannot meet his burden. As discussed above, the defamatory statements at issue in his retaliation claim are the same as those in his defamation claim, which we have already concluded are protected by the absolute privilege set forth in Civil Code section 47, subdivision (b)(3). Accordingly, we reverse the trial court's order denying the University's motion to strike\n   the retaliation claim, but only as to the allegation in that claim relating to defamatory statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Attorney's Fees\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The University and McVey argue they are entitled to attorney's fees and costs as prevailing parties on their anti-SLAPP motion.
