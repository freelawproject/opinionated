(24 Mise 2d 430.) Coon, J. P., Gibson and Reynolds, JJ., concur; Herlihy, J. I concur in the result. I have serious doubts as to that part of the decision which invalidated the signatures due to the mistake made by the authenticating witness but which in this case would not change the result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
