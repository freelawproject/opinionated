His appeal to the county court was there dismissed on the ground that his appeal Dond was defective; from which judgment of the county court appeal is prosecuted to this court. A motion is made by the Assistant Attorney General to dismiss this appeal because this court has no jurisdiction of appeals from . justices\u2019 courts wherein the fine, exclusive of costs, does not exceed one hundred dollars. <em>Held, </em>that Section 16 of Article 5 of the Constitution, which provides \u201cthat in all appeals from justices\u2019 courts there shall be a trial <em>de novo </em>in the county court, and when the judgment rendered or the fine imposed by the county court shall not exceed one hundred dollars, the trial shall be final,\u201d applies only to trials <em>de novo </em>on the merits in the county court, and not to such proceedings as were bad in this case. In olher words, an appeal lies to this court from a judgment of the county court, dismissing an appeal from a justice\u2019s court, when the amount of the judgment was for more than twenty dollars; wherefore the motion t.o dismiss this appeal is overruled. ,</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b524-15\">2 Appeal Bond.\u2014In order to hind a party to a written contract it is not necebitu-y that nis \u00a1-\u00a1\"nature should appear at the end of it.

Defendant was tried, and his punishment assessed at a fine of twenty-five dollars, in the justice\u2019s court. He appealed to the county court, where his appeal was dismissed because of insufficiency of his appeal bond, and he nas appealed to this court from the judgment of the county court dismissing his appeal in that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-13\">A motion is now made by the Assistant Attorney General to dismiss the appeal in this court because this court has no jurisdiction, inasmuch as the fine, exclusive of costs in the justice\u2019s court, did not exceed one hundred dol\u00eda,rs.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-14\">It is provided by the sixteenth section of article five of the Constitution that in all appeals from justices\u2019 courts there shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>be a trial <em>de novo </em>in the county court, and when the judgment rendered or fine imposed by the county court shall not exceed one hundred dollars the trial shall be final,\u201d Had there been a trial <em>de novo </em>and a fine of less than one hundred dollars, then such trial would have been final, and this court would have had no jurisdiction on this appeal. But there was no trial <em>de novo </em>in the county court; the appeal was dismissed, without a trial, for supposed errors in the appeal bond. \u201c The limitation imposed by Section 16, Article 5, of the Constitution, on appeals from the county court in causes appealed from a justice\u2019s court, applies only when there has been a trial <em>de novo </em>on the merits and the recovery was less than one hundred dollars. An appeal lies to the Court of Appeals from a judgment of the county court dismissing an appeal from a justice\u2019s court where the amount of the judgment was for more than twenty dollars. <em>(Pevito </em>v. <em>Rodgers, 52 </em>Texas, 581.)</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">The motion of the Assistant Attorney Genera* to dismiss this appeal is not well taken, and is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Did the county court err in dismissing the appeal from the justice\u2019s court because the appeal bond was insufficient and defective? Two objections were made to the bond in the motion to dismiss, viz: 1. Because George Tayior, the principal, had signed his name in the centre instead of at the end of the bond. 2. Because the bond did not show that it had been approved by the justice trying the case below.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\"><em>\u201c </em>In order to bind a party to a written contract it is not necessary that his signature should appear at the end of it. If he writes his name in any part of the agreement it may be taken as his signature, provided it was there written for the purpose of giving authenticity to the instrument, and thus operating as a signature.\u201d <em>(Fulshear </em>v. <em>Randon, </em>18 Texas, 275.)</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">Hor was the second ground of the motion well taken. In <em>Dyches </em>v. <em>The State, </em>24 Texas, 266, it was held that \u201cthe statute requiring the justice to approve the bond taken by him from a party held to appear in the district court, etc., is directory, and the bond is not a nullity because the magistrate neglects to endorse his approval on it. The approval may well be inferred from his return of the bond to the district court.\u201d <em>(Doughty </em>v. <em>The State, </em>33 Texas, 1; <em>Cundiff </em>v. <em>The State, </em>38 Texas, 641.)</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">Because the county court erred in dismissing the appeal from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>the justice\u2019s court, for supposed defect in the appeal bond, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for a trial <em>denovo </em>on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Opinion delivered June 21, 1884.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
