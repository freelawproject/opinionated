The note was indorsed in blank by the payee and delivered to Bobert G. Lambe to be used as collateral in securing money already borrowed by appellant from appellee. It was to take the place of a note executed by the father of the Steins, who was then dead, which with other security, had been delivered to the husband of appellee as her agent, as collateral for $2,000 borrowed by appellant from appellee. The original Stein note was not satisfactory collateral, on account of interest unpaid for several years, and was therefore returned after the money had been loaned. E. C. Lambe was a lawyer, apparently in good standing, and had acted for appellant before in making a loan and acted for her in securing this loan.</p><p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-4\" pgmap=\"175\">When the new Stein note was executed it was placed in his hands, and at his suggestion and under his advice, was indorsed in blank by appellant. Instead of delivering it as collateral he inserted the name of J. 0. Burnside over the name of the payee on the back of the note and sold it to Burnside and converted the proceeds to his own use.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-5\" pgmap=\"175\">Subsequently appellant paid the loan to appellee and called on Lambe for the Stein note. He first told her that it was on file at the court house. Appellant called on him several times for the note and was put off with different excuses. She finally heard that it was sold to Burnside, and again calling on Lambe, he promised to pay her in a couple of days. Hot receiving the note nor its proceeds appellant brought this suit.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-6\" pgmap=\"175\">The gist of the declaration is, in substance, an averment by the plaintiff that the defendant received the note and wrongfully converted it to her use. Defendant denied ever receiving the note. A jury was waived and trial by the court and judgment for the defendant.</p><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b175-7\" pgmap=\"175\">James McHale and J. Gr.

If he was the agent of appellee she\u201e is liable for its conversion. If he was not her agent she is not liable. The onus of proving that he was the agent of appellee was upon appellant. It is a question of the weight of evidence. The trial court upon this issue found for appellee. We see no valid reason for disagreeing with this finding. Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
