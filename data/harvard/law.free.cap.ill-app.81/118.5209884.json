The order approving the award is in effect the allowance of a claim, or judgment for the amount; the claim is against the estate of her deceased husband. If there is no estate she can not enforce its collection; if, after taking some personal property, nothing remains of the estate except land, the residue of her award is a subsisting claim against the estate, for the payment of which the land of the decedent may be sold.

Judd v. Ross et al., 146 Ill. 49; Bursen v. Goodspeed, 60 Ill. 277.</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b125-7\" pgmap=\"125\">Statement of the Case.\u2014On the 17th day of August, 1886, Leonard Tarrant died seized of 112 acres of land, sought to be partitioned by the plaintiffs in error. This land constituted the homestead of the said Leonard Tar-rant at the time of his death, and continued to be so occupied by his widow, Sarah Tarrant, up to the time of her death, March 31, 1896.</p><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b125-9\" pgmap=\"125\">By the last will of said Leonard Tarrant all his estate was devised to his widow, Sarah, to hold during her natural life, with remainder to his heirs. She probated the will, and on the 20th day of September, 1886, took out letters. Subsequently she filed inventory, appraisejnent bill and sale bill, and gave notice of the probating of claims against said estate. The appraisers awarded the widow \u00a7472, which was approved by the County Court, and estimated the value of the personal property at \u00a7226.75.</p><p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b126-4\" pgmap=\"126\">The inventory tiled by the widow and approved by the court showed that all of the real estate was embraced in the homestead. On March 31, 1896, the administratrix died, without having settled the estate.</p><p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b126-5\" pgmap=\"126\">About 1890 Sarah married J. M. Benfro, who survived her, and took out letters of administration on her estate. On April 23, 1896, M. M. Kelly was\" appointed administrator c\u00ede bonis non of the estate of Leonard Tarrant. He tiled his account as such administrator, showing a balance due \u00f3n the widow\u2019s award to Sarah Tarrant, after exhausting the personal assets, of $230.27, and charging interest to the \"amount of $142.43. This was the only debt claimed against the estate.</p><p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b126-6\" pgmap=\"126\">Subsequently the defendant in error filed his petition in the County Court praying for an order to sell the land to pay the debts of Leonard Tarrant. The only debt claimed to be unpaid was a balance on the widow\u2019s allowance of $230.27. Subsequently the heirs of Leonard Tarrant filed their petition in the Circuit Court of Effingham County for petition of the land in question, making M. M. Kelly, administrator de bonis non, a party defendant. He answered, setting up the claim for the unpaid portion of the widow\u2019s allowance, and praying that it \"be declared a lien upon the land, or if the land /was sold, that it be first paid out of the proceeds of sale. \u2022 .</p><p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b126-7\" pgmap=\"126\">It was stipulated that the decree of the Circuit Court reserving the right to appeal, should be conclusive as to the rights of the respective parties. The only question involved then'is whether the allowances of the award is a subsisting lien upon the real estate sought to be partitioned.</p> <opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b126-8\" pgmap=\"126\">Mr. Justice Worthington</author> <p id=\"Aps\" pgmap=\"126\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p> <p id=\"b126-9\" pgmap=\"126(56) 127(108)\">That the award was in the first instance a lien is not disputed. It is claimed, however, that the widow having failed to enforce this lien for nearly ten years, that it has been lost by her laches. While there is no statute of limitations directly applicable to this class of cases, still the courts of this State have, by analogy, adopted the period of seven years as the time within which proceedings for the enforcement of the \"lien must be commenced, after the grant of letters of administration, unless the delay is satisfactorily explained. In McKean v. Vick, 108 Ill. 373, it is said : \u201c ft may be regarded the settled doctrine of this court, that when it is not satisfactorily explained, delay for seven years after the grant of letters of administration in presenting a petition of this character, is such laches as will bar any relief under it.\u201d Other cases to the same effect might be cited.</p> <p id=\"b127-4\" pgmap=\"127\">In the case at bar, there is not only no satisfactory reason given for the delay of nine years, but there is the testimony of two witnesses to the effect that the widow in her lifetime said that all she wanted was her living out of the place, and the taxes paid. By the will of her husband she enjoyed all his property, personal and real, during her life. This seems to have been all that she desired and may explain her failure to seek the collection of her unpaid award. We find no satisfactory reason for holding that the seven years rule should not be applied in this case.</p> <p id=\"b127-5\" pgmap=\"127\">The finding and judgment of the Circuit Court is therefore reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this decision.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
