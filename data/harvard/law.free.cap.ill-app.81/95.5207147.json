They were received by appellee on the 25th of January, at his store in Greenville, in this State. A part of the goods, amounting to $41.58, were immediately returned, as not corresponding with samples. The remainder of the bill, $91.90, was paid, and -this suit is to recover $41.58, the price of the goods returned.</p><p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-7\" pgmap=\"103(113) 104(94)\">E. E. Wise, a young man twenty-four years of age, a son of appellee, and a clerk in his father\u2019s store, bought the goods in question, which consisted of hats of different kinds,' referred to in the bill as \u201c lots,\u201d selecting them by samples shown him in the store of appellant. The manner of selection was as follows: Albert Rothschild, one of the plaintiffs, acting as salesman, showed to Wise, samples, one sample representing a certain \u201clot\u201d of hats. From these samples Wise bought, specifying the number to be taken from each \u201clot,\u201d which number with the number of the \u201clot,\u201d and the price, Rothschild entered on a memorandum. After the purchase was completed, the memorandum was given to the stock clerk who took from the different \u201c lots \u201d the number specified in the memorandum and placed them in a stall, where they were packed and shipped to the purchaser. Neither Wise nor Eothschild had anything more to do with the hats after making the memorandum. From the record it appears that there were forty-one different \u201c lots \u201d selected from, and the hats sent from thirteen \u201c lots \u201d were returned, as not corresponding to the. samples shown of these \u201c lots.\u201d</p> <opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b104-5\" pgmap=\"104\">Me. Justice Worthington</author> <p id=\"ADm\" pgmap=\"104\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p> <p id=\"b104-6\" pgmap=\"104\">It will be seen from this statement that Eothschild, the salesman, and Wise, the acting purchaser, are the only two persons who know of their own knowledge, what hats were bought. Eothschild testifies that the hats shipped were of the same kind and quality as the samples shown. Wise, the purchaser, testifies that the hats sent out of thirteen \u201cdots \u201d were not. That the hats from these thirteen \u201c lots \u201d were of the vintage of 1895, while he bought hats for the market of 1896.</p> <p id=\"b104-8\" pgmap=\"104\">The jury believed Wise, and found for appellee. We see no reason for interfering with their finding upon this issue.</p> <p id=\"b104-9\" pgmap=\"104\">Appellant insists that the court erred in holding that appellee could receive a part of the goods sold that were according to sample, and could return those that were not. In other words, appellant insists that the contract of purchase was an entire contract, and not divisible, and that appellee had to take all the hats or none. This is not the law as we understand it, in a case like this.</p> <p id=\"b104-10\" pgmap=\"104\">If the hats purchased had been p.11 of one \u201clot,\u201d the contention of appellant would be correct. In such case the purchaser, if he desired to rescind the contract, would have to return the entire \u201c lot.\u201d This is. decided by Harzfield v. Converse, 105 Ill. 536, and Wolf v. Dietzsch, 75 Ill. 207 cited by appellant.</p> <p id=\"b104-11\" pgmap=\"104(13) 105(31)\">In Telford v. Albro, 60 Ill. App. 359, a part of the neck wear had been sold, and the remainder was burned up with the store. The question presented in the case at bar did not come up in the cases above referred to.</p> <p id=\"b105-4\" pgmap=\"105\">In Story on Contracts, Vol. 1, Sec. 24, it is said :</p> <blockquote id=\"b105-5\" pgmap=\"105\">\u201cIn this diversity of cases, it is difficult to state any rule. But on the whole the weight of opinion and the more reasonable rule would seem to be, that where there is a purchase of different articles, at different prices, at the same time, the contract would be several as to each article, unless the taking of the whole was rendered essential, either by the nature of the subject-matter or by the act of the parties.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b105-6\" pgmap=\"105\">Many authorities might be cited in support of this proposition. We cite only the following:</p> <blockquote id=\"b105-7\" pgmap=\"105\">\u201c An agreement is divisible when it embraces several undertakings each supported by a distinct consideration.\u201d McDaniels v. Whitney, 38 Iowa, 64.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b105-8\" pgmap=\"105\">\u201c When many different articles are bought at the same time for different prices, even if they are articles of the same general description, so that a warranty that they are all of a particular quality would apply to each, the contract is not entire, but it is in effect a separate contract for each article sold.\u201d Young &amp; Co. v. Wakefield, 121 Mass. 91.</blockquote> <p id=\"b105-9\" pgmap=\"105\">In Bank of Antigo v. Union Trust Co., 149 Ill. 348, the court say:</p> <blockquote id=\"b105-10\" pgmap=\"105\">\u201c The rule' laid down by Parsons, Vol. 2, p. 257, is, \u2018 If the part to be performed by one party consists of several distinct and separate items, and the price to be paid by the other is apportioned to each item to be performed, or is left to be implied by law, such a contract will generally be held to be several.\u2019\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b105-11\" pgmap=\"105\">And Wharton says, Sec. 748, Laws of Contracts :</p> <blockquote id=\"b105-12\" pgmap=\"105\">\u201c When a consideration is divisible and the price can be apportioned, then if a distinct divisible portion of the consideration fails, the price paid for such portion can be recovered back,\u201d and that \u201cin cases * * * in which the consideration is divisible, the purchaser may elect to take what can be delivered to him, and in such case, if the purchase money has been paid, he can recover back the excess, or if there has been no payment he can defend pro tanto.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b105-13\" pgmap=\"105\">This case also cites Young &amp; Co. v. Wakefield, cited supra.</p> <p id=\"b106-3\" pgmap=\"106\">In the case \u00e1t bar the hats from each \u201c'lot \u201d had a separate price, and were put down on the memorandum as of that \u201c lot \u201d with the price annexed. The hats in each \u201c lot \u201d were in effect separate sales. There is nothing to indicate that the price of the hats in any one \u201c lot,\u201d was in any way influenced by the price of hats in any other \u201c lot,\u201dor that their sale depended upon the sale of liats from other \u201c lots.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b106-4\" pgmap=\"106\">The bargain and sale lacked the elements of an entire contract and could be affirmed in part and rescinded in part;</p> <p id=\"b106-5\" pgmap=\"106\">The introduction of certain bills by appellee to prove a custom of wholesale dealers in St. Louis to take back goods when not satisfactory was objected to by appellant.</p> <p id=\"b106-6\" pgmap=\"106\">It was error to admit these bills for that purpose, but in view of all the testimony in the case we'do not think it reversible error.</p> <p id=\"b106-7\" pgmap=\"106\">J udgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
