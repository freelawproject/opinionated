McKinney, having embezzled the sum of $91,702.06 from his employer, reported and paid taxes on the fund in 1966. He refunded the entire amount in 1969 and now seeks to be made whole tax-wise under the terms of a special statutory relief provision of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-10\">The facts are not in dispute. Over a period of years McKinney, who was employed by the Texas Employment Commission, arranged matters in such a manner that in 1966 he was able to siphon off $91,702.06 of the state\u2019s money. Because of the requirements of the federal taxing statutes following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>James v. United States, </em>366 U.S. 213, 81 S.Ct. 1052, 6 L.Ed.2d 246 (1961), McKinney reported the embezzled funds as \u201cmiscellaneous income\u201d on his 1966 federal income tax return. Subsequently, the embezzlement was discovered, and McKinney was convicted in the state courts of embezzlement. He repaid the emb\u00e9zzled funds in 1969. On his tax return for that year, taxpayer claimed a deduction for this repayment as a trade or business loss, resulting in a reported \u201cnet operating loss\u201d for that year. He then claimed a net operating loss carryback deduction for 1966. Alternatively, taxpayer filed a claim for refund for 1969, claiming the benefit of the provisions of \u00a7 1341.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1325-18\">The Government does not dispute the taxpayer\u2019s entitlement to a deduction for the year 1969, but this does not give him the full benefits that would be enjoyed if he could treat the loss as if it had occurred in 1966, the year of payment. The taxpayer has abandoned his original claim that he is entitled to a carryback of the loss as a \u201cnet operating loss,\u201d a point decided against him by the trial court. He therefore relies solely on his contention that by the enactment of \u00a7 1341, Congress intended that a taxpayer, who reported as income funds acquired by theft or embezzlement, be able to obtain, if required subsequently to refund the amounts, the full benefit of a deduction in the year of repayment that would effectively wipe out the economic loss suffered from the prior payment of taxes on the illegally acquired funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-19\">In 1954, Congress enacted \u00a7 1341 to alleviate perceived inequities created by operation of the so-called \u201cclaim-of-right doctrine.\u201d The classic formulation of the doctrine is that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1325-20\">If a taxpayer receives earnings <em>under a claim of right and without restriction as to its disposition, </em>he has received <em>income </em>which he is required to return, even though it may still be claimed that he is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1242\">*1242</page-number>not entitled to retain the money, and even though he may still be adjudged liable to restore its equivalent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1326-4\"><em>North American Oil Consolidated v. Burnet, </em>286 U.S. 417, 424, 52 S.Ct. 613, 615, 76 L.Ed. 1197 (1952) (emphasis added). The statute merely allows, as an alternative to a deduction in the year of repayment, taxes for the current year to be reduced by the amount taxes were increased in the year of receipt because the funds in question were included in gross income.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-5\">The Court first applied the doctrine in the context of embezzled funds in <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Wilcox, </em>327 U.S. 404, 66 S.Ct. 546, 90 L.Ed. 752 (1946). In <em>Wilcox </em>the IRS argued that embezzled funds should be treated as taxable income to the wrongdoer under \u00a7 22(a) of the Code. The Court disagreed. After noting that the essence of taxable income is \u201cthe accrual of some gain, profit or benefit to the taxpayer,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 407, 66 S.Ct. at 548, the Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1326-6\">For present purposes . . . it is enough to note that a taxable gain is conditioned upon (1) the presence of a claim of right to the alleged gain and (2) the absence of a definite, unconditional obligation to repay or return that which would otherwise constitute a gain. <em>Without some bona fide legal or equitable claim, . . . </em>the taxpayer cannot be said to have received any gain or profit within the reach of \u00a7 22(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1326-9\">It is <em>obvious that the taxpayer in this instance, in embezzling the $12,748.60, received the money without any semblance of a bona fide claim of right. </em>And he was at all times under an unqualified duty and obligation to repay the money</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1326-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 408, 66 S.Ct. at 549 (emphasis added) (citation omitted). On this basis the Court concluded that embezzled money did not constitute taxable income to the embezzler.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-11\">Fifteen years later, the Court expressly overruled <em>Wilcox </em>in <em>James v. United States, </em>366 U.S. 213, 81 S.Ct. 1052, 6 L.Ed.2d 246 (1961). The Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1326-12\">A gain \u201cconstitutes taxable income when its recipient has such control over it that, as a practical matter, he derives readily realizable economic value from it,\u201d <em>Rut-kin </em>v. <em>United States, </em>[343 U.S. 130, 137, 72 S.Ct. 571, 575, 96 L.Ed. 833]. Under these broad principles, we believe that petitioner\u2019s contention, that all unlawful gains are taxable except those resulting from embezzlement, should fail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1326-13\">When a taxpayer acquires earnings, lawfully or unlawfully, without the consensual recognition, express or implied, of an obligation to repay and without restriction as to their disposition, \u201che has received income which he is required to return, even though it may still be claimed that he is not entitled to retain the money, and even though he may still be adjudged liable to restore its equivalent.\u201d <em>North American Oil Consolidated v. Burnet, </em>[286 U.S. 417, 424, 52 S.Ct. 613, 615, 76 L.Ed. 1197]. <em>Corliss v. </em>Bowers, [281 U.S. 376, 378, 50 S.Ct. 336, 74 L.Ed. 916]. This standard brings wrongful appropriations within the broad sweep of \u201cgross income\u201d .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1326-14\"><em>Id. </em>at 219, 81 S.Ct. at 1055.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-15\">Because the benefit conferred by the statute depends upon whether it \u201cappear[s] that the taxpayer had an unrestricted right to such item\u201d, it is necessary for us to determine whether in its <em>James </em>decision, the Supreme Court modified its conclusion in <em>Wilcox </em>that in embezzling funds a taxpayer \u201creceived the money without any semblance of a bona fide claim of right\u201d, 327 U.S. at 408, 66 S.Ct. at 549, or whether the Court merely said that embezzled funds are to be returned for tax purposes as part of gross income regardless of whether they were held under a \u201cclaim of right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-16\">We agree with the reasoning of the trial court here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1326-17\">The decision ... in <em>James </em>cannot properly be read to say that the Supreme Court concluded that embezzled funds are held under a claim of right. On the contrary, <em>James </em>does not in any way contradict or weaken the Court\u2019s statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1243\">*1243</page-number>in <em>Wilcox </em>that embezzled funds are not held under a claim of right; it only says that this is immaterial in determining whether embezzled funds must be included in gross income.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1327-5\">The <em>James </em>Court merely held that the term \u201cgross income\u201d in the tax statute was broad enough to include money received \u201cwhen its recipient has such control over it that, as a practical matter, he derives readily realizable economic value from it,\u201d 366 U.S. at 219, 81 S.Ct. at 1055, without regard to whether its recipient had a \u201cclaim of right\u201d to the funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-6\">Since the language of \u00a7 1341 makes its benefits available to a taxpayer only if he \u201chad an unrestricted right to such item\u201d, we agree with the trial court that the plain language of the statute prevents its application in favor of appellant. The language of \u00a7 1341(a)(1), /. e. \u2018.\u2018because it appeared that the taxpayer had an unrestricted right to such item\u201d, must necessarily mean \u201cbecause it appeared <em>[to the </em>taxpayer] that [he] had an unrestricted right to such item.\u201d When the item was embezzled funds it is clear that it could not appear <em>to the taxpayer </em>that he had any right to the funds, much less \u201can unrestricted right\u201d to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-7\">This contention is consistent too with the applicable regulations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1327-8\">(a) <em>In general. </em>(1) If, during the taxable year, the taxpayer is entitled . to a deduction of more than $3,000 because of the restoration to another of an item which was <em>included </em>in the taxpayer\u2019s gross income for a prior taxable year . <em>under a claim of right, </em>the tax imposed . . . shall be ... .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1327-9\">(2) For the purpose of this section <em>\u201cincome included under a claim of right\" </em>means an item included in gross income because it <em>appeared </em>from all the facts available in the year of inclusion that the taxpayer had an unrestricted right to such item .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1327-10\">Treas. Reg. \u00a7\u00a7 1.1341-l(a)(l), (2) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-11\">The taxpayer contends that, notwithstanding the plain meaning of the words, the statute should be interpreted to read that whenever gains are enjoyed by a taxpayer which, under applicable laws, he is required to report as income, this requirement of itself converts such gains into income held under a \u201cclaim of right.\u201d The chronology of the two Supreme Court cases and the enactment of this statute precludes such a determination. At the time this statute was enacted, <em>Wilcox </em>was the law. Embezzled funds were not reportable as income. It could not have been the intent of Congress to give the benefits of this new relief section to holders of embezzled funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-13\">Our conclusion comports with the prior affirmance by us of the judgment of the district court in <em>Hankins v. United States, </em>403 F.Supp. 257 (N.D.Miss.1975). In that case, on facts identical to those in the present case, the district court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1327-14\">[A]s an embezzler, plaintiff never received his employer\u2019s funds under a claim of right and the benefits of Section 1341 of the Code (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341) are not available to him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1327-15\"><em>Id. </em>at 259. Our court affirmed <em>Hankins </em>without opinion. 531 F.2d 573 (5th Cir. 1976). Since it is not clear that the trial court in <em>Hankins </em>was required to pass on the precise issue before us, we consider it appropriate to deal with the matter at greater length here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-16\">The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1325-12\">.
