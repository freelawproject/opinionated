CAMPBELL,</author>\n<p id=\"A8a\">Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">Over two and one-half years after his 1973 trial and conviction on drug-related charges,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thomas W. Thornburg filed this motion to vacate sentence under \u00a7 2255<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or, in the alternative, for writ of error coram nobis, in the District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. His principal contention was and is that \u201c[a]t least one and possibly as many as four jurors who were empaneled in the jury that rendered the verdict of guilt in this case were unable to understand the English language.\u201d Thornburg argues that this alleged defect deprived him of his fifth amendment right to due process and his sixth amendment right to a jury trial. The district court referred the matters raised in the motion to a magistrate who, after close examination of the records of trial and voir dire, and of preempanelment questionnaires that had been completed by the jurors, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1869(h), recommended that \u201cthe petition be denied as frivolous, without a hearing.\u201d The district court in its order confirmed that conclusion, and dismissed the complaint. We affirm.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-14\">Appellate counsel for Thornburg, who is different from trial counsel, maintains that in September of 1975, two years after trial, he, for the first time, became aware of information in the record and in the juror qualification forms that raised suspicions about the linguistic competence of three jurors and one alternate juror. His suspicions stemmed from (1) a short written exchange in Spanish between jurors and judge that occurred during the jury\u2019s deliberations; (2) the discovery that two jurors (including the alternate juror, who never served on the panel) had previously been disqualified from jury service because of inadequate English language skills; and (3) the discovery that two other jurors had written on their juror qualifications forms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>the answers \u201ca little\u201d and \u201ca little \u2014 not to [sic] much\u201d in response to the question whether they could \u201cread, write, speak, and understand\u201d the English language.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">In Puerto Rico, where the customary language is Spanish, not English, prospective jurors are routinely examined by a district judge, in English, with an eye to their proficiency in spoken English, before being admitted to the venire. <em>See United States v. Ramos Colon, </em>415 F.Supp. 459, 466-67 (D.P.R.1976); <em>United States v. Valentine, </em>288 F.Supp. 957, 965, 968-69 (D.P.R.1968). This is done after they have submitted their juror qualification forms and have been provisionally approved by the clerk. <em>Cf. Plan Prescribing Method for Composition of Jury Wheels and Selection of Jurors </em>for the District of Puerto Rico \u00b6\u00b6 4, 6. That this was done here is not contested, although we do not have a record of the judge\u2019s examination since the pertinent transcripts were discarded, apparently in usual course, prior to Thornburg\u2019s filing of his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">The trial transcript does reflect, however, the voir dire that immediately preceded empanelment of the jury at Thornburg\u2019s trial. Each juror was individually asked in English to stand up, state his name, present address, present occupation and the name and address of his employer, or if retired, to state his former occupation and the length of his retirement. Each was asked if he or she was married, and, if so, to state the spouse\u2019s employment. All responded properly in English. They remained silent when asked as a group if they could think of \u201cany other matters which [they] should call to the court\u2019s attention which may have some bearing on [their] qualifications as . juror[s].\u201d As Thornburg concedes in his brief, \u201cthe state of the record in its present form may not now establish that the suspect jurors did not in fact understand English.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">There is a \u201cstrong policy against the too-ready impeachment of jury verdicts on the basis of . afterthoughts suggested by a disappointed litigant,\u201d <em>Peterman v. Indian Motorcycle Co., </em>216 F.2d 289, 293 (1st Cir. 1954); <em>cf. Francis v. So. Pacific Co., </em>333 U.S. 445, 450-51, 68 S.Ct. 611, 92 L.Ed. 798 (1948). This policy finds expression in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1867, which directs that challenge to a petit jury in a criminal case may be made \u201cbefore the voir dire examination begins, or within seven days after the defendant discovered or could have discovered, by the exercise of diligence, the grounds therefor, whichever is earlier . . . .\u201d Section 1867 is the \u201cexclusive means by which a person accused of a Federal crime . may challenge any jury . on the ground that such jury was not selected in conformity with the provisions of this title.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1867(e). (The \u201cprovisions of this title\u201d include the requirement of proficiency in English. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1865(b)(2), (3)). Section 1867 has thus been construed as establishing mandatory filing requirements, in the absence of good cause shown. <em>E. g., United States v. Grismore, </em>546 F.2d 844, 848 (10th Cir. 1976); <em>United States v. Noah, </em>475 F.2d 688, 695 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 1095, 94 S.Ct. 728, 38 L.Ed.2d 553 (1973); see <em>Kinty v. United Mine Workers, </em>544 F.2d 706, 722-23 (4th Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1093, 97 S.Ct. 1107, 51 L.Ed.2d 540 (1977); <em>cf. United States </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>557 F.2d 1086 (5th Cir. 1977). <em>But see United States </em>v. <em>Silverman, </em>449 F.2d 1341 (2d Cir. 1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>405 U.S. 918, 92 S.Ct. 943, 30 L.Ed.2d 788 (1972). Thornburg therefore bears a heavy burden when almost three years after his conviction he undertakes to show that the district court was obliged to hold a hearing or to grant his \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Cf. United States v. Neary, </em>552 F.2d 1184, 1189-90 (7th Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 864, 98 S.Ct. 197, 54 L.Ed.2d 139 (1978). Under the existing circumstances we find no cause to excuse him from compliance with the time limits of section 1867.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>Thornburg was represented at this trial by experienced members of the Bar of Puerto Rico. The records and transcripts relating to jury selection and competence, in particular the juror qualification forms and the now unavailable transcript of proceedings before the judge to determine proficiency, were then accessible to Thornburg and his counsel by statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1867(f); <em>Test v. United States, </em>420 U.S. 28, 95 S.Ct. 749, 42 L.Ed.2d 786 (1975). Neither at the voir dire nor at trial did Thornburg challenge any juror\u2019s competency in English, nor did he request as part of the voir dire that any special, additional inquiry into the jurors\u2019 English skills be made. In response to defense counsel\u2019s request, the district judge had explicitly ruled at the start of the voir dire that he \u201cwould allow the defense counsel and the U.S. Attorney, if he so feels, to ask further questions to the members of the jury,\u201d although \u201cthe procedure that we follow in this court in selecting the jury is that [the judge] ask[s] the voir dire.\u201d Thornburg\u2019s counsel made neither inquiry nor objection at the time of the minor interchange between court and jury in Spanish. Further, no jury members felt prompted to inform the court that they or their fellows were having difficulty. <em>Compare United States v. Silverman, supra. </em>And the experienced trial judge, who is fluent in both English and Spanish, recorded no hesitancy about any of the jurors after questioning them at the voir dire and observing them at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">It is thus too late for Thornburg to raise these issues. All of the matters which, almost three years later, have led him to question the linguistic proficiency of the jurors, could have been ascertained at the time of trial with relatively little effort. The potential for linguistic difficulty that now shocks the appellant would have been as apparent at that time as later. <em>See People of Territory of Guam v. Palomo, </em>511 F.2d 255 (9th Cir. 1975). And the effect of this delay is that the transcript of the judge\u2019s examination of the veniremen'is not available, making it very difficult to conduct a meaningful inquiry now.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u2018 In an analogous case turning on Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(2) the Supreme Court said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-9\">\u201cIf [the rule\u2019s] time limits are followed, inquiry into an alleged defect may be concluded and, if necessary, cured before the court, the witnesses, and the parties have gone to the burden and expense of'a trial. If defendants were allowed to flout its time limitations, on the other hand, there would be little incentive to comply with its terms when a successful attack might simply result in a new indictment [or here, a new jury] prior to trial. Strong tactical considerations would militate in favor of delaying the raising of the claim in hopes of an acquittal, with the thought that if those hopes did not materialize, the claim could be used to upset an otherwise valid conviction at a time when reprosecution might well be different.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-10\"><em>Davis v. United States, </em>411 U.S. 233, 93 S.Ct. 1577, 36 L.Ed.2d 216 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>We hold that under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1867, appellant has waived this objection by its untimely assertion. <em>United States v. Grismore, supra; United States v. Noah, supra; see Guam v. Palomo, supra; cf. United States </em>v. <em>Tropeano, </em>476 F.2d 586 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 839, 94 S.Ct. 90, 38 L.Ed.2d 75 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">\n<em>The denial of appellant\u2019s motion to vacate sentence is affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b118-10\">. Thornburg and his codefendant, Roger Alluis, were convicted by a jury after trial in September, 1973, of conspiring to import, importation, and conspiring to possess a controlled substance (marijuana) in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952(a)(2), 960, and 846. We affirmed that conviction on July 22, 1975, in an unpublished opinion, noted at 521 F.2d 1397 (1 Cir.). The Supreme Court denied certiorari. 423 U.S. 1049, 96 S.Ct. 775, 46 L.Ed.2d 637 (1976). It was in the petition for certiorari, filed after our affirmance, that Thornburg first raised these objections to the jurors\u2019 competence. This motion to vacate sentence on these grounds was filed June 23, 1976. . (A similar motion was erroneously filed as part of the related criminal action on March 19, 1976, and was acted on by the district court on March 29, 1976 in an \u201corder instructing movant to file the \u00a7 2255 proceedings as a civil action against the United States.\u201d)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b118-11\">. Thornburg is currently on probation. His term is to expire on April 8, 1979.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b118-12\">. Thornburg also maintains that he was entitled to discovery and a hearing on the question of the jurors\u2019 competence. Because we find as a matter of law on the record as presented both to this court and the district court that Thorn-burg waived his claim, \u00a7 2255 did not entitle him to a hearing or to discovery. <em>See Miller v. United States, </em>564 F.2d 103, 105-06 (1st Cir. 1977). Further, Thornburg contends that Judge Torruella (who sat on the \u00a7 2255 motion after the trial judge, Judge Toledo, recused himself), was disqualified from sitting on the case because he would have to pass on Judge Toledo\u2019s credibility as a witness concerning the jurors\u2019 competence. Thornburg urges that all Puerto Rican federal judges were similarly disqualified. This contention is frivolous, even assuming the point is not moot in view of our finding that no hearing was required. Thorn-burg has made out none of the essential grounds for disqualification. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 144, 455(a); <em>United States v. Cowden, </em>545 F.2d 257, 265-66 (1st Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied. </em>430 U.S. 909, 97 S.Ct. 1181, 51 L.Ed.2d 585 (1977). Thornburg\u2019s ancillary claim that Judge Torruella was disqualified for his personal bias is equally without merit. United States v. <em>Cowden, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b119-11\">. Even were we to assume that Thornburg was somehow justifiably delayed until September, 1975, in uncovering these purportedly suspicious facts, he would still fail to meet ihe section 1867 requirement that challenge be made \u201cwithin seven days after the defendant discovered . . the grounds therefor.\u201d Thorn-burg was aware of the grounds at least by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>time he raised the issue of linguistic competence in his petition for certiorari, filed in September, 1975, but made no motion before the district court until March 19, 1976, see note 1, <em>supra, </em>well after the close of the seven-day period allotted by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The statute directs that a defendant wishing to challenge compliance with selection procedures prescribed for empaneling a petit jury \u201cmay move to . . . stay the proceedings against him.\u201d A petition for certiorari to the United States Supreme Court hardly complies with the statutory procedure. Even if raising the objection in the certiorari proceeding were deemed sufficient to preserve the claim temporarily, Thornburg\u2019s motion remains tardy, since he first raised the claim in the district court over two months after certiorari was denied on January 5, .1976.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b120-12\">. It should also be noted that two alternative jurors were empanelled. Though Thornburg now challenges the competency of one alternate, had a timely objection to one or more of the jurors been made and sustained during the trial, the disqualified jurors could likely have been replaced, saving the enormous burden and expense of a new trial in a lengthy, complex case. Except to avoid clear injustice, we are not disposed to entertain challenges of this nature after the trial. Strong policy favors requiring such challenges to be made at the trial itself whenever possible.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
