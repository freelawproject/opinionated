CAMPBELL,</author>\n<p id=\"Abq\">Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-27\">Plaintiff-appellee, Russell Lugo-Vina, a resident of Puerto Rico, was injured in a fall on the premises of a supermarket in Puerto Rico operated by defendant Pueblo International, Inc. (Pueblo). In this appeal, Pueblo challenges the size of the jury award and also maintains that the district court erred in finding diversity of citizenship. Because we decide that there was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>diversity jurisdiction, we do not reach the issue of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">Plaintiff filed suit in October 1974 in the District of Puerto Rico. A few months earlier the district court had consolidated five other actions against Pueblo, <em>sub nom. Agosto Alamo v. Pueblo International, Inc., </em>for determination of the diversity jurisdiction question. In an opinion filed in June 1974, visiting Judge Dalton found that the <em>Agosto Alamo </em>plaintiffs had not established that Pueblo, a Delaware corporation, had its \u201cprincipal place of business,\u201d <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(c), outside Puerto Rico. He therefore ordered the cases dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Relying on Judge Dalton\u2019s opinion, Chief Judge Toledo in March 1975 ordered plaintiff-Lugo-Vina\u2019s action dismissed. Shortly thereafter, Lugo-Vina moved to vacate the order of dismissal on grounds that visiting Judge Turk had agreed to reconsider Judge Dalton\u2019s order in <em>Agosto Alamo. </em>After Judge Turk vacated the <em>Agosto Alamo </em>dismissal, Judge Toledo vacated his dismissal in <em>Lugo-Vina. </em>A jury trial and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">The answers to interrogatories, affidavit, and deposition of Pueblo\u2019s Executive Vice President Vallecillo revealed that Pueblo in 1972,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> directly operated 20 stores in Puerto Rico. Through wholly owned subsidiaries, Pueblo operated 8 other stofes in Puerto Rico, ran a bread factory and operated several other stores and businesses in the Caribbean. Pueblo also owned all the stock in Hills Supermarkets, Inc., a New York corporation operating 71 supermarkets in the metropolitan New York area. The operation of the supermarkets and other businesses was conducted from three \u201cresponsibility centers.\u201d The Hills markets were run from a center on Long Island. The Caribbean area markets were run from Puerto Rico and the bread factory and other enterprises were also centrally directed from Puerto Rico. The heads of the \u201cresponsibility centers\u201d had membership on the Pueblo Board of Directors and the Board\u2019s Executive Committee. Neither the Board nor the Executive Committee had a situs since meetings were regularly held in New York, Puerto Rico and elsewhere. However, three, perhaps four, members of the five-member Executive Committee worked regularly in Puerto Rico. The functions of the \u201cresponsibility centers,\u201d the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee were not described in great detail. Mr. Vallecillo deposed that the responsibility centers \u201creport\u201d to the Board of Directors. He also stated that the Board and Executive Committee \u201cestablish certain policies as to how business is to be conducted in general and . . . approve budgets, establish goals for the subsidiaries and/or divisions and/or responsibility centers and . also approve, at those levels, major capital requirements . . . .\u201d Mr. Vallecillo also stated that the Executive Committee managed</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-11\">\u201cthe business and affairs of the corporation, in such manner as the Executive Committee shall deem for the best interests of the corporation in all such cases in which specific directions shall not have been given by the Board of Directors.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-12\">The record also reveals that the Chairman of the Board\u2019s office was in New York City where \u201che looks over the shoulder [of each responsibility center] to the extent that every division reports to the chairman of the board.\u201d Mr. Vallecillo also stated without elaboration that the responsibility centers report to the Board and Executive Committee through the Chairman. He stated that the Chairman had moved his office to New York because Hills had been newly acquired and its operations could be better scrutinized from New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>Remaining evidence established that both the President and Executive Vice President of Pueblo had their offices in Puerto Rico. Mr. Vallecillo also deposed that the \u201cprincipal offices\u201d of the corporation were there and that Pueblo kept all of* its books in Puerto Rico.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">On this record, Judge Turk found that Pueblo\u2019s principal place of business was New York. He based his finding on two grounds. He disregarded the formal separation between Pueblo and its wholly owned subsidiary, Hills Supermarkets, Inc. Viewing them as a single entity, Judge Turk reasoned that since the majority of supermarkets was in New York, Pueblo had its base of operations in New York. He also found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-5\">\u201cthat New York is the situs from which its activities are primarily controlled and directed. The executive offices are in New York as are the offices of the Chairman of the Board of Directors, and it is reasonable to conclude that the ultimate direction of the defendant\u2019s various business interests is established in New York.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">With respect to the first basis for the district court\u2019s finding, it erred in ignoring the separate corporate identities of Hills and Pueblo. The evidence before the district court bearing on Hills\u2019 relationship to Pueblo differs in no material respect from that before the court in <em>de Walker v. Pueblo International, Inc., </em>569 F.2d 1169 (1st Cir. 1978), where we held that it was error to look to the subsidiary\u2019s operations for purposes of determining where Pueblo\u2019s \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d was located. On the basis of <em>Walker, </em>therefore, we conclude that the district court erred insofar as its finding of diversity was based on the location of the Hills operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">We also think that the district court was clearly erroneous in finding that New York was \u201cthe situs from which [Pueblo\u2019s] activities are primarily controlled and directed.\u201d In <em>Walker we </em>were faced with the similar contention that Pueblo\u2019s \u201cnerve center\u201d was in New York. <em>See Scot Typewriter Co. v. Underwood Corp., </em>170 F.Supp. 862 (S.D.N.Y.1959); 1 J. Moore, Federal Practice \u00b6 0.77[3] (1977 ed.). In <em>Walker </em>we rejected the applicability of the \u201cnerve center\u201d test on grounds that plaintiff\u2019s evidence did not show that anything resembling a nerve center was located outside Puerto Rico. Nothing more was shown than that one of two otherwise undescribed \u201cexecutive offices\u201d was in New York. In the present case, the evidence is slightly more informative, but it does not establish that anything which may be termed a \u201cnerve center\u201d is in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-11\">The \u201cnerve center\u201d test was developed for application in cases involving \u201ca Targe corporate enterprise with complex and farflung activities\u2019 where only the \u2018nerve center\u2019 can actually be termed the \u2018principal place of business.\u2019 \u201d <em>Walker, supra </em>at 1172. Assuming without deciding that Pueblo is the type of corporation for which the \u201cnerve center\u201d test is appropriate,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we consider whether the corporation\u2019s activities in New York City were shown to constitute a \u201cnerve center.\u201d <em>Scot Typewriter Co., supra </em>at 865, stated that the \u201cnerve center\u201d is the location from which the corporation\u2019s \u201cofficers direct, control and coordinate all activities without regard to locale, in the furtherance of the corporate objective.\u201d The cases following Scot <em>Typewriter Co. </em>have found a \u201cnerve center\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>only in the locale where a substantial degree of direction of the enterprise, if not all important decision-making, occurs. <em>See </em>1 J. Moore, <em>supra, </em>\u00b6 0.77[3.-2] at 717.65-66 &amp; n.l (collecting cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">In the present case, plaintiff \u2014 who has the burden of proving diversity, <em>see Walker, supra </em>at n.4 \u2014 has established only that the Chairman of the Board has his office in New York City. No information beyond generalities such as that the responsibility centers report to the Board and Executive Committee through him has been established with respect to the Chairman\u2019s duties. In contrast, the Board and Executive Committee were shown not to have a fixed situs, in New York or elsewhere, and Pueblo\u2019s books and a majority of its Executive Committee, including its President and Executive Vice President, were established to be in Puerto Rico. Furthermore, with respect to the operation of all supermarkets directly owned by Pueblo, as well as of subsidiaries other than Hills, the responsibility centers in Puerto Rico provide the management. There'is no evidence, and it is not contended, that active managerial tasks on behalf of Pueblo itself, such as purchasing, occur in New York. On the basis of this evidence, the district court was clearly erroneous in finding that the Chairman of the Board\u2019s office was the \u201cnerve center.\u201d <em>See </em>Epstein v. <em>Guilford Industries, Inc., </em>218 F.Supp. 286, 288-89 (S.D.N.Y. 1963). Given the diffusion of power among the \u201cresponsibility centers\u201d and the lack of situs of Board of Directors and Executive Committee, no \u201cnerve center\u201d as described in the <em>Scot Typewriter Co. </em>line of cases\u2014 certainly none in New York \u2014 was established. Only Puerto Rico, the locus of Pueblo\u2019s regular operations, could therefore serve as its \u201cprincipal place of business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded with instructions to dismiss the complaint.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b126-7\">. Both Judges Dalton\u2019s and Turk\u2019s orders were based on the fruits of discovery conducted in 1972, although the <em>Lugo-Vina </em>complaint was not filed until October 1974. Jurisdiction is to be determined as of the time of the filing of the complaint. <em>See Smith v. Sperling, </em>354 U.S. 91, 93 n.1, 77 S.Ct. 1112, 1 L.Ed.2d 1205 (1957), <em>quoting Mollan v. Torrance, </em>9 Wheat. (22 U.S.) 537, 539, 6 L.Ed. 537 (1824). We assume from the willingness of counsel on both sides to rely on the discovery conducted in <em>Agosto Alamo </em>that the facts relative to Pueblo\u2019s locus remained substantially unchanged from 1972 through 1974.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b127-7\">. The \u201cnerve center\u201d test seems most appropriate in the case of a holding company. See, e. <em>g., Textron Electronics, Inc. v. Upholtz-Dickie Corp., </em>193 F.Supp. 456, 459 (D.Conn.1961); 1 J. Moore, Federal Practice, 0.77[3.-2], at 717.68 (1977 ed.). Pueblo, however, is both a holding company and an operating company. Even though the bulk of the overall entity\u2019s worth may be represented in the subsidiaries, it still seems more appropriate in a case such as this to emphasize Pueblo\u2019s role as an operating company. Plaintiff\u2019s accident occurred at a store owned and operated directly by Pueblo through executive offices in Puerto Rico. Since the injury was attributable solely to alleged misfeasance at the operational level, all of which occurred in Puerto Rico, it would seem artificial at best to shift the focus to the alleged pinnacle of corporate control in New York for purposes of determining Pueblo\u2019s citizenship. We need not, however, face this question since plaintiff failed to establish that a New York pinnacle did in fact exist.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
