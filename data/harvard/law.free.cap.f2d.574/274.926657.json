The question presented by this appeal is whether a claimant, in this case Randall L. Chance, may \u201cborrow\u201d quarters of coverage credited to him because of his military service in World War II in order to satisfy the twenty-quarter requirement, when the military service quarters do not fall within the forty-quarter period immediately preceding disability. We hold he cannot.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-15\">Randall L. Chance is a 64-year-old resident of Kennesaw, Georgia. He served in the United States Army during World War II, and thereafter worked as a civil service welder and as a self-employed land grader. On May 9,1973, Chance suffered an inferior myocardial infarction, commonly known as a heart attack, and ceased working. On July 2, 1973, he applied for social security disability insurance benefits, alleging he became disabled on May 22, 1973 because of his heart condition. The Bureau of Disability Insurance of the Social Security Administration, Department of Health, Education, and Welfare found that Chance had only seven quarters of coverage - during the relevant forty-quarter period and denied his application. Chance requested reconsideration and the Bureau affirmed its decision. On August 27, 1974, a de novo hearing was held before an administrative law judge of the Bureau of Hearings and Appeals, who affirmed the decision of the Bureau of Disability Insurance after finding that Chance had only eight quarters of coverage, and, in any event, was not disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act. The Appeals Council affirmed the decision of the administrative law judge on June 25, 1975, the administrative law judge\u2019s decision became the final decision of the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, and Chance sought review in the district court, which reversed the Secretary\u2019s decision. The Secretary now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-16\">Sections 216(i)(3)(B)(i) and 223(c)(l)(B)(i) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 416(i)(3)(B)(i) and 423(c)(l)(B)(i), provide that a claimant, in order to be. insured for disability insurance benefits, must have at least twenty quarters of coverage during the forty-quarter period immediately preceding disability.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cQuarter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>of coverage\u201d is defined in Section 213(a)(2) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 413(a)(2), as a calendar quarter in which a claimant earned $50 or more in wages or $100 or more in self-employment income. Section 217(a)(1) of the Act. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 417(a)(1), provides further in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-4\">For purposes of determining entitlement to and the amount of any monthly benefit for any month after August 1950, or entitlement to and the amount of any lump-sum death payment in case of a death after such month, payable under this subchapter on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of any World War II veteran, and for purposes of section 416(i)(3) of this title, such veteran shall be deemed to have been paid wages (in addition to the wages, if any, actually paid to him) of $160 in each month during any part of which he served in the active military or naval service of the United States during World War II.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Thus an American serviceman\u2019s earnings while serving in World War II may count toward satisfying the Social Security Act\u2019s twenty-quarter coverage requirement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court, in reversing the Secretary\u2019s decision, found in part that Chance had compiled twelve quarters of coverage from his military service during 1941-1944 in World War II, which, when coupled with the eight other quarters of coverage found by the administrative law judge, gave him the twenty quarters necessary for insured status at the time he incurred his disability. Chance did not earn the quarters credited to him as a result of his military service during the forty-quarter period immediately preceding his disability, however. In effect, then, the lower court found that military service quarters of coverage are peripatetic in nature, and that a claimant may cast them forward to apply to a later forty-quarter period.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-14\">In providing quarters of coverage for World War II service, Congress intended only that veterans should have the same status for the purpose of qualifying for social security benefits as they might have had if military service had not interrupted their civilian employment. <em>See </em>S.Rep.No. 1987, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>[1954] <em>U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News, </em>pp. 3710, 3785; S.Rep.No.1669, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>[1950] <em>U.S.Code Cong.Serv. </em>pp. 3287, 3307. To allow a veteran to apply his military service quarters to a forty-quarter period other than that in which they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>earned would treat a veteran differently by placing him in a privileged position with respect to other employees for the purpose of receiving disability insurance benefits. We find no evidence either from the Social Security Act or from its legislative history that Congress intended such inequality.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Jones v.
