Magistrate Maxwell dismissed appellants\u2019 complaint<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> against three defendants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Then, after a jury verdict of \u201cnot cause for action\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> against the remaining two defendants was recorded by the clerk of the district court, the magistrate denied appellants\u2019 motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-26\">With the parties\u2019 consent, District Judge John T. Curtin originally referred the case to the magistrate for trial with a six-member jury. We will assume that the district court had authority to appoint the magis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>trate as a special master.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We will further assume that trial by jury before a magistrate, with the parties\u2019 consent, is proper.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nevertheless, we decline to consider the merits at this time because this court lacks jurisdiction to hear the appeal. We therefore remand to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">The crucial inquiry is whether a magistrate\u2019s orders and rulings must be reviewed and adopted by the referring district court before appellate jurisdiction will lie. The starting point of this inquiry is consideration of the nature of circuit court jurisdiction. It is clear that our jurisdiction must be predicated on a statute. 9 <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>1110.01, at 47 (2d ed. 1975). At first glance, the general statutory grant authorizing appeals from \u201cfinal decisions of the district courts of the United States,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, appears inapplicable because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>the magistrate\u2019s order is not a decision by a federal district court. This conclusion has been reached by other circuits. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Reeds, </em>552 F.2d 170, 171 (7th Cir. 1977) (per curiam); <em>McCall v. Cudd, </em>544 F.2d 934 (8th Cir. 1976); <em>Swanson &amp; Youngdale, Inc. v. Seagrave Corp. </em>542 F.2d 1008 (8th Cir. 1976); <em>Reciprocal Exchange v. Noland, </em>542 F.2d 462, 463 (8th Cir. 1976); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Haley, </em>541 F.2d 678 (8th Cir. 1974); <em>cf. United States v. Various Documents, Papers and Books of Briggs &amp; Turivas, </em>278 F. 944 (7th Cir. 1921) (order of Commissioner not directly appealable), <em>cert. denied, </em>258 U.S. 617, 42 S.Ct. 271, 66 L.Ed. 793 (1922).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">However, at least two arguments can be made that the Federal Magistrates Act as it existed at the time of the reference, Pub. L.No. 90-578, \u00a7\u00a7 631-39, 82 Stat. 1107-14 (1968), and as it exists today, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 631-39, in conjunction with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, sanctions appeals directly from a magistrate\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because the Act provides that magistrates \u201cmay be assigned . such additional duties as are not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> proponents of greater power for magistrates urge that it is not impermissible to empower a magistrate to enter final judgment, at least when the parties have consented and the district court has so ordered in its initial reference.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, final judgments of magistrates would be treated as \u201cfinal decisions of the district courts,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, making direct appellate review proper.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-16\">We find it unnecessary to address this argument beyond noting that it cannot prevail on the instant facts. Section 636(b) permits <em>\u201cassign [ment]\u2019\u2019 </em>of \u201cadditional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>duties.\u201d Here, the reference by Judge Cur-tin <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> neither explicitly nor implicitly authorized the entry of final judgment by the magistrate,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and there has never been any consent by the parties to conferral of such authority on the magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">A second theory supporting the finality of proceedings before a magistrate distinguishes between jury and nonjury trials. Assuming the propriety of jury trials before magistrates, see note 6 &amp; accompanying text <em>supra, </em>Rule 58(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the argument runs, mandates automatic entry of a jury verdict by the clerk of the referring district court, unless the district judge provides otherwise. In other words, entry of judgment is ministerial only, not requiring any oversight by the district judge. Thus, the verdict would be an appealable \u201cdecision of the district court,\u201d like any other verdict recorded under Rule 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">We find this construction of Rule 58 unconvincing. The mandate for automatic entry of judgment by the clerk without court order presupposes a verdict resulting from a judicial proceeding, or at least judicial consideration of the controversy and proceedings before the magistrate prior to the clerk\u2019s act.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> If the jury verdict as incorporated into the judgment order were a final decision of the district court, the magistrate\u2019s various rulings and orders \u2014 such as the dismissal of the complaint against certain defendants here and the denial of the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, <em>see </em>notes 2-4 &amp; accompanying text <em>supra </em>\u2014 would never be reviewed by the district judge. Thus, there would be no judicial proceeding or even judicial consideration prior to the clerk\u2019s entry of judgment in contravention of Rule 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-12\">District court review after a trial before a magistrate or master is not a meaningless exercise.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Rather, the procedure comports with the fundamental congressional policy underlying the Magistrates Act \u2014 to <em>aid </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>courts in their ultimate decisionmaking function.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Subjecting the acts of magistrates and masters to district court scrutiny also avoids possible constitutional infirmities.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In addition, such review permits correction of possible error at the earliest time. Thus, an improper verdict may be detected and corrected before appeal.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Similarly, an erroneous charge to the jury<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> or an incorrect ruling of law<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> by the magistrate or master can be rectified by ordering a new trial. Finally, not only will review at the district court level often save parties the expense and difficulty of appeal, but it will also give the appellate court the benefit of the district court\u2019s reasoned consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-14\">We therefore conclude that direct appeal does not lie from trials before magistrates or masters, at least where the federal judge has not authorized entry of final judgment at the time of the reference with the parties\u2019 consent.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The district judge must first consider the magistrate\u2019s rulings and orders on motions and objections and then order entry of judgment.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Absent such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>review by the district court, the judgment is a nullity and nonappealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">Here, the district judge did not direct the entry of final judgment. More importantly, he did not review the rulings and orders of Magistrate Maxwell. The authorization of an appeal in forma pauperis with certification of nonfrivolity under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a), a matter also first referred to the magistrate,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> does not cure these deficiencies. Such authorization and certification do not amount to consideration by the judge of the issues presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">Appeal dismissed; judgment vacated; cause remanded for (1) consideration by district judge of the magistrate\u2019s denial of motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, dismissal of the complaint, and any other legal errors raised during the trial; and (2) entry of judgment in accordance with the district court\u2019s conclusions on review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b773-16\">. The complaint alleges that appellees unlawfully discriminated against Laura Sick on the basis of her sex by temporarily preventing her participation on the high school boys\u2019 track team and by not permitting her to compete in a school track meet.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b773-17\">. The motion to dismiss was granted on the last day of trial. There is no indication that the district court reviewed the ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b773-27\">. The judgment on the jury verdict, recorded by the clerk of the district court on October 1, 1976, stated that there was \u201cno cause for action.\u201d The amended judgment recorded on October 5, 1976, stated that there was \u201cnot cause for action.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b773-28\">. Appellants\u2019 motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict was denied on October 26, 1976. The denial was recorded by the clerk of the district court on November 9, 1976. Again, there was no review by the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b774-5\">. Under current 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(2), which was added to \u00a7 636 on October 21, 1976, Pub. L.No. 94-577, \u00a7 1, 90 Stat. 2729 (1976), the appointment undeniably would have been proper. This provision permits designation of a magistrate \u201cin any civil case, upon consent of the parties, without regard to the provisions of rule 53(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure . . . .\u201d Rule 53(b) authorizes reference to a master in jury cases \u201conly when the issues are complicated.\u201d The reference here, however, was made on July 21, 1976, and the trial was terminated by October 1, 1976. Both the reference and the trial occurred, therefore, prior to the effective date of the amendment, October 21, 1976. At the time of the reference and the trial, the statute provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-7\">Any district court of the United States, by the concurrence of a majority of all the judges of such district court, may establish rules pursuant to which any full-time United States magistrate, or, where there is no full-time magistrate reasonably available, any part-time magistrate specially designated by the court, may be assigned within the territorial jurisdiction of such court such additional duties as are not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States. The additional duties authorized by rule may include, but are not restricted to \u2014 \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-8\">(1) service as a special master in an appropriate civil action, pursuant to the applicable provisions of this title and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for the United States district courts;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-9\">(2) assistance to a district judge in the conduct of pretrial or discovery proceedings in civil or criminal actions; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-10\">(3) preliminary review of applications for posttrial relief made by individuals convicted of criminal offenses, and submission of a report and recommendations to facilitate the decision of the district judge having jurisdiction over the case as to whether there should be a hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-11\">Pub.L.No. 90-578, \u00a7 636(b), 82 Stat. 1113 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-12\">If the magistrate was appointed pursuant to then Section 636(b)(1) Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 53(b) would have been applicable; and the issues here were surely not \u201ccomplicated\u201d within the contemplation of Rule 53(b). Nevertheless, precedent in this circuit refers to the long-established practice permitting references by consent in civil cases. <em>Steger v. Orth, </em>258 F. 619, 620 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>250 U.S. 663-64, 40 S.Ct. 11, 63 L.Ed. 1196 (1919). Consensual references have apparently been used \u201c[i]n a substantial number of cases\u201d in this circuit. <em>United States v. Eastmount Shipping Corp., </em>62 F.R.D. 437, 439 (S.D.N.Y.1974). Furthermore, other circuits have upheld such references against constitutional and statutory attack. <em>See, e. g., Reciprocal Exch. v. Noland, </em>542 F.2d 462, 463 (8th Cir. 1976); <em>DeCosta v. CBS, Inc., </em>520 F.2d 499, 503-08 (1st Cir. 1975); <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 1073, 96 S.Ct. 856, 47 L.Ed.2d 83 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b774-15\">. Arguably, trial by jury before a magistrate or master is inconsistent with the Constitution\u2019s Seventh Amendment which contemplates \u201ca trial by a jury <em>... in the presence and under the superintendence of a judge </em>empowered to instruct them on the law and to advise them on the facts, and ... to set aside their verdict, if, in his opinion, it is against the law or the evidence.\u201d <em>Capital Traction Co. v. Hof, </em>174 U.S. 1, 13-14, 19 S.Ct. 580, 585, 43 L.Ed. 873 (1899) (emphasis added). A magistrate is not an Article III judge, the reasoning continues, and therefore either as such or as a master he is not the superintending judge within the purview of the Seventh Amendment. This argument, however, proves too much. It would invalidate not only Section 636(b)(2) in its present form, but also the limited references permitted by Rule 53(b). <em>See </em>note 5 <em>supra. </em>Moreover, the Seventh Amendment does not preclude the parties from waiving the right to a jury trial altogether either by stipulation, <em>Baylis v. Travellers\u2019 Ins. Co., </em>113 U.S. 316, 321, 5 S.Ct. 494, 28 L.Ed. 989 (1885) (parties may stipulate when Congress has so provided by statute); <em>In re Henderson\u2019s Distilled Spirits, </em>81 U.S. (14 Wall.) 44, 53, 20 L.Ed. 815 (1871) (parties may stipulate irrespective of any legislative provision), or by failure to demand a jury trial, Fed.R.Civ.P. 38(d). Accordingly, there is no ostensible reason for preventing consent to a jury trial before a magistrate or master, assuming the propriety of the appointment in the first instance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b775-6\">.

Co. v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>89 F.2d 163, 164 (2d Cir. 1937) (per curiam); <em>Thornton v. Nat\u2019l City Bank, </em>45 F.2d 127, 129 (2d Cir. 1930); <em>Steger v. Orth, supra, </em>258 F. at 620-21. However, these cases were decided prior to adoption of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, including Rule 53, and were based on clearly superseded former rules of practice. Moreover, the cases arose prior to adoption of the Magistrates Act, which delineates the powers of federal magistrates for the country as a whole.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b777-17\">. Our holding appears equally applicable to the Act as amended by the 1976 legislation. An underlying justification of the Act is the requirement that ultimate adjudication be exercised by the district court. In the case of references for dispositive motions and for \u201chearings,\u201d the district judge must make the final determination based on proposed findings and recommendations of the magistrate. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B). Orders concerning other pretrial matters are subject to final review by the district court, perhaps at the district court\u2019s discretion, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 636(b)(1)(A), and certainly when a party requests reconsideration, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 636(b)(1). <em>See </em>Silberman, <em>supra </em>note 9, at 1367-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-18\">Section 636(b)(2), authorizing consensual designation of a magistrate to serve as a master in civil cases, does not specify the procedures for review. However, the 1976 House Report, <em>supra </em>note 16, at 12, states that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>provisions of Fed.R.Civ.P. 53 other than Rule 53(b), see note 5 <em>supra, </em>are applicable. Rule 53 generally requires district court review, with the exception that parties may consent to final findings of fact by the master. <em>Id. </em>Rule 53(e)(4). Additionally, since references for dis-positive motions must be reconsidered by the district court, it is likely that Congress also intended review of entire trials.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b778-22\">. After appellants appealed directly from these orders, Laura Sick moved before the district court for leave to appeal in forma pauper-is. Judge Curtin referred the application to the magistrate to determine whether there were appealable issues. Following Magistrate Maxwell\u2019s recommendation, the district court granted the motion on March 30, 1977.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
