ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b709-18\">This appeal summons us to investigate the scope of Exemption 3 of the Freedom of Information Act, as revised in 1976,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in order to determine whether Section 7(c) of the Export Administration Act of 1969<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> fits within the purview of that exemption. We conclude that Section 7(c) is not a statute calling the current version of Exemption 3 into play. We accordingly reverse the judgment under review, which denied appellants access to information on the basis of Section 7(c), and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-19\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b709-20\">The Export Administration Act of 1969 endows the Secretary of Commerce with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>broad power to impose export controls in pursuit of specified objectives.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> One of these goals \u2014 congressionally declared to be \u201cthe policy of the United States\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2014 is \u201cto encourage and request domestic concerns engaged in . exporting] . to refuse to take any action which has the effect of furthering or supporting the restrictive trade practices or boycotts fostered or imposed by any foreign country against another country friendly to the United States.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Act commands the Secretary to issue regulations requiring domestic exporters asked to take any such action to report the request to the Secretary,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the Secretary has so prescribed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Substantial penalties attend any failure to furnish the information required by the regulations.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Inspired by a 1975 newspaper article, appellants sought access to these boycott-request reports and allied information<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> under the auspices of the Freedom of Information Act.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Secretary took the position that much of the desired material was \u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure\u201d within the meaning of that legislation<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> by reason of Section 7(c) of the Export Administration Act, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-6\">No department, agency, or official exercising any functions under [the Export Administration Act] shall publish or disclose information obtained hereunder which is deemed confidential or with reference to which a request for confidential treatment is made by the person furnishing such information, unless the head of such department or agency determines that the withholding thereof is contrary to the national interest.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-16\">Since the Secretary did not regard disclosure as \u201cservpng] a constructive purpose or contributing] to the national welfare,\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> he declined to release either the reports or any information gleanable from them that might identify particular exporters, although he did furnish appellants with statistical tabulations of the number and general format of boycott requests.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-17\">Appellants subsequently repaired to the District Court in an effort to establish their right of access. The court, however, was of the view that Section 7(c) was \u201ccomparable to the statute discussed [by the Supreme Court] in <em>FAA Administrator v. Robertson, . </em><footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and that under the rationale of that Opinion, Plaintiffs herein are not entitled to the documents sought by this action. . \u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It therefore granted the Secretary\u2019s motion for summary judgment,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> from which this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-19\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b710-20\">Two facets- of this case have been substantially altered by occurrences postdating the District Court\u2019s disposition. First, Congress amended Exemption 3 of the Freedom of Information Act on September 13,1976,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>in order \u201cto overrule the decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Robertson </em>. ,\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> on which the District Court had here relied. Beyond peradventure, as counsel for the Secretary conceded at oral argument, that amendment now governs.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Thus the law by which the District Court was bound is no longer controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Second, the Secretary\u2019s authority under the Export Administration Act lapsed on September 30, 1976, by expiration of the fixed terms of that legislation.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The powers that he had exercised thereunder were then continued by an Executive Order of that date<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> until Congress revivified the Secretary\u2019s role on June 22, 1977.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> This hiatus in the legislation poses the thorny question whether material that, when submitted, was \u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> lost its exemption once the statute went into remission. We need not grapple with that issue here, however, for we find that Section 7(c) of the Export Administration Act of 1969 is not a provision that \u201cspecifically exempt[s]\u201d the sought-after data from disclosure within the contemplation of amended Exemption 3 0f the Freedom of Information Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-13\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b711-14\">In <em>Robertson, </em>the Supreme Court explained the original Exemption 3<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> as a device whereby Congress \u201cpermitted] the numerous laws then extant allowing confidentiality to stand.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Accordingly, the Court held that a statute barring divulgence of material \u201cwhen in [the] judgment\u201d of administrative officials specified consequences would follow<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> justified nondisclosure under the Freedom of Information Act notwithstanding its grant of a \u201cbroad de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>gree of discretion on what information is to be protected.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">The legislative response was a narrowing of Exemption 3 to exclude from its compass laws such as that in <em>Robertson, </em>which Congress perceived as giving the agency <em>\u201ccart blanche </em>to withhold any information [it] pleases.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Congress did not, however, itself undertake to sort out those nondisclosure statutes that it comprehended as remaining within the exemption from those that it intended to exclude. Instead, it left that task for the courts by amending Exemption 3 so that material would be deemed \u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute\u201d only if the \u201cstatute (A) requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or (B) establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld.\u201d <footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">The legislative history of the amendment leaves no doubt that Exemption 3\u2019s two subsections are separate and distinct.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Subsection (A), on its face, is too rigorous to tolerate any decisionmaking on the administrative level. It embraces only those statutes incorporating a congressional mandate of confidentiality that, however general,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> is \u201cabsolute and without exception.\u201d <footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Subsection (B) does leave room for administrative discretion in two carefully defined situations, but its unmistakable thrust, like that of Subsection (A), is to assure that basic policy decisions on governmental secrecy be made by the Legislative rather than the Executive branch.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> To include within its sweep provisions reflecting no more than a vague apprehension that an agency might someday fall heir to sensitive information is obviously to frustrate that policy. Nondisclosure is countenanced by Subsection (B) if, but only if, the enactment is the product of congressional appreciation of the dangers inherent in airing particular data and incorporates a formula whereby the administrator may determine precisely whether disclosure in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>instance would pose the hazard that Congress foresaw.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Decisions as to whether given \u201ccriteria\u201d or enumerated \u201ctypes of matters\u201d are sufficiently \u201cparticularpzed]\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> in any statute to represent such a congressional judgment necessarily implicate a measure of subjectivity. Congress did, however, leave some clues to the measure it contemplated, for it gave examples of provisions that it concluded would or would not fall within the amended exemption.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> These touchstones leave no doubt but that statutes like that involved in <em>Robertson </em>\u2014which, because they set forth benchmarks for secrecy so general as the \u201cinterest of the public,\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> in fact delegate to administrators the entire burden of identifying the problems disclosure might generate \u2014 do not satisfy Subsection (B)\u2019s requirement that Congress have articulated \u201cparticular criteria.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> When, on the other hand, Congress has made plain its concern with a specific effect of publicity \u2014 as when in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 it directed that information be released only if it \u201ccan be published without undue risk to the common defense and security\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> \u2014 Exemption 3 is to honor that concern.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Similarly, to fall within the definition of a \u201cstatute . . '. [that] refers to particular types of matters to be withheld,\u201d <footnotemark>41</footnotemark> the \u201cCongressional English\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> must be more exact than that in a section of the Social Security Act which purports to forbid disclosure \u201cof any [tax] return . . , or of any file, record, report or other paper, or any information . . . , except as [the agency] . . . may by regulations prescribe.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> These and other examples imply a congressional sense that the crucial distinction lay between statutes that in some manner <em>told </em>the official what to do about disclosure and those that did not significantly inform his discretion in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>Our recent application of amended Exemption 3 in <em>Seymour v. </em>Barabba<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> illustrates this distinction. There we held that legislation prohibiting use of any \u201cinformation furnished under [the census laws] for any purpose other than the statistical purposes for which it is supplied\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> satisfied the exemption\u2019s strictures. Noting that Congress had several times specifically considered the issue of the confidentiality of census data,<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> we concluded that the statute delimited narrowly enough the form in which they might be opened to public view.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> This amount of attention to the problem and this degree of precision in addressing it convinced us that Congress had itself made the basic decision, and had left to the administrator only the task of implementation.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Applying these standards to Section 7(c) of the Export Administration Act,<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> we find it wanting as a barrier under amended Exemption 3 of the Freedom of Information Act to the data which appellants seek. Its very terms belie any contention that it \u201cleave[s] no discretion on the issue\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> of disclosure, as required by Subsection (A), for it expressly undertakes to commit to departmental and agency heads the determination of whether \u201cthe withholding\u201d of the information \u201cis contrary to the national interest.\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Nor is the exemption called into play by reason of Subsection (B). To be sure, were the only \u201cmatters\u201d to which Section 7(c) \u201crefer[red]\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> the boycott-request reports at issue here, a plausible argument might be made that the congressional directive it incorporated was sufficiently well honed to summon the exemption\u2019s protections. As it is, however, Section 7(c) applies to any and all \u201cinformation obtained\u201d under any portion of the enact<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>ment of which it is a part.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> The Export Administration Act contains numerous provisions authorizing the collection of data,<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> perhaps the broadest being the power to require exporters to keep such records and submit such reports as are \u201cnecessary or appropriate to the enforcement of this Act . or to the imposition of any penalty, forfeiture, or liability . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> This general applicability to anything that might happen to be encompassed within this array of information-gathering functions undermines any notion that Section 7(c) represents a congressional determination of the advisability of secrecy for any \u201cparticular type[ ] of matter[ ],\u201d<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> if for no other reason than that the agency had the power radically to expand the quantity and diversity of information in its files to intercept matter of a sort that Congress well might not have contemplated when considering the need for confidentiality.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">There remains the question whether Section 7(c)\u2019s incorporation of the \u201cnational interest\u201d as a yardstick for disclosure<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> suffices to satisfy Subsection (B)\u2019s requirement of \u201cparticular criteria for .withholding.\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> We believe the answer to this lies in Congress\u2019 specific disapproval<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Robertson<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> As noted earlier, the \u201cpublic interest\u201d standard specified in the statute there involved was thought to give the agency <em>\u201ccart </em>blanche\u201d <footnotemark>62</footnotemark> \u2014 precisely the kind of situation that Exemption 3 was amended to avoid.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> Perhaps there is a metaphysical distinction between the \u201cpublic interest\u201d and the \u201cnational interest,\u201d but such a difference would not warrant dissimilar treatment under the Freedom of Information Act.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>We hold, then, that Section 7(c) does not immunize the information in controversy from disclosure prompted by a request under the Freedom of Information Act.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> That does not mean, of course, that some of the information sought here might not be exempt from revelation under other exemptions specified in that Act<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> \u2014 a matter on which we intimate no view. We reverse the judgment of the District Court and remand the case to it for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

If there could be any doubt about the existence of substantial administrative discretion under \u00a7 7(c), the legislative history puts it to rest. Section 7(c) was first enacted as part of the Export Control Act of 1949, Pub.L. No. 81-11, \u00a7 6(c), 63 Stat. 8-9 (1949), and was imported without change into the Export Administration Act of 1969. Its vaguely-expressed purpose seems to have been to aid in the detection of violations of substantive provisions of the 1949 Act. See S.Rep.No. 31, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 6 (1949); 95 Cong.Rec. 438 (1949) (statement of Senator Maybank). Such debate' as touched on it centered not on the inclusion in the bill of what Representative Wolcott called a \u201csnooping clause,\u201d 95 Cong. Rec. 1379 (1949), but on the lack of standards. See 95 Cong.Rec. 1368 (1949), (remarks of Representative Brown); <em>id. </em>at 1379 (remarks of Representative Wolcott); <em>id. </em>at 1386 (remarks of Representative Hale); <em>id. </em>at 1396 (exchange between Representatives Wolcott and Buchanan). Indeed, on the floor of the House an amendment was offered that would have made nondisclosure mandatory rather than \u201cwholly within the discretion of\u2019 the administering agency. 95 Cong.Rec. 1396 (1949) (remarks of Representative Wolcott). The sole statement in defense of the section as it stood was that certain of its language \u2014 \u201cunless [the agency] determines that the withholding thereof is contrary to the national interest\u201d \u2014 \u201cqualifies the [rest of the Section] and clarifies it. The experience of the Department in carrying out [previous export control acts] indicates that language of this character is essential.\u201d 95 Cong.Rec. 1396 (1949) (remarks of Representative Buchanan). The proposed amendment was defeated by less than a score of votes. 95 Cong. Rec. 1396 (1949).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"51\">\n<p id=\"b714-17\">.

One might be inclined to argue that the readoption of \u00a7 7(c) in 1977, see text <em>supra </em>at notes 21-23, reflects a congressional understanding that the section was within the scope of amended Exemption 3. We think the relevant legislative history forecloses that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-19\">During its consideration of the bills forerun-ning the 1977 enactment, the House Committee on International Relations addressed a contention by the Department of Commerce that, in view of the reframing of Exemption 3 in 1976, \u201cit is necessary to specify the types of information with respect to which confidentiality must be maintained.\u201d H.R.Rep.No. 95-190, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 18 (1977); U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1977, p. 1155. The Committee declined to do so, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-20\">The committee finds the list of types of information proposed by the Department for confidential treatment to be virtually all-inclusive, and actually to expand the secrecy provisions of the act, rather than reduce them as is the intent of the committee. It is not the intent of the committee to require disclosure of trade secrets and commercial and financial information which is legitimately confidential or the public release of which could cause competitive harm or the disclosure of in-traagency, interagency, or intergovernmental deliberations with respect to which secrecy is truly necessary on the grounds of national defense, foreign policy, or business confidentiality. The committee considers the various exemptions granted by the Freedom of Information Act, together with the existing provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>sions of section 7(c) of the act, to be adequate for the protection of such information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9qS\"><em>Id. </em>The Commission also rejected a similar suggestion by the Department that data gathered before the effective date of amended Exemption 3 \u2014 the type of information in controversy here \u2014 be given unqualified protection from disclosure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-5\">For the same reason, the committee does not accept the Department\u2019s argument that it is necessary to grant a blanket exemption from the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act with respect to all information received by the Department before the effective date of the Government in the Sunshine Act. Any such information which is legitimately confidential is, in the opinion of the committee, adequately protected by the exemptions of the Freedom of Information Act and section 7(c) of the Export Administration Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\"><em>A </em>claim that, whatever its status before 1977, \u00a7 7(c) is by reason of the Committee\u2019s statements now an Exemption 3 statute, may be initially beguiling. But closer examination reveals \u2014 quite satisfactorily, we think \u2014 that by no means were the statements intended to have that effect. First, there is the Committee\u2019s professed purpose to curtail rather than enlarge \u201csecrecy provisions\u201d in the Export Administration Act, a predisposition at war with any notion that \u00a7 7(c) was to enjoy an expansive role. Indeed, there is also the Committee\u2019s flat refusal to confer \u201ca blanket exemption\u201d upon previously-collected material, which is precisely what \u00a7 7(c) would do if it fell within the ambit of Exemption 3. There is, too, the fact that the kinds of information that the Committee overtly deemed confidential \u2014 trade secrets, commercial and financial information, and intraagency, interagency and intergovernmental deliberations \u2014 all were already protected by one or another of the exemptions to the Freedom of Information Act, see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(4), (5) (1976). The Committee\u2019s ra-liance on Freedom-of-Information-Act exemptions other than Exemption 3 is a convincing indication that \u00a7 7(c) is not to be considered an Exemption 3 statute, since if it were it would itself \u2014 without assistance from any other source \u2014 shield from disclosure every bit of information obtained under the Export Information Act. Lastly, we remain mindful that, save as affected by exemptions other than Exemption 3 to the Freedom of Information Act, the Committee lifted the veil of secrecy prospectively for \u00a7 7(c), material, see note 23 <em>supra, </em>and in no wise intimated an opinion that information already in hand is to be treated differently, as one might expect had the Committee entertained that view.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-11\">These peculiarities persuade us that the Com-* mittee, preoccupied as it was with unacceptable suggestions from the Department of Commerce, was not undertaking to overhaul \u00a7 7(c), but was content to leave demands for disclosure of material assembled thereunder wholly to the dictates of the Freedom of Information Act. This does not mean, of course, that such material is freely releasable, for particular portions may well be intercepted by exemptions to the Freedom of Information Act other than Exemption 3. Nor does it strip \u00a7 7(c) of any mission of its own. To the extent that disclosure is not mandated by a proper Freedom-of-Information-Act request, \u00a7 7(c) stands as a bar to voluntary administrative divulgence without the required determination \u201cthat the withholding thereof is contrary to the national interest.\u201d See text at note 12 <em>supra. </em>Compare <em>Charles River Park \u201cA\u201d, Inc. v.
