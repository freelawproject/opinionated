Redmond was appointed to be in charge of a Bible study class by the Elders of the church in 1959.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This class met on Tuesday evenings until January, 1974 when it was changed by the Body of Elders to Saturday morning.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This change resulted, for the first time in all of the many years of Redmond\u2019s employment with GAF, in a conflict between the required overtime infrequently scheduled on Saturdays<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and Redmond\u2019s religious practices. While the record is unclear as to exactly when GAF was informed of this conflict, it is clear that Redmond did not work Saturday overtime after January 1974. The record, however, does suggest both that overtime had been scheduled by GAF during this period for which Redmond had been excused, and that GAF was aware of the reason for his inability to work on Saturday.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b983-13\">Just after an incident in July of 1974, when he was suspended for one day for failure to return for annual inventory which was held in the middle of his vacation,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Redmond was scheduled to work overtime on Saturday. After his protest to his immediate supervisor, Hampton, proved unsuccessful, he requested a meeting for the next day with Hampton, and Svatos, the warehouse manager. Redmond testified that even though his employers were aware that he could not work on Saturday because of his \u201creligious obligation,\u201d he was told that either he agreed to work or he would lose his job. When he told them he would not be able to work the scheduled overtime on the coming Saturday, he was terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-15\">Title VII prohibits discrimination based on \u201creligion,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(a)(l), but until the 1972 amendment of the act did not define thh term or otherwise indicate the boundaries of the beliefs being protected. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>The 1972 amendment, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(j), added the following definition: \u201cThe term \u2018religion\u2019 includes all aspects of religious observance and practice, as well as belief . While the words of the statute make it clear that Congress was attempting to protect both subjective belief and practices followed in carrying out such belief, the enactment does nothing to aid courts in determining the breadth of the \u201cbeliefs\u201d and \u201cpractices\u201d to be protected, other than to say that they must be \u201creligious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">Most of the reported cases discussing \u201creligious discrimination\u201d under Title VII involve situations where either Sabbatarianism or a practice specifically mandated or prohibited by a tenet of the plaintiff\u2019s religion is involved.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, despite support which can be cited for both positions,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we do not feel the protection of Title VII is limited to these categories.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">First, we note that the very words of the statute <em>(\u201call aspects </em>of religious observance and practice . . . .\u201d) leave little room for such a limited interpretation. Secondly, we note that to restrict the act to those practices which are mandated or prohibited by a tenet of the religion, would involve the court in determining not only what are the tenets of a particular religion, which by itself perhaps would not be beyond the province of the court, but would frequently require the courts to decide whether a particular practice is or is not required by the tenets of the religion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We find such a judicial determination to be irreconcilable with the warning issued by the Supreme Court in <em>Fowler v. Rhode Island, </em>345 U.S. 67, 70, 73 S.Ct. 526, 527, 97 L.Ed. 828 (1953), \u201c[I]t is no business of courts to say . . . what is a religious practice or activity</p>\n<p id=\"b984-12\">The Supreme Court has never had the occasion to interpret this phrase of the 1972 amendment, but the two circuits which have considered it, the Fifth and Sixth Circuits,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> both have concluded that it is not to be given a narrow or limited interpretation. We conclude that conduct which is \u201creligiously motivated,\u201d <em>i. e., </em>\u201call forms and aspects of religion, however eccentric . .\u201d is protected. <em>Cooper v. General </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number><em>Dynamics, </em>533 F.2d 163, 168 (5th Cir. 1976).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b985-4\">We are thus unable to agree with the suggestion made by GAF on appeal, that because Saturday work <em>per se </em>is not prohibited by plaintiff\u2019s religion,' that the practices in question are outside the protection of Title VII. There is no dispute that Redmond was sincere in his religious belief, having been an active participating member of the church for over 16 years. The evidence establishes that he was appointed to be a lifetime leader of the Bible study class, and had done so for many years prior to this case. The evidence showed that the time of the meeting was arranged by the elders, and that following the meeting the group, of which Redmond was the leader, did field missionary work. Redmond testified that he felt his participation in the Saturday activities was at the dictate of his elders and that they were a \u201creligious obligation.\u201d We conclude that the practices in question are within the protection offered by \u00a7 2000e(j) to \u201call aspects of religious observance and practice\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">According to \u00a7 2000e(j) once the plaintiff here had established that his practice, which prevented him working Saturday overtime, was \u201creligious\u201d and that nonetheless it had been used as the basis for discharging him, the burden shifted to the employer to \u201cdemonstrate that he is unable to reasonably accommodate to an employee\u2019s . . religious observance or practice without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer\u2019s business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b985-8\">The court below found that plaintiff had made out a <em>prima facie </em>case of religious discrimination. The court further found that the defendant made \u201cno effort to accommodate plaintiff,\u201d nor had it introduced any evidence \u201cshowing or tending to show any inconvenience\u201d which would have prevented it from accommodating plaintiff\u2019s religious practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-12\">Implicit within plaintiff\u2019s <em>prima facie </em>case is the requirement that plaintiff inform his employer of both his religious needs and his need for an accommodation. Defendant at the time of oral argument cited certain recent cases which he states show that there is still another interim step or burden of proof which plaintiff must meet, and here failed to do, before the burden shifts under \u00a7 2000e(j) to GAF.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-13\">GAF cites <em>Yott v. North American Rockwell Corp., </em>428 F.Supp. 763, 769 (1977), for the proposition that under \u00a7 2000e(j) \u201cthe plaintiff has the burden of proving that he has offered to the employer an accommodation which is acceptable to him (the employee).\u201d This would require that the plaintiff not only advise his employer of his religious needs and the nature and extent of the potential or actual conflict in terms of his employment, but would also place on the plaintiff the burden of suggesting to his employer possible methods of accommodation. While we feel plaintiff should be free, even encouraged, to suggest to his employer possible ways of accommodating his religious needs, we see nothing in the statute to support the position that this is part of plaintiff\u2019s burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-14\"><em>Chrysler Corp. v. Mann, </em>561 F.2d 1282 (8th Cir. 1977), also cited by defendant, states that the plaintiff also has a duty \u201cto attempt to accommodate his beliefs himself.\u201d This duty is found not in Title VII, but rather in the \u201cmutuality of obligation [which] inheres in the employer-employee relationship\u201d apart from the Act. <em>Id. </em>at 1285. We agree that the concept of a \u201cmutuality of obligation\u201d is inherent in accommodation, for rarely will an accommodation be successful without mutual efforts and cooperation. However, to the extent that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>the <em>Chrysler </em>court may be interpreted to say that it is incumbent on plaintiff to show first that he has made some effort to either \u201ccompromise\u201d or accommodate his own religious beliefs before he can seek an accommodation from his employer, we disagree.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">In this connection, we now deal with defendant\u2019s claim that plaintiff failed to provide sufficient information to put it on notice of his religious needs and thus to permit an accommodation. The <em>Chrysler </em>court noted that an employee who is disinterested in informing his employer of his religious needs \u201cmay forego the right to have his beliefs accommodated by his employer.\u201d 561 F.2d at 1286.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">We agree with defendant that accommodation is not so onerous as to charge an employer with the responsibility for continually searching for each potential religious conflict of every employee. The employee has the duty to inform his employer of his religious needs so that the employer has notice of the conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-6\">The evidence indicates that plaintiff\u2019s Bible study class was switched to Saturday morning in early 1974. The record also reveals that plaintiff did not work any Saturdays after January, 1974. While there is no clear record as to exactly what the situation was between January and July of 1974, it appears that Mr. Redmond was being excused from Saturday work because of his \u201creligious obligation.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b986-7\">While there is a paucity of information in the record regarding this period of time, when the conflict finally reached a climax in early August, Mr. Redmond testified, without contradiction, that he told his supervisor, Hampton, \u201cI thought we had discussed this several times before, that I was not able to work on Saturday because of my religious obligation.\u201d The following day during the meeting with Hampton and Sva-tos, Mr. Redmond stated, \u201cI\u2019ve talked with you and Mr. Hampton several times before about the matter of Saturday work . .\u201d I thought we had an understanding as to why I was not able to come to work on Saturday ... I cannot work Saturdays ... I have a religious obligation.\u201d When Mr. Svatos testified regarding the meeting, his account was that \u201cRodges, of course, advised us that he couldn\u2019t work on Saturdays because of his Bible classes.\u201d Whatever confusion or misunderstanding that may have existed prior to this time as to the reasons for Mr. Redmond\u2019s inability to work on Saturday, they were clearly eliminated during this meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-12\">Next, we address the defendant\u2019s argument that this court is entitled to make <em>de novo </em>review of the trial court\u2019s finding of fact as to \u201caccommodation\u201d on the theory that such a finding is in the nature of conclusion of law. <em>Stewart v. General Motors Corp., </em>542 F.2d 445 (7th Cir. 1976). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-13\">Other circuit courts that have been confronted with this question have concluded that this is basically a question of fact and not one of law. <em>Chrysler Corp. </em>v. <em>Mann, </em>561 F.2d at 1286; <em>United States v. City of Albuquerque, </em>545 F.2d at 111; <em>Williams v. Southern U. Gas Co., </em>529 F.2d at 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-14\">The term \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d is a relative term and cannot be given a hard and fast meaning. Each case involving such a determination necessarily depends upon its own facts and circumstances, and comes down to a determination of \u201creasonableness\u201d under the unique circumstances of the individual employer-employee relation<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>ship. The trier of fact is in the best position to weigh these considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">We conclude that the trial court\u2019s determination of the issue of \u201caccommodation\u201d must be accepted unless it is \u201cclearly erroneous,\u201d i. e., if after a careful review of the record the reviewing court is left with the definite and firm conviction that the finding is clearly wrong and that a mistake has been made. <em>Chrysler, supra, </em>at 1286.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-7\">When the defendant learned of the conflict between Redmond\u2019s religious obligations and the Saturday overtime schedule (which clearly occurred at the August 2 meeting), GAF had an obligation to reasonably accommodate the practice unless it could demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the conduct of its business. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(j).</p>\n<p id=\"b987-8\">The trial court below found that defendant made \u201cno effort to accommodate plaintiff,\u201d and that it had \u201cintroduced no evidence showing or tending to show any inconvenience\u201d justifying its failure to accommodate plaintiff. Unless we are convinced that these findings are \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d the judgment of the district court must be upheld. We find no such mistake, having examined the record carefully and in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-9\">The record shows that despite the knowledge of Redmond\u2019s obligation, his employer indicated to him that he would have to work on Saturday \u201cor else.\u201d Mr. Redmond responded that if it was between his religion or his job, he would have to follow the dictates of his religion, whatever the result. Mr. Redmond was terminated the same day. We note that there was no discussion during this meeting of an alternative way of solving the problem other than Mr. Redmond agreeing to work on Saturday. There was no discussion of excusing him, even though apparently this had been done in the past. There was no discussion of the possibility of transferring him to another of GAF\u2019s warehouses or transferring him to another job to eliminate this conflict. The only alternative given to Redmond was to agree to work on Saturday or lose his job.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> GAF made \u201cno effort to accommodate\u201d Redmond.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-12\">The court\u2019s finding that there was no evidence showing any \u201cinconvenience\u201d to justify GAF\u2019s failure to accommodate plaintiff, we do not find to be clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b987-13\">While the court did not have the benefit of the clarification which the Supreme Court recently gave to \u201caccommodation\u201d and \u201cundue hardship\u201d in <em>Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison, </em>432 U.S. 63, 97 S.Ct. 2264, 53 L.Ed.2d 113 (1977) there is no showing that the standard used here diverges from that enunciated by the <em>Hardi-son </em>Court. But <em>cf. Ward v. Allegheny, </em>560 F.2d 579 (3rd Cir. 1977). The record contains evidence relevant to the interpretation given to the term \u201cundue hardship\u201d by <em>Har-dison </em>and supports the finding of the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-14\">The record reveals that defendant would not have had to underman its warehouse operation if plaintiff were excused from work. There were six other warehouses in the Chicago area from which it could draw. There was also testimony that on other occasions when overtime was required in the warehouse, the company had either hired temporary help or had used office help. Furthermore, Saturday overtime was not done regularly, so the problem was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>a constant one (Redmond worked on Saturday only five times during 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">There is no showing that a replacement would result in a loss of efficiency. The testimony was uncontradicted that the work done on Saturday in overtime was essentially unskilled work that any employee would be capable of doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">To pay replacement employees premium wages would not impose a cost on the defendant, for the regular warehouse employees were already receiving premium wages for their Saturday work.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-6\">There was no union or collective bargaining contract which would present any problem in shifting plaintiff\u2019s schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-7\">Therefore, we agree with the trial court\u2019s finding that defendant made no effort to accommodate plaintiff\u2019s religious needs, and failed to demonstrate that it would suffer any undue hardship in accommodating the plaintiff.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b988-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b982-9\">. This suit originally began in July of 1974 when Redmond filed a <em>pro se </em>complaint, following receipt of a Notice of Right to Sue from EEOC, charging racial discrimination. Redmond filed the harassment charge with EEOC on July 10, 1974. Following his termination on August 2, 1974, he amended his EEOC complaint to include his termination and the religious discrimination charge. The EEOC issued a Notice of Right to Sue on February 24, 1975. Redmond filed his second amended complaint on February 28, 1975.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b983-6\">.

Seeger, </em>380 U.S. 163, 85 S.Ct. 850, 13 L.Ed.2d 733 (1969), i. e., (1) is the \u201cbelief\u2019 for which protection is sought \u201creligious\u201d in person\u2019s own scheme of things, and (2) is it \u201csincerely held.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b986-8\">. We believe that what the court in <em>Chrysler </em>was suggesting was that when \u201cprocedures and scheduling already provide a measure of elasticity in switching work shifts and in allowing excused absences,\u201d a plaintiffs failure to first seek an accommodation within these procedures indicates a lack of cooperation which, when combined with other factors, may render an accommodation impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-15\">But see <em>Jordan v. North Carolina National Bank, </em>565 F.2d 72 (4th Cir. 1977). The court there found that a prospective employee\u2019s refusal to agree to ever work on her Sabbath was \u201cso unlimited and absolute in scope that it speaks its own unreasonableness and thus beyond accommodation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b986-16\">. See n. 6, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b987-10\">. We also note that the record does not reveal that there were any existing procedures whereby Redmond would on his own have been able to accommodate his practices, such as switching schedules or finding a substitute, as there was in <em>Chrysler, supra. </em>Apparently all the warehouse employees were required to work overtime. The only exception to this was the warehouse supervisor, Hampton. He was in addition to being\" a supervisor, and therefore not paid extra for overtime work, a Seventh Day Adventist, The company never scheduled him for Saturday work.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b987-16\">. We interpret the finding of \u201cno inconvenience\u201d to be the equivalent of finding \u201cno undue hardship.\u201d To the extent these terms may differ in meaning, defendant benefited since \u201cinconvenience\u201d would be a lower standard than \"undue hardship,\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b988-18\">. Defendant also challenges the constitutionality of Title VII as it relates to religion arguing it is violative of the establishment clause. However, defendant did not raise the issue below and federal courts have traditionally held that constitutional arguments cannot be raised for the first time on appeal. <em>Allen v. Beneficial Finance Co., </em>531 F.2d 797, 805 (7th Cir. 1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
