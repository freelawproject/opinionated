BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1448-13\">After a jury trial Evasio Hernandez was convicted of conspiracy to possess marijuana with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 846 (Count II of the indictment). The jury also convicted Hernandez of possessing marijuana with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 952(a) and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2 (Count IV of the indictment). Hernandez was given a three-year sentence on each count with the terms running consecutively. On appeal Hernandez contends that his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights were violated by a custodial police interrogation which produced inculpatory statements admitted into evidence at trial. We reverse the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-16\">\n<em>The Counts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-17\">On June 24, 1976, the government indicted Hernandez together with Norberto Acosta, Pedro Otto Ramirez, and Jose Pedro Perez. Count I of the indictment charged the four defendants with violating 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 952(a), 963 by conspiring to import marijuana. Count II of the indictment charged the defendants with conspiracy to possess marijuana with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 846. Count III charged the defendants with transporting marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 9&amp;2(a) and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2. Count IV charged the defendants with possession of marijuana with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2. Count V charged that the defendants unlawfully carried and possessed firearms during the commission of the above marijuana related felonies in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-18\">On October 14, 1976, the four defendants appeared for trial. After the government rested, the motions of defendants Acosta and Ramirez for a severance were granted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The case was submitted to the jury as to only defendants Hernandez and Perez. This appeal involves only Hernandez\u2019s conviction,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and we concentrate on those facts pertinent to appellant\u2019s constitutional claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-19\">\n<em>The Crime</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-20\">On the evening of January 30, 1976, officer Robert Murrhee of the City of Coral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1365\">*1365</page-number>Gables Police Department was on patrol in a water front area of the city called \u201cGables by the Sea\u201d. Officer Murrhee testified that he regularly patrolled the area. Shortly after midnight, January 31, 1976, he observed a Ryder Rental Truck backed up to the guard rail at Belle Vista Point, an area of dense mangroves and swamp adjacent to a canal and bay. The officer parked his patrol car, asked for a backup unit, and proceeded to the cab of the truck. Although no one was in the vehicle, he noticed the distinct odor of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-4\">Approaching the rear of the truck, officer Murrhee heard the sound of several people running, possibly six or more, and he pursued them. As Murrhee ran he observed several large piles of marijuana, later determined to be an amount of approximately 23 tons. He ran until he reached a mangrove head and noticed three men lying down. He called, \u201chalt, police\u201d, and all three lunged for him forcing him to fire a shot. Appellant Hernandez yelled, \u201cI give up, don\u2019t shoot,\u201d and the three men came out with their hands up. Murrhee arrested the appellant along with the other two men, Acosta and Ramirez. Officer Murrhee detected a distinct smell of marijuana on their person.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-9\">Testimony about what transpired following Hernandez\u2019s arrest is often conflicting and confusing. Accordingly, before launching into a detailed description of the evidence, we briefly sketch the facts as disclosed by the uncontested portions of the record. The record clearly supports the trial judge\u2019s finding that the police gave Hernandez his <em>Miranda </em>rights<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201con at least three occasions and perhaps four.\u201d It is equally clear that on each occasion Hernandez declined to speak thereby repeatedly invoking his right to remain silent. Hernandez first refused to speak immediately after his midnight arrest when officer Mur-rhee informed Hernandez of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Approximately five hours later, after a lengthy confinement in a police wagon at the scene, Hernandez was transported to the police station where, according to the trial judge\u2019s findings, he again was given his <em>Miranda </em>rights and the police attempted to interrogate him at least two, and perhaps three times more. Within 45 minutes after his arrival at the station house the police succeeded in eliciting incriminating comments from Hernandez.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-10\">A more detailed investigation of the record reveals the following.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Officer Mur-rhee testified that he simultaneously gave all three suspects their <em>Miranda </em>warnings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1366\">*1366</page-number>at the scene upon their arrest. Upon cross-examination, officer Murrhee affirmatively acknowledged that Hernandez declined to make any statement at that time.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>. Hernandez, however, testified that he asked to see a lawyer after Murrhee gave him his rights. Hernandez then stated that there was no further conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-4\">It is undisputed that the three suspects were then confined in a police wagon at the scene. Even though the station house was minutes away, the suspects remained confined in the close quarters of the police wagon for approximately five hours. After this lengthy confinement, Hernandez arrived at the station house about 5:00 a. m. in the morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-5\">According to Hernandez, shortly after he arrived at the station officer Murrhee again informed him of his rights and attempted to elicit conversation. During this interrogation, Murrhee asked whether Hernandez had a record. Hernandez responded that he was on three years probation. At that point Hernandez stated that, in exchange for cooperation, Murrhee offered \u201cto try to keep me on probation because my probation officer was a Coral Gables police officer and he was going to try to do the best for me in court and on my probation.\u201d Hernandez testified that he again declined to talk and again requested counsel.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1450-6\">The testimony by Hernandez about his second interrogation session went unchallenged. Officer Murrhee who had testified earlier, was not called upon by the prosecution to refute Hernandez\u2019s version of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-12\">Hernandez further testified that the police attempted yet another interrogation about 15 minutes after the second attempt. Hernandez stated that he was brought into a room occupied by an officer Maloy, officer Murrhee, and several other officers, he was again given his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and officer Maloy urged Hernandez to cooperate in exchange for help in Court. Hernandez testified that he again repeated his desire to see an attorney and said nothing more.</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-13\">During his testimony, officer Maloy confirmed that he had interrogated Hernandez. He testified that he had first given Hernandez his <em>Miranda </em>rights, in both English and Spanish, and that Hernandez stated that he understood his rights.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Maloy also confirmed that several officers, including officer Murrhee, were present during the questioning session. Maloy admitted that he knew that Murrhee had previously given the <em>Miranda </em>warnings to Hernandez. Ma-loy further testified that he didn\u2019t know whether Hernandez had elected to give a statement or to remain silent. Similarly, officer Maloy did not know whether Mur-rhee had talked to Hernandez again between the midnight arrest and Maloy\u2019s interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-14\">Maloy testified that during this interrogation session Hernandez made certain incriminating statements. Hernandez admitted that he was hired by Luis Valdez to help unload some marijuana; that he didn\u2019t know Valdez well; that he was to receive $5,000 plus some marijuana for his help; and that Valdez just called him and asked if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1367\">*1367</page-number>he wanted to make some money. Maloy maintained that there was no discussion about Hernandez\u2019s probationary status. Finally, Maloy testified that Hernandez, after making his oral statements, refused to sign a written statement and requested an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-5\">Hernandez testified that it was not until a fourth interrogation effort some 30 minutes after Maloy\u2019s interrogation that he finally answered questions. Hernandez stated that another officer approached him, gave him his rights, and induced him to speak through promises of leniency and nonrevocation of his probationary status. Even after giving his oral statements, Hernandez refused to sign a written statement. Hernandez testified that three or four officers, including officer Murrhee, were present at the session which produced the inculpatory statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-6\">After hearing the conflicting testimony, the District Court ruled that the oral statements would be admitted into evidence. In arriving at his decision, the District Court found as a fact that Hernandez was given his warnings on \u201cthree and perhaps four separate occasions by the police officers pri- or to finally making his admissions.\u201d Nevertheless, the Court ruled that the number of times Hernandez may have been warned prior to making statements was completely immaterial. \u201cOn the question of how many times a man was advised of his rights, the Court concedes that to be immaterial. . . . If he was advised of his rights ten times or twenty times or a hundred times, it cannot inure to his prejudice. It can only make him more fully aware of what his rights are. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-8\">The trial judge ruled that although he was concerned with the fact that Hernandez made his statements at 5:00 a. m., that fact alone, taking the time of the arrest into consideration, did not warrant suppressing the evidence. The District Court also noted that the inducements offered to Hernandez, if true, did not prohibit the oral statements from being admitted into evidence. \u201cOn the inducement factor the Court finds that that was not a matter that would fall within any of the proscriptions of the <em>Miranda </em>rule or [the law of voluntariness].\u201d Finally, although the District Court made no express finding as to whether Hernandez had indeed requested counsel each time he invoked his right to remain silent, the Court\u2019s admissibility decision implicitly indicates that the Court found he had not exercised this right. The District Court found that the government met its burden under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3501. (See note 4, supra).</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-11\">On appeal Hernandez argues that the police violated his Fifth Amendment <em>Miranda </em>safeguards. Appellant further contends that the police denied him his Sixth Amendment right to assistance of counsel. Accordingly, Hernandez maintains that his conviction should be overturned because the District Court failed to suppress the incriminating statements taken in violation of his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-12\">\n<em>Self-Incrimination</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-13\">The landmark decision of <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>1966, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, delineated specific procedures to safeguard the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination during custodial interrogations. <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>salutary prophylactic prescription was designed to combat the inherently coercive atmosphere of a police-dominated, in-custody interrogation. 384 U.S. at 467-68, 86 S.Ct. at 1624, 16 L.Ed.2d at 719-20.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1452-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1368\">*1368</page-number>Hernandez contends that the prophylactic safeguards of <em>Miranda </em>were violated by the repeated efforts of the police to interrogate him despite his refusal to speak. We cannot agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion and the government\u2019s position on appeal that it is immaterial how many times a person is advised of his rights, and that it can only make the person \u201cmore fully aware of his rights.\u201d In the present case, an appraisal of the accused\u2019s rights preceded each attempt to initiate interrogation. The more times police inform a suspect of his rights in the face of his repeated invocation of one of those rights \u2014 the right to remain silent \u2014 the clearer it becomes that the police must not mean what they say. This is exactly the type of subtle coercive pressure which the <em>Miranda </em>opinion condemned.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-4\">Particularly in the circumstances of this case, Hernandez was ripened for influence by the inherent pressures attendant to a station house interrogation. Hernandez spent nearly five hours in the close quarters of the police wagon, where he was effectively held incommunicado without any possible access to an attorney. His arrival at the station house was in the early morning hours around 5:00 a. m., and the police immediately began repetitive efforts to elicit comment from him. He was given his rights, he invoked his right to remain silent through his refusals to cooperate, he was given his rights again, and so on until he incriminated himself.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The inculpatory statements were secured without the benefit of assistance of counsel<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> in a room with more than three officers present, one of whom had on several prior occasions attempted interrogation. Such police conduct is tantamount to coercive pressure applied to the accused to force him to reconsider his invocation of his right to silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-10\">In <em>Michigan v. Mosley, </em>1975, 423 U.S. 96, 96 S.Ct. 321, 46 L.Ed.2d 313, the Supreme Court addressed the question which now confronts us under the express findings of the trial Court: under what circumstances is the prosecution prohibited from using a defendant\u2019s in-custody statement obtained by police who have renewed interrogation after the defendant has invoked his right to remain silent. The Supreme Court stressed that \u201c[a] reasonable and faithful interpretation of the <em>Miranda </em>opinion must rest on the intention of the Court in that case to adopt \u2018fully effective means ... to notify the person of his right to silence and to assure that the exercise of the right will be scrupulously honored . . . <em>Mosley, supra, </em>423 U.S. at 103, 96 S.Ct. at 326, 46 L.Ed.2d at 321. The Court also emphasized that the critical safeguard under <em>Miranda </em>was a person\u2019s \u201cright to cut off questioning.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Supreme Court concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1369\">*1369</page-number>that \u201cthe admissibility of statements obtained after the person in custody has decided to remain silent depends under <em>Miranda </em>on whether his \u2018right to cut off questioning was \u2018scrupulously honored.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mosley, supra, </em>423 U.S. at 104, 96 S.Ct. at 326, 46 L.Ed.2d at 321. Although the facts of <em>Mosley </em>are distinguishable and make its result inapplicable here, the principles established and the analysis entertained in that case fully control Hernandez\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-5\"><em>Mosley </em>teaches that a Court must adopt a case by case approach in determining whether, under the circumstance of each case, a resumption of questioning was consistent with scrupulous observance of the right to cut off questioning. In <em>Mosley, </em>for example, the Court found that Mosley\u2019s right to cut off questioning had been scrupulously honored. The Court based its conclusion on a number of factors, including: \u201c[T]he police here immediately ceased the [initial] interrogation, resumed questioning only after the passage of a significant period of time and the provision of a fresh set of warnings, and restricted the second interrogation to a crime that had not been a subject of the earlier interrogation.\u201d 423 U.S. at 106, 96 S.Ct. at 327, 46 L.Ed.2d at 322.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In contrast, none of these factors existed in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-6\">After Hernandez arrived at the station house he was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. He declined to answer questions. Almost immediately thereafter the police made a second effort to interrogate Hernandez. Clearly, the police did not immediately cease the interrogation nor did they resume questioning after the passage of a significant period of time. Their acts were immediate, repetitive, and deliberate. The police focused their interest on only the crime involving the marijuana. They made absolutely no indication of a desire to restrict subsequent interrogation to crimes other than that which was the subject of the earlier attempted interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-11\">Within 45 minutes from the time he arrived at the station house, and perhaps after a third attempted effort to get Hernandez to speak within that period of time, the incriminating statement was elicited. It is patently obvious that the police ignored Hernandez\u2019s repeated invocation of his right to remain silent. The circumstances do not reflect a <em>scrupulous </em>honoring by police of Hernandez\u2019s right to cut off questioning. Officer Murrhee, who on two prior occasions had given Hernandez his <em>Miranda </em>warnings and witnessed his refusal to talk, was present at officer Maloy\u2019s interrogation session and yet failed to notify Maloy that Hernandez had twice before exerted his right to remain silent. Moreover, the police\u2019s peppering of Hernandez by repeatedly informing him of his rights despite his expressed desire to remain silent could only reinforce doubts in our minds or Hernandez\u2019s that the police meant what they said.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1453-12\">Additionally, Hernandez testified that the police attempted to induce him to speak through promises of leniency and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1370\">*1370</page-number>nonrevoeation of his existing probationary status. The District Court ruled that such inducement would not fall under the proscriptions of <em>Miranda. </em>Under the facts of this case, it is abundantly clear that any inducements might further aggravate the compulsive atmosphere of this situation.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1454-4\">Finally, we are confronted with the District Court\u2019s failure to expressly resolve the conflicting evidence and make a clear ruling on Hernandez\u2019s assertion that he had simultaneously requested counsel each time he exerted his right to remain silent. In view of the District Court\u2019s implicit finding that Hernandez did not request counsel, a finding which the evidence reasonably supports,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> we do not consider appellant\u2019s Fifth Amendment right to counsel claim. We emphasize, however, that if it had been determined that Hernandez indeed requested counsel simultaneously with the invocation of his right to remain silent, we would be faced with an even more egregious situation. Denial by authorities of an express desire for counsel is a serious matter which affects fundamental constitutional rights of the accused, and such a denial most certainly cannot make continued interrogation more honorable or less suspect.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In any case, the facts as found by the District Court unequivocally demonstrate that Hernandez\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>right to cut off questioning was not scrupulously honored.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1454-9\">\n<em>Waiver</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-10\">We have held that defendants may waive their constitutional privileges and make voluntary statements. <em>E. g., United States v. Brown, </em>5 Cir., 1978, 569 F.2d 236 (en banc). \u201cThe standard to be applied in determining the question of [a] waiver under federal constitutional law is that the government must prove \u2018an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brown, supra, </em>569 F.2d at 238, <em>citing Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>1938, 304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 1028, 82 L.Ed. 1461, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1371\">*1371</page-number>1466.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In the present case, where the accused was repeatedly informed of his rights, we fail to find any substantial indication of waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-5\">A \u201cheavy burden\u201d rests on the government to prove that Hernandez waived his privilege against self-incrimination. <em>Miranda, supra, </em>384 U.S. at 475, 86 S.Ct. at 1628, 16 L.Ed.2d at 724; <em>Nash v. Estelle, </em>5 Cir., 1977, 560 F.2d 652, 660, <em>reh. en banc granted, </em>560 F.2d 660; <em>United States v. Guzman-Guzman, </em>5 Cir., 1974, 488 F.2d 965; <em>United States v. Bailey, </em>5 Cir. 1972, 468 F.2d 652, 660, <em>aff\u2019d on reh. en banc, </em>1973, 480 F.2d 518.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Also, Courts indulge in every reasonable presumption against waiver. <em>Brewer v. Williams, </em>1977, 430 U.S. 387, 404, 97 S.Ct. 1232, 1242, 51 L.Ed.2d 424, 440; <em>Brookhart v. Janis, </em>1966, 384 U.S. 1, 4, 86 S.Ct. 1245, 1246, 16 L.Ed.2d 314, 317. Furthermore, although the general rule is that neither a written nor an oral expressed waiver is required, <em>United States v. James, </em>5 Cir., 1976, 528 F.2d 999, 1019, <em>cert. denied sub nom., Austin </em>v. <em>United States, </em>429 U.S. 959, 97 S.Ct. 382, 50 L.Ed.2d 326; <em>United States v. Montos, </em>5 Cir., 1970, 421 F.2d 215, 224, <em>cert. denied, </em>1971, 397 U.S. 1022, 90 S.Ct. 1262, 25 L.Ed.2d 532, implied waivers are clearly disfavored. <em>Estelle v. Williams, </em>1975, 425 U.S. 501, 515, 96 S.Ct. 1691, 1698, 48 L.Ed.2d 126, 137 (Powell, J., concurring); <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>1972, 407 U.S. 514, 525-26, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 2189-90, 33 L.Ed.2d 101, 114; <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>1939, 304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1023, 82 L.Ed.2d 1461, 1466.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1455-8\">The possibility that Hernandez made an implied voluntary waiver of his right is greatly diminished by the fact that the police initiated each attempted interview, including the one at which the incriminating statements were elicited. <em>United States v. Menichino, </em>5 Cir., 1974, 497 F.2d 935, 940; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>5 Cir., 1971, 448 F.2d 398, 399; <em>United States v. Clark, </em>4 Cir., 1974, 499 F.2d 804, 807. Moreover, although the refusal of an accused at a later time to sign a written waiver (here in the form of a written statement of Hernandez\u2019s confession) does not automatically preclude the finding of a voluntary waiver, <em>United States v. James, </em>5 Cir., 1976, 528 F.2d 999, 1020, <em>cert. denied sub nom., Austin v. United States, </em>429 U.S. 959, 97 S.Ct. 382, 50 L.Ed.2d 326; <em>United States v. Hopkins, 5 </em>Cir., 1970, 433 F.2d 1041, 1044, <em>cert. denied, </em>401 U.S. 1013, 91 S.Ct. 1252, 28 L.Ed.2d 550, in the present case such a factor is accentuated because the police, and not Hernandez, initiated all efforts at further conversation prior to Hernandez\u2019s refusal to sign. <em>See, United States v. Ramos, </em>5 Cir., 1971, 448 F.2d 398, 399. Furthermore, there is no indication whatsoever from the record, other than the incriminating statements themselves, that Hernandez ever waived his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1372\">*1372</page-number>Finally, and most importantly, a <em>Miranda </em>transgression lessens the probability that rights were voluntarily waived. If the police may pursue interrogation three or four times until the accused confesses, then the concept of waiver would be woefully lacking in substance. We conclude that under the circumstances the Government did not adequately demonstrate that Hernandez waived his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-4\">\n<em>Harmless Error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-5\">We have held that an unlawful confession obtained by the interrogator\u2019s failure to observe <em>Miranda's </em>procedural safeguards, while constituting damaging evidence against the accused, \u201cmay not be nearly as untrustworthy in determining the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence, or nearly as shocking to our notions of fundamental due process, as an involuntary confession certainly is.\u201d <em>Smith v. Estelle, </em>5 Cir., 1976, 527 F.2d 430, 431 (footnote omitted). More importantly, an unlawful confession may fall subject to the harmless error rule of <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>1967, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705. Consequently, the erroneous admission of an incriminating statement, obtained through a failure to scrupulously honor Hernandez\u2019s invocation of his rights following a full <em>Miranda </em>warning, does not require reversal where the admission is harmless error in view of the overwhelming guilt of the defendant.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1456-6\">It is clear that Hernandez\u2019s incriminating statements were obtained in violation of <em>Miranda. </em>Because these statements carried extreme probative weight in relation to the crimes for which Hernandez was convicted, we cannot find their admission to be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Although there appears to be an ample basis to sustain the conviction,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> we recognize that these incriminating statements may have represented overpowering, inescapable evidence for the jury. Strong as were the circumstances of presence at the scene of the truck and 23 tons of marijuana, the sudden flight to the mangrove head, and the lunge of these persons toward the officer, there was little, if any, direct evidence connecting Hernandez with the truck or the contents. We cannot conclude that the admission of these statements was harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-9\">In view of our disposition of appellant\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>claim, we need not reach his independent Sixth Amendment right to assistance of counsel claim. The admission in evidence of Hernandez\u2019s incriminating statements vitiates the judgment because it violated basic Fifth Amendment constitutional safeguards.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-10\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1448-22\">.

The <em>Miranda </em>decision was predicated upon the conclusion that \u201cwithout proper safeguards the process of in-custody interrogation of persons suspected or accused of crime contains inherently compelling pressures which work to undermine the individual\u2019s will to resist and to compel him to speak where he would not otherwise do so freely.\u201d <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 467, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 1624 (1966); <em>see Hoffa </em>v. <em>United States, </em>385 U.S. 293, 304, 87 S.Ct. 408, 414, 17 L.Ed.2d 374 (1966).

Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 458, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 1619 (1966). Since the vice against which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1368\">*1368</page-number>the privilege against self-incrimination protects is compulsion, legal or factual, in the process of interrogation, <em>see Hoffa v. United States, </em>385 U.S. 293, 303-304, 87 S.Ct. 408, 414 (1966); <em>United States v. Burr (In re Willie), </em>25 Fed.Cas. 38, 40 (No. 14692e) (C.C.D.
