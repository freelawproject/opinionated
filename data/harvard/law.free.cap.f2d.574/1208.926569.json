Petitioner Robert O\u2019Quinn seeks release from the Texas Department of Corrections, contending that his fourth, sixth, and fourteenth amendment rights were violated by the State when the prosecution refused to reveal the identity of \u201cknown narcotics users\u201d whose alleged presence at O\u2019Quinn\u2019s residence was relied upon by the State in securing the search warrant which led to his arrest. The district court granted relief. Because O\u2019Quinn had a full and fair opportunity to litigate his claim in State court, we hold that <em>Stone v. Powell, </em>428 U.S. 465, 96 S.Ct. 3037, 49 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1976), mandates reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-20\">In October 1967 Houston police officers received information from a reliable informer that O\u2019Quinn had heroin in his possession for sale and use. Acting on this information, Houston police, over a period of three days, observed five \u201cknown narcotics users\u201d at O\u2019Quinn\u2019s residence. These facts were set forth in an affidavit supporting a search warrant of O\u2019Quinn\u2019s residence. The police executed the search warrant on the fourth day, October 26, 1967. Narcotics were found in O\u2019Quinn\u2019s possession, and he was arrested. O\u2019Quinn attempted to learn the names of \u201cknown narcotics users\u201d in a pretrial discovery motion. The State trial court denied this part of the discovery motion in a pretrial hearing. O\u2019Quinn reurged his request just prior to trial, and it was again denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1209\">*1209</page-number>A jury found O\u2019Quinn guilty of possession of heroin and sentenced him to life imprisonment. On direct appeal to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, O\u2019Quinn attacked the State\u2019s refusal to identify the five known narcotics users. His conviction was affirmed. <em>O\u2019Quinn v. Texas, </em>462 S.W.2d 583 (Tex.Crim.App.1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-5\">In 1971 O\u2019Quinn filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in federal district court, again alleging constitutional error in the State court\u2019s failure to order disclosure of the known narcotics users. The district court denied the writ, and this Court affirmed without opinion. <em>O\u2019Quinn v. Estelle, </em>488 F.2d 1406 (5th Cir. 1974). O\u2019Quinn\u2019s petition for rehearing en banc was denied, 491 F.2d 1272 (5th Cir. 1974), and the Supreme Court denied certiorari, 419 U.S. 863, 95 S.Ct. 117, 42 L.Ed.2d 99 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-6\">On May 20, 1976, this Court decided <em>Curry v. Estelle, </em>531 F.2d 1260 (5th Cir. 1976), which on facts substantially identical to the instant case affirmed the district court\u2019s grant of habeas corpus relief. We held that the identities of two \u201cknown narcotics users,\u201d which \u201cwere possibly exculpatory of the petitioner as the basis for an attack on the search warrant or in impeaching the testimony of the arresting officer,\u201d should have been disclosed by the prosecution under <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-7\">Armed with this decision, O\u2019Quinn filed in State court a petition for habeas corpus, again pressing the identical constitutional claims asserted earlier in his direct appeal. The State trial court denied the application, and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed without opinion. O\u2019Quinn then filed the instant \u00a7 2254 application in federal court and moved for summary judgment. Relying on <em>Curry, </em>the district court entered summary judgment for O\u2019Quinn and ordered that he either be retried within 90 days or be released.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-8\">If viewed by itself, this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Curry </em>would require affirmance of the district court\u2019s grant of habeas corpus relief. Our inquiry, however, cannot end with <em>Curry, </em>for less than two months after <em>Curry </em>was decided, the Supreme Court handed down <em>Stone v. Powell, </em>428 U.S. 465, 96 S.Ct. 3037, 49 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1976), which substantially contracted the power of federal courts to grant habeas corpus relief to state prisoners alleging fourth amendment violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-10\">In <em>Stone </em>the Court considered the \u00a7 2254 petitions of Lloyd Powell and David Rice, who were both incarcerated in state prisons under convictions obtained in part on the basis of evidence seized in violation of the fourth amendment. Both Stone and Rice unsuccessfully pressed their fourth amendment claims in their respective state court appeals and then sought federal habeas corpus relief. Stone\u2019s petition was denied by the district court, but granted on appeal to the Ninth Circuit; Rice was successful in both the district court and the Eighth Circuit. The wardens of their respective state prisons appealed to the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-11\">The Supreme Court reversed. After a lengthy discussion of the substantial societal costs incurred in applying the exclusionary rule, the Court concluded that collateral review of the search-and-seizure claims of state prisoners would not further the purpose of the rule \u2014 to deter unconstitutional police conduct \u2014 to an extent sufficient to outweigh the additional costs to the truth-finding process. Accordingly, the Court held that \u201cwhere the State has provided an opportunity for full and fair litigation of a Fourth Amendment claim, a state prisoner may not be granted federal habeas corpus on the ground that evidence obtained in an unconstitutional search or seizure was introduced at his trial.\u201d 428 U.S. at 494, 96 S.Ct. at 3052 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-12\">The district court in this case held <em>Stone v. Powell </em>inapplicable, reasoning that O\u2019Quinn\u2019s claim is based on the prosecution\u2019s duty to disclose exculpatory information, which under <em>Brady </em>arises out of the due process guaranty of a fair trial, not the search-and-seizure clause of the fourth amendment. It is clear, however, that O\u2019Quinn\u2019s constitutional claim is ultimately based on the fourth amendment. From a constitutional standpoint, the identities of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1210\">*1210</page-number>the \u201cknown narcotics users\u201d are useful to him only in an attack on the probable cause predicate of the search warrant that ultimately yielded the damning narcotics. Indeed, O\u2019Quinn is not even in as good a position as were Messrs. Powell and Rice, for O\u2019Quinn\u2019s fourth amendment claim is not yet a reality; he merely hopes that a fourth amendment claim will materialize from disclosure of the five known narcotics users. Nor is O\u2019Quinn entitled to habeas corpus relief under \u00a7 2254 on the ground that he was unable to use the known narcotics users as impeachment witnesses. Standing alone, his naked speculation that the persons observed entering his residence might have been helpful to his defense as impeachment witnesses, hardly rises to the level of a constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-4\">Plaintiff unsuccessfully pressed his claim in Texas state court on direct appeal in 1971. Having received an opportunity for full and fair litigation of his fourth amendment claim, O\u2019Quinn is not entitled to federal habeas corpus relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-5\">REVERSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
