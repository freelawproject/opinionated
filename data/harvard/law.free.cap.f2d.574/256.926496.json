The court\u2019s decision was based on a lack of \u201csome element of general reliance by plaintiff\u201d on the reports released by defendants. In his deposition testimony which was before the district court, plaintiff specifically averred that he relied on the reports dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>seminated by defendants, which were allegedly misleading in their treatment of sales to a subsidiary and of research and development expenses. Holding that the district court erroneously concluded that there was no issue of fact as to reliance, and that it misapplied our case of <em>Simon v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., </em>482 F.2d 880 (5th Cir. 1973), which turned on a finding of lack of any reliance on a broker\u2019s advice, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">I. <em>Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Plaintiff Michael Rifkin brought this class action suit pursuant to \u00a7 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 78j(b), and Rule 10b-5, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5, promulgated thereunder. Named as defendants were Recognition Equipment, Inc.; nine of its officers and directors; its affiliate, Corporation S; and its accountants, Price Waterhouse &amp; Co. Plaintiff sought to recover damages suffered by himself and all persons who purchased Recognition common stock on the open market between October 31, 1969 and July 1, 1971 at prices allegedly inflated by misleading financial and other statements disseminated by Recognition, some of which were certified by defendant Price Water-house. Plaintiff alleges that Recognition was able to show a profit in 1969 only by improperly capitalizing millions of dollars worth of research and development expenses, and by not consolidating Recognition\u2019s financial statements with those of its 49%-owned affiliate, Corporation S, to which Recognition made substantial sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Recognition was organized in 1962 to design and manufacture optical scanning character recognition systems. Such devices \u201ctranslate\u201d written English into \u201cmachine language\u201d for utilization by a computer. During its early years, Recognition suffered substantial losses. In 1965, Recognition\u2019s president, defendant Philipson, promised its shareholders that the company would be profitable by 1969. Despite losses for the years 1962 through 1968, on January 28, 1969 Philipson repeated his prediction that Recognition would show a profit for its fiscal year ending October 31, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">Recognition\u2019s 1969 Annual Report showed the promised profits. Plaintiff contends that Recognition was able to achieve this only by making two principal misstatements and omissions in the financial reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">First, the company capitalized several million dollars of research and development costs. This fact was revealed in Note 5 to the financial statement. Plaintiff alleges that defendants knew this research and development would not be recoverable from later years\u2019 operations. Therefore, plaintiff contends, it should not have been capitalized and carried as an asset, but instead should have been written off in 1969. In 1970, Recognition decided to expense research and development costs as incurred, and to write off the prior (1969) unamor-tized research and development as an extraordinary item.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">Second, Recognition reported profits on sales of equipment to its affiliate, Corporation S. Recognition had formed Corporation S in 1967. Corporation S was a \u201cservice\u201d company, which provided data processing services to subscribers, using Recognition\u2019s optical character recognition equipment. In 1969, Recognition reduced its' ownership of Corporation S to 49%. As a result, Corporation S was no longer a majority-owned subsidiary, and Recognition did not consolidate the financial results of the two companies in its 1969 financial statements as it had in the past. Recognition pointed this out in Note 2 to the financial statement in its 1969 Annual Report.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">Recognition\u2019s sales for 1969 included sales of $12,000,000 of equipment to Corporation S. This represented 45% of Recognition\u2019s total sales for that year of $27,000,000. Plaintiff asserts that generally accepted accounting principles required Recognition to consolidate Corporation S\u2019s results with its own, thus eliminating the intercompany sales and profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-12\">II. <em>Issues of Fact</em></p>\n<p id=\"b342-13\">A. <em>As to Reliance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b342-14\">The district court erred in holding that there was no genuine issue of fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>regarding the lack of \u201csome element of general reliance by plaintiff.\u201d Even if \u201csome element of general reliance\u201d were required, a legal issue discussed in Section III, <em>infra, </em>of this opinion, plaintiff offered sufficient evidence to create an issue of fact in that regard, so that the case could not be decided by summary judgment on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">In his deposition, Rifkin specifically stated that he relied on the 1969 Annual Report and other statements emanating directly and indirectly from Recognition in making his seven purchases of Recognition stock in the period in question. He summarized his detailed deposition testimony about his reliance by saying that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">I read every document I received from the Company, and to the extent I read it, I relied on it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">In making his first purchase, of 50 shares, on December 19, 1969, Rifkin relied on an account of a speech by Recognition\u2019s president Philipson, in which Philipson reported that Recognition \u201chad achieved a long awaited turnaround for the year ended 1969, a turnaround in earnings, resulting from sharply increasing sales.\u201d He also \u201ctook into account\u201d information in trade journals (such as Moody\u2019s, Electronic News, and Standard &amp; Poor), and an Arthur D. Little study about the potential for optical recognition equipment. In making his purchase, he relied upon the \u201cfact that REI [Recognition] became profitable for the first time; that . . . after years of investment and heavy losses, they . alone in the industry were suddenly profitable [and] the turnaround was pretty good.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-11\">Plaintiff\u2019s second purchase, also of 50 shares, was on January 15, 1970. In addition to the material he had relied on in making his first purchase, he relied on an article in Business Week, more complete reports of Philipson\u2019s speech, and possibly Recognition\u2019s 1969 Annual Report, if he had received it by then.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-12\">On February 4, 1970, plaintiff purchased another 50 shares. By this purchase at the latest, he received and relied on the company\u2019s 1968 and 1969 Annual Reports. He also read a complete transcript of Philip-son\u2019s speech, which appeared in the Wall Street Transcript issue of January 19, and a \u201cwelcome\u201d letter from Recognition.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-14\">Plaintiff made his fourth purchase, of 100 shares, on September 10, 1970. He relied on a Barron\u2019s article, Recognition\u2019s semi-annual report to shareholders, a Recognition press release reporting that it had received a $7,000,000 contract from the United States Post Office, a series of Investors News Reports which Recognition sent its stockholders, and a Wall Street Transcript of another speech by Philipson.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-15\">Plaintiff\u2019s next purchase, of 50 shares, occurred on October 20, 1970. In making this purchase, he relied upon all the information he had previously relied upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-16\">On January 4, 1971, plaintiff made his sixth purchase, of 100 shares of Recognition stock. In making this purchase, he considered a Wall Street Journal article reporting that Recognition would have reported a profit for the year ending 1970, but because of an accounting change and extraordinary items, Recognition was going to have a loss of almost $11,000,000 for the year.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-17\">Rifkin made his seventh and last purchase on February 12, 1971. He stated that if he received the 1970 Annual Report dated January 4 before making this purchase, he read and relied on it. He also relied on an article by Robert Metz in the New York Times, which showed that Recognition\u2019s \u201cstock was priced low as compared to prior periods.\u201d Rifkin also noted that before all of his purchases he relied on the interim reports (quarterly and semi-annual) he received from the company. By \u201creliance,\u201d Rifkin said he meant that he saw and read the material and it was a factor in his determination to buy the Recognition stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-18\">In addition to the specific documents referred to above, Rifkin stated that in making his purchases he relied on the fact that the market price of a stock reflects the company\u2019s financial statements and its inherent value:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-19\">If the price of the stock reflects, and I believe it does, if the price of a stock <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>reflects the financial statements which are circulated to the investment community and if the financial statements are over-stated, inflated, it would be reasonable to believe that the price of the stock was over-stated. I think that a buyer of a security has a right to rely on the fact that the stock value bears some reasonable relationship to the financial statements circulated in the investment market. . . . [Investors] are entitled to rely on the fairness of a price set by the general investment community and that that price has been established as bearing a reasonable relationship to the earnings and balance sheets and if the earnings and balance sheets are over-stated, why their reliance and expectation of paying a fair price is just not borne out.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Thus, plaintiff\u2019s testimony, if accepted by a trier of fact, would support recovery under even the most restricted reliance requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">B. As <em>to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles</em></p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">Plaintiff alleges that the Recognition financial statements were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and did not fairly present the true financial position of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">Defendants submitted several affidavits from experts which flatly concluded that Recognition\u2019s financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, but plaintiff\u2019s affidavits from his accounting expert detailed a contrary opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">Defendants argue that an analysis of the affidavits reveals no genuine issue as to the propriety of the accounting methods employed in the financial statements. They argue that the statements, when read with the accompanying notes, reveal all that is required by generally accepted accounting principles, and that the consolidation touted by plaintiff and his expert would actually have been contrary to the law and generally accepted accounting principles in effect at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">The analysis of these arguments, however, is an exercise initially for the district court. The district court\u2019s decision, granting summary judgment to defendants based on the reliance issue, made no mention as to whether the district court considered there to be a genuine issue of a material fact as to the fair presentation and disclosure of the financial condition of the company. On remand, the district court is free to consider the propriety of summary judgment on any ground it has not previously ruled upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-11\">III. <em>Simon v. Merrill Lynch and Rule 10b-5\u2019s Reliance Requirement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b344-12\">While we do not know for certain how the facts will develop on further proceedings, we have concluded that, in light of the parties\u2019 contentions, it is highly unlikely that <em>Simon v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., </em>482 F.2d 880 (5th Cir. 1973), will be a controlling or dispositive precedent as to the law in this case. That decision held a 10b-5 cause of action foreclosed because there was no \u201cgeneral reliance\u201d on the stockbroker\u2019s alleged misrepresentations. Further analysis here may be helpful to the district court on remand to put <em>Simon </em>in proper context, <em>vis-a-vis </em>this case and the law of reliance as it has developed in the other circuits.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-13\">Simon brought his 10b-5 action against Merrill Lynch, alleging he had purchased common stock in a computer corporation because of misrepresentations and omissions made by Merrill Lynch. After a bench <em>trial, </em>the district court concluded that Simon had failed to prove his case against Merrill Lynch. Simon appealed, and we affirmed. Our disposition was clearly based on the fact that the district judge, as trier of fact, found that Simon <em>had not relied </em>on any Merrill Lynch representations. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-14\">The [trial] Court specifically found that Simon <em>\u201cdid not rely </em>on [Merrill Lynch\u2019s representations] regarding these securities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>482 F.2d at 883 (emphasis added). Simon did not convince us that this finding of fact was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Simon argued that the trial court\u2019s finding of nonreliance was \u201cnot dispositive,\u201d because Simon read <em>Affiliated Ute Citizens </em>v. <em>United States, </em>406 U.S. 128, 92 S.Ct. 1456, 31 L.Ed.2d 741 (1972), as holding that reliance need not be proved in nondisclosure cases. We rejected Simon\u2019s argument on the basis of the facts before us, that is, that the district judge had found that Simon was not relying on any information from Merrill Lynch in making his purchases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-6\">We think the finding that plaintiff did not generally rely upon the broker for advice makes the principle asserted by Simon inapplicable here. Although <em>Ute </em>does state that a plaintiff need not specifically demonstrate reliance on particular omissions, that case did not involve, as here, a general <em>lack of reliance by the plaintiffs </em>on the defendants\u2019 representations. In <em>Ute, </em>concerning the management and distribution of the Indian tribe\u2019s assets, the Court acknowledged that the plaintiffs \u201cconsidered these defendants to be familiar with the market for the shares of stock and relied upon them when they desired to sell their shares.\u201d 406 U.S. at 152, 92 S.Ct. at 1471. The Court made clear that \u201cif [defendants] had functioned merely as a transfer agent, there would have been no duty of disclosure here.\u201d 406 U.S. at 152, 92 S.Ct. at 1471.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-12\">This reasoning is apparent in this Circuit\u2019s holdings that some element of general reliance by plaintiff, even in nondisclosure cases, is essential to a Rule 10b-5 action. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-13\">In the case at bar, the District Court found no evidence \u201cthat plaintiff followed [Merrill Lynch\u2019s] advice to his detriment,\u201d indicating that, unlike those who relied on the defendants in <em>Ute, Simon made his own investment decisions and relied in no way on defendant\u2019s recommendations. </em>The circuit\u2019s requirement of reasonable reliance, therefore, was not met.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-14\">482 F.2d at 884-885 (emphasis added). Thus, since nothing said by the broker was a factor in causing Simon to purchase his stock, nothing omitted by the broker could be a factor either. <em>Simon, </em>then, was a fact case, which merely applied the simple rule that before a defendant can be charged with a plaintiff\u2019s losses, defendant had to have played some part in <em>causing </em>those losses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Since <em>Simon </em>was based on a find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>ing of fact, no burden of proof issues were involved, and the articulation of the <em>Ute </em>presumption of reliance was inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">In <em>Ute, </em>a bank purchased stock from a group of unsophisticated investors without disclosing that the stock was selling at a higher price on a secondary market made by the bank. The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit denied recovery because the record failed to disclose evidence that the plaintiffs relied on any misstatements made by the bank. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-5\">[u]nder the circumstances of this case, involving primarily a failure to disclose, positive proof of reliance is not a prerequisite to recovery. All that is necessary is that the facts withheld be material in the sense that a reasonable investor might have considered them important in the making of this decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">406 U.S. at 153-154, 92 S.Ct. at 1472. Thus, <em>Ute </em>simply did not address the <em>Simon </em>situation where there was positive proof that the plaintiff did not rely on anything defendant did.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">After <em>Ute, </em>the reliance requirement has varied somewhat in articulation from circuit to circuit, but a general pattern seems to have emerged: where a 10b-5 action alleges defendant made positive misrepresentations of material information, proof of reliance by the plaintiff upon the misrepresentation is required. Upon an absence of proof on the issue, plaintiff loses. On the other hand, where a plaintiff alleges deception by defendant\u2019s nondisclosure of material information, the <em>Ute </em>presumption obviates the need for plaintiff to prove actual reliance on the omitted information.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Upon a failure of proof on the issue, defendant loses. But this presumption of reliance in nondisclosure cases is not conclusive. If defendant can prove that plaintiff did not rely, that is, that plaintiff\u2019s decision would not have been affected even if defendant had disclosed the omitted facts, then plaintiff\u2019s recovery is barred.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Simon, </em>therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>employs a reliance standard no different from that generally applied in other federal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The above analysis tends to demonstrate that <em>Simon </em>may well be inapplicable to this case. On remand, when the facts are fully developed, it will first be necessary for the district court to \u201ccharacterize\u201d the case, as a \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d or an \u201comission\u201d case. If the court determines that this is a misrepresentation case, then the more stringent reliance requirement would apply, and Rifkin would need to prove that he relied on defendants\u2019 misrepresentations. If, on the other hand, the district court determines that this is an omission case, Rifkin would be entitled to the <em>Ute </em>presumption of reliance, and without more, he could prevail on the reliance issue unless, as in <em>Simon, </em>defendants prove that plaintiff did not rely. Since the alleged misstatements were in the official financial statements of the company itself, defendants may be hard pressed to demonstrate that these statements played no part in the investment decisions of an investor such as Rifkin.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\"><em>Simon </em>would also be inapplicable should the .facts so develop as to present a \u201cfraud on the market\u201d theory of action. Rifkin testified that he relied on the market to properly reflect in market value the financial condition of a company as accurately set forth in the company\u2019s statements. The inaccuracies and omissions of the statements caused a distortion in the market which Rifkin claims misled him as to the fair market value of the stock. In further support of his claim, Rifkin submitted an affidavit from a securities expert, who concluded that the alleged misstatements \u201chad a material inflationary impact on the price at which Recognition stock traded during the period\u201d in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">In cases involving similar \u201cfraud on the market\u201d claims, the Second and Ninth Circuits have held that a plaintiff need not show individual reliance upon the particular misrepresentations or omissions made by a defendant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The rationale for extending the <em>Ute </em>presumption of reliance to such cases was explained in <em>Blackie </em>v. <em>Barrack:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8z\">A purchaser on the stock exchanges . relies generally on the supposition that the market price is validly set and that no unsuspected manipulation has artificially inflated the price, and thus indirectly on the truth of the representations underlying the stock price \u2014 whether he is aware of it or not, the price he pays reflects material misrepresentations. Requiring direct proof from each purchaser that he relied on a particular representation when purchasing would defeat recovery by those whose reliance was indirect, despite the fact that the causational chain is broken only if the purchaser would have purchased the stock even had he known of the misrepresentation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">524 F.2d 891, 907 (9th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 816, 97 S.Ct. 57, 50 L.Ed.2d 75 (1976). A defendant can rebut this presumption of reliance in two ways: by proving that an insufficient number of traders relied to inflate the stock\u2019s price, or by proving that the plaintiff purchased despite knowledge of the misrepresentation or omission or that he would have purchased had he known of it. 524 F.2d at 906.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">This Circuit has not yet decided whether reliance should be presumed in \u201cfraud on the market\u201d situations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Without full de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>velopment of the facts, we need not now decide whether such a theory will be recognized in this Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">IV. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The district court erred in granting defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment for lack of \u201cgeneral reliance by plaintiff,\u201d both as to the issues of fact involved and in its application of <em>Simon v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., supra, </em>to the facts before it. We therefore reverse and remand to the district court. Since the district court denied class certification with a citation to <em>Simon, </em>we vacate that order to allow the district court to reconsider that order in light of this opinion. We affirm, however, that part of the district court\u2019s order dismissing the case against defendant Richard Dawkins for want of prosecution, since even at this date Dawkins has never been served with process in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">We wish to emphasize that summary judgment for defendants is not precluded by this opinion, if it is based on some ground other than the reliance issue. Defendants have argued that summary judgment is proper, even if plaintiff has shown reliance, because defendants followed generally accepted accounting principles and did not make any misrepresentations or omissions. Plaintiff disputes this. Both sides have submitted accountants\u2019 affidavits. The district court did not base summary judgment on this issue. It is appropriate for us to leave this question for initial determination by the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b345-7\">. Dicta in our recent opinion of <em>Moody v. Bache &amp; Co., </em>570 F.2d 523 (5th Cir. 1978), suggested that this is the correct interpretation of <em>Simon. </em>The Court there observed that Simon\u2019s recovery had been precluded by a specific finding of nonreliance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-8\">[E]ven in nondisclosure cases, where a <em>causal link between violation and harm </em>is always most difficult to prove, a <em>specific finding of nonreliance may suffice to overcome the materiality of the omission. Simon v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., </em>482 F.2d 880 (5th Cir. 1973).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">570 F.2d at 528, (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">This \u201ccausal link\u201d is related to a defendant\u2019s duty of disclosing information to plaintiff. In <em>Ute, </em>for example, the Supreme Court made it clear that the presumption of reliance was raised because of the \u201ccircumstances of the case.\u201d 406 U.S. at 153, 92 S.Ct. 1456. Those \u201ccircumstances\u201d included the fact that plaintiffs \u201cconsidered these defendants to be familiar with the market for the shares of stock and <em>relied upon them when they desired to sell their shares.\u201d Id. </em>at 152, 92 S.Ct. at 1471 (emphasis added). The Supreme Court noted that if defendants \u201chad functioned merely as a transfer agent, there would have been <em>no duty </em>of disclosure here.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-16\">In <em>Simon, </em>we quoted these two passages from <em>Ute, </em>and concluded that our requirement of \u201csome element of general reliance by plaintiff, even in nondisclosure cases\u201d is based on \u201c[t]his reasoning\u201d in <em>Ute. </em>Thus, it is clear that <em>Simon\u2019s </em>\u201cgeneral reliance\u201d requirement means that in a general way, plaintiff must have made his purchase relying on defendant\u2019s duty to disclose material information to plaintiff. <em>See Vohs v. Dickson, </em>495 F.2d 607, 622 (5th Cir. 1974) (the <em>Ute </em>presumption of reliance is confined by <em>Simon </em>\u201cto making proof of <em>specific </em>reliance on particular omissions unnecessary when the circumstances indicate that the plaintiff placed some <em>general </em>reliance upon the defendant\u2019s disclosing material information.\u201d) (emphasis in original); <em>Amswiss International Corp. v.

In other words, <em>Simon\u2019s </em>\u201cgeneral reliance\u201d language simply requires there to be a causal link between defendant\u2019s violation and plaintiffs harm in order for plaintiff to recover. <em>See also Moody v.
