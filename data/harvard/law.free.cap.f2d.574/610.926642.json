ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b696-22\">We are presented here with disputes arising from attempts by the Federal Power Commission<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to encourage voluntary responses by electric utilities to problems cre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>ated by the 1973 oil embargo. The issues are whether the Commission reasonably exercised its discretion in rejecting invocation of its emergency powers, in setting rates for service voluntarily furnished during the crisis, and in deferring detailed consideration of an allegation of unlawful discrimination. We hold that in each action it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">I. INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"Ayy\">To counteract oil shortages threatened by the embargo, the Commission on November 29.1973, implored the Nation\u2019s electric utilities to make maximum use of other fuels.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because utilities in some sectors of the country, such as New England, relied heavily on oil for their boilers, the Commission called for the transfer, when feasible, of electricity from regions with excess non-oil-fired capacity \u2014 primarily areas in which coal was heavily utilized \u2014 to those short on petroleum. The Commission also sought the help of the National Electric Reliability Council in establishing a voluntary program of emergency transmissions. Since an alternative solution was to convert East Coast plants to coal-fired boilers and then to ship coal to the East, the process of transferring electricity became known as \u201ccoal by wire.\u201d A number of utilities volunteered to participate.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Concerned by forecasts of dire oil shortfalls and apparently doubting the efficacy of the voluntary program, the New England Power Pool (NEPOOL)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on January 10.1974, petitioned the Commission to order utilities east of the Mississippi River with excess capacity to supply it with energy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> NEPOOL sought to convince the Commission to use to this end its emergency authority under Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Commission responded immediately by ordering the eastern utilities to notify NEPOOL of any excess capacity available for coal-by-wire transactions and by convening a public conference to arrange a voluntary solution of NEPOOL\u2019s problems. Participants in this and four additional meetings discussed needs, schedules, rates, limitations and the effects of coal-by-wire service on the local obligations of supplying utilities. By the time of the final conference, the purchasing, transmitting and supplying utilities and participating state regulatory commissions had arrived at substantial agreement. The supplying and transmitting utilities subsequently filed new or amended rate schedules, which specified refunds in excess of $2 million on charges at previously higher rates, and NEPOOL moved to withdraw its petition for emergency relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-14\">The Commission\u2019s staff expressed its approval of the rates. Conceptualizing \u201cfuel conservation service\u201d as a series of transfers scheduled on a weekly or slightly longer basis, the staff recommended that the rate structure resemble those frequently employed for short-term power, including recovery of the replacement cost of fuel, incremental operating costs (variable costs) and a pro rata share of fixed costs (constant costs). The staff concluded that the rates were reasonable as measured by that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-15\">Richmond (Indiana) Power &amp; Light, an electric utility, and Representative Michael J. Harrington of Massachusetts<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> objected to the proposed rates on various grounds, and the Commission instituted a rulemak-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>ing proceeding.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Other interested utilities submitted undisputed data showing that the variable and constant costs allocated to this service equalled or exceeded the rates proposed. Richmond and the Commission\u2019s Office of Economics, however, protested the attribution of any fixed costs to the service. Richmond further complained of the Commission\u2019s failure to impose rates low enough for Adam Smith\u2019s invisible hand to dictate the use of coal by wire even after imported oil again became freely available. An aspect of this alleged error was the Commission\u2019s rejection of Richmond\u2019s requested \u201cthrough\u201d rate \u2014 a single joint rate for a transmission crossing two or more systems as opposed to individual rates for each utility or power pool involved in the transaction.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Richmond also disputed the Commission\u2019s refusal to direct intervening utilities to transmit \u2014 or wheel<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u2014 electricity from the supplier to the purchaser. Many of the parties responded to Richmond\u2019s attacks and disagreed with its conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">By order of August 26,1974, the Commission determined that the situation did not justify invocation of its emergency powers and granted NEPOOL\u2019s motion to withdraw its petition.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Commission further found that fixed-cost recovery was proper and that the cost data it had received fully supported the proposed rates.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Lastly, the Commission refused to compel utilities to wheel power.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> On September 26, 1975, the Commission denied reconsideration of the points now in contention,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and petitioners seek our review.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-15\">II. THE COAL-BY-WIRE PROGRAM</p>\n<p id=\"b698-16\">A. <em>NEPOOL\u2019s Petition for Emergency Relief</em></p>\n<p id=\"b698-17\">We must first analyze the Commission\u2019s decision to allow NEPOOL to withdraw its petition for emergency relief. Richmond is aggrieved by the Commission\u2019s refusal to invoke Section 202(c)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> only if its emergency powers could have provided the sole authorization for the steps Richmond sought. Thus, unless the Commission incorrectly declined to declare an emergency, we must consider the remaining issues in light of the Commission\u2019s ordinary powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-18\">We encounter little difficulty in concluding that the Commission was well within its discretion. Richmond argues that NE-POOL never received all of the coal by wire it had originally requested and, although the embargo has long since ended, that the high cost and uncertain supply of imported oil continue to justify emergency measures. On the first point, the Commission pointed out that because the effects of the embargo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>were less severe than expected NEPOOL received greater oil allocations than originally anticipated, that the coal-by-wire equivalent of 1.3 million barrels of oil was voluntarily supplied, and that NEPOOL never had to interrupt service.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Commission insists that under these circumstances it did not abuse its discretion by settling upon a temporary-voluntary program, and we heartily agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">Richmond\u2019s second contention, that dependence on imported oil leaves this country with a continuing emergency, compels no different result. We are fully mindful, of course, that current national policy is to discourage reliance on foreign oil, but we cannot fault the Commission for reading Section 202(c) as devoid of a solution. That section speaks of \u201ctemporary\u201d emergencies, epitomized by wartime disturbances,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and is aimed at situations in which demand for electricity exceeds supply and not at those in which supply is adequate but a means of fueling its production is in disfavor.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The Commission\u2019s construction of Section 202(c) contravenes neither common sense nor any indication of legislative intent, and we are constrained to defer to the administrative interpretation.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">B. <em>The Necessity of Considering National Policy On Foreign Oil</em></p>\n<p id=\"b699-11\">Richmond\u2019s major complaint is that the Commission erroneously limited the scope of its inquiry. The Commission explained its position in these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AW3\">These proceedings are not ones in which we are properly called upon to resolve broad questions of resource allocation, industry pooling structures and operating procedures, all as raised by the foregoing contentions. These fuel conservation power and energy transfers were consummated at the Commission\u2019s request to meet physical fuel shortfall conditions, not to affect economic conditions. The Commission contemplated that these transfers would be accomplished within the framework of the existing power pools and electric reliability councils.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-13\">Since displacement of foreign oil with domestic energy is a national goal, Richmond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>argues that the Commission must consider incentives to the substitution of domestic fuels in reaching any decision that could have that effect. Specifically, Richmond posits that \u201cfuel conservation\u201d rates that do not lead to decreased consumption of foreign oil are ipso facto unreasonable.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">We disagree. Although the Commission must serve the public interest in approving rates, we see no abuse of discretion in limiting this proceeding to the shortrun problem of setting just and reasonable rates for the service theretofore provided in response to the 1973 oil embargo. While an administrative agency must remain faithful to public policies directly related to its regulatory authority,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> surely at any given moment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>history it may rationally decline to affirmatively foster other policies in weighing the specific interests that it is required by statute to consider.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> This is especially true when the forum chosen by proponents of the other policy is not well suited to study of its implications.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">The goal of minimal use of foreign oil is predicated upon fear of overdependence and the concomitant danger of economic dislocation by an actual or threatened cutoff. This very dispute demonstrates, however, that as long as substantial excess capacity remains available in an emergency\u2014 and Richmond does not propose any lasting dedication of capacity \u2014 the Commission by order or by persuasion can eliminate much of the need for oil in electrical generation, Thus the question of long-term displacement of imported petroleum could safely be left to later proceedings instigated by Richmond or the Commission itself, or indeed to resolution by Congress.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">Moreover, while the Commission rebuffed a more positive march toward the goal of decreased consumption of foreign oil, it also rejected the means suggested by Richmond for achieving that end as either ineffica-cious or statutorily prohibited. If that action was well founded, the Commission\u2019s failure to weigh the requested objective could hardly amount to error.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Thus, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>turn to the specifics of Richmond\u2019s proposals.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">C. <em>Through Rates</em></p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Richmond\u2019s most imaginative demand was that the Commission modify the proposed schedules by the -substitution of \u201cthrough\u201d transmission rates for coal-by-wire transactions. An understanding of this proposition requires some knowledge of the national electrical interconnection system, and thus we offer a brief explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">The United States is divided into a number of regions for purposes of interconnection.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Many parts of the country are served by formal power pools, made up of interlinked utilities contracting to shunt electricity back and forth as needed.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Each such pool has a central dispatcher in charge of interutility transfers and transmissions <footnotemark>29</footnotemark> to other contiguous systems. In-terpool transactions require a high degree of coordinated effort. NEPOOL, for example, might request electricity from the adjoining New York Power Pool (NYPP), which might fill the order and replace its surrendered energy by a transmission from the neighboring Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection (PJM). If PJM does not wish to start up oil-fired generators for that purpose, it may seek a transmission from the Allegheny Power System, located to the west. This process, which Richmond derisively labels a \u201cdaisy-chain,\u201d continues until it reaches a utility willing to employ its excess capacity to complete \u2014 or, from its perspective, to begin \u2014 the transaction. That utility is the supplier, and all intervening utilities are engaged in \u201cwheeling\u201d of electricity.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-12\">Such transfers normally occur at night or on weekends, when suppliers are more likely to have underused turbines and power lines. Traditionally, and under the schedules approved by the Commission, each utility or pool pays its neighbor for the service provided; a particular coal-by-wire transmission can involve four or more individual charges. If no supplier can be found or any needed intervening utility refuses to wheel, the entire transmission will fail. Quite understandably, no one lacking excess capacity is generally disposed to give power up until assured of a replacement amount from someone else.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>Richmond proposed a single through rate for transmissions crossing multiple utilities or systems, with the participants later dividing the payment. This, it was argued, would allow supplier and ultimate purchaser to engage in \u201cface-to-face\u201d dealings and thus encourage use of coal by wire. Nonetheless, as the Commission pointed out, coordination is essential to assure balanced loading of transmission lines and consequently to avoid disruptions and blackouts.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Unavoidably, then, each dispatch center must communicate directly with its neighbor in any case.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">Moreover, as Richmond admits,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> through rates would be feasible only if the Commission could order all intervening utilities to wheel electricity; a bundle of electrons ordered by a purchaser simply cannot be put in the mail by a supplier. And such a rate would be advantageous to purchasers only if it were lower than the sum of the individual rates. Since purchasers are always free to subscribe to the services of willing utilities at the separate rates, the Commission\u2019s failure to establish through rates can be deemed arbitrary only if the individual rates were unjustly or unreasonably high and, as well, the utilities had a duty to wheel. Richmond separately contended for both of these propositions, to which we turn next.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">D. <em>Authority to Require Wheeling</em></p>\n<p id=\"A1_\">No one now argues that the Commission has authority to mandate wheeling. As the Supreme Court recently held, the legislative history precludes that result:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-10\">As originally conceived, Part II [of the Federal Power Act] would have included a \u201ccommon carrier\u201d provision making it \u201cthe duty of every public utility to . , transmit energy for any person upon reasonable request. . . .\u2019\u2019In addition, it would have empowered the Federal Power Commission to order wheeling if it found such action to be \u201cnecessary or desirable in the public interest.\u201d H.R. 5423, 74th Cong., 1st Sess.; S. 1725, 74th Cong., 1st Sess. These provisions were eliminated to preserve \u201cthe voluntary action of the utilities.\u201d S.Rep.No.621, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., 19.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-13\">It is clear, then, that Congress rejected a pervasive regulatory scheme for controlling the interstate distribution of power in favor of voluntary commercial relationships.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-14\">As we have indicated, both Richmond and Representative Harrington originally urged the Commission to directly order wheeling.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> As the Congressman put it, he would have \u201c \u2018require[d] utilities to transmit power along their lines if capacity [was] fully available\u2019 \u201d because \u201cpast reliance on voluntary interconnection and coordination of facilities (Section 202(a)) by areas within the United States has not produced a rational power system . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Whether or not one is impressed by the possible benefits of a fully integrated national power grid,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> it is clear that Representative Harrington\u2019s arguments are better directed to his congressional colleagues than to the Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>sion, for only Congress can change what has been wrought by Section 202(a).<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">In this court Richmond seeks the same end through less direct means. Since the Commission may reject unreasonable rate proposals and fix acceptable rates instead,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> and since the utilities submitted to the Commission rates for voluntary wheeling, Richmond asserts that the Commission must have the power to condition its approval of those rates on continued, albeit involuntary, wheeling. This logic is superficially persuasive; the Commission does have authority to impose requirements and conditions \u201cnecessary or appropriate to promote the policies\u201d of the Act.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> But such conditions may not contravene the Act, and the reasoning of Richmond\u2019s unstated minor premise, as we now explain, seeks to achieve exactly that.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">Richmond assumes that the proffered rates were unreasonable because they did not guarantee that utilities will wheel. Yet Congress\u2019 as-yet unamended purpose was to indulge utilities that very freedom.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> If Congress had intended that utilities could inadvertently bootstrap themselves into common-carrier status by filing rates for voluntary service, it would not have bothered to reject mandatory wheeling in favor of a call for just such voluntary wheeling. What the Commission is prohibited from doing directly it may not achieve by indirection.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-13\">E. <em>Recovery of Fixed Costs</em></p>\n<p id=\"b704-14\">On more traditional grounds, Richmond attacks the inclusion of fixed costs in the Commission\u2019s transmission rate calculations.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The rationale is that fuel conservation service is in practice largely confined to nights and weekends and thus uses idle capacity, and that transmitting utilities do not dedicate capacity but rather can terminate transmissions on short notice. Thus Richmond would predicate the rates on variable costs because the service would not require the building of new facilities with accompanying fixed costs. Richmond also argues that fixed costs are fully reflected in the utilities\u2019 other rate schedules and that pro rata inclusion here would produce a windfall for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-15\">Richmond\u2019s contentions. obviously would be doomed to failure had it succeeded in persuading the Commission to develop long-term fuel conservation measures featuring mandatory wheeling. Had that been done, and once such transfers became commonplace, utilities expectably would build new facilities to assure an adequate safeguard of excess capacity for their regular customers; <footnotemark>42</footnotemark> fixed costs would thus become closely related to the service in question. The same response \u2014 and the same result\u2014 might be anticipated if long-term, large-scale voluntary wheeling became predicta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>ble. The Commission, however, has for now rejected coal by wire as more than a temporary expedient, and accordingly must justify the rates in light of the sporadic and transient nature of the service.</p>\n<p id=\"aky-dedup-0\">Without debating the logic behind the inclusion of fixed costs in situations of this sort, we must say that in this case the Commission has reached an informed and reasoned decision.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> We might observe generally that the science of utility rate-making may not be so exact that, even if it were the rule that \u201creasonable\u201d rates must be strictly cost-related, the allocation of fixed costs to short-term use of otherwise excess capacity could be considered unquestionably arbitrary.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> We need not reach that issue, however, because we find that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>was within the Commission\u2019s discretion to conclude that Richmond\u2019s off-peak pricing theory was unacceptable on the facts of this case.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">Although the utilities could cancel out on short notice, coal-by-wire service involved reservations of identifiable facilities.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> More importantly, transmitting systems such as PJM showed that their participation would often levy maximum loads on their facilities, thus imposing a ceiling on increased service to their standing customers, although supplying utilities might not be operating at capacity.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> And, as the Commission noted, even if some of the same fixed costs had already been allocated through another rate schedule, coal-by-wire transmission service should not be given a \u201cfree ride\u201d; both federal and state regulatory agencies could always order corresponding changes in the rates for the utilities\u2019 normal consumers.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> This arrangement seems in accord with Congress\u2019 refusal to compel utilities to function as common carriers and its manifest intent that they meet their local obligations first.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-11\">To summarize, we find that substantial evidence supports the Commission\u2019s actions and that the rates approved fall'within the statutorily-mandated zone of reasonableness.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> The Commission specifically left open the possibility of applying off-peak cost allocation methods when warranted,<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> and in a separate rulemaking proceeding not here under challenge gave broader study to the theoretical principles generally applicable to rates in fuel-by-wire transactions.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> We think no more was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-12\">III. DISCRIMINATION</p>\n<p id=\"adu-dedup-0\">One last and analytically separate issue remains. Richmond has used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>these proceedings as a forum for its complaint of the alleged refusal of the American Electric Power System (AEP) \u2014 the Nation\u2019s largest \u2014 and its affiliate, Indiana &amp; Michigan Electric Co. (I&amp;M), to wheel Richmond\u2019s excess energy to coal-by-wire customers. Viewing itself, perhaps correctly, as David battling Goliath, Richmond argues that AEP and I&amp;M are guilty of unlawful discrimination because they decline to transmit its power and instead wheel higher-priced electricity of another AEP member.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">With contract negotiations ongoing between Richmond and I&amp;M, the Commission\u2019s order of August 26,1974, referred the dispute to the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission, and concluded that the parties should reconsider their positions in light of its rulings on Richmond\u2019s other contentions.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> The Commission also expressly held out \u201cthe opportunity to seek further Commission consideration and resolution of any remaining unresolved issue within the Commission\u2019s regulatory jurisdiction. ... If there are then any outstanding unresolved issues within the Commission\u2019s regulatory jurisdiction, they will be set for hearing by a future Commission order.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-10\">Richmond\u2019s only response was to argue that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-11\">[t]he Commission has failed, and is failing, to order relief for Richmond which would assure that I&amp;M will in fact purchase Richmond energy on a non-discriminatory basis, that I&amp;M will provide transmission service for Richmond\u2019s available energy not purchased by I&amp;M, and that I&amp;M will sell to and transmit to Richmond conservation energy in the event of a coal shortage, at least on the same basis it provides such services to other utilities, and on the same basis such services are supplied among and between the AEP affiliates.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-12\">Thus Richmond spurned the opportunity to demonstrate that particular activities were unreasonably anticompetitive or discriminatory and claimed instead that the mere failure to wheel energy to and from Richmond while wheeling for any other utility was unlawful discrimination.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> With the issue thus narrowed, the Commission correctly ruled that since Congress made wheeling voluntary an individual decision to wheel for one customer but not for another is not automatically discriminatory.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> This rejection of a per se rule follows logically from the congressional refusal to impose common-carrier duties on electric utilities.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>Thus Richmond had an obligation, which it failed to meet, of presenting a <em>prima facie </em>case that I&amp;M\u2019s actions were the result of anticompetitive intentions or, perhaps, were at least unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">Had Richmond made such a presentation, we would still be far from certain that the Commission\u2019s deferral of further consideration to a separate proceeding would have been error. Agencies have wide leeway in controlling their calendars,<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> and Richmond was not complaining that any term of the approved schedules was itself anticompeti-tive.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> Richmond would have had to prove its allegations of undue discrimination in one arena or another, and we perceive no appreciable disadvantage to Richmond in consequence of the course that the Commission invited it to pursue.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Although the objectives that Richmond has sought to realize in this ratemaking proceeding may have some merit, we remain convinced that on the whole the Commission dealt with them in a manner consistent with its statutory discretion. We are not at liberty to substitute our judgment for the judgment of the Commission. The orders reviewed herein must accordingly be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b696-10\">.

Richmond did not seriously argue that the Commission should completely abandon such considerations as cost and instead set the rates at a level designed solely to assure transmission of a substantial amount of coal by wire. Thus we need not determine whether, under the Federal Power Act and the Fifth Amendment, the Commission could ever fix rates below allocable costs simply to further particular end uses or policies. Compare <em>FPC v. Hope Natural Gas Co., </em>320 U.S. 591, 617, 64 S.Ct. 281, 294-295, 88 L.Ed. 333, 353 (1944) (\u201c[i]f the standard of \u2018just and reasonable\u2019 is to sanction the maintenance of high rates . . because they restrict the use of natural gas for certain purposes, the Act must be further amended\u201d) and <em>Consolidated Gas Supply Corp. v.

Although we need not resolve the issue, one may doubt whether the goal of energy independence is within the Commission\u2019s regulatory jurisdiction at all. In <em>NAACP v. FPC, </em>the Court ruled that, although elimination of employment discrimination is \u201can important national goal,\u201d the Commission is not called upon to \u201cadvanc[e] the public interest in general\u201d; \u201cthe use of the words \u2018public interest\u2019 in a regulatory statute is not a broad license to promote the general public welfare. Rather, the words take meaning from the purposes of the regulatory legislation.\u201d 425 U.S. 662, 665-666, 669, 96 S.Ct. 1806, 1809-1810, 1811, 48 L.Ed.2d 284, 288-289, 291 (1976). The Commission\u2019s principal purpose, the Court reminded, is the \u201corderly development of plentiful supplies of electricity and natural gas at reasonable prices.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 670, 96 S.Ct. at 1811, 48 L.Ed.2d at 291 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-11\">Richmond does not argue for overall conservation of fuel, but instead urges that utilization of one fuel is preferable to another. Nor is there room in this case for argument that the Commission must encourage coal by wire because it bears more reasonable prices than does foreign oil. It would be circular to say that the Commission must consider setting low rates for coal by wire because if it does they will be below rates reflecting the cost of an equivalent amount of foreign oil.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-14\">Perhaps the answer is that the Commission may consider the energy-independence issue but, aside from its future relationship to potentially lower rates, is not necessarily required to do so. All the Act expressly mandates is that the Commission determine whether the rates are unjust, unreasonable or unduly discriminatory. Federal Power Act \u00a7\u00a7 205-206, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 824d-824e (1970). Another section of the Act, not directly applicable to this proceeding, deals with the Commission\u2019s duty to promote and encourage voluntary interconnection, and states that its purpose is to assure \u201can abundant supply of electric energy throughout the United States with the greatest possible economy and with regard to the proper utilization and conservation of natural resources . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 202(a), 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824a(a). From this expression of congressional intent, one might reason that the Commission is empowered to consider overall fuel-supply economics and the social consequences of energy shortages, but that it need not invariably do so if the rates are just and reasonable in the traditional regulatory sense and if the rate decision will not substantially impair the chances for achieving the goals of \u00a7 202(a) through the mechanisms of that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-16\">Nothing in <em>NAACP v. FPC, supra, </em>forecloses agency discretion to consider in given situations pervasive public policies that it is not required to evaluate in every decision it makes. But see Kennedy, <em>The Federal Power Commission, Job Bias and NAACP v. FPC, </em>10 Akron L.Rev. 531, 537 (1977). If it is within an agency\u2019s discretion to consider furthering an asserted public interest, but if consideration of that interest is not demanded by the governing regulatory legislation, compare, e. <em>g., Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v. FPC, </em>354 F.2d 608, 614, 620 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>384 U.S. 941, 86 S.Ct. 1462, 16 L.Ed.2d 540 (1965) (\u201c[t]he Commission has an affirmative duty to inquire into and consider\u201d all facts relevant to the decisionmaking standards imposed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>statutory scheme), or other \u201caction-forcing\u201d legislation, compare, e. <em>g., Calvert Cliffs\u2019 Coordinating Comm. v.

This conclusion was within the Commission\u2019s expertise and was supported by undisputed data in the record. Richmond\u2019s present argument differs in that it proposes that the Commission should set rates low, even below cost, simply on the ground that they would therefore be low.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b701-7\">. <em>Cf.

The Commission\u2019s justification of the resulting rate relies on fairness and value-of-service considerations. See <em>Atlantic Seaboard Corp., supra, </em>11 F.P.C. at 53-56; J. Bonbright, <em>supra </em>note 42, at 354 n.16.

PJM\u2019s major demand comes from the urban corridor on the eastern border of its system. Its base load is primarily handled by minemouth units located to the west. Units in the cities are used during peak periods to meet the increased demand. Thus major west-to-east transmission lines are heavily loaded at all times. Of course, not all systems share this characteristic, although they all received rates based in part on fixed costs. This points up a potential defect in the use of rulemaking instead of individual adjudications in setting rates. The Commission should be wary of serious over-generalizing through rulemaking, but no one has raised a protest in this proceeding. See <em>FPC v.
