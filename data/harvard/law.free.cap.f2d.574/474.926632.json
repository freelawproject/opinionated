We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-22\">Appellant opened seven bank accounts under two different pseudonyms and then deposited in each checks drawn on an out-of-State account. Each check was signed \u201cKarl Stats.\u201d To establish the checks were falsely made, the vice president of the drawee bank testified that Karl Stats was not an authorized signature for that account.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-23\">When, as here, there is no indication the drawee is a real person who may have authorized the check, the bank official\u2019s testimony, coupled with other circumstantial evidence, is sufficient proof the check was falsely made. <em>See United States v. Huntley, </em>535 F.2d 1400, 1403 (5th Cir. 1976).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There was ample evidence to support the jury\u2019s implied finding that the checks were falsely made.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b559-14\">. In pertinent part, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-15\">Whoever, with unlawful or fraudulent intent, transports in interstate commerce any falsely made [or] forged . securities knowing the same to have been falsely made [or] forged . Shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b559-19\">. \u201cFinally, appellants argue that the evidence is insufficient because there is no showing that they were not authorized to use the name \u201cS. B. Marlin.\u201d They rely on <em>Parker v. United States, </em>297 F.2d 135 (5th Cir. 1961). That case, which dealt with signing the name of another, real person to checks, is completely inapposite. The absence of any \u201cS. B. Marlin\u201d from the scene of appellants\u2019 operations eliminates the need to prove lack of authorization as a separate element of the offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-27\">535 F.2d at 1403.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
