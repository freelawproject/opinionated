Bossard, a 64 year old individual, began working in the coal mines in 1937. He worked off and on in the coal mines until 1974 when, at age 62, he terminated all employment. He felt that he was unable to work any longer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-13\">On July 9, 1973, Bossard filed a claim for black lung benefits which claim would have been governed by the transition statute, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 925, added to Part B of the Black Lung Act in 1972, and which statute governed black lung claims filed from July 1, 1973 through December 31, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-15\">A hearing was held on Bossard\u2019s claim and the hearing officer found that Bossard was totally disabled due to black lung arising out of coal mine employment. However, the hearing officer also held that the three year statute of limitations which is contained in Part C of the Act, which governs claims filed from and after January 1, 1974 to date, barred recovery against the company, Clinchfield Coal. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 932(f)(1). The hearing officer did award benefits to Bossard, but held that the Secretary of Labor was responsible for payment thereof. He reasoned that the three year statute of limitations did not run in favor of the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-17\">The Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, filed a timely appeal with the Benefits Review Board seeking a reversal of the holding of the hearing officer that the Part C statute of limitations, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 932(f)(1) was applicable to transition claims filed under the Part B transition statute, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 925. The Benefits Review Board, in a decision January 24, 1977, affirmed the hearing officer\u2019s decision. <em>Bossard v. Clinchfield Coal Co., </em>5 B.R.B.S. 374 (1977). The Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-18\">Following oral argument, we took this case under advisement pending action by the Congress on amendments to the Black Lung Act. Congress has now passed, and the President has signed, the Black Lung Benefits Reform Act of 1977 which is effective March 1, 1978. See Public Law No. 95-239, 92 Stat. 95 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1169\">*1169</page-number>In light of the substantial amendments to the Black Lung Act, including \u00a7 7(f) thereof, modifying the three year statute of limitations contained in 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 932(f)(1), 92 Stat. at 99, and also including \u00a7 15 thereof which adds an entirely new section, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 945, which deals with review of pending and previously denied claims, 92 Stat. at 103-105, this case is remanded to the Benefits Review Board for expedited treatment in light of the Black Lung Benefits Reform Act of 1977. See, Conference Report, Black Lung Benefits Reform Act of 1977, Report No. 95-864, February 2, 1978 at 21, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1978, p. 465.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1253-5\">\n<em>REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1253-17\">. We note that Bossard filed his claim for black lung benefits on July 9, 1973. We further note, that under the provisions of the Black Lung Benefits Reform Act of 1977, \u00a7 15(c), 92 Stat. at 105 that benefits may be awarded under the amended Act, on a retroactive basis for a period which begins no earlier than January 1, 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-26\">We express no opinion at this time concerning Bossard\u2019s eligibility for benefits from July 9, 1973, the date on which he first filed for benefits under the transition statute, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 925, through January 1, 1974, the cut-off date for an award of retroactive benefits under the Black Lung Act, as amended.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
