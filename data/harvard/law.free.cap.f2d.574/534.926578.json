The applicable statute is the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, as amended (15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1381 <em>et seq. </em>(Supp. V 1975)) (hereafter the \u201cAct\u201d or \u201cSafety Act\u201d). Nos. 76-2062 and 76-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>2063 concern Ford\u2019s appeal from the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment in part for the Government, and its order that Ford recall approximately 500,000 1968 and 1969 model-year Mustang and Cougar automobiles and replace a defective seat-pin bracket in the driver\u2019s seat of each of these cars.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This bracket connects the back of the seat to the bottom of the seat as shown in the sketch reproduced below from the Government\u2019s brief, page 5a.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> No. 77-1378 concerns the Government\u2019s appeal from the district court\u2019s approval of a final recall notice which the Government believes does not comply with the relevant statutory and regulatory standards.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-12\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b621-13\">After a lengthy investigation, the Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (\u201cNHTSA\u201d) on August 12, 1975<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> ordered Ford to notify the owners of 1968 and 1969 model-year Mustang and Cougar automobiles that the cars contained a defect related to motor vehicle safety and to remedy the defects in such vehicles as required by the Act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Ford de-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>dined to comply with this order and indicated its intention to seek judicial review (J.A. 172). Thus, on August 18, 1975, the Government filed suit to enforce the Administrator\u2019s order of August 12, 1975 (J.A. 151-55).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> After Ford answered the complaint (J.A. 156-61) and after both parties undertook extensive discovery, the Government filed a motion for summary judgment (J.A. 284 <em>et seq.). </em>The district court filed its opinion granting in part the Government\u2019s motion on October 1,1976 (J.A. 340-50).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Judgment in accordance with the opinion was entered on October 20, 1976 (J.A. 351-52). Thereafter, Ford appealed the October 20 order in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">In the district court, Ford sought a stay of the court\u2019s order pending appeal, but this request was denied. Then, on November 24, 1976, Ford sought in this court a stay pending appeal. On that same day, we granted an \u201cadministrative stay\u201d pending disposition of Ford\u2019s stay request. The stay motion was denied on January 19,1977, but we extended the administrative stay for two weeks to allow the parties to make further efforts to reach agreement on the terms of an \u201cinterim\u201d recall notice. It was contemplated that the \u201cinterim\u201d notice would be issued prior to our consideration of the appeal from the district court\u2019s summary judgment order. Several weeks passed during which the Government and Ford could not agree on the terms of the interim recall notice; the administrative stay was extended throughout this period. Finally, on March 8, 1977, after considering two proposed interim notices and the objections to each, this court granted Ford a stay pending appeal <em>provided </em>that it promptly distribute the Government\u2019s interim notice (Addendum to Govt. Br. at 16a). Ford, however, considered this result unacceptable: by letter dated March 21, 1977, Ford advised this court through counsel that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AoA\">upon the record evidence in this case and the information available to Ford, it is unable to agree that the notice proposed by the Government fairly represents the likely consequences of seat pin breakage. Under the circumstances, Ford\u2019s management has decided, for public and customer relations reasons, not to send such a letter but to undertake a final recall of the cars.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 20a-21a.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">The Government, concerned that the terms of Ford\u2019s unilateral final recall notice would not adequately advise car owners of the safety consequences of the pin defect, filed an emergency motion with this court on March 24, 1977 to prohibit Ford from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>implementing any final recall <em>(Id. </em>at 22a-23a). The motion was granted on March 25, 1977 <em>(Id. </em>at 27a), and the parties subsequently filed proposed final recall notices. On April 8, 1977, this court remanded the case to the district court to determine whether Ford\u2019s proposed final notice satisfied the judgment of the district court (Appendix to Govt. Br. at 36a). On April 14, 1977, the district court, after conducting a hearing, approved Ford\u2019s recall notice with certain modifications and directed Ford to distribute it <em>(Id. </em>at 64a; Appendix to Ford Brief at 71a).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">The Government did not seek a stay of the district court\u2019s April 14, 1977 order, but instead appealed it in No. 77-1378. The Government urges that a second recall notice be issued with language that, in the Government\u2019s view, corrects inadequate language contained in the order approved by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">II. FORD\u2019S APPEAL FROM THE SUMMARY JUDGMENT</p>\n<p id=\"auj-dedup-0\">The purpose of the Safety Act is to protect the public against the unreasonable risk of accidents which might be caused by defects in the design, construction, or performance of motor vehicles and against the unreasonable risk of death or injury in the event of such accidents.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Act contains a variety of mechanisms designed to further this purpose, but the one that concerns us here is the Act\u2019s requirement that manufacturers notify purchasers of motor vehicles containing a safety-related defect that poses an unreasonable risk of accident or injury within the meaning of the statute (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391; 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1412).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As mentioned above, the district court decided that the seat-pin bracket in the cars in question constituted a safety-related defect which posed an unreasonable risk within the meaning of the Act. Accordingly, the district court, upon the Government\u2019s summary judgment (notion, ordered Ford to recall the cars and repair the defective parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-12\">Ford appealed this decision, but thereafter unilaterally instituted a final recall to repair the defective seat pins in the vehicles. Ford has, on its own, initiated action which, <em>if completed in accordance with the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations, </em>will result in the elimination of the dangerous condition that was the subject of the proceedings before the district court. Now that Ford has decided to repair the defects, the question on appeal \u2014 whether the district court erred when it declared the defect an unreasonable risk and ordered a recall upon the Government\u2019s summary judgment motion \u2014 is moot. By eliminating the defect in these vehicles, Ford will eliminate the very subject of the suit in Nos. 76-2062 and 76-2063. A federal court should not consider questions or decide issues that do not involve actual controversies affecting the rights of some litigant in the case before it.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Since a recall is under way and since the defects are being repaired, we need not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>decide whether the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment was proper. We hold that the dispute in Nos. 76-2062 and 76-2063 is moot. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeals in these two cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">III. THE ADEQUACY OF THE RECALL NOTICE</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">In No. 77-1378, the Government appeals the district court\u2019s order of April 14, 1977 approving Ford\u2019s final recall notice.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> At the outset, Ford asks us to hold that if a manufacturer sends a final recall notice pursuant to court order, the manufacturer has discharged its responsibilities under the Act, and it cannot be required to send a second, corrective notice; thus, Ford insists that the Government should be allowed to appeal district court orders approving allegedly inadequate recall notices only if it first sought a stay of the order before initiating the appeal. To state the proposition otherwise, Ford would have us hold that a manufacturer who circulates pursuant to a judicial mandate a recall notice which does not comply with the statute cannot be required to circulate a second notice which does satisfy the statute <em>if </em>the Government did not seek a stay of the district court order prior to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>Ford\u2019s position admittedly has some intuitive attractiveness: at first glance, it appears to draw support from the equitable principle that a party which claims equitable relief (here the Government) must act with reasonable promptness. <em>See Russell v. Todd, </em>309 U.S. 280, 287, 60 S.Ct. 527, 84 L.Ed. 754 (1940); <em>Parker v. Dacres, </em>130 U.S. 43, 50, 9 S.Ct. 433, 32 L.Ed. 848 (1889); <em>Major v. Shaver, </em>88 U.S.App.D.C. 148, 149, 187 F.2d 211, 212 (1951); 2 Pomeroy Equity Jurisprudence \u00a7 418 (5th ed. Symons 1941). We decline, however, to accept Ford\u2019s position. To do so would ignore the interests sought to be protected by the Act and would not give full recognition to the special factual context presented by this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-19\">As noted earlier, the purpose of the Act is to protect the <em>public </em>against the unreasonable risk of accidents which might result from defects in motor vehicles and from the unreasonable risk of death or injury caused by such accidents. The Act provides that if a defect is discovered by the manufacturer <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>or </em>the Secretary,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the manufacturer must give notice to the owners of the vehicles and must remedy the defect. Congress itself has designated what information the notice must contain.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This statute reflects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>what Congress believes to be the minimum amount of disclosure necessary to fulfill the purposes of the Act.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Obviously, approving recall notices that fail to meet the statutory requirements does not further the policies of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Of course, a court of equity is vested with the discretion to prevent undue prejudice that might arise when one party fails to assert its rights and thereby causes detriment to the position of its opponent, but this is not the case here. It was Ford that chose not to comply with this court\u2019s interim notice order and decided instead to proceed with a final recall. In doing so, it fully realized \u2014 or should have realized\u2014 that the Government might challenge the adequacy of the final notice. Ford did not \u2014 and indeed cannot \u2014 dispute this. Instead, Ford\u2019s contention is that once the district court ordered Ford to issue the final recall notice, it was then the obligation of the Government to seek a stay to preserve its right of appeal. This argument, however, is based upon a basic misapprehension of the course of these proceedings. Throughout this litigation, Ford has pressed for acceptance of its own proposed notice.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Likewise, the Government has vigorously opposed Ford\u2019s proposed language and has pressed equally hard for the language which it believes satisfies the statutory requirements. Having heard the objections of the Government prior to argument in the district court, Ford was on notice that its recall language might not comply with the statute. Accordingly, Ford should have expected that the Government might appeal an adverse decision of the district court.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Ford did not change its position in reliance on the Government\u2019s failure to seek a stay. And if Ford seriously thought that having to transmit a second, corrective recall notice would prejudice its interests, <em>Ford </em>could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>have asked the district court for a stay pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">In short, when Ford decided to draft its own final recall notice, Ford prompted the Government\u2019s challenge, and Ford resisted that challenge in court. By embarking on this course, Ford took the risk that litigation would ensue and that a court\u2014 trial or appellate \u2014 might find its notice legally insufficient. This is a fair price for Ford\u2019s conscious decision not to heed warnings that the notice was inadequate. Indeed, Ford is cognizant of the important policies served by the Safety Act. Ford must have realized that the Government, vested with the responsibility to protect the public interest, might decide that having <em>an inadequate notice </em>of the dangerous condition sent immediately was to be preferred over having <em>no notice </em>sent during the pend-ency of an appeal. The interest of the public in this matter is obviously not of small moment. We hold that the Government\u2019s appeal of the district court order is properly before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Before proceeding to the merits, we posit this observation, which should be apparent from our preceding discussion: this court\u2019s deciding of the merits of similarly situated appeals does not place an undue burden on automobile manufacturers. Manufacturers are aware both of what the statute and the regulations require and of what policies the statute is intended to further. The public has a right to expect that automobile manufacturers will live up to their responsibilities under the Act. If a manufacturer chooses to ignore warnings that its notice is not in compliance with the relevant law and it nevertheless insists on sending out language of its own choice, the manufacturer invites litigation. Even if the manufacturer persuades a district court that its notice is adequate, the manufacturer assumes the risk that the court\u2019s decision might be appealed, that the prior notice might be deemed legally insufficient, and that a corrective notice will be required. The manufacturer has this knowledge prior to its decision on how it will proceed with a recall. The manufacturer knows the rules of the game; it may well come to regret its decision to play the game once the score is final. Yet the manifestation of this result, while unpleasant' for the manufacturer which does not ultimately prevail, amounts to far less than the imposition of an undue burden on the manufacturer. It is but a small price for the protection of the public, and it is a price that the manufacturer assumed the risk of one day having to pay.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-16\">Since the Government\u2019s appeal is properly before the court, we now consider whether the recall notice approved by the district court satisfies the applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. The controlling statute on the adequacy of the notice is 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413 (Supp. V 1975).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> This statute requires that the notice contain several specific items, and it also requires \u201csuch other matters as the Secretary may prescribe by regulation.\u201d Acting under this authority, the Secretary has prescribed regulations which provide additional standards for a valid notice.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-17\">The Government challenges the adequacy of the final recall notice approved by the district court on two grounds. First, it argues that the notice does not contain a clear description of the defect. In pertinent part, the approved notice states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-18\">The defect involves the driver\u2019s seat back inboard pivot pin bracket, which could break without prior warning allowing the seat back to rotate rearward. The Na<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>tional Highway Traffic Safety Administration has further concluded that the pivot pin bracket could break while persons are getting into or out of the vehicle or in any driving mode and may cause the driver to fall backward.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Appendix to Govt. Br. at 65a. The statute requires that the notice contain \u201ca clear description of such defect\u201d (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413(a)(1) (Supp. V 1975)). Regulations enacted pursuant to the statute require the notice to contain<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-5\">[a] clear description of the defect, which must include\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-6\">(1) Identification of the vehicle system or particular item or items of motor vehicle equipment affected;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-7\">(2) A description of the malfunction that may occur;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-8\">(3) A statement of operating or other conditions that may cause the malfunction to occur; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-9\">(4) Precautions, if any, that the purchaser should take to reduce the chance that the malfunction will occur before the vehicle is repaired.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-15\">49 C.F.R. \u00a7 577.4(c) (1976). It is our opinion that the description approved by the district court clearly and accurately describes the defect in terms that a reasonable person would understand. The notice identifies the defect, describes the nature of the malfunction, and states the conditions under which the failure might occur. The description fulfills both the requirements and the purpose of the statute and the relevant regulations.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-16\">As a second ground, the Government contends that the description contains an inadequate \u201cevaluation of the risk to motor vehicle safety.\u201d In pertinent part, the approved notice states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-17\">The safety risk that may result from this defect is loss of vehicle control without warning, which can cause, and has caused, accidents in the past.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-18\">Appendix to Govt. Br. at 65a. The statute requires that the notice contain an \u201cevaluation of the risk to motor vehicle safety reasonably related to such defect\u201d (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413(a)(2) (Supp. V 1975)). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>applicable regulation states that the notice must contain</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-5\">[an] evaluation of the risk to traffic safety reasonably related to the defect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-6\">(1) When vehicle crash is the potential occurrence, the evaluation must include whichever of the following statements is appropriate:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-7\">(i) That the defect can cause vehicle crash without prior warning, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-8\">(ii) A description of whatever warning may occur, and a statement that if this warning is not heeded, vehicle crash can occur.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">49 C.F.R. \u00a7 557.4(d) (1976). The Government attacks this portion of the approved notice in two ways. First, it contends that the notice contains no description of the specific safety consequences of the failure of the defect. We disagree. The notice states in clear and unambiguous terms that an accident might result. In this context, \u201caccident\u201d and \u201cvehicle crash\u201d are synonymous. The specific safety consequences are adequately described. Second, the Government contends that the notice is inadequate because it does not contain the following words: \u201cthe defect can cause vehicle crash without prior warning.\u201d The Government believes that those nine words convey a stronger message of danger than the language approved by the district court. We note at the outset that the regulation does not <em>require </em>that the nine words appear in the notice exactly as they appear in the regulation. Section 557.4(d) is unlike other parts of the regulations, such as section 557.4(a)<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> or section 557.4(b)(1)<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> which do require specific words- to be placed in the notice. Section 557.4(d) only requires a statement that <em>communicates </em>the idea that a vehicle crash can occur without prior warning.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The language in the approved notice is wholly adequate to communicate to the -car owner the danger of seat-pin failure \u201cwithout prior warning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-17\">With respect to the description of the risk to motor vehicle safety; the Government also argues that this court, by virtue of its March 8,1977 order concerning an interim recall notice, held that nothing less than the Government\u2019s description met the minimum requirements for a recall notice,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and that this holding is the law of the case to which the district court was bound on remand (Govt. Br. at 19). We disagree. This court\u2019s April 8, 1977 order instructed the district court to determine whether Ford\u2019s proposed final recall notice satisfied the court\u2019s judgment and otherwise met the minimum statutory and regulatory requirements. On remand, the district court was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>not bound to accept any previously proposed notice as the minimum standard for a valid final recall notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">The recall notice approved by the district court fulfills the requirements of the statute and the regulations. The Government\u2019s objections are without merit. For these reasons, the April 14, 1977 judgment of the district court approving the final recall notice is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">IV. SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">We express no opinion on the propriety of the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment for the Government in Nos. 76-2062 and 76-2063, since we hold that the appeals in such cases are moot. However, since the appeals in those two cases are dismissed, the judgments entered by the district court remain final and valid. In No. 77-1378, we hold that the Government\u2019s suit is not barred, that it is properly before this court, and that the recall notice approved by the district court satisfies the relevant statutory and regulatory standards; hence, we affirm the April 14, 1977 judgment of the district court approving the recall notice distributed by Ford.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b621-4\">. The district court\u2019s memorandum opinion and grant of summary judgment was filed on October 1, 1976 (J.A. 340-50); the judgment was entered by order on October 20, 1976 (J.A. 351-52). The October 20 order is the subject of the appeal in No. 76-2062 (see J.A. 389-90). Ford filed a motion for reconsideration of the October 20 order on or about November 1, 1976 (J.A. 353-54). This motion was denied on November 16, 1976 (J.A. 388). The denial of the motion for reconsideration is the basis of the appeal in No. 76-2063 (see J.A. 391-92).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b621-5\">.

The facts of this case date back to September, 1969, when the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (\u201cNHTSA\u201d) received two consumer letters complaining about the collapse of seat backs in vehicles with this type of seat bracket pin (J.A. 25). The agency conducted an investigation which proceeded with varying degrees of intensity over the next six years (see <em>generally </em>J.A. 29-150). On March 13, 1975, NHTSA advised Ford that it had \u201cinitially determined\u201d on the basis of its investigation that the 1968 and 1969 model-year Mustangs and Cougars contained a safety-related defect (J.A. 69-168). Ford was given an opportunity to submit data, views, and arguments, and Ford made an oral presentation (see J.A. 170). Thereafter, on August 12, 1975, NHTSA directed Ford to provide the statutorily required notice to the owners of the affected vehicles and to remedy the defect in them as required by the Act (J.A. 170-71).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b621-15\">.

On August 18, 1975, Ford filed a suit challenging the constitutionality of various provisions of the Act, including the penalty provisions of the Act for noncompliance with an NHTSA order. A three-judge district court rejected Ford\u2019s constitutional challenge and the Supreme Court summarily affirmed. <em>Ford Motor Co. v.

The three-judge court, however, granted Ford a temporary stay pending Ford\u2019s application for a statutory stay of the penalty provisions in the Government\u2019s enforcement action, which, as mentioned in the text, was also filed on August 18, 1975 (402 F.Supp. at 490-91).

In <em>Brownlow, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>petitioner sought review of a judgment of this court that directed the issuance of a writ of mandamus to compel the granting of a building permit. After the decision of this court, the permit was issued, the building was erected, and the property was transferred to persons not parties to the case. The Court concluded: \u201c[i]t thus appears that there is now no actual controversy between the parties \u2014 no issue on the merits which this Court can properly decide.\u201d 261 U.S. 217, 43 S.Ct. 264. This conclusion was based on two independent grounds: the second was that the property had been transferred, but the first was that \u201cthe permit, the issuance of which constituted the sole relief sought by petitioner, has been issued and the building to which it related has been completed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court stated: \u201cThis Court will not proceed to a determination when its judgment would be wholly ineffectual for want of a subject matter on which it could operate. . . To adjudicate a cause which no longer exists is a proceeding which the Court uniformly has declined to entertain.\u201d 261 U.S. at 217-18, 43 S.Ct. at 264. In the Ford defect proceedings, the district court gave summary judgment in part for the Government in its action to enforce the order of the Administrator that Ford recall the cars and remedy the defect. Prior to appeal, Ford \u201cacceded\u201d to the Administrator\u2019s order (see note 12 <em>infra) </em>although a dispute remains whether Ford\u2019s purported compliance is legally sufficient. This latter dispute is the product of a separate, distinct district court order approving Ford\u2019s recall notice. Now that the <em>core </em>of the Administrator\u2019s order has been complied with, no actual controversy \u2014 as was the situation in <em>Browniow </em>\u2014 remains in this part of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">Consider also <em>Gray v. Board of Trustees of the University of Tennessee, </em>342 U.S. 517, 72 S.Ct. 432, 96 L.Ed. 540 (1952), where appellants sought to enjoin the appellees from refusing to admit Blacks to the University. At oral argument, counsel for appellees stated that appellants would be admitted to the University as requested. Upon that representation and upon the absence of any suggestion that any person \u201csimilarly situated\u201d would not be afforded similar treatment, the Court declared the controversy moot and remanded the case so that the action could be dismissed. 342 U.S. at 518, 72 S.Ct. 432. Similarly, in <em>Board of School Commissioners of Indianapolis v. Jacobs, </em>420 U.S. 128, 95 S.Ct. 848, 43 L.Ed.2d 74 (1975), the Court held that a purported class action by six named plaintiffs challenging certain school regulations was moot where all plaintiffs had graduated from school and the class was not properly identified. 420 U.S. at 129-30, 95 S.Ct. 848.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b624-11\">. In deciding No. 77-1378, we assume <em>arguen-do </em>that the defect in the seat pin bracket is a safety-related defect that poses an unreasonable risk within the meaning of the Act. The district court made this finding on summary judgment; we express no opinion on whether this was proper, as we decline to reach the merits of the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for the Government in Nos. 76-2062 and 76-2063. Our assumption is perfectly appropriate, since in deciding to issue a final recall of the vehicles with the defective parts, Ford has \u201cacquiesced\u201d in the Administrator\u2019s findings that the possibility of failure of the seat-pin is a safety-related defect that constitutes an unreasonable risk. We note, however, that throughout these proceedings Ford has emphatically disputed these findings. Ford argues in its brief in Nos. 76-2062 and 76-2063 that the record does not show a single fatality or serious accident and only shows a few losses of control. Ford also argues that most seat pins that will fail have done so already. <em>See generally </em>Ford\u2019s Br. (Nos. 76-2062 &amp; 76-2063) at 13-30. Ford, of course, advances these arguments only for the purpose of urging that it is entitled to a trial and that summary judgment was improper. We do not evaluate these arguments, as they have been rendered moot by the decision to recall the automobiles.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b625-5\">. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1411 (Supp. V 1975) provides: If a manufacturer\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-6\">(1) obtains knowledge that any motor vehicle or item of replacement equipment manufactured by him contains a defect and determines in good faith that such defect relates to motor vehicle safety;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-7\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-8\">he shall furnish notification to the Secretary and to owners, purchasers, and dealers, in accordance with section 1413 of this title, and he shall remedy the defect or failure to comply in accordance with section 1414 of this title.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b625-9\">. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1412 (Supp. V 1975).

This bracket is technically called the driver\u2019s bucket seat back inboard pivot pin bracket. One part of this bracket, called the \u201cpin\u201d, breaks suddenly and without any warning. This causes the seat back to snap off from the seat bottom on the right side, and to swing backward and downward in a clockwise motion. The bracket pin may break at any time, and either while the automobile is standing still or while the automobiles is moving at low, medium, or high speeds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-22\">Appendix to Govt.

We note that the recall letter actually proposed by Ford contained the following sentence: \u201cIf breakage were to occur while driving, the driver could lose control of the vehicle which could result in a vehicle crash.\u201d The district court objected to this sentence and substituted the following: \u201cThe safety risk that may result from this defect is loss of vehicle control without warning which can cause and has caused accidents in the past.\u201d Appendix to Govt.
