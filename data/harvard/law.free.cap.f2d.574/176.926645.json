Pursuant to the Pennsylvania Municipal Claims and Tax Liens Act, Pa.Stat. Ann. tit. 53, \u00a7 7101 <em>et seq., </em>the Sewer Authority filed a municipal lien against her property for $389, the amount of the unpaid charges. Her complaint seeks a class action determination, a declaration that the lien is void and of no effect, and an injunction against the future filing of such liens, on the ground that the Municipal Claims and Tax Liens Act is unconstitutional. Since the complaint was filed in 1975, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2281, now repealed, then applied, and the convening of a three-judge court was re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>quired unless her claim was clearly foreclosed by prior decisions of the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Winpenny\u2019s objection to the Act is that it permits a municipality to create a lien by filing a claim without a pre-filing hearing. In <em>Sager v. Burgess, </em>350 F.Supp. 1310 (E.D.Pa.1972), <em>summarily aff\u2019d, </em>411 U.S. 941, 93 S.Ct. 1923, 36 L.Ed.2d 406 (1973), the same contention was made and rejected. We are bound by the Supreme Court\u2019s summary affirmance. <em>Hicks v. Miranda, </em>422 U.S. 332, 343, 95 S.Ct. 2281, 45 L.Ed.2d 223 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Winpenny contends that <em>Sager v. Burgess </em>is not controlling for three reasons. First, she urges that the authority of the summary affirmance in that case has been brought into question by the subsequent decisions in <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>W. T. Grant Co., </em>416 U.S. 600, 94 S.Ct. 1895, 40 L.Ed.2d 406 (1974), and <em>North Georgia Finishing, Inc. v. Di-Chem, Inc., </em>419 U.S. 601, 95 S.Ct. 719, 42 L.Ed.2d 751 (1975). In this she is plainly wrong. Those cases dealt with state remedies providing for the deprivation of use of debtor property by a pre-hearing seizure. Under the Municipal Claims and Tax Liens Act the filing of the claim does not affect the alleged debtor\u2019s use of the property, and no interference with that use can take place until the municipality resorts to a judicial foreclosure. Pa.Stat.Ann. tit. 53, \u00a7 7181 <em>et seq. </em>The validity of the provision making the claim a lien on the property without any change in possession was determined in <em>Sager </em>v. <em>Burgess, </em>which is unimpaired by cases dealing with a different subject matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Winpenny also contends that her case presents an issue that was not presented in <em>Sager v. Burgess. </em>To free the property from the lien, she may, under Pa.Stat.Ann. tit. 53, \u00a7 7184, notify the township that it must within fifteen days commence a judicial foreclosure by issuing a writ of scire facias. She can then file her defense to the claim. Pa.Stat.Ann. tit. 53, \u00a7 7185. Her objection to that procedure is that in her interpretation of \u00a7 7184 she must either file a bond for security or pay the disputed amount into eourt. For poor persons such as Winpenny, she urges, this requirement makes the foreclosure scheme vulnerable under <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>W. T. Grant Co., supra, </em>and <em>North Georgia Finishing, Inc. v. Di-Chem, Inc., supra. </em>But the district court ruled that the constitutional issue she tendered was not present in the case, since, as the Sewer Authority conceded, no such bond or security is required by \u00a7 7184. Winpenny contends that both the district court and the Sewer Authority misconstrue the statute. However she now has a judgment to the effect that no such bond or security is required. Since she prevailed on the absence of that requirement, on statutory rather than constitutional grounds, she cannot appeal from that favorable determination. Counsel for the defendant at oral argument assured this court that his client is perfectly happy to be bound by the judgment on the issue of statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">Finally, Winpenny contests the validity of the provision in Pa.Stat.Ann. tit. 53, \u00a7 7182 that an owner desiring to sell property while contesting the amount due can obtain early removal of the lien by paying the money into court or by posting security therefor. The district court, finding that Winpenny had no present intention or desire to transfer the property and thus lacked standing to litigate it, declined to consider this issue. We find no error in that ruling. For a person situated as is Winpenny, the operative provision is \u00a7 7184, not \u00a7 7182. There was no reason for the district court to decide a challenge to a section of the statute in which she had no present interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">The judgment appealed from will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
