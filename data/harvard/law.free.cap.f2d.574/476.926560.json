No. 94-553, Title I, \u00a7 101, Oct. 19,1976, 90 Stat. 2541, effective January 1, 1978. Inasmuch as the cause of action arose prior to January 1, 1978, it is governed by Title 17, U.S.C. \u201cas it existed when the cause of action arose,\u201d section 112, Pub.L. No. 94-553.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Defendants/Appellants James Mitchell, Arthur Mitchell, and Cinema Seven, Inc. were found liable for infringement of Plaintiff/Appellee Consuelo Pye\u2019s copyright in the musical work \u201cLucy\u2019s Song.\u201d The district court awarded Pye $5,000 for the use of \u201cLucy\u2019s Song\u201d in defendants\u2019 movie \u201cFlesh and Brimstone\u201d and $5,000 for its use by defendants in the movie \u201cSex Odyssey.\u201d Defendants do not contest their liability for infringement of \u201cLucy\u2019s Song\u201d but argue that the measure of damages is not justified by the damage provisions of the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(b). Defendants were also found liable for infringement of Consuelo Pye\u2019s and Iris Hammer\u2019s undivided one-third interests in the musical composition \u201cWhatever Happens.\u201d The district court awarded Pye and Hammer each $5,000 for defendants\u2019 use of their music in \u201cSex Odyssey.\u201d Defendants contest both the finding of statutory liability for \u201cWhatever Happens\u201d and, alternatively, the amount of damages awarded. Plaintiffs were awarded $9,600 in attorneys\u2019 fees plus costs of suit which defendants contest for the first time on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Two basic issues confront us. The first is whether Pye and Hammer are entitled to statutory damages under 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(b) for defendants\u2019 use of \u201cWhatever Happens\u201d in \u201cSex Odyssey.\u201d Defendants argue that copyright protection for the song was not effective until a date subsequent to any acts of infringement. Defendants argue further that even if copyright protection was effective at the time of infringing performances, plaintiff Hammer is not entitled to statutory damages because she was not registered as a joint owner with' the Copyright Office at the time of any acts of infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">The second issue is whether a written release from liability, executed by a joint owner of copyright, which did not expressly mention copyright infringement, constituted actual notice of infringement for the purpose of invoking the exception to the limitations on damages set forth in 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(b). Defendants contend that because the release was not formal notice it cannot serve as actual notice so as to invoke the exception and justify the damages awarded by the lower court.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">Finally defendants argue, for the first time on appeal as already noted, that the attorneys\u2019 fees award included amounts for time spent on issues not directly related to the present litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">We affirm the lower court\u2019s decision. Plaintiffs Pye and Hammer are both entitled to statutory damages under 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(b). The written release did constitute actual notice of infringement of plaintiffs\u2019 interest in \u201cWhatever Happens\u201d with the result that the damages awarded by the lower court are well within its discretionary powers. And finally, we will not overturn the award of attorneys\u2019 fees where the issue is first raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">\n<em>Facts.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b562-11\">Plaintiffs Consuelo Pye and Iris Hammer compose and perform musical works. Defendants Arthur Mitchell, James Mitchell, and Cinema Seven, Inc. produce sexually explicit movies. Consuelo Pye created and wrote the musical composition \u201cLucy\u2019s Song.\u201d She secured statutory copyright protection for the unpublished work under 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 12 on January 17, 1972. Pye, Iris Hammer, and Daniel LeBlanc (not a party to this action) co-authored the musical composition \u201cWhatever Happens.\u201d Le-Blanc fulfilled the requirements of 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 12 on March 8, 1972. A space provided for \u201capplication received,\u201d one of three required dates on the registration certificate, originally read March 8, 1972, but for an unknown reason, has since been altered to May 22, 1972. LeBlanc obtained the registration certificate in his and Pye\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>names only. On February 7, 1973, both an Assignment and Transfer of Part Ownership of Copyright to Iris Hammer and an Affidavit Correcting Fact of Ownership were recorded with the Register of Copyrights in recognition of Hammer\u2019s interest in \u201cWhatever Happens.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Both musical compositions were performed publicly at the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco on September 25, 1971 as part of a concert given by \u201cSynchronicity,\u201d a group to which Pye and LeBlanc belong. Alex Benton, a Mitchells\u2019 employee, recorded the concert without the consent of either Pye, Hammer, or LeBlanc.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">The Mitchells incorporated \u201cLucy\u2019s Song\u201d in a sound track accompanying \u201cFlesh and Brimstone,\u201d a movie first released October 5, 1971. The Mitchells included both \u201cLucy\u2019s Song\u201d and \u201cWhatever Happens\u201d in a production entitled \u201cSex Odyssey,\u201d first released May 5,1972. Following the premiere of each movie, Bruce Hatch, a sound engineer for the Mitchells, informed defendants that their productions contained infringing music. The Mitchells did not expunge \u201cLucy\u2019s Song\u201d from \u201cFlesh and Brimstone\u201d or \u201cSex Odyssey.\u201d They did delete \u201cWhatever Happens\u201d from one print of \u201cSex Odyssey.\u201d There were at least three prints of \u201cSex Odyssey,\u201d incorporating plaintiffs\u2019 music, in circulation, two of which were screened after May 25, 1972. The lower court found infringing performances in excess of ten times of \u201cFlesh and Brimstone\u201d between October 5, 1971, and November 9, 1972, and of \u201cSex Odyssey\u201d between May 5, 1972 and June 20, 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">About a week after the first screening of \u201cSex Odyssey\u201d Arthur Mitchell, Consuelo Pye, Daniel LeBlanc, and Alex Benton discussed the Mitchells\u2019 use of plaintiffs\u2019 music. Before angrily leaving the meeting, Pye made it clear that she did not consent to the defendants\u2019 use of her music. On May 25, 1972, LeBlanc, purporting to represent Pye, executed a written release relieving the Mitchells from further financial responsibility for the use of plaintiffs\u2019 music for the previous two-week period.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> An addendum, dated May 30,1972, notes that it was agreed that the music was not to be used again. Both the release and the addendum were signed by LeBlanc and Arthur Mitchell. The lower court found that the release constituted actual notice of infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">Plaintiffs\u2019 actual damages and defendants\u2019 actual profits were unascertainable. The lower court, as already noted, awarded statutory \u201cin lieu\u201d damages to Pye in the amount of $5,000 for the multiple infringements of \u201cLucy\u2019s Song\u201d in \u201cFlesh and Brimstone\u201d and $5,000 for the multiple infringements of \u201cLucy\u2019s Song\u201d in \u201cSex Odyssey.\u201d The lower court also awarded Pye and Hammer each statutory damages of $5,000 for the infringement of \u201cWhatever Happens\u201d in \u201cSex Odyssey\u201d and attorneys\u2019 fees in the amount of $9,600.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-12\">We will discuss the two principal issues which this case presents and then briefly turn our attention to the question of attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-14\">\n<em>Plaintiffs Pye and Hammer are entitled to statutory damages under 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b563-16\">Only the proprietor of statutory copyright at the time of acts of infringement is entitled to damages under 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 2 Nimmer on Copyright \u00a7 132 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>(1976). The district court concluded that Pye and Hammer are proprietors of undivided one-third interests in the musical work \u201cWhatever Happens\u201d effective March 8, 1972. Defendants first contend that because the March 8, 1972 date originally entered adjacent to \u201capplication received\u201d on the registration certificate was altered to May 22,1972, the latter is the true effective date of copyright. Furthermore, defendants maintain that there were no acts of infringement subsequent to May 22, 1972. Therefore they cannot be found liable for statutory damages where they have not infringed a statutory right.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">Defendants tender this argument for the first time on appeal. That is too late. The copyright registration certificate was admitted into evidence with the express stipulation that the effective date was March 8, 1972. It is not clear from the record whether the May 22 date had even been substituted at this time. Far from making the requisite specific and timely objection at trial, Fed.R.Evid. 103(a)(1), defendants agreed to the effectiveness of copyright as of March 8. Where an issue is conceded below, it cannot be raised for the first time on appeal. <em>Drop Dead Co. </em>v. <em>S. C. Johnson &amp; Son, Inc., </em>326 F.2d 87 (9th Cir. 1963), <em>cert. denied, </em>377 U.S. 907, 84 S.Ct. 1167, 12 L.Ed.2d 177 (1964); <em>Wilson v. Byron Jackson Co., </em>93 F.2d 572 (9th Cir. 1937); <em>Edward B. Marks Music Corp. v. Continental Record Co., </em>222 F.2d 488 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>350 U.S. 861, 76 S.Ct. 101,100 L.Ed. 764 (1955). Since the argument was not properly raised at the district court level, it may not be presented in the Court of Appeals. <em>Rothman v. Hospital Service of Southern California, </em>510 F.2d 956 (9th Cir. 1975). We affirm the district court\u2019s finding that the effective date of copyright in \u201cWhatever Happens\u201d is March 8, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Defendants next argue that plaintiff Hammer was not a proprietor of copyright in \u201cWhatever Happens\u201d until January 7, 1973, the date she was officially recorded in the Copyright Office as a joint owner. The district court found that Hammer, together with Pye and LeBlanc \u201ccreated and wrote the original words and music\u201d to \u201cWhatever Happens\u201d and that \u201cat all times herein applicable plaintiffs, Consuelo Pye and Iris Hammer, have each been and still each are sole proprietors\u201d of \u201cWhatever Happens.\u201d We uphold the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Hammer was a proprietor of an undivided one-third interest in \u201cWhatever Happens\u201d even though she was not a proprietor of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">If a work is a product of joint authorship, each co-author automatically becomes a holder of an undivided interest in the whole. 1 Nimmer on Copyright \u00a7 69 (1976). There is abundant evidence in support of the finding that Hammer co-authored \u201cWhatever Happens.\u201d When LeBlanc secured copyright for the composition on March 8, 1972 in his and Pye\u2019s names only, he did not divest Hammer of her interest in the music she had co-authored. In a similar situation where the defendant and plaintiff had jointly \u201cconceived, compiled, and created\u201d a book and its parts for which defendant had obtained the related copyrights in her name only, this circuit found that the defendant held the copyright in trust for the co-author-plaintiff. <em>Richmond </em>v. <em>Weiner, </em>353 F.2d 41 (9th Cir. 1965), <em>cert. denied, </em>384 U.S. 928, 86 S.Ct. 1447, 16 L.Ed.2d 531 (1966). Likewise, LeBlanc and Pye held the copyright in trust for Hammer.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">Therefore, Hammer, although not the proprietor of record, was an equitable proprietor of an undivided one-third interest in \u201cWhatever Happens\u201d at the time defendants appropriated it for their own use. While we express no opinion on the right of an equitable owner of a copyright to bring an action for infringement in his own name and without joinder of the legal owner, we do hold that the equitable owner, Hammer, when joined with Pye, a legal owner, as plaintiffs may maintain an infringement action against a non-owner infringer for injuries prior to the time she, Hammer, became a legal proprietor. <em>Cf. Manning v. Miller Music Corp., </em>174 F.Supp. 192 (D.C.N. Y-.1959). Of course, as a legal proprietor of the copyright, Hammer is entitled to recov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>er damages for any infringement occurring after she acquired her legal interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Defendants additionally assert that even if Hammer was a proprietor they had no notice of her ownership and would have been unable to discover her interest. Their argument that these facts should relieve them of liability for $5,000 in damages is unavailing. First, the assertion that they would have been unable to discover Hammer\u2019s ownership is factually inaccurate. Secondly, a defendant may be liable where he copied with or without a license, from a third party, who in turn had copied from the plaintiff. <em>Buck v. Jewell-LaSalle Realty Co., </em>283 U.S. 191,198-99, 51 S.Ct. 410, 75 L.Ed. 971 (1931), 2 Nimmer on Copyright \u00a7 148 (1976). In such a situation the defendant may not even know the plaintiff exists, much less his name, and certainly has less opportunity to discover the true owner than the defendants in this case. Indeed, even where the defendant believes in good faith that he is not infringing a copyright, he may be found liable. <em>See County of Ventura v. Blackburn, </em>362 F.2d 515 (9th Cir. 1966) (trial court\u2019s determination that \u201clack of intent to infringe does not excuse legal liability upheld\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">Because the effective date of copyright protection was March 8, 1972, and Pye and Hammer were both proprietors at that and at all times when defendants infringed their copyright, they are entitled to a statutory damage award.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-11\">\n<em>The written release constitutes actual notice of copyright infringement and thus justifies the damages awarded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b565-12\">17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(b) provides that a copyright proprietor may recover actual damages as well as the defendants\u2019 actual profits due to the infringement. Alternatively, the copyright proprietor may be awarded, \u201cin lieu of actual damages and profits, such damages as to the court shall appear to be just.\u201d Where, as here, neither plaintiffs\u2019 actual damages nor defendants\u2019 actual profits are ascertainable the award of \u201cin lieu\u201d damages is mandatory. <em>Krofft Television Productions, Inc. v. McDonald\u2019s Corp., </em>562 F.2d 1157, 1179 (9th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-13\">Ordinarily the trial court\u2019s discretion as to the measure of damages is confined by minimum and maximum dollar award limitations. After a list of exceptions to the limitations designed to relieve the financial burden on innocent infringers<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the statuto<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>ry language continues, \u201csuch damages shall in no other case exceed the sum of $5,000, nor be less than the sum of $250 . . But these \u201climitation[s] as to the amount of recovery [shall not] apply to infringements occurring after the actual notice to a defendant, either by service of process in a suit or other written notice served upon him.\u201d Once actual notice releases the court from the strictures of the statutory limitations, the court is bound only by the language allowing \u201csuch damages as . shall appear to be just.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">The lower court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-6\">On May 25, 1972, defendants herein received written notice of the copyrights herein. Said notice consisting of communications herein and that certain writing designated \u201cconsent\u201d and executed on said date by Daniel LeBlanc and Arthur Mitchell.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-7\">Thereafter, defendants willfully and intentionally and with notice of said copyrights did cause the motion pictures \u201cFlesh and Brimstone\u201d and \u201cSex Odyssey\u201d to be shown, thereby continuing to infringe plaintiffs copyrights on numerous occasions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">This conclusion justifies the damage awards, which might otherwise be beyond the statutory limitations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendants argue that the release (or \u201cconsent\u201d) cannot serve as written notice so as to raise the statutory ceiling because the \u201cnotice makes no mention of copyright, nor does the testimony concerning its negotiation do so.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Additionally they argue that there was no evidence to support a finding of infringing performances of \u201cSex Odyssey\u201d following the purported written notice. We hold that the release did constitute written notice within the meaning of 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(b), and that the finding of infringements after such notice was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-13\">There is a dearth of authority as to what constitutes actual notice within the meaning of the statute. One court has held that even where the defendant had actual notice that he was infringing, the statutory language required that he then be a defendant and have notice of the pending lawsuit. <em>Advertisers Exchange, Inc. v. Hinkley, </em>199 F.2d 313 (8th Cir. 1952), <em>cert. denied, </em>344 U.S. 921, 73 S.Ct. 388, 97 L.Ed. 710 (1953). We reject this unduly restrictive interpretation of the statute. We agree that \u201c[b]y specifying that written notice other than service of process will suffice, Congress has quite surely indicated that one need not already have become a defendant for written notice to be effective.\u201d <em>Davis v. E. I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>249 F.Supp. 329, 344 (S.D.N.Y.1966) (holding that a letter or telegram is sufficient written notice). <em>See </em>2 Nimmer on Copyright \u00a7 154.2 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-14\">Our conclusion is buttressed by the fact that some courts have found that actual notice will suffice when there exists neither service of process nor written notice. This circuit, for example, has suggested in dictum that sufficient notice to the defendant may be imputed from the notice and knowledge of his agents and employees even though there was no \u201cwritten notice served upon him.\u201d <em>Universal Pictures Co. v. Harold Lloyd Corp., </em>162 F.2d 354 (9th Cir. 1947). Another recent decision found actual notice where the defendant knew that the material belonged to the plaintiffs and had entered into unsuccessful negotiations to obtain a license even though there was neither service of process nor written notice. <em>Smothers v. CBS, Inc., </em>359 F.Supp. 723 (C.D.Cal.1973). Still other courts have based findings of actual notice on the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>that the plaintiff had told the defendant that he was infringing his copyright, <em>Schell-berg v. Empringham, </em>36 F.2d 991 (S.D.N.Y. 1929) and on the finding that defendant had directly observed a copyright notice with plaintiff\u2019s name affixed to the sheet music which was copied, <em>Mills Music, Inc. </em>v. <em>State of Arizona, </em>187 U.S.P.Q. 22 (D.Ariz.1975). While it can be asserted that these cases go beyond the wording of 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(b), which speaks of \u201cwritten notice\u201d, they do evidence a strong tendency to regard the substance of the notice above its form.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">This enables us to put aside defendants\u2019 objections to the form of the notice. While there is no express statement announcing that the defendants have infringed plaintiffs\u2019 copyright, there is implicit in the procurement and composition of the \u201crelease\u201d the knowledge of copyright infringement. The release was secured for no other purpose than to relieve defendants of liability for copyright infringement. Its terms indicate that defendants are released from \u201cfurther financial responsibility\u201d implying that financial responsibility or liability had previously accrued. The release purports to be authorized by Connie Pye. At the time of its execution the defendants had full knowledge that Pye owned the subject music. The release was notice and in writing. A \u201cwritten notice\u201d within the meaning of the statute includes a notice in writing even if its construction by some courts embraces more. It need not be captioned, \u201cWritten Notice.\u201d To insist upon such a caption or its equivalent would be to exalt form over substance which neither the authorities nor reason require.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">An additional reason for our finding is that it appears that the written notice primarily was designed to serve an evidentiary purpose. Congress, in enacting this provision concurrently with the clauses decreasing statutory limitations on recovery where the defendant was an innocent infringer, sought to lessen the potentially bankrupting liabilities of movie producers who could not protect themselves \u201cby the exercise of reasonable diligence\u201d but to terminate that protection upon notice.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Congress did not prescribe the form of the notice, but legislative history indicates that \u201cordinary notice\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> terminates protection. Written notice is made the method by which innocent and willful infringers are distinguished. Professor Nimmer suggests that the draftsmen may have intended that only \u201cthis particular and decisive form of proof of knowledge should be sufficient to remove the maximum limitation.\u201d 2 Nimmer on Copyright \u00a7 154.2 (1976). The release in this case we believe clearly fulfills the evi-dentiary purpose which the written notice requirement appears to serve. We find that the defendants were on actual notice of infringement as of May 25, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">The district court\u2019s finding that defendants continued to infringe plaintiffs\u2019 copyright after receipt of actual notice through several screenings of \u201cFlesh and Brimstone\u201d and \u201cSex Odyssey\u201d may not be upset unless it is \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d <em>County of Ventura </em>v. <em>Blackburn, </em>362 F.2d 515, 521 (9th Cir. 1966). The evidence as we view it amply supports the court\u2019s finding.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>Therefore, the court was no longer bound by the statutory limitations. The damages awarded are within the discretion of the trial court and we find no abuse of that discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">\n<em>Attorneys\u2019 Fees.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">17 U.S.C. \u00a7 116 provides that \u201cthe court may award to the prevailing party a reasonable attorneys\u2019 fee as part of the costs.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys filed a summary of hours on March 3, 1975 which defendants dispute in certain respects for the first time on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Usually errors not raised below will not be considered on appeal. <em>Singleton </em>v. <em>Wulff, </em>428 U.S. 106, 96 S.Ct. 2868, 49 L.Ed.2d 826 (1976), <em>Hormel v.

But the foregoing exceptions shall not deprive the copyright proprietor of any other remedy given him under this law, nor shall the limitations as to the amount of recovery apply to infringements occurring after the actual notice to a defendant, either by service of process in a suit or other written notice served upon him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-15\">The exceptions for innocent infringers as well as the language lifting the ceiling on damages for infringements after actual notice were part of the Townsend Bill which amended the 1909 Act in 1912. The legislators were particularly concerned that the movie industry might be crippled by awards of the maximum statutory damages in circumstances where it would have been impossible to discover the fact of infringement. This protection would be lost \u201cas soon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>as the manufacturer received <em>ordinary notice </em>that it was an infringement.\u201d (emphasis added) 48 <em>Cong.Rec. </em>8290 (2d Sess. 1912) (remarks of Rep.

Defendants also characterize the release executed by LeBlanc as a non-exclusive license granted by a joint owner of copyright and argue that, as such, it relieves them from liability to Pye and Hammer. The merits of this argument need not be reached. Whether or not valid, the release on its face is limited to a period of two weeks \u2014 May 11, 1972 to May 25, 1972. There is ample support in the record for findings of infringement both before and after the \u201clicensed\u201d period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b567-6\">.

The infringing music was deleted from only one of those prints. The testimony of Gerald Bonner, the defendants\u2019 accountant, together with Joint Exhibit Two provides circumstantial evidence that at least one print with infringing music was screened after May 22, 1972. Bonner testified that for each print of \u201cSex Odyssey\u201d there was an alphabetically labeled inventory control card on which the date and name of each theater engagement was recorded. There were three such cards for \u201cSex Odyssey.\u201d According to Joint Exhibit Two, at least two prints were shown after May 22, 1972. The stock card for print \u201cA\u201d records an engagement on November 29. The stock card for print \u201cC\u201d records engagements from May 19 to June 5, June 12 to June 26 and October 26. Because the movie did not exist until May 5, 1972, the year date is at least 1972. The only inference is that at least one of the two prints screened after May 25, 1972 included infringing music. Other portions of Joint Exhibit Two reveal that a print of \u201cSex Odyssey\u201d was shown at various times from May 16, 1974 to June 20, 1974, but there are no specifications as to which print.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
