CAMPBELL,</author>\n<p id=\"A3\">Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-12\">Appellants are longshoremen who were injured during their work on vessels in Puerto Rican harbors. They invoke federal diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332, and the Puerto Rico direct action statute, 26 P.R.Laws Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 2001 <em>et seq., </em>in aid of their various actions, now consolidated, to recover damages for personal injury from The United Kingdom Mutual Steamship (Bermuda) Limited (United Kingdom), which provides protection and indemnity insurance for appellants\u2019 employer, Sea Land Services, Inc. Sea Land operated these vessels under a demise charter.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Appellants concededly have already received compensation for their injuries pursuant to the Puerto Rico Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, 11 P.R.Laws Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 1 <em>et seq., </em>which classifies Sea Land Services as an insured employer participating in the compensation plan. 11 P.R.Laws Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 2, 19, 21. They are thus barred from suing their employer Sea Land in tort, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 21, regardless of its concurrent status as charterer of the vessel. <em>Alcoa v. Perez Rodriguez, </em>376 F.2d 35 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>389 U.S. 905, 88 S.Ct. 215, 19 L.Ed.2d 219 (1967). Appellants urge nonetheless that the direct action statute affords them the right to bring against their employer\u2019s insurer, United Kingdom, the very tort action that the Puerto Rico Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act prohibits them from bringing against their employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-15\">The district court granted summary judgment for the insurer. 428 F.Supp. 1232 (D.P.R.1977). We endorse the district court\u2019s reasoning, and affirm its judgment. It seems obvious, direct action statute or no, that appellants cannot recover from their employer\u2019s liability insurer when they lack any right of action against the employer. Where the employer is not liable, there has been no \u201closs covered by the policy,\u201d 26 P.R.Laws Ann. \u00a7 2001, such as would allow recovery under its terms. The insurer\u2019s legal liability can be no greater than the extent of its underlying contractual undertaking with its insured. Nothing in the direct action statute says otherwise. 26 P.R.Laws Ann. \u00a7 2003. To be sure, we have characterized the direct action statute as creating \u201ca separate cause of action\u201d against the insurer, <em>Ramos v. Continental Insurance Co., </em>493 F.2d 329, 331 (1st Cir. 1974), <em>quoting Fraticelli v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co., </em>375 F.2d 186 (1st Cir. 1967). But the cause <em>of </em>action merely permits an injured party to maintain directly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>against the insurer the same claim it could have pursued against the insured. It has never been suggested that under the direct action statute the insurer\u2019s liability somehow becomes independent of its contractual obligations. <em>See Ramos v. Continental Insurance Co., </em>493 F.2d 329, 332, 333 &amp; n. 4 (1st Cir. 1974); <em>Nations </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>483 F.2d 577, 587-88 &amp; n. 36 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 1071, 94 S.Ct. 584, 38 L.Ed.2d 477 (1973); <em>Gomez Vazquez v. Litton Industries Leasing Corp., </em>67 F.R.D. 117, 120 (D.P.R. 1975) (dicta); cf. <em>Garcia v. Northern Assurance Co., </em>92 P.R.R. 236 (1965); <em>Trigo </em>v. <em>The Travelers Insurance Co., </em>91 P.R.R. 843, 850-53 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">Appellants maintain that the district court should at least have certified their contentions as a question to the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico. In a federal diversity case, the decision to certify a question of law to the local court is discretionary. <em>Lehman Bros. </em>v. <em>Schein, </em>416 U.S. 386, 94 S.Ct. 1741, 40 L.Ed.2d 215 (1974); <em>Fornaris v. Ridge Tool Co., </em>400 U.S. 41, 91 S.Ct. 156, 27 L.Ed.2d 174 (1970). While Puerto Rico\u2019s direct action statute has its complexities, its application in these circumstances does not present a close or novel question, and the district court\u2019s choice not to certify plainly did not constitute an abuse of discretion. <em>Compare Bellotti v. Baird, </em>428 U.S. 132, 96 S.Ct. 2857, 49 L.Ed.2d 844 (1976); <em>Fornaris v. Ridge Tool Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">There is, finally, no merit in appellants\u2019 criticism of the district court for referring to Louisiana and Fifth Circuit authority respecting the Louisiana direct action statute as an aid to interpretation of Puerto Rico\u2019s statute. The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has itself cited authorities from these jurisdictions in aid of construing the Puerto Rican analogue. <em>Garcia v. Northern Assurance Co., supra </em>at 241-46; <em>Trigo v. The Travelers Insurance Co., supra </em>at 849-50. <em>See Torres v. Interstate Fire and Casualty, </em>275 F.Supp. 784 (D.P.R.1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">\n<em>The judgment is affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b129-13\"> The vessels in question are owned by the named defendant, Litton Industries Leasing Corp., and others. The \u201cbareboat\u201d or \u201cdemise\u201d charter arrangement under which Sea Land operates them is \u201ctantamount to, though just short of, an outright transfer of ownership.\u201d <em>Guzman v. Pichirilo, </em>369 U.S. 698, 700, 82 S.Ct. 1095, 1096, 8 L.Ed.2d 205 (1962). Appellants originally sued the vessel owners as well as the charterer\u2019s insurers, but do not contest the dismissal of those related actions. <em>See Ramos v. Beauregard, Inc., </em>423 F.2d 916 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 865, 91 S.Ct. 101, 27 L.Ed.2d 104 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
