The district court, in granting summary judgment in favor of the finance company, answered this question in the negative. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>reverse on this issue, but affirm the order of the district court in other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">The facts are substantially undisputed. On June 5, 1972, appellant, a District of Columbia resident, purchased a used 1971 Ford Pinto automobile from appellee Center Motors, Inc. (Center), an automobile dealer located in Maryland about a mile outside the District of Columbia. On November 5, 1973, appellant traded the Pinto in to Center on a used 1972 Ford Torino. In each case, appellant signed a \u201cConditional Sales Contract\u201d filled out by Center. While Center was denominated in the contracts as the lender, the contract forms were supplied by appellee Franklin Investment Company, a financial concern whose sole office was located in the District of Columbia and the forms provided that payments were to be made not to Center but to the \u201cassignee.\u201d Center and Franklin enjoyed a close and long-standing relationship. Center normally did no credit investigation of its own, and admittedly did no such investigation in connection with either advance of credit to appellant. Franklin financed at least a portion of Center\u2019s car inventory on a \u201cfloor plan\u201d basis (App. 286-87) and purchased at a discount a substantial percentage of Center\u2019s loan contracts. From 1970 to 1973 not less than 16% of the total conditional sale contracts purchased by Franklin were acquired from Center (App. 257). On each assignment, $25 was placed into a \u201creserve account\u201d available to compensate Center for its liabilities on contracts sold with recourse or repurchase rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The loan contract on the Pinto was assigned to Franklin on the day of the sale. When appellant traded in the Pinto, Center initially wrote the conditional sales contract for the Torino to require payment in a lump sum on the following day, and then on November 7, 1973, substituted a rewritten contract providing for installment payment. Franklin had apparently reapprov\u00e9d appellant\u2019s credit during the interim, and the rewritten contract was then assigned to Franklin. Franklin subsequently sent appellant a coupon book and letters referring to him as its \u201ccustomer\u201d and soliciting his further business.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-13\">Soon after the trade-in, appellant had mechanical problems with the Torino.' Repairs by Center did not cure the problems, and Center refused to make further repairs. Appellant arranged for transmission repairs by a private shop and notified appellees of this fact, but declined to pay the repair charges or make any further payments on the contract. Franklin then repossessed the car from the repair shop, paying for the transmission repairs, and notified appellant that he could redeem the car by paying an amount totaling about $644. This sum consisted principally of the amount claimed to be due on the contract, the repair charges, and storage charges. Appellant did not redeem, and Franklin gave notice that the Torino would be sold at public sale. However, the car was apparently sold privately to Center, and a deficiency of about $351 was assessed against appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-14\">On November 5, 1974, appellant filed suit in the district court against Center and Franklin, charging that the \u201cCredit Sales Disclosure Statement\u201d dated November 5, 1973 (App. 145) prepared by Center in connection with the Torino conditional sale contract contained violations of the Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that Center and Franklin were jointly liable to' him for these violations. Appellant also asserted a number of \u201cpendent\u201d state-law claims, including usury, \u201cloan sharking,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>and breach of warranty, arising out of both loans. He sought damages and injunctive relief on all claims on behalf of himself and a class of persons similarly situated. Appellant later amended his complaint, however, to omit all class action claims. Franklin counterclaimed for the deficiency allegedly due on the conditional sale contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment and partial summary judgment. After a hearing the district court held that the Torino disclosure statement had violated the Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z in several respects. Summary judgment was entered in favor of appellant against Center and Franklin\u2019s counterclaim was dismissed. Appellant was awarded the maximum statutory penalty of $1,000 plus costs and attorneys\u2019 fees,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but no injunctive relief was ordered. The district court entered summary judgment against the appellant on his claims against Franklin and dismissed his state law claims against both defendants for lack of jurisdiction. On May 17, 1976, appellant demanded and received Center\u2019s payment of the $1,000.00 penalty and court costs, but the amount of the reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees still owing remains to be determined. Appellant now challenges the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Franklin and its dismissal of the state claims, as well as the court\u2019s refusal to enjoin further violations by the appellees. Neither Center nor Franklin has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-11\">As a threshold issue, both appellees argue that this appeal became moot when appellant accepted Center\u2019s tender of part payment of the judgment against it. Alternatively, they assert that this acceptance either waived appellant\u2019s right to challenge the judgment or estops him from doing so. It is a settled rule of law that a litigant may not accept all or a substantial part of the benefit of a judgment and subsequently challenge the unfavorable aspects of that judgment on appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There is, however, a \u201cfirmly established exception that when a judgment or decree adjudicates separable or divisible controversies, the appealing party may accept the benefit of the separable or divisible feature in his favor and challenge the feature adverse to him . . .\u201d <em>Luther v. United States, </em>225 F.2d 485, 497 (10th Cir. 1955), and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-14\">In the present case, two reasons suggest that the claims against Center and Franklin are sufficiently \u201cseparable\u201d that an appeal is not foreclosed despite appellant\u2019s acceptance of Center\u2019s payment. First, on appeal, since Franklin and Center occupy a different status, the statute might be construed to allow a separate statutory recovery against each defendant. Second, even if the statute is construed to allow only a single penalty, the two appellees might be held to be jointly liable. Such a determination would be relevant on remand, as the amount of the reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees still owing will vary depending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>on whether or not appellant is deemed to have been successful against Franklin so as to merit an award of court costs and fees attributable to this part of its action under the Act. The Act clearly intends that the award of fees and costs is at least as important a part of a plaintiff\u2019s potential recovery as the small statutory penalty it establishes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, issues affecting the determination of - these fees have an independent significance and should be appealable under the <em>Luther </em>standard. Having determined on this basis that the case before us is not moot, we proceed to the merits of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">As to the federal claims, the district court\u2019s amended order contained only the conclusion that Center violated the Act and Regulation Z in several respects, and the conclusion that Center alone was liable to appellant for the violations. The court made no summary of material facts not in issue, and did not offer any explanation of his conclusions of law. The review process therefore must begin with a reconstruction of the reasoning of the district judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-13\">The district court held, on the facts most favorable to Center, that Center was liable for violations of the Act and Regulation Z. This holding necessarily rests on the conclusion that Center was a \u201ccreditor,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that as such \u201ccreditor\u201d it was required to make the required disclosures. These holdings are not challenged by any party to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-14\">Nor is there any challenge to the specific violations found by the district court. The district court concluded that the disclosure statement violated three parts of Regulation Z: (1) 12 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 226.4(a)(3), (2) 226.6(d), and (3) 226.8(b)(4). Section 226.-4(a) provides that the amount of any finance charge shall be computed to include \u201c(3) Loan fee, points, finder\u2019s fee, or similar charge.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Section 226.6(d) provides that \u201c[i]f there is more than one creditor . in a transaction, each creditor shall be clearly identified . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>Section 226.8(b)(4) requires the disclosure of \u201c[t]he amount, or method of computing the amount, of any default, delinquency, or similar charges payable in the event of late payments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">The principal issue raised in this appeal is whether the district court properly entered summary judgment in favor of Franklin on appellant\u2019s claims. This is a question of first impression in this jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">Franklin may be held liable under the Truth in Lending Act if it can be successfully characterized as a \u201ccreditor.\u201d Section 121(a) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631(a), provides that \u201c[e]ach creditor\u201d shall make the required disclosures, and section 130(a) provides that <em>\u201cany creditor </em>who fails to comply with any requirement imposed under this chapter with respect to any person is liable to such person . .\u201d in the sums specified in the statute. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640(a) (emphasis added). The definition of \u201ccreditor\u201d in both the Act and Regulation Z includes those who regularly \u201carrange for the extension of\u201d credit as well as those who \u201cextend\u201d credit.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The district court clearly considered that Franklin was a \u201ccreditor.\u201d In concluding that Center had violated section 226.6(d), which requires the disclosure of the identity of \u201ceach <em>creditor,\" </em>\u2014 \u201cif <em>there is more than one creditor . . </em>.\u201d (emphasis added) \u2014 the district court necessarily concluded that both Franklin and Center were \u201ccreditors\u201d on the Torino loan. No other possible \u201ccreditors\u201d are involved. Moreover, the court\u2019s finding that Center had failed to disclose a \u201c[l]oan fee, points, [or] finder\u2019s fee,\u201d section 226.4(a)(3), presumably was based on the $25 rebate from Franklin to Center, and further suggests that the district court concluded that Franklin was a \u201ccreditor.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-19\">Other courts have had no difficulty in concluding that under the Act and Regulation Z, a seller who arranges credit with a lender on behalf of a customer, but who does not himself become <em>bound </em>on the instrument, is nevertheless a \u201ccreditor\u201d liable for failure to make required disclosures.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> A number of other courts have confronted the situation like that in the present case, in which a seller of goods executes a loan contract with the customer, and then immediately assigns the contract to a finance company. Based on the nature of the transaction and the relationship between the two defendants, virtually all of these courts have concluded that the seller acted as a \u201cconduit\u201d for the finance company and held that both were \u201ccreditors\u201d liable for the failure to make disclosures required by the Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>In each of these cases, the relationship between the seller and the finance company-assignee very closely resembled that between Center and Franklin in the present case. For example, in <em>Meyers v. Clearview Dodge Sales, Inc., </em>539 F.2d 511 (5th Cir. 1976), Clearview, an automobile dealer, frequently took a financial statement from a prospective customer and submitted it to several credit institutions with which it regularly dealt.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-4\">If any one of the lenders approves the customer\u2019s credit, Clearview completes the sale and immediately assigns the commercial papers to an approving lender. This practice of prearranging the assignment of commercial paper is a regular and essential part of Clearview\u2019s business and is . tantamount to arrang-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-5\">ing for the extension of credit. . Consequently, in this factual setting, both appellants are \u201ccreditors\u201d under the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ahz-dedup-0\">539 F.2d at 515. Both the dealer and the finance company were held to be \u201cobligated to make the disclosures mandated by the Act and Regulations,\u201d <em>id., </em>and both were held jointly and severally liable for the statutory penalties for noncompliance. Similarly, in <em>Joseph v. Norman\u2019s Health Club, Inc., </em>532 F.2d 86 (8th Cir. 1976), the health club sold \u201clifetime memberships\u201d on an installment plan, immediately assigning the notes, at a prearranged discount, to one of several finance companies. The companies were alerted and did a credit check almost simultaneously with the execution of the note, and refused the assignment of only about five percent of the notes executed. 532 F.2d at 91. On the basis of these facts, the Eighth Circuit reversed the district court\u2019s entry of judgment in favor of the finance companies, and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">In entering summary judgment in favor of Franklin on appellant\u2019s claims, the district court did not expressly conclude that on the facts most favorable to appellant, the relationship between Center and Franklin was distinguishable as a matter of law from the relationships between the \u201ccreditors\u201d in <em>Meyers, Joseph, </em>and similar eases. Franklin argues that these cases are distinguishable from the present one because there is no evidence that Franklin dictated to Center \u201chow the [conditional sales contract] forms were to be filled out or the terms of the transaction.\u201d Franklin Brief 14.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> However, we disagree with Franklin\u2019s analysis of the law. Cases such as <em>Meyers </em>and <em>Joseph </em>did not require that the assign-ee-finance company actually participate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>with the assignor-seller in drafting the price terms of the loan contract. Rather, it is sufficient under these decisions if the relationship between the defendants is sufficiently close to indicate that the seller was acting as the agent or \u201cconduit\u201d of the assignee in arranging the loan. \u201cWhere a finance company becomes an integral part of the seller\u2019s financing program, the financing company must bear full responsibility for all disclosure required under the Truth in Lending Act,\u201d <em>Joseph, </em>532 F.2d at 92. The closeness of the parties here is strengthened by Franklin\u2019s floor plan financing of Center\u2019s cars and the provision for consignment of some cars (App. 286-87).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">We do not, however, go quite so far as the Eighth Circuit in <em>Joseph. </em>The conclusion that Franklin was a \u201ccreditor\u201d does not in our view require that it be held liable for all deficiencies in disclosure. Most of the courts that have considered the liability of multiple creditors under the Act have found them liable without fully addressing the effect of Regulation Z, \u00a7 226.6(d). That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-6\">If there is more than one creditor or lessor in a transaction, each creditor or lessor shall be clearly identified and shall be responsible for making only those disclosures required by this Part which are within his knowledge and the purview of his relationship with the customer or lessee. [2] If two or more creditors or lessors make a joint disclosure, each creditor or lessor shall be clearly identified. [3] The disclosures required under paragraphs (b) and (c) of \u00a7 226.8 shall be made by the seller if he extends or arranges for the extension of credit. [4] Otherwise disclosures shall be made as required under paragraphs (b) and (d) of \u00a7 226.8 or paragraph (b) of \u00a7 226.15.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A78f\">(Bracketed numbers added).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">There has been a split among the Circuits as to the proper construction of this regulation. The Third Circuit, in <em>Manning v. Princeton Consumer Discount Co., </em>533 F.2d 102 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 865, 97 S.Ct. 173, 50 L.Ed.2d 144 (1976), found that a transaction in which an automobile dealer arranged a loan for a customer with a finance company was in reality a \u201ccredit sale,\u201d and that both the dealer and the finance company were \u201ccreditors\u201d within the meaning of the Act and the Regulation. It held, however, that the duty of each to make the required disclosures, and the liability for failure to do so, was controlled by section 226.6(d). It noted that the first sentence of that section would require \u201ceach creditor\u201d to make \u201cthose disclosures . which are within his knowledge and the purview of his relationship with the customer,\u201d but concluded that the more specific language of the third sentence controls whenever a \u201cseller . . . arranges credit.\u201d By its terms, the <em>Manning </em>court held, the third sentence limits both the duty and the liability to the seller alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">Three other courts have reached the opposite conclusion. In <em>Hinkle v. Rock Springs Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>538 F.2d 295 (10th Cir. 1976), the Tenth Circuit held that both a seller and the lender with whom the seller arranged consumer financing were liable for the failure to make required disclosures. It cited section 226.6(d) for the proposition \u201cthat when there are several \u2018creditors\u2019 they each shall be responsible for disclosures which are within the scope of its relationship with the consumer. . and of the data they possess.\u201d 538 F.2d at 297. The <em>Hinkle </em>court thus relied upon the first, sentence of section 226.6(d) in assessing <em>liability </em>even though a seller had arranged the extension of credit. The view of the <em>Hinkle </em>court was elaborated and adopted in preference to that of <em>Manning </em>by district courts in <em>Williams v. Bill Watson Ford, Inc., </em>423 F.Supp. 345, 354-357 (E.D.La.1976) and a similar result reached in <em>Lipscomb v. Chrysler Credit, </em>No. C72-792 (N.D.Ohio 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-11\">We concur with the analysis presented in <em>Hinkle. </em>We are loathe in the absence of clearly compelling language to adopt a reading that would permit a finance company to escape all liability for nondisclosures by enlisting a seller of goods to arrange for an extension of credit. We are particularly reluctant to do so here because of the close<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>ly integrated relationship of Center and Franklin. To the extent that the finance company influences the conduct of the seller, the deterrent purpose of the liability provisions of the Act is advanced by interpreting the first sentence of section 226.6(d) to control liability for failure to make required disclosures. The limitation of \u201cresponsibility]\u201d in the first sentence to disclosure of matters \u201cwithin [the creditors\u2019] knowledge and the purview of his relationship with the customer\u201d confines multiple creditors\u2019 potential liability to nondisclo-sures for which they are justifiably held responsible, and is the interpretation most consistent with sections 121(a) and 130(a) and the general purposes of the Act.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">The \u201cknowledge\u201d and \u201cpurview\u201d tests are not defined in the Act or Regulation Z. They appear to have independent significance primarily in cases involving co-extenders with differing relationships to the customer. In a \u201cconduit\u201d case like the present one, these two tests overlap to a considerable degree. The matters the <em>Williams </em>court found not to meet these tests were minor matters collateral to the contract and solely within the control of the seller. In contrast, the matters for which the finance company was held liable in <em>Hinkle </em>were essential terms of the contract. At a minimum, the holding that the seller arranged the extension of credit as the \u201cconduit\u201d of the assignee includes the conclusion that the assignee exercised sufficient control over the central terms of the contract to be held liable for their nondisclosure. In addition, the assignee may be charged with the nondisclosure of other matters over which it is shown to have exercised some control.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">In the present case, Franklin\u2019s identity as a creditor is a sufficient basis upon which to rest liability without placing any reliance upon Franklin\u2019s apparent rebate of $25 to Center\u2019s reserve account. Thus, as a matter of law, on the undisputed facts, Franklin is liable to appellant for the nondisclosure of its relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">The \u201cconduit\u201d theory of creditor\u2019s liability under the Truth in Lending Act as it has been described above is applicable to those assignees whose dealings with the assignor were so close that the assignor in reality acted to \u201carrange for the extension of credit\u201d on behalf of the assignee. In addition, the Act provides for proceedings \u201cagainst any subsequent assignee,\u201d including bona fide assignees, whether or not the primary creditor worked in league with them in obtaining the financing contract. As one would expect, however, Section 131 of the Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1641 (1970) provides for more limited liability for subsequent assignees than that established under the conduit theory. This section states that as to an assignee without knowledge, \u201cwritten acknowledgement of receipt [of a disclosure statement] shall be conclusive proof of delivery thereof and, <em>unless the violation is apparent on the face of the statement, </em>of compliance with this part.\u201d (Emphasis added). The clear implication of this language is that a loan customer may obtain a recovery directly from a person who takes assignment of a loan contract accompanied by a disclosure statement containing a \u201cviolation apparent on [its] face.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus, Sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>tion 131 provides an alternative basis for Franklin\u2019s liability if Franklin can be shown to have taken the loan assignment under such a manifestly inaccurate disclosure statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Appellant contends that various violations were \u201capparent on the face of the statement\u201d accepted by Franklin. In evaluating these contentions, we must be conscious of the underlying purpose stated in both the original Act and its 1974 Amendments, \u201cto assure a meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that the consumer will be able to compare more readily the various credit terms available to him and avoid the uninformed use of credit . . .\u201d Section 102, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601 (Supp. V 1975). <em>See Mourning v. Family Publications Service, </em>411 U.S. 356, 364-365, 93 S.Ct. 1652, 36 L.Ed.2d 318 (1973). With this purpose in mind we turn to appellant\u2019s first contention which is that the description of the collateral and the security interest was inadequate and thus in violation of section 128(a)(10) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1638(a)(10), and Section 226.8(b)(5) of the Regulation. Both the Act and the Regulation require the disclosure of \u201ca description of any security interest . to be retained.\u201d The disclosure statement in the present case describes the collateral only as \u201c1972 Ford.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">In evaluating the adequacy of this description in light of the Act\u2019s purpose of providing for meaningful disclosure for credit customers, the reference to a \u201c1972 Ford\u201d seems clearly sufficient. There can be no question that in the setting in which the disclosure statement was prepared and given to appellant, this description fully identified the object of the security interest. It is not the intent of the Act that the disclosure statement be as detailed in all respects as the credit contract itself; this would defeat, rather than serve, the goal of providing usable information to the customer.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-11\">The adequacy of the description of the security interest in Center\u2019s disclosure statement is a closer question than that of the sufficiency of the description of the collateral, but on balance we conclude that it also was sufficient. The language of the Act and Regulation Z differ somewhat in their statement of how technical a description is required. Section 128(a)(10) of the Act simply requires a \u201cdescription of the security interest,\u201d while the Regulation Z, \u00a7 226.8(b)(5) requires a \u201cdescription <em>or identification of the type </em>of security interest\u201d (emphasis added). In the latter, both \u201cdescription\u201d and \u201cidentification\u201d could be read as modifying \u201ctype of security interest,\u201d thus requiring disclosure in every case of the specific legal \u201ctype\u201d into which the security interest falls. <em>Cf. </em>Regulation Z \u00a7 226.2(z).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-12\">The effect of the various \u201ctypes\u201d of security interests upon a credit customer, however, differs very little, and this information would be of relatively little use to him. Requiring the identification of the \u201ctype of security interest\u201d would, accordingly, not comport with the statutory purpose of informing the consumer of his options. Furthermore, a comparison of section 226.8(b)(5) with the section of the Act itself upon which this regulation is based suggests that \u201cdescription\u201d and \u201cidentification of the type\u201d are alternative modifications \u201cof [the] security interest,\u201d and under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>this reading, it would be sufficient if the creditor described the security interest, even though he did not place it in a legal category. The latter reading adequately serves the purposes of the Act and by avoiding excessive technicality, may actually better inform the consumer than a legally accurate description. The recitation in the disclosure statement that the \u201ctransaction is secured by a Security Agreement of even date herewith\u201d was sufficient to put the appellant on notice of the existence of a security agreement and to direct him to the specific agreement, which was readily available for inspection by him prior to his purchase of the automobile. This was a sufficient \u201cdescription ... of the security interest\u201d to comply with both the Act and the Regulation.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Other alleged inadequacies in the disclosure statement are the failure to disclose that (1) the contract provides for the payment of attorneys\u2019 fees of 15 percent in the event the contract is placed with an attorney for collection, (2) that the contract contains an acceleration clause, and (3) that the creditor retains the right of self-help repossession. Appellant contends that these omissions were violations which were \u201capparent on the face of the statement.\u201d In this respect, however, Section 128(a)(9), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1638(a)(9), and Regulation Z, \u00a7 226.8(b)(4), only require the disclosure of the \u201cdefault, delinquency, or similar charges payable in the event of late payments.\u201d A number of circuit courts have recently interpreted this language to apply only to charges <em>automatically </em>payable in the event of late payments or default.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This view has been adopted by the Federal Reserve Board itself in interpretation letters.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We find this authority persuasive, and accordingly conclude that the optional remedies in question here are not required to be disclosed by the Act or Regulation Z.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">It is further obvious from such reading of the statute and Regulation Z, that neither the right of self-help repossession, nor the attorneys\u2019 fees that might be due if the creditor <em>elects </em>to refer the past due account to an attorney for collection are \u201cdefault, delinquency or similar charges\u201d which must be disclosed, since these provisions are not automatically invoked. Similarly, the acceleration clause in the conditional sale contract provides: \u201cIn the event of death of any Purchaser, or in case of insolvency, bankruptcy, or failure of business, all amounts due hereunder shall <em>at the option of the Seller </em>or assigns become immediately due and payable in full without demand or notice.\u201d (Emphasis added). This clause, although clearly optional presents a somewhat more difficult question than those providing for self-help or collection of fees, because some courts have held that acceleration represents a \u201ccharge\u201d if the unearned prepaid finance charge is not rebated in an amount at least equal to the rebate the purchaser would receive in the event of voluntary prepayment. <em>See, e. g., Johnson </em>v. <em>McCrackin-Sturman Ford, </em>527 F.2d 257, 264-69 (3d Cir. 1975); <em>Black v. G. B. Enterprises, supra, </em>mem. op. at 10-15 and cases cited therein. The contract in the present case does not contain an express provision for the rebate of unearned finance charges in the event of acceleration, but the District of Columbia and Maryland law both require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>such a rebate<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and that is sufficient to preclude characterizing the acceleration as a \u201ccharge.\u201d In the present case, the District of Columbia had the \u201cmost significant contacts\u201d relationship to the contract,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and thus its law would apply and require a rebate of unearned finance charges, nor would the conclusion be different if Maryland law was applied. We therefore hold that the acceleration clause did not include a \u201cdefault, delinquency, or similar charge[].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Finally, appellant argues that a variation between the disclosure statement and the conditional sale contract runs afoul of the requirements of section 128(a)(9) and Regulation Z, \u00a7 226.8(b)(4), and is \u201capparent on the face of the statement.\u201d The contract provides- that the purchaser \u201cshall pay\u201d a delinquency collection charge of five percent of each installment in default for ten days, while the disclosure statement indicates only that the purchaser <em>\u201cmay be required </em>to pay a delinquency and collection charge equal to <em>5% </em>of each installment in default.\u201d (Emphasis added). The disclosure statement leaves the impression that the default charge is discretionary with the creditor; the contract, on the other hand, leaves no doubt that these charges are automatic.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-12\">We agree with appellant that this inaccuracy was \u201capparent on the face of the statement.\u201d Although the misstatement in question is not an obvious omission that would be \u201capparent\u201d to one who had not examined the underlying contract, we conclude that if section 128(a)(9) is to provide consumers with the protection Congress intended, the assignee must be held to the knowledge of the underlying contract and of any inconsistency between its terms and the disclosure statement. We have no doubt that the inaccuracy in question is sufficiently serious to constitute a cognizable violation of the Act. As a matter of law, therefore, this variation between the contract and the disclosure statement is \u201capparent on the face of the statement,\u201d and Franklin, as an assignee, is liable for this violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-13\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b689-14\">Since we hold that Franklin is liable to appellant as both a \u201ccreditor\u201d and an assignee, it remains to determine the nature and extent of its liability. Appellant concedes that each violation does not give rise to a separate penalty, but contends that a separate statutory recovery may be obtained from each creditor.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The difficulty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>with appellant\u2019s position is that Franklin\u2019s liability as a \u201ccreditor\u201d is solely of a vicarious nature, based on the conclusion that Center acted to \u201carrange the extension of credit\u201d to appellant on Center\u2019s behalf. In similar factual situations, the courts have unanimously held that the two \u201ccreditors\u201d are jointly liable for a <em>single </em>statutory penalty.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> A new section 130(g) was added by the 1974 amendments, codifying this result:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aio-dedup-0\">The multiple failure to disclose to any person any information required under this part to be disclosed in connection with a <em>single account </em>under [a] . consumer credit sale . . . shall entitle the person to a single recovery under this section but continued failure to disclose after a recovery has been granted shall give rise to rights to additional recoveries.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">This amendment was expressly made applicable to all pending cases<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and limits the liability of persons held to have violated the Act either as \u201ccreditors\u201d or \u201csubsequent assignees.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The present case involves a failure to disclose in connection with a \u201csingle account\u201d \u2014 the contract involving the 1972 Torino. It is therefore clear, both under the prevailing interpretation of section 130(a) and under the new section 130(g), that appellant is entitled only to a single award from the two appellees.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-12\">On remand, summary judgment will be entered against Franklin on appellant\u2019s claims, and Franklin will be held jointly liable for the penalty assessed against Center. In awarding costs and attorneys\u2019 fees, the district court should consider that appellant has been \u201csuccessful\u201d against both Franklin and Center, section 130(a)(3), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640(a)(3). Since appellant does not challenge the district court\u2019s conclusion that he suffered no \u201cactual damage\u201d com-pensable under section 130(a)(1), we do not disturb, that portion of the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-13\">IV. '</p>\n<p id=\"b690-14\">Appellant also argues that it was error for the district court to dismiss his state claims and deny summary judgment on Franklin\u2019s counterclaim on the basis of a lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-15\">Under the two-tiered test enunciated in <em>United Mine Workers </em>v. <em>Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. 715, 725-26, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966), a federal court has <em>power </em>to determine \u201cpendent\u201d state-law claims if the \u201cstate and federal claims . . . derive from a common nucleus of operative fact\u201d and \u201care such that [the plaintiff] would be expected to try them all in one proceeding.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>In the present case, the Truth in Lending claims arose solely out of the transaction involving the Torino. The state usury and misrepresentation claims based on the earlier Pinto sale did not derive from a nucleus of operative fact common to the federal action, so it was not within the district court\u2019s power to consider these claims to be pendent to the federal claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">The local law claims arising out of the Torino transaction, on the other hand, were within the district court\u2019s power to exercise pendent jurisdiction. But these claims would have required the resolution of complex choice of law and substantive questions involving the statutory and common law governing usury, loan sharking, and breach of warranty. All of these claims are completely unrelated to the Truth in Lending claims. Had the district court elected to retain the pendent claims, the result would have been virtually unmanageable for the courts and the parties. In addition, once the local law claims based on the Pinto sale were properly dismissed, the rationale for retaining jurisdiction over the remaining pendent claims became even weaker. Liberal joinder rules in both the District of Columbia and Maryland would probably permit all of these claims to be tried in a single proceeding,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> resulting in greater economy and convenience than would have resulted from the retention of jurisdiction over the local law claims based upon the Torino purchase alone. We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the pendent claims.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> For the same re\u00e1son it was proper to deny appellant summary judgment on Franklin\u2019s counterclaim.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the district court\u2019s order of summary judgment in favor of Franklin Investment Company and remand for entry of summary judgment against Franklin on appellant\u2019s claims. Appellees Franklin and Center Motors, Inc., will be held jointly liable to appellant for a single statutory penalty under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640(a)(2)(A), and costs and fees will be awarded on the basis that appellant has been \u201csuccessful\u201d against Franklin as well as Center, \u00a7 1640(a)(3).

See <em>id., </em>\u00a7 408(e), 88 Stat. 1519.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">Nevertheless, we do not find in the language or legislative history of the 1974 amendments any implication that section 131 does not provide, by implication, the same right of recovery made express in section 115. The legislative history of the 1974 amendments, adopted as Title IV of an act concerned primarily with federal deposit insurance, is very limited and indicates only that they were \u201cbasically technical amendments designed to improve the administration of the Truth in Lending Act.\u201d H.R.Rep.No.93-1429, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 37 (1974) (conference report); U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1974, pp. 6119, 6152.

See Judge Sobeloffs opinion in <em>Lowe\u2019s North Wilkesboro Hardware, Inc. v. Fidelity Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>319 F.2d 469 (4th Cir. 1963). While Price signed the contract in Maryland, it provided from the outset that it would be \u201c[playable at the office of the assignee [Franklin]\u201d (App. 146). This was in the District of Columbia. From the beginning, assignment was contemplated, and, thus, the contract was finally consummated by delivery and acceptance at Franklin\u2019s office in the District of Columbia. Franklin is also incorporated in the District of Columbia. The contacts of a contract are to be evaluated according to their relative importance with respect to a particular issue. R. Lafler, American Conflicts of Law \u00a7 147, p. 366 (1959). One of the particular issues here that is of primary importance is the manner of handling unearned finance charges, and since that relates to <em>payment </em>of money, with all payments to be made in the District of Columbia, we hold that District law applies. We also note that all provisions of the contract will be completely effective in the District of Columbia. In this respect the District does not enjoy any advantage over Maryland. <em>Cf., </em>Baffin <em>Land Corp. v. Monticello Motor Inn, Inc., </em>70 Wash.2d 893, 425 P.2d 623, 628 (Wash.1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b689-16\">.

That case is readily distinguishable, as it involved ten <em>separate </em>notes in favor of ten different obligees, arranged by three defendant mortgage brokers. 511 F.2d at 939. <em>Ljepava </em>therefore did not involve a single account and does not fall within the rule of section 130(g) and the cases. <em>See Mirabal v.
