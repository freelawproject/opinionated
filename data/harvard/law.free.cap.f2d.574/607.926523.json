The District Court dismissed the complaint,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">The District Court\u2019s thorough opinion, with which we are in general agreement, disposes of most of appellant\u2019s arguments. We think, however, that a clear understanding of our disposition of this appeal is assisted by reference to the plain language of the relevant statutes. Section 105(d), as amended in 1973, provides that \u201cthe Secretary shall require that such projects <em>be selected by the appropriate local officials </em>with the concurrence of the state highway department . . . and . <em>in accordance with the planning process required pursuant to Section 134 </em>of this title.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section 134 prohibits the Secretary\u2019s approval of urban projects \u201cunless he finds that such projects are based on the continuing comprehensive transportation planning process carried on cooperatively by States and local communities in conformance with the objectives stated in this section.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">Appellant admits that the Secretary has properly insisted that planning be don\u00e9 by the metropolitan planning organizations<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but asserts that they cannot permissibly be allowed to select the projects to be funded. Since, however, as Section 105(d) makes plain, programming must be in accordance with planning \u2014 and of course planning would be a waste of time were it otherwise <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u2014 the regulations appear on their face to be a reasonable means of effectuating the statutory command. We will not presume that should they prove unsuccessful after a fair trial<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the Secretary would arbitrarily fail to modify or abandon them.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-18\">We add, too, that the Tenth Amendment contention, even assuming the County has standing to press it, is equally unpersuasive. In no way does the administrative scheme diminish the states\u2019 sovereign powers or undercut their ability to discharge their sovereign responsibilities.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> If a state is empowered by its constitution and laws to order local jurisdictions not to participate in the planning and programming process\u2014 and hence to forgo the opportunity to seek federal funding \u2014 nothing in the challenged rules prohibits it from doing so. Consequently, any impact on the states from observance of the regulations is but a necessary concomitant of Congress\u2019 evident desire to assure that federal funds be spent wisely.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>The judgment of the District Court appealed from is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"A5d\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b693-8\">. 23 C.F.R. \u00a7 450.316 (1976).
