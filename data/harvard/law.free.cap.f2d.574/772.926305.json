Because it is not clear whether the administrative law judge properly based his decision on substantial evidence, we remand the case for a redetermination regarding eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-21\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-22\">Anthony Gober, born on December 3, 1912, began work in a coal mine in 1928. From that time until 1955, except for twenty-two months of military service, he was employed as a miner. In 1955, Gober began work with the Aluminum Company of America as a press helper. He testified that one of the reasons he left the mines was that he experienced difficulty in breathing.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-23\">In April 1972, Gober was hospitalized with a myocardial infarction and, on physi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>dans\u2019 orders, did not return to work. Based on an application filed in August of 1972, Gober was awarded Social Security disability benefits in January of 1973 for his heart condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">Also, in August of 1972, Gober filed a claim for black lung benefits under the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> alleging that he was disabled because of pneumoconiosis. His application was subsequently supported by-the opinion of Dr. William Dzurek, his physician. On May 10, 1973, Gober\u2019s claim was denied by the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare. Six days later, a workman\u2019s compensation referee of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania adjudicated Gober totally and permanently disabled because of anthraco-silicosis resulting from his prior employment in coal mines.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">On December 17, 1975, after a hearing, an administrative law judge assigned to the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, affirmed the denial of Gober\u2019s claim, stating that Gober\u2019s disability did not arise from pulmonary difficulties, but from heart disease. The decision by the administrative law judge was upheld, successively, by the Appeals Council and by the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. An appeal from the affirmance by the district court is before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">Under the Black Lung Benefits Act of 1972,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> benefits are to be available to miners who are totally disabled by pneumoconiosis or an associated lung disease. Such benefits may be attained, under current regulations, in one of three ways. The first, and most direct of these routes, allows a claimant to prove his entitlement by:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-13\">(a) submitting X-rays which can be diagnosed as disclosing complicated pneu-moconiosis,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a totally disabling disease; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-14\">(b) submitting X-rays which \u201cestablish\u201d the existence of pneumoconiosis,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which, if the claim was originally asserted before July 1, 1973, raises the rebuttable presumption that the miner was totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-15\">The second option, if a claimant has worked for more than fifteen years in coal mines and has filed his claim by July 1, 1973, is to establish the existence of a \u201ctotally disabling respiratory disease\u201d by way of ventilatory studies.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If the \u201cforced expiration volume\u201d (FEY) and \u201cmaximum voluntary ventilation\u201d (MVV) values fall below standards stated in the regulations, the miner is presumed to be totally disabled and therefore entitled to benefits, if the presumption is not rebutted.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-16\">A third possibility, if the ventilatory test results are not sufficiently low and X-rays are negative, permits a miner who has worked fifteen years in the mines to \u201cnevertheless\u201d establish entitlement to benefits <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> by proving the existence of a \u201ctotally disabling chronic respiratory ailment\u201d presumed to be pneumoconiosis.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Such proof may be adduced by the submission of \u201cother relevant evidence,\u201d \u201cestablishing\u201d that the claimant was subject to a chronic respiratory or pulmonary ailment, the severity of which prevented him from engaging in gainful employment comparable to that which he performed in the mines.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Upon such a showing, the miner is presumed to be totally disabled because of pneumoconiosis, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>a presumption which may be rebutted only by a demonstration that the miner does not have pneumoconiosis.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">Gober sought to utilize each of the three courses prescribed by the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">Although Gober submitted six X-rays which were construed to indicate pneumoconiosis, the administrative law judge chose to credit other readings of five of those films that indicated no pneumoconiosis. We have some reservations regarding the administrative law judge\u2019s decision to credit equivocal negative readings by Dr. Milton Friedlander instead of emphatic positive readings by Dr. Dzurek of X-rays taken by Dr. Dzurek in May 1973, and regarding the rejection of uncontradicted positive readings by Dr. Dzurek in August 1975. These reservations are augmented by our puzzlement at the reference by the administrative law judge to only \u201cfive X-rays\u201d contained in the record<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> when actually six were entered into evidence. Nonetheless, we cannot overturn as unsupported by substantial evidence the determination by the administrative law judge that the X-rays failed to \u201cestablish\u201d pneumoconiosis.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">Similarly, Gober submitted three successive ventilatory studies that yielded progressively lower results. The first study contained readings that were close to the values from which disability could be presumed; the second two were substantially below such values.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The administrative law judge chose to credit the first ventilatory study, but to reject the other two, on the ground that the latter studies employed a \u201cpoor or unacceptable technique\u201d in that they failed to comply with the procedures required by regulations. Again, we cannot say that the administrative law judge\u2019s decision was not within his discretion, or was unsupported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-13\">Gober also attempted to utilize the third route to benefits by tendering \u201cother relevant evidence\u201d to demonstrate that he was totally disabled as a result of a respiratory disease. Given his twenty-five years of work in coal mines, such a demonstration would have entitled him to a presumption that he qualified for benefits. Gober testified that he was chronically short of breath, subject to extended coughing spells, experienced severe chest congestion, had difficulty walking up grades or steps, and expectorated \u201cdark grey\u201d phlegm. He stated that he was unable to engage in activities such as repairing automobiles or gardening, which he formerly enjoyed. Gober also commented that he was unable to work after his heart attack \u201cbecause of his lungs.\u201d Significantly, all of this evidence by Gober was unrebutted.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-14\">Counsel for Gober presented the testimony of Dr. Dzurek, a physician specializing in lung diseases of miners, who had examined Gober in May 1973, and August 1975. Dr. Dzurek stated that on both occasions, based on X-rays, ventilatory function studies, vital capacity studies and clinical observations, he had concluded that Gober suffered from pneumoconiosis and emphysema, and consequently was totally disabled. As a result of his clinical evaluation, Dr. Dzurek <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>also testified that Gober had fully recovered from his earlier heart attack. Under questioning by the administrative law judge, Dr. Dzurek reiterated this last opinion and stated that he predicated it on blood-pressure readings before and after exercise by Gober which indicated a \u201cwell-functioning heart,\u201d as well as a general clinical examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">The administrative law judge concluded that, while \u201csome degree of lung disfunction is clearly evidenced,\u201d Gober\u2019s disability was attributable to his heart condition, and therefore not compensable under the Act. We have grave doubts whether such resolution of Gober\u2019s application was properly supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">Our task in reviewing the administrative law judge\u2019s determination is made more difficult by the fact that he did not follow the format which we suggested in <em>Baerga v. Richardson,</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Nonetheless, as the Fourth Circuit has noted, \u201cunless the Secretary has analyzed all evidence and has sufficiently explained the weight he has given to obviously probative exhibits, to say that his decision is supported by substantial evidence approaches an abdication of the court\u2019s \u2018duty to scrutinize the record as a whole to determine whether the conclusions reached are rational.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We must therefore explore the somewhat discursive opinion of the administrative law judge to ascertain his reasons for rejecting the conclusion of Dr. Dzurek, the sole examining physician to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">1. The first evaluation of evidence, on page 3 of the administrative law judge\u2019s opinion,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> stresses a letter of Dr. Leo Coraz-za, who examined Gober in December of 1972. The letter stated that Gober was hospitalized in 1972 with heart disease, and that such disease continued. The administrative law judge also referred to the Health, Education and Welfare determination in January of 1973 that Gober was entitled to Social Security disability benefits on the basis of \u201carteriosclerotic heart disease, myocardial infarction and coronary insufficiency.\u201d These, the administrative law judge seemed to suggest, should be entitled to greater weight than the testimony of Gober and his physician, Dr. Dzurek, that the claimant was disabled because of pneumoconiosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-10\">There are several difficulties with this analysis. First, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.470 explicitly declares that decisions regarding eligibility for Social Security disability benefits are not to be determinative in black lung proceedings. Second, it is unclear whether the administrative law judge\u2019s erroneous attribution of the Social Security finding to a \u201cjudicial determination\u201d indicates that a mistaken degree of credence was given to that piece of evidence. Third, the administrative law judge did not consider the fact that the Pennsylvania Unemployment Compensation Referee had ascertained that Gober was totally disabled because of an-thracosilicosis.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Nonetheless, if the reasons thus far articulated had been the only evaluation of the evidence, it might have been sufficient to require affirmance. Three pages later, however, the administrative law judge returned to his analysis of the cause of Gober\u2019s disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-11\">2. In the later discussion, the administrative law judge first discounted Dr. Dzu-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>rek\u2019s testimony on the ground that \u201cthe exaggerations of that physician gives [sic] little credibility to the findings he reports.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It is unclear to what \u201cexaggerations\u201d the administrative law judge referred. The only prior discussion regarding Dr. Dzurek\u2019s testimony was the administrative law judge\u2019s rejection of that physician\u2019s reading of Gober\u2019s chest X-ray. It does not seem appropriate for an administrative law judge to discredit medical testimony entirely because such testimony is on the less persuasive side of a difference of medical opinion regarding a previous issue. We are left with the impression that the testimony of Dr. Dzurek was rejected because it represented an \u201cexaggeration\u201d only as compared with the administrative law judge\u2019s own conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">Such an evaluation would be improper. While an administrative law judge is free to resolve issues of credibility as to lay testimony or to choose between properly submitted medical opinions, he is not free to set his own expertise against that of a physician who testified before him. In this respect, we note the following observation by the Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-6\">[T]he decision whether to continue disability benefits will turn, in most cases, upon \u201croutine, standard, and unbiased medical reports by physician specialists,\u201d <em>Richardson v. Perales, 402 </em>U.S. [389] 404, [91 S.Ct. 1420, at 1428, 28 L.Ed.2d 842], concerning a subject whom they have personally examined. In <em>Richardson </em>the Court . . . emphasized] that while there may be \u201cprofessional disagreement with the medical conclusions,\u201d the \u201cspecter of questionable credibility and veracity is not present.\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-12\">3. After discounting Dr. Dzurek\u2019s testimony, the administrative law judge commented that Gober\u2019s lung disfunction was \u201cbased in part upon emphysema,\u201d and \u201cmay or may not be due to the fact that he smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for forty years.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> It is of questionable propriety in any event for the administrative law judge to speculate on the source of lung disability when no medical evidence was submitted to support such hypothesis. And it is unacceptable for such speculations to influence the outcome of the case, especially when they contradict the intentions of Congress. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c)(4) was specifically amended to state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-13\">If a miner was employed for fifteen years or more in one or more underground coal mines . . . and if other evidence demonstrates the existence of a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment, then there shall be a rebuttable presumption that such miner is totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8B\">The speculation by the administrative law judge that Gober\u2019s lung disorder might have been caused by smoking is at odds with the expressed Congressional presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-15\">4. Finally, the administrative law judge declared that \u201cIt would be highly unlikely for total disability to exist where stated ventilatory values exceed the interim values:\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> This assertion is unsupported by the record. And perhaps even more important, the use of this statement to defeat Gober\u2019s claim is inconsistent with the intent of Congress in amending the Act in 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-16\">The 1972 Amendments, according to the Senate Committee Report, were brought about because of the high rate at which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>claims for black lung benefits were being denied. The Report stated: \u201c[I]t has become glaringly apparent that the Act is not benefiting many of the nation\u2019s disabled coal miners who Congress intended to benefit,\u201d <footnotemark>23</footnotemark> One of the reasons for this undesirable failure to grant benefits was that \u201cthe simple breathing test, which measures only ventilatory capacity, may not adequately detect disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-3\">Thus, the legislative history contemplated that \u201cinterim rules and criteria shall . provide for the adjudication of claim [sic] on the basis of medical evidence other than breathing tests.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> If a failure to qualify for benefits on the basis of ventilatory studies rajsed the inference that it was \u201chighly unlikely\u201d that the miner was disabled, the Congressional mandate would be slighted. Such an inference would, moreover, be at variance with the Congressional announcement that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-4\">The Black Lung Benefits Act of 1972 is intended to be a remedial law \u2014 to improve upon the 1969 provisions so that the cases which should be compensated will be compensated. In the absence of. definitive medical conclusions, there is a clear need to resolve doubts in favor of the disabled miner or his survivors.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">We therefore join the Sixth, Seventh and Eighth Circuits in concluding, at least where there is medical testimony that a disabling respiratory disease is present, that under the 1972 Amendments the Secretary may not infer merely from a failure to submit qualifying X-rays and ventilatory studies that a miner is unlikely to be totally disabled because of respiratory or pulmonary disease.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-10\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-11\">Since, from the record before us, we cannot determine whether or not the errors in the administrative law judge\u2019s opinion noted above infected his conclusion that Gober was not entitled to benefits, the case will be remanded for a new hearing, consonant with this opinion, regarding Gober\u2019s eligibility.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b858-8\">. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 921-925.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b858-9\">.
