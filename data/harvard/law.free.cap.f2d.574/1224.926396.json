The gun was found when an airline employee opened defendant\u2019s attach\u00e9 case in an effort to discover to whom it belonged, the unmarked case having been sent as checked luggage and misrouted. Defendant complains of the Government\u2019s subsequent war-rantless \u201cseizure\u201d of the briefcase and its contents from the airline. The initial search by the airline employee, a private person, was clearly outside the protection of the Fourth Amendment. Since the airline then voluntarily notified the authorities and turned the briefcase over to them, the Government\u2019s action did not constitute a separate search or seizure. Accordingly, the district court was correct in denying the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1226\">*1226</page-number>Defendant also contends that the court erred in allowing into evidence a shirt with the word \u201cOutlaws\u201d on it and a second firearm found in the briefcase, objected to by defendant as irrelevant and prejudicial. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting these two items.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-4\">A review of the trial transcript revealing sufficient evidence to support the conviction, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-5\">\n<em>The \u201cSearch\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-6\">In January 1977, defendant checked his briefcase on a Delta flight from Atlanta, Georgia to Tampa, Florida. The briefcase was misrouted and arrived in Manhattan, Kansas with Frontier Airlines. Because the briefcase was not claimed and had no external identification, it was held by Frontier. On January 23, a Frontier supervisor opened the briefcase in an effort to discover the identity of its owner. Instead, he discovered two loaded firearms and what he suspected to be narcotics. He resealed the briefcase and reported his discovery to the local police. They passed the information to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &amp; Firearms, which sent an agent to the airport. The Frontier supervisor turned the briefcase over to the agent. He and the Frontier supervisor then reopened the briefcase and inventoried its contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-7\">Defendant maintains that the Government agent should have gotten a warrant before seizing the briefcase and searching its contents. He contends the district court erred in finding that Frontier voluntarily turned the briefcase over to the agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-8\">To violate the Fourth Amendment, a search must be \u201c(1) an unreasonable search (2) by a state or federal officer.\u201d United States <em>v. Blanton, </em>479 F.2d 327, 328 (5th Cir. 1973). That Amendment proscribes only governmental action. A search by a private individual for purely private reasons does not fall within Fourth Amendment proscriptions. <em>See, e. g., Burdeau v. McDowell, </em>256 U.S. 465, 475-476, 471 S.Ct. 574, 65 L.Ed. 1048 (1921); <em>United States v. Lamar, </em>545 F.2d 488, 490 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>430 U.S. 959, 97 S.Ct. 1609, 51 L.Ed.2d 810 (1977); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Crabtree, </em>545 F.2d 884, 886 (4th Cir. 1976); <em>United States v. Sherwin, </em>539 F.2d 1, 5-6 (9th Cir. 1976) <em>(en banc); United States v. Capra, </em>501 F.2d 267, 272-273 n.4 (2d Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>420 U.S. 990, 95 S.Ct. 1424, 43 L.Ed.2d 670 (1975); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Blanton, </em>479 F.2d 327, 328 (5th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-10\">Defendant concedes the initial search by Frontier did not violate the Fourth Amendment. He contends, however, that the Government was required to obtain a warrant before it \u201cseized\u201d the briefcase from Frontier. The law in this Circuit is to the contrary. The Government\u2019s actions \u201cdid not constitute a separate or additional search which could be equated with a search proscribed by the . . . Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>United States v. Blanton, </em>479 F.2d 327, 328 (5th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-12\">In <em>Blanton, </em>defendant was convicted of possessing and transporting a silencer for a firearm. An airline employee found defendant\u2019s suitcase in the airport\u2019s baggage claim area. Since it was unclaimed and had no external means of identification, the employee opened the bag to determine its ownership. He found a pistol and a silencer inside. He reclosed the bag and called federal officers, who reopened the bag when they arrived. On appeal, Blanton made the same argument defendant McDaniel now raises: that \u201cthe federal officer made a new search under circumstances where a warrant could have been obtained.\u201d 479 F.2d at 328. The Court rejected that argument. It found it of no significance that the federal officers reopened the bag, as opposed to seeing the evidence in plain view had the bag been left open by the airline employee. The initial search was valid because it was by a private person, who then turned the evidence over to the authorities. The Court held that the Government\u2019s actions in that situation did not constitute a \u201cseparate or additional search.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1227\">*1227</page-number>Defendant contends that unlike the situation in <em>Blanton, </em>the airline employee here did not <em>voluntarily </em>give the briefcase to the Government agent. The district court concluded, however, that the airline did voluntarily turn the briefcase over to the Government, a finding of fact supported by the evidence. The Frontier airline employee testified at the suppression hearing that he had been instructed by his supervisor, the airline\u2019s director of security, to request a warrant from the local police if they took the bag. When the Government agent arrived, the Frontier employee asked him if he had a warrant, and the agent said he did not need one because there was contraband in the briefcase. The Frontier employee then checked with the airline\u2019s director of security, who instructed him to release the briefcase. This testimony by the Frontier employee was corroborated by the testimony of the Government agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-5\">Since the airline voluntarily released the briefcase to the Government, this case is controlled by our decision in <em>Blanton. </em>The district court correctly denied the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-6\">\n<em>The Second Gun and the \u201cOutlaws\u201d Shirt</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-7\">Defendant contends on grounds of irrelevancy and unfair prejudice, that the district court erred in admitting into evidence a second gun and a shirt with the word \u201cOutlaws\u201d on it, both found in the briefcase.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-8\">The gun was admitted only to establish the contents of the case. A witness had testified that defendant told him the briefcase contained two guns, and the gun was introduced to corroborate the witness\u2019 testimony. Evidence of other crimes, closely related in both time and nature to the crime charged, may be admitted to establish the <em>res gestae, </em>that is, \u201cthe common scheme or history of the crime, of which the other crimes constitute a part.\u201d <em>United States v. Blewitt, </em>538 F.2d 1099, 1100 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1026, 97 S.Ct. 650, 50 L.Ed.2d 629 (1976). .The admission of the gun was necessary to complete the story told at trial. No error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-10\">The shirt with the word \u201cOutlaws\u201d on it was introduced by the Government for the purpose of identifying the briefcase in which it was found as belonging to defendant. The shirt had a pin with the word and emblem \u201cMack\u201d on it. Defendant was known as \u201cLarry Mack,\u201d and had adopted the \u201cMack\u201d emblem. Thus, the shirt was relevant to establish defendant\u2019s ownership of the briefcase.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-11\">Rule 403, Fed.R.Evid., allows the trial judge to exclude relevant evidence \u201cif its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\u201d This balancing test is committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge. His decision on admissibility can be disturbed only upon a showing of abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>547 F.2d 1264, 1266 (5th Cir. 1977). The district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the shirt into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-12\">\n<em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-13\">Defendant attacks the sufficiency of the evidence against him. While the Government\u2019s case was proved principally by circumstantial evidence, that evidence was sufficient for the jury to find defendant guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
