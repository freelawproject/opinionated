Plaintiff has petitioned this court for damages resulting from an alleged breach of contract by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant first moved for sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>mary judgment on grounds that plaintiff\u2019s petitions failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted and that, even if HUD officials did purport to make the agreements alleged by plaintiff, they were acting beyond the scope of their legal authority. This court, by its order of September 30, 1977, denied defendant\u2019s motion, noting that defendant had failed to show that there existed no triable issues of material fact. We also noted, however, that 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 200(a)(1) (1970),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which may prevent enforcement of oral contracts against the Government, might provide a \u201cshort and conclusive answer to the petitions here\u201d and render a trial unnecessary. Defendant has now, predictably, moved again for summary judgment, citing 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 200(a)(1). After a careful analysis of the arguments concerning \u00a7 '200 put forward by both the defendant and the plaintiff in opposition, we conclude that plaintiff may have a claim against the Government which is not precluded by \u00a7 200 and that a trial is, therefore, necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Giving, as we must for purposes of withstanding this motion for summary judgment, full credence to plaintiff\u2019s allegations, the following scenario unfolds. In 1971, plaintiff entered into negotiations with Central Post Housing, Inc., the Presbyterian-University of Pennsylvania Medical Center, and representatives of the Philadelphia Regional Office of HUD (defendant here)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to provide the services of general contractor for the development of the Center Post Housing Project.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> By September of 1971, before any written contracts were executed, plaintiff advised defendant that a preliminary investigation had demonstrated that the cost figures required by defendant were less than reasonable and necessary to develop and construct the project. Defendant thereupon told plaintiff that the contracts would have to be drafted with the lower figures, to get the project underway, but assured plaintiff that these cost figures would be increased at a later date in accordance with applicable HUD mortgage increase procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-11\">Also in 1971, plaintiff entered into negotiations with Adventurers, Inc., the Philadelphia Council for Community Advancement, and the appropriate representatives of HUD for the Philadelphia Region, to serve as general contractor for the remodeling and partial renovation of the Kemble Park Apartments. Similarly, after an initial investigation, plaintiff informed all parties that the remodeling could not be accomplished for the costs required by defendant. Again, to enable the project to proceed, defendant assured plaintiff that the cost figures would be adjusted at a later time in accordance with HUD procedures for increasing mortgage insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-12\">In both cases, defendant\u2019s commitments were oral only. Relying on these representations, plaintiff proceeded with the two projects, and completed them both, to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>satisfaction of all the parties. The mortgage insurance was not raised, and costs were not adjusted to reflect the true costs of construction in either project. On the Center Housing project, plaintiff claims that a balance of $226,313.10 is owing; on the Kemble Park Apartments, plaintiff claims $140,574.37 is owed.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">Defendant now moves for summary judgment on the ground that 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 200 precludes recovery by the plaintiff on the basis of an alleged oral contract. Citing <em>United States v. American Renaissance Lines, </em>161 U.S.App.D.C. 140, 494 F.2d 1059, <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 1020, 95 S.Ct. 495, 42 L.Ed.2d 294 (1974), the leading case interpreting 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 200, defendant argues that a clear, written contract is required to bind the parties, where one of the parties is the Government. It seeks to bolster this assertion by submitting affidavits of Philadelphia Region HUD officials stating that HUD regulations did not allow the oral agreements alleged by plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Defendant goes even further to argue that \u00a7 200 also precludes this court from finding an implied-in-fact contract or from awarding damages in <em>quantum meruit </em>based on the same nucleus of operative facts. It argues that finding an implied-in-fact contract or awarding <em>quantum meruit </em>damages would be the same as determining that \u00a7 200 did not apply at all, and further asserts that a <em>quantum meruit </em>recovery requires performance, which plaintiff here has not undertaken, beyond that which is already contractually obligated. Finally, the Government contends that this court does not have jurisdiction over pure <em>quantum meruit </em>claims because they spring from contracts implied-in-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s rejoinder centers on the argument that it was not Congress\u2019 intent, in passing \u00a7 200, \u201cto allow the Government to repudiate at will contracts which by custom of trade are oral.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">Plaintiff also asserts, however, that even if \u00a7 200 should be interpreted so as to apply to the alleged express oral contract, it should not be so broadly construed as to preclude any kind of a recovery by plaintiff. Plaintiff raises <em>quantum meruit </em>and implied-in-fact contract as two alternate theories under which it should be allowed to recover, both of which would require a trial. Plaintiff argues that, even though our previous order characterized this agreement as \u201cactually more in the nature of an express contract not reduced to writing,\u201d additional facts (in addition to the express oral agreement negated by \u00a7 200) make a \u201cmeeting of the minds\u201d a reasonable inference. And, where such an inference is possible, a contract implied-in-fact may exist. <em>Algonac Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>428 F.2d 1241, 1255-56, 192 Ct.Cl. 649, 673-74 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">Because we see a valid distinction to be drawn between the naked, express oral contract at which \u00a7 200 may be directed, and the \u201cadditional facts\u201d from which a contract implied-in-fact could be inferred, we agree with the plaintiff that a trial is necessary to determine whether such additional facts can be proved in the face of Government opposition.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-11\">We do not now decide whether the Government\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 200 with regard to the express oral contract is correct. A stark assertion by an individual that a Government representative had orally promised some performance might, without more, be insufficient to bind the Government. Likewise, a stark assertion by the Government that some other person had orally promised performance might, without more, be insufficient to bind that other person to perform. <em>See American Renaissance Lines, </em>161 U.S.App.D.C. at 143, 494 F.2d at 1062-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-12\">We have great difficulty, however, in accepting the Government\u2019s further assertion that a reasonable interpretation of \u00a7 200 must, of necessity, preclude recovery through implied-in-fact contract or <em>quantum meruit </em>when such recovery would be based on the same basic operative facts. Were we to subscribe to such an argument, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>we would be facing the farcical situation of having the Government, in any situation where it was defending against an implied-in-fact contract claim, attempting to prove that there was, in actuality, an express oral contract which it had breached. Then, citing \u00a7 200 and applicable regulations, the Government could escape any liability whatsoever. <em>Cf. American Renaissance Lines, </em>161 U.S.App.D.C. at 144, 494 F.2d at 1063 (similar result dismissed as unsatisfactory in context of mutuality).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Even more importantly, such an interpretation would also, in practicality, have the effect of eliminating recovery against the Government in almost all cases where claims are based on implied-in-fact contract or <em>quantum meruit. </em>In almost all such cases, there is some sort of oral representation on the part of some Government agent. Although the party seeking to recover from the Government may not rely on the oral representation, and may rely totally on other, independent facts to establish the presence of an implied-in-fact contract or to recover in <em>quantum meruit, </em>the Government now seeks to make the mere existence of the oral representation, characterized as an oral express contract not reduced to writing, sufficient to compel this court to close its eyes to all other surrounding facts. Clearly such an expansive interpretation of \u00a7 200 is unacceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">The Supreme Court, in discussing a statutory predecessor to \u00a7 200, recognized the possibility of recovery outside of the oral express contract which had not been reduced to writing. In <em>Clark v. United States, </em>10 Ct.Cl. 604 (1874), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>95 U.S. 539, 24 L.Ed. 518 (1877), the Court of Claims had taken exactly the position which the Government now asserts and had denied recovery to a claimant against the Government on an oral contract. The Supreme Court, though recognizing that application of the statute was mandatory insofar as it precluded recovery based solely on an alleged express oral contract, reversed this court and allowed recovery on \u201can implied contract for a <em>quantum meruit.\"</em></p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">Since that early interpretation (and since the statute now in issue became effective in 1954) this court has often allowed recovery on an implied-in-fact contract, <em>see, e. g., Algonac Mfg. Co. v. United States, </em>428 F.2d 1241, 192 Ct.Cl. 649 (1970). The failure, for whatever reason, of an attempt at an express contract, be it written or oral, is not enough, in itself, to deprive a party of a recovery for breach where sufficient additional facts exist for the court to infer the \u201cmeeting of the minds\u201d necessary to separate an implied-in-fact from a pure implied-in-law contract.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>New York Mail and Newspaper Transportation Co. v. United States, </em>154 F.Supp. 271, 278, 139 Ct.Cl. 751, 759, <em>cert. denied, </em>355 U.S. 904, 78 S.Ct. 332, 2 L.Ed.2d 260 (1957).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>It appears from the record now before us \u2014 which must be interpreted in a light most favorable to the plaintiff for purposes of withstanding defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment \u2014 that plaintiff may be able to prove facts, in addition to the alleged express oral contract, from which a contract may be inferred. If such be the case, the statutorily mandated preclusion of recovery on an oral contract (which we assume <em>arguendo, </em>without deciding) will not totally bar plaintiff\u2019s recovery in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">Accordingly, after a thorough consideration of the briefs and submissions of the parties without oral argument, the defendant\u2019s motion, treated as a motion for partial summary judgment is denied and this action is remanded to the Trial Division for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b592-16\">.

The distinction between contracts implied-in-fact and those implied-in-law is clearly spelled out in <em>Algonac.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-7\"><em>* * * </em>Thus a contract implied in fact is a true contract, the agreement of the parties being inferred from the circumstances, while a contract implied in law is but a duty imposed by law and treated as a contract for the purposes of a remedy only. Another distinction * * * lies in the fact that,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-8\">* <em>* * </em>in the case of contracts implied in fact, there must be an assent of the parties, as in express contracts, whereas * * * in the case of contracts implied in law, or, more properly, quasi or constructive contracts, such element of assent is lacking. The distinction has also been stated -that a contract implied in fact is an implied contract in which the intention is ascertained and enforced, while a contract implied in law is a mere fiction, the intention being disregarded, and the quasi contractual obligation being imposed by law to bring about justice, without regard to the intention of the parties. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-12\">428 F.2d at 1255-56, 192 Ct.Cl. at 674, <em>quoting </em>17 C.J.S. <em>Contracts </em>\u00a7 4 (1963).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b595-13\">.
