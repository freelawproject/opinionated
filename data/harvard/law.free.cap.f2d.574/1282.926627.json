We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-24\">In April 1974, while serving in active duty as a United States naval officer, Val-lance entered the Navy Regional Medical Center in Oakland, California, for diagnosis of head pains. United States Navy personnel performed an arteriogram, the results of which they termed normal. In August 1976, Vallanee returned to the hospital with increased pain. Hospital personnel discovered and removed a large tumor. Allegedly, the April test results showed the tumor, but the results had been misread. Vallanee charged that hospital personnel discovered the mistake after he left in April, but did not notify him. Vallanee contends that the delay in treatment increased the degree of permanent damage he suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-25\">In <em>Feres v. United States, </em>340 U.S. 135, 71 S.Ct. 153, 95 L.Ed. 152 (1950), the Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1283\">*1283</page-number>preme Court interpreted the F.T.C.A. to exclude liability for injuries to servicemen \u201cwhere the injuries arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service.\u201d 340 U.S. at 146, 71 S.Ct. at 159, 95 L.Ed. at 161. Vallance argues that in seeking medical treatment at the Navy hospital he was engaged in \u201cbusiness of his own person,\u201d such that the injuries he sustained through alleged medical malpractice did not arise in the course of activity incident to service.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-5\">In <em>Shults v. United States, </em>421 F.2d 170 (5th Cir. 1969), a case presenting a factual situation similar to that in the case at bar, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1367-6\">it is obvious that the injured man could not have been admitted, and would not have been admitted, to the Naval Hospital except for his military status. He was there treated by Naval medical personnel solely because of that status. It inescapably follows that whatever happened to him in that hospital and during the course of that treatment had to be \u201cin the course of activity incident to service!;.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1367-7\">421 F.2d at 171-172. [Citation omitted.] Under <em>Shults, </em>Vallance engaged in activity incident to service in being treated at the Navy hospital while on active duty; therefore, he cannot maintain an action under the F.T.C.A.
