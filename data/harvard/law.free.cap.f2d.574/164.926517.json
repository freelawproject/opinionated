App. \u00a7 2 (1977 Supp.).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Since we hold that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>he is not, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">Defendant Palmer was indicted by a federal grand jury on April 28, 1977, on two counts of forging and cashing a United States Treasury check as prohibited by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 495. On May 25, 1977, defendant was sentenced on an unrelated state charge in the Court of Common Pleas of Erie County, Pennsylvania. On the same day he began serving that sentence in the Erie County Jail. On June 2, 1977, the federal government obtained custody of defendant by writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum, issued pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c)(5), and arraigned him in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. The defendant was then returned to the Erie County Jail. On June 22, 1977, defendant was transferred from the Erie County Jail to the Western Pennsylvania State Diagnostic and Correctional Institute at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (\u201cWestern Penn\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On August 1, 1977, the federal government again took custody of defendant by writ of habeas corpus ad pro-sequendum. On that day, following a colloquy pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 11, the adequacy of which is not in dispute, defendant pleaded guilty to both counts in the federal indictment. Thereafter he was immediately returned to Western Penn.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">On August 14, 1977, defendant filed a motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that his transfers from state custody to federal custody and then back to state custody violated Article IV(e) of the IAD. On August 26, 1977, the district court denied the motion and sentenced defendant to two years of imprisonment imposed concurrently with the state sentence. Defendant then filed this direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">The parties do not dispute that a violation of the IAD in fact took place. If defendant had raised this contention prior to pleading guilty, the indictment would have been dismissed with prejudice. <em>United States v. Sorrell, </em>562 F.2d 227 (3d Cir. 1977); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>562 F.2d 232 (3d Cir. 1977); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mauro, </em>544 F.2d 588 (2d Cir. 1976). The sole issue for decision is whether defendant, after pleading guilty without reservation, may thereafter complain about violations of Article IV(e) of the IAD. <em>See United States v. Zudick, </em>523 F.2d 848, 851 (3d Cir. 1975); <em>United States v. D\u2019Amato, </em>436 F.2d 52, 53 (3d Cir. 1970). <em>Cf. also, Lefkowitz v. Newsome, </em>420 U.S. 283, 95 S.Ct. 886, 43 L.Ed.2d 196 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">Defendant pleaded guilty on August 1, 1977. At that time, the applicability of Article IV(e) to his situation was still in doubt because <em>Sorrell </em>and <em>Thompson </em>had not yet been decided. Defendant apparently made a rational and voluntary decision to accept the benefits of pleading guilty.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although he moved to dismiss the indictment before sentencing, he was not willing to surrender these benefits by seeking to withdraw his plea and \u201ctaking his chances\u201d on the outcome of his IAD motion. By pleading guilty in this way, defendant waived his right to have the Article IV(e) claim considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">Defendant contends the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the IAD provides the indictment \u201cshall not be of any further force or effect\u201d and entitles a de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>fendant to dismissal \u201cwith prejudice\u201d when Article IV(e) is violated. The defendant is correct that errors and defenses which <em>go </em>to the jurisdiction of the court to accept a guilty plea may be raised even after the plea has been entered. <em>See </em>e. <em>g., Blackledge v. Perry, </em>417 U.S. 21, 30, 94 S.Ct. 2098, 40 L.Ed,2d 628 (1974); <em>United States v. Hawthorne, </em>532 F.2d 318, 321-2 (3d Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 894, 97 S.Ct. 254, 50 L.Ed.2d 177 (1976); <em>United States v. Loschiavo, </em>531 F.2d 659, 662-3 (2d Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">However, the nature of defendant\u2019s rights under the IAD disposes of this contention. The Supreme Court has consistently held that even deprivation of constitutional rights occurring prior to the entry of a guilty plea may not be asserted in subsequent proceedings. <em>Tollett </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>411 U.S. 258, 93 S.Ct. 1602, 36 L.Ed.2d 235 (1973); <em>Brady </em>v. <em>United States, </em>397 U.S. 742 (1970); <em>McMann </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>397 U.S. 759, 90 S.Ct. 1441, 25 L.Ed.2d 763 (1970); <em>Parker v. North Carolina, </em>397 U.S. 790, 90 S.Ct. 1458, 25 L.Ed.2d 785 (1970). The IAD, on the other hand, constitutes nothing more than a set of procedural rules. The statutory right to dismissal due to an administrative violation of these rules is therefore not \u201cfundamental\u201d, even though its impact on a defendant may be great. <em>Cf. Blackledge v. Perry, supra, </em>at 30, 94 S.Ct. 2098.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">In our view, whether a claim is \u201cjurisdictional\u201d or not depends on the source and importance of the right asserted as well as its impact. We therefore hold that the violation of a statutory provision such as Article IV(e) is not sufficiently important to deny a court jurisdiction to entertain a guilty plea where the defendant fails to raise the issue in a timely manner. <em>Strawderman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>436 F.Supp. 503 (E.D.Va.1977). Furthermore, while the impact of defendant\u2019s right to a dismissal under Article IV(e) may be great, it is no greater than the impact of the right to suppress a confession which may constitute the bulk of the government\u2019s proof against a defendant. Nor is it any greater than the right to a dismissal because of an improperly constituted grand jury. The Supreme Court has held that these rights \u2014 even though derived from the Constitution \u2014 are also not sufficiently \u201cfundamental\u201d to permit avoidance of a voluntary plea. <em>McMann v. Richardson, supra; Parker v. North Carolina, supra; </em>and <em>Tollett v. Henderson, supra. See also Burrows </em>v. <em>Engle, </em>545 F.2d 552 (6th Cir. 1976) (right to challenge wording of indictment waived). In light of these cases, it would be anomalous for us to hold that the statutory rights derived from the IAD cannot be waived. <em>See Edwards v. United States, </em>564 F.2d 652, No. 77-2048 (2d Cir. 1977) (IAD violation not a \u201cfundamental defect\u201d). <em>Cf. United States v. Ford, </em>550 F.2d 732, 742 (2d Cir. 1977) (protections in IAD Article IV(e) may be waived).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">We note that the purposes of the IAD are to implement a defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial and to avoid excessive interference with a prisoner\u2019s rehabilitation in the state prison system. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sorrell, supra, </em>at 229; <em>United States ex rel. Esola v. Groomes, </em>520 F.2d 830, 833 (3d Cir. 1975); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ford, supra, </em>at 737-41 (2d Cir. 1977). These purposes are not disserved by our ruling that the benefits of the act may be waived by a guilty plea. The right to a speedy trial may be waived. <em>See Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 523-9, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972). The defendant in the case at bar never requested to be tried, nor was any substantial delay in affording him a trial evident. Furthermore, a prompt guilty plea enables a defendant to recommence his state program for rehabilitation without any delay. Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>gressional intent will be frustrated to a far lesser extent by our binding defendant to his plea than by our adopting a rule which would release numerous defendants who have already admitted their guilt.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Cf. </em>Judge Garth\u2019s dissenting opinion in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thompson, supra, </em>at 239; <em>Daniel v. Louisiana, </em>420 U.S. 31, 33, 95 S.Ct. 704, 42 L.Ed.2d 790 (1975). Accordingly, we hold that the judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b249-11\">. IAD Article IV(e) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-12\">If trial is not had on any indictment, information, or complaint contemplated hereby prior to the prisoner\u2019s being returned to the original place of imprisonment pursuant to Article V(e) hereof, such indictment, information, or complaint shall not be of any further force or effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice:</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b250-6\">. The government has conceded that the defendant was not held in federal custody at the Western Penn because that institution is not designated as a holding place for federal prisoners awaiting trial in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b250-7\">. At oral argument, defendant\u2019s counsel represented to the court that he was aware of the provisions of Article IV(e) at the time defendant pleaded guilty, but was unsure whether they applied in defendant\u2019s situation. While the record is bare of evidence of any plea bargain in defendant\u2019s case, we assume that defendant\u2019s counsel obtained some concessions from the government in exchange for the plea. He and the defendant apparently deemed these concessions acceptable in view of the uncertainty surrounding the IV(e) claim. We note in this regard that the government made no sentencing recommendation and that the sentence imposed was concurrent with the state sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b251-7\">. Defendant contends that <em>Enright v. United States, </em>434 F.Supp. 1056 (S.D.N.Y.1977), compels a dismissal of the indictment. In view of the recent decision in <em>Edwards v. United States, </em>564 F.2d 652, No. 77-2048 (2d Cir. 1977), we doubt that <em>Enright </em>has value as precedent, even in its own circuit. Furthermore, the issue in <em>Enright </em>was not whether a violation of the IAD is waived by a guilty plea. Rather, <em>Enright </em>considered whether other acts by the defendant constituted a knowing and voluntary waiver of the provisions of the IAD. <em>Cf. Strawderman v. United States, </em>436 F.Supp. 503 (E.D.Va.1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b252-13\">. It is presumably for this reason that this court noted in <em>Sorrell, supra, </em>at 231, that \u201cthere seems little justification for retroactive application of the statutory construction ultimately adopted, through collateral attack, where the defendant-prisoner has not requested a speedy trial prior to the trial.\u201d <em>See also Edwards v. United States, supra, </em>(a claim based on a violation of IAD is not cognizable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
