Because the record does not disclose the basis for a crucial element of the Secretary\u2019s findings, the matter will be remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-22\">Fred G. Schaaf, now 78 years old, worked in coal mines for thirty-six years. In January of 1970, Schaaf filed an application for black lung benefits. The claim was denied initially in November of 1970, and rejected twice on administrative reconsideration under the 1972 Amendments. On January 16, 1972, after a hearing, an administrative law judge affirmed the denial. The administrative law judge\u2019s decision was approved by the Social Security Appeals Council. Denial of Schaaf\u2019s claim then was affirmed by the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. An appeal from the district court\u2019s decision is now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-23\">As we recently outlined in <em>Gober v. Matthews,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>an applicant for black lung benefits who has worked in the mines more than 15 years can claim entitlement on the basis of any of three showings: (1) X-rays \u201cestablishing\u201d pneumoconiosis, (2) ventilatory tests demonstrating disabling respira<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>tory disease, or (3) \u201cother relevant evidence\u201d establishing disability due to respiratory disease.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In this case, the claimant provided all three varieties of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Schaaf submitted two X-rays which were read as \u201ccompatible with\u201d pneumoconiosis, and one which was interpreted as definitely demonstrating pneumoconiosis. However, the two \u201ccompatible\u201d X-rays were each reread by three other physicians as completely negative for pneumoconiosis, and a fourth X-ray was submitted which was construed by two physicians as negative. Regardless of our opinion of his action, the administrative law judge\u2019s decision that the X-rays failed to establish the existence of pneumoconiosis is not without substantial support in the record.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Likewise, Schaaf submitted five ventila-tory studies, and all but one would have qualified him for benefits. The administrative law judge found on the basis of the opinions of medical consultants that five of the studies were technically unsatisfactory. He also declined to accept the sixth study, on the ground that it \u201ctraced a single effort on FEV and made no tracing of MW.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In view of the statement in the record by Dr. Harold Passes that studies with less than three individual tests \u201ccannot be medically accepted,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we are unable to conclude that the administrative law judge\u2019s decision in this respect was without substantial evi-dentiary support.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Schaaf also based his claim on \u201cother relevant evidence.\u201d He testified that he suffers from a cough both morning and night which produces thick black phlegm. His breath is short, he can walk only half a block before he has to stop, and can climb only two or three steps at a time. Because of difficulty in breathing when he is fully reclined, he sleeps propped up. He has not been able to do household chores since the late 1960s.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-15\">In addition, Schaaf submitted letters from two physicians who have dealt with his medical difficulties, Dr. Gilbert Reed, a general practitioner who has been treating Schaaf since 1970, detailed his findings thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-16\">My impression was that the patient is totally and permanently disabled due to anthracosilicosis first stage with bilateral emphysema. His hypertension and present diabetes mellitus which I have treated him for in no way contributes to his disability.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-17\">Dr. John Mika, who had attended Schaaf since 1975 likewise set forth the results of his examination and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-18\">On the basis of the physical examination, the work history, the chest X-ray, and the pulmonary function study, it is my impression that Mr. Fred Schaaf is totally disabled due to anthracosilicosis and emphysema.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-19\">The administrative law judge nonetheless determined that \u201cthe other relevant evidence, considered as a whole, does not demonstrate a level of severity as contemplated\u201d in the applicable regulations.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is unclear whether the administrative law judge accepted Schaaf\u2019s testimony as to the extent of his disability.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> If Schaaf\u2019s testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>mony was accurate, he was totally disabled, and the finding by the administrative law judge must be that Schaaf\u2019s disability was not caused by a respiratory disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">This determination, however, conflicts with the uncontradicted diagnoses of two physicians who are currently treating Schaaf. We have before us only vague indications of why the administrative law judge refused to accept these diagnoses. He might have rejected the findings because he inferred from the non-qualifying ventilatory studies that Schaaf was unlikely to suffer from disabling lung disease.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> But such an inference, as we explained in <em>Gober v. Matthews, </em>would be impermissible.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The administrative law judge might have declined to accept the doctors\u2019 studies on the ground that they were based on X-ray, interpretations which are discredited, and that the remaining clinical findings were too sketchy a predicate to establish the existence of a disabling respiratory disease. Or the administrative law judge might have improperly engaged in medical diagnosis of his own.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-14\">An opinion such as the one before us thus does riot adequately explain the reasons for refusing to credit uncontradicted medical evidence. Congress expected that under the 1972 Amendments the diagnoses of treating physicians would play a major role in the determination of eligibility for black lung benefits.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-15\">For the administrative law judge to reject two such diagnoses without a clear statement of the reason for such rejection is unacceptable, particularly when there are intimations that the administrative law judge utilized improper inferences in reaching his conclusion.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It would be improper for us to speculate as to the administrative law judge\u2019s reasoning process, and the case, therefore, must be returned to the Secretary for a rehearing.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>The judgment of the district court will be reversed, and the case remanded.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b242-24\"><em>. </em>No. 77-1499, 574 F.2d 772 (3d Cir. 1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b243-8\">.
