Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). Regardless of the label attached to it, a motion challenging the correctness of a judgment is a motion filed pursuant to Rule 59(e)' of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure if the litigant submits it within 28 days after the entry of the judgment. <em>Mangieri v. Clifton, </em>29 F.3d 1012, 1015 n. 5 (5th Cir.1994); <em>Harcon Barge Co. v. D &amp; G Boat Rentals, Inc., </em>784 F.2d 665, 667 (5th Cir.1986) (en banc); Fed.R.CivJP. 59(e). Where a litigant files a timely Rule 59(e) motion and a notice of appeal, the notice of appeal does not become effective until the entry of the order disposing of the motion. Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(A)(iv), (B)(i); <em>Burt v. Ware, </em>14 F.3d 256, 260-61 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Harris filed a postjudgment motion challenging the dismissal of his complaint within 28 days of the district court\u2019s entry of judgment, which is properly construed as a Rule 59(e) motion. <em>See Mangieri, </em>29 F.3d at 1015 n. 5; <em>Harcon Barge Co., </em>784 F.2d at 668. Because the district court has not decided the Rule 59(e) motion, this appeal is premature. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App, P. 4(a)(4)(B)(i). The case is, therefore, remanded to the district court for the limited purpose of allowing the court to rule on Harris\u2019s pending Rule 59(e) motion. Harris\u2019s appeal is held in abeyance.</p>\n<p id=\"AO2\">REMANDED FOR LIMITED PURPOSE; APPEAL HELD IN ABEYANCE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b408-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
