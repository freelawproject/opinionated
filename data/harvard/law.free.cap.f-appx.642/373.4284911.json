He appeals the district court\u2019s order disqualifying him from serving as a relator in the suit and dismissing the case without prejudice to the Government. Because Holmes fails to raise any arguments warranting reversal, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">This dispute involves two underlying proceedings and a tangled array of related actions. And, like so many cases that have appeared in our court recently, Hurricane Katrina was the catalyst for the chain of events leading to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Northrop Grumman Corporation (\u201cNGC\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is a large government contractor that, amongst other things, operates shipyards in Mississippi and Louisiana. Northrop Grumman Risk Management, Inc., insured its parent company, NGC, for certain losses related to those shipyards. A separate company, Munich Re, then provided reinsurance for NGC\u2019s covered losses. In late 2005, NGC presented a claim under its policy with Munich Re for alleged damages to several of its shipyards as a result of Hurricane Katrina. During the adjustment process, Munich Re and NGC entered into a confidentiality agreement that prohibited Munich Re and its agents from disclosing documents and information that they received from NGC. Munich Re ultimately initiated arbitration proceedings in London, England, to resolve coverage disputes under the Munich Re/NGC reinsurance policy (the \u201cLondon Arbitration\u201d). Holmes and another lawyer, Gerald Fisher, represented Munich Re in the London Arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-12\">While the London Arbitration was pending, Munich Re submitted a request with the United States Navy for documents relating to NGC. The Navy agreed to release the requested documents if an enforceable protective order was put in place. As a result, on April 6, 2010, Munich Re \u2014 represented by Holmes and Fisher \u2014 filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against NGC and several of its subsidiaries seeking a protective order (the \u201cProtective Order Litigation\u201d). \u25a0 In the complaint, Holmes and Fisher stated that they sought the relevant documents \u201cin aid of private foreign arbitration only\u201d and that they were \u201cin no way ... attempting] to usurp the power of the arbitration tribunal\u201d for other purposes. The complaint included a proposed protective order, which prohibited the use of the requested documents for any purpose outside of the London Arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-13\">On June 2, 2010, while the Protective Order Litigation was still pending, Holmes and Fisher filed a qui tam lawsuit against NGC and'others under the False Claims Act (\u201cFCA\u201d). They alleged that NGC had defrauded the Navy by using government funds allocated for expenses related to Hurricane Katrina to cover cost overruns that had occurred before the storm. Amongst other things, the complaint alleged that a review of the documents that they anticipated receiving from the Navy would help prove their claim. This complaint was filed under seal pursuant to the FCA, and the suit was later transferred from the District of Columbia to the Southern District of Mississippi.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-14\">On June 18, 2010, the parties in the Protective Order Litigation stipulated to a protective order, and on June 24, 2010, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>district court entered the proposed protective order (the \u201cProtective Order\u201d or \u201cOrder\u201d). The Protective Order stated that any produced documents designated \u201cCourt Protected Material\u201d would \u201cbe used or disclosed solely in the [London] Arbitration\u201d and would \u201cnot be used in any other proceeding or for any other purpose without further order of this Court.\u201d The Protective Order further required the parties to return or destroy all protected materials at the conclusion of the London Arbitration. Despite the express terms of the Protective Order, Holmes submitted documents he received from the Navy to the Department of Justice\u2019s Civil Fraud Division and to the district court presiding over the qui tam action.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">On November 11, 2011, NGC and Munich Re settled the London Arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">On December 8, 2011, the United States officially declined to intervene in the qui tam suit. In previous filings, the Government explained that it had investigated the claims, and that, amongst other things, its decision not to participate \u201cstem[med] from serious ethical and professional responsibility concerns arising from the particular circumstances of [the] action.\u201d On August 18, 2012, Fisher also withdrew from the case when Holmes filed the operative First Amended Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">In October 2013, Appellees filed a motion to disqualify Holmes from representing the United States as a qui tam relator, citing his unethical conduct in pursuing the claim. On June 3, 2015, the district court granted the motion and issued an order (1) disqualifying Holmes as a relator and (2) dismissing the case with prejudice as to Holmes, but without prejudice as to any rights of the United States. Holmes timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">We review rulings on motions to disqualify for abuse of discretion. <em>F.D.I.C. v. U.S. Fire Ins. Co., </em>50 F.3d 1304, 1311 (5th Cir.1995). Under this standard, we review fact-findings for clear error and review de novo the district court\u2019s application of the relevant rules of attorney conduct. <em>Id. </em>This same abuse of discretion standard applies in our review of a district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint as a result of ethical violations. <em>See Salmeron v. Enter. Recovery Sys., Inc., </em>579 F.3d 787, 793 (7th Cir.2009); <em>see also United States v. Quest Diagnostics Inc., </em>734 F.3d 154, 165-66 (2d Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-11\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b398-12\">In a thorough and detailed opinion, the district court outlined Holmes\u2019 numerous ethical violations committed in pursuit of this qui tam action. Citing the District of Columbia Rules of Professional Conduct, the Mississippi Rules of Professional Conduct, and the American Bar Association\u2019s Model Rules,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the district court persuasively explained that Holmes violated no less than four ethical duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>The court first explained that Holmes violated his duty of loyalty by taking a position in the qui tam suit that was contrary to the interests of his client, Munich Re, in the London Arbitration. <em>See </em>ABA Model Rule 1.7(a) (\u201c[A] lawyer shall not represent a client 'if the representation involves a concurrent conflict of interest\u201d). The analysis is straightforward: in the London Arbitration, Munich Re argued that it did not owe NGC compensation for certain losses related to Hurricane Katrina in part because the Government had previously paid NGC compensation for those losses; Holmes then argued in the qui tam action that the Government should not have paid all of NGC\u2019s claimed losses from Hurricane Katrina.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These two positions are clearly in direct conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Perhaps most troubling of the violations was Holmes\u2019 blatant disregard for the Protective Order and his related violation of his duty of candor to the court. There is no dispute that Holmes violated the express terms of the Protective Order by relaying the documents he received in the Protective Order Litigation to the Department of Justice and the district court in the qui tam action; indeed, Holmes has conceded the point.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He also concedes on appeal that he was obligated to follow the Protective Order in pursuing his qui tam claim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">The district court also concluded. that Holmes violated his duty of candor during the course of the Protective Order Litigation. Holmes and Fisher told the court in the Protective Order Litigation on April 6, 2010, that Munich Re was seeking documents for use solely in the London Arbitration. On June 2, 2010, Holmes filed the qui tam suit, and told the- court there that he expected that the documents he received from the Navy would prove NGC\u2019s alleged fraud. Holmes stipulated to the Protective Order on June 18, 2010, and the order was entered on June 24. He then promptly disclosed the documents he received pursuant to the Protective Order to third parties in direct contravention of the terms of the Order and his representations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>to the court in the Protective Order Litigation. Later, in the operative First Amended Complaint, Holmes stated that he had \u201cgained access to documents and information showing that the U.S. Government has been defrauded,\u201d including \u201cdocumentation submitted by Northrop Grumman to the Navy.\u201d Based on this timeline, the district court did not clearly err in finding that Holmes violated his duty of candor in his representations to the court in the Protective Order Litigation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See </em>ABA Model Rule 3.3(a) (\u201cA lawyer shall not knowingly ... make a false statement of fact or law to a tribunal or fail to correct a false statement of material fact or law previously made to the tribunal by the lawyer.\u201d); <em>see also </em>ABA Model Rules 4.1(a), 8.4(c). This timeline also supports the court\u2019s finding that Holmes <em>knowingly </em>violated the Protective Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">The district court concluded that (1) \u201cbased on the totality of the ethical violations committed by Holmes surrounding this qui tam case, Holmes should be disqualified from serving as relator in this case,\u201d and (2) \u201cmerely disqualifying Holmes from serving as relator without dismissing the case would greatly prejudice Northrop Grumman because the case would be tried on a record developed primarily through the fruits of Holmes\u2019 unethical conduct.\u201d Citing <em>Quest Diagnostics, </em>734 F.3d at 167, the district court noted that its dismissal of the complaint was further justified by the fact that neither the United States, as the real party in interest, nor any other relator was foreclosed from bringing the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">District courts are afforded discretion in penalizing ethical violations, including disqualifying a relator and dismissing his suit in a qui tam action, <em>see id. </em>at 165-69 (affirming the disqualification of relator and the dismissal of the complaint in qui tam suit for ethical violations); <em>Salmeron, </em>579 F.3d at 798 (similar), and Holmes has failed to raise any competent argument as to how the district court abused its discretion here. In his briefing before the district court, Holmes challenged his disqualification largely based on his assertion that ethics rules and confidentiality duties are inapplicable in FCA cases. He now acknowledges on appeal that he is obligated to abide by his ethical obligations as a lawyer \u2014 even in FCA cases \u2014 and that he was and is bound by the terms of the Protective Order.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">In addition to conceding these points of law, his brief on appeal fails to muster a cognizable argument to bolster his position, as it lacks any meaningful citation to legal authority,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and contains only sparse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>reference to the record on appeal.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This failure is inexcusable given that Holmes is an experienced attorney and has already been warmed by the district court in this litigation about his failure to properly brief matters.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We therefore decline the invitation to dig through Holmes\u2019 bald assertions and marshal an argument on his behalf; as we have previously stated, \u201c[j]udges are not like pigs, hunting for truffles buried in briefs.\u201d <em>de la O v. Hous. Auth. of City of El Paso, </em>417 F.3d 495, 501 (5th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>United States v. Dunkel, </em>927 F.2d 955, 956 (7th Cir.1991)).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Holmes\u2019 remaining argument on appeal is that the district court did not afford him an evidentiary hearing on NGC\u2019s disqualification motion; however, Holmes did not raise any evidentiary issues before the district court and there is no indication that he ever requested an evidentiary hearing on the disqualification motion. And, sure enough, he fails to cite any legal authority on appeal supporting the position that he is entitled to a hearing. We therefore find no reason to conclude that the district court abused its discretion in not holding an evidentiary hearing on NGC\u2019s motion to disqualify. <em>See In re Eckstein Marine Serv. L.L.C., </em>672 F.3d 310, 319 (5th Cir.2012) (stating that a district court\u2019s denial of an evidentiary hearing is reviewed for abuse of discretion); <em>see also United States v. Skilling, </em>554 F.3d 529, 568 n. 63 (5th Cir.2009), <em>aff'd in part, vacated in part on other grounds, </em>561 U.S. 358, 130 S.Ct. 2896, 177 L.Ed.2d 619 (2010) (holding that appellant waived his argument that he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing because the appellant failed to brief the following issues: \u201cWhen is a district court obligated to hold an evidentiary hearing? What is the standard of review? Are there any relevant Fifth Circuit cases?\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b401-11\">Given Holmes\u2019 failure to challenge the district court\u2019s careful and well-reasoned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>opinion in any meaningful way, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b396-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b397-10\">. For simplicity purposes, we will refer to NGC and its subsidiaries as \"NGC\u201d with the exception of one NGC\u2019s subsidiaries, Northrop Grunman Risk Management, Inc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b398-7\">. The district court explained that these rules apply because: (1) much of Holmes\u2019 conduct occurred while the case was pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, (2) the Mississippi Rules of Professional Conduct apply to litigants practicing in federal court in Mississippi, and (3) the Fifth Circuit recognizes the ABA Model Rules as the national standard for professional conduct. <em>See U.S. ex rel. Holmes v. Northrop Grumman Corp., </em>No. 1:13CV85-HSO-RHW, 2015 WL 3504525, at *4 (S.D.Miss. June 3, 2015), There is no material difference for purposes of this case between the three sets of rules, and therefore our discussion centers on the ABA Model Rules, as they are the \"national standards utilized by this circuit in ruling on disqualification motions.\u201d <em>In re Am. Airlines, Inc., </em>972 F.2d 605, 610 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b399-6\">. Holmes argues that the qui tam action was a litigation tactic to force settlement in the London Arbitration and that he received informed consent from Munich Re to pursue his claim. Oddly, in support of the proposition that he disclosed conflicts issues with his client, Holmes cites to a filing by the Government in which the Government expressed serious \"ethical and professional responsibility concerns\u201d with Holmes\u2019 conduct, including \"a potential conflict between [Holmes'] claims in this qui tam action and those of [his] insurance company client[, Munich Re,] in its arbitration with NGC.\u201d The Government further stated that its communications with Munich Re did not assuage these concerns. The other evidence that Holmes cites for this claim is limited, and indicates that he represented to Munich Re that he was legally required to bring his qui tam suit (which he was not) and that there is no attorney-client privilege issue (which the district court did not raise).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b399-7\">. In fact, Holmes filed a motion with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to correct his violation of the Protective Order. In particular, he asked the court for a modification of the Order to allow him to use the protected documents in the qui tam suit and to sanction him in the amount of $1,000 for his violation. The district court denied the motion, finding \"no reason \u2014 let alone good cause \u2014 to change the terms of the original protective order.\u201d <em>Munchener Ruckversicherungs-Gesellschaft Aktiengesellschaft in Munchen v. Northrop Grumman Risk Mgmt. Inc., </em>No. 10-551(JEB), 2015 WL 8483241, at *6 (D.D.C. Dec. 9, 2015),.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b399-11\">.The district court similarly found that Holmes\u2019 disclosures included Munich Re\u2019s confidential information \u2014 obtained during.the course of his representation \u2014 in violation of his duty of confidentiality. <em>See </em>ABA Model Rule 1.6(a) (\"A lawyer shall not reveal information relating to the representation of a client unless the client gives informed consent. ...\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b400-5\"><em>. </em>Holmes claims that he was \"extremely candid\u201d with the court \"about documents, where they came from, and the fact that he needed further guidance from the District Court as to how to deal with them.\u201d In support he cites filings made with the district court in the qui lam suit. This argument is, at best, misguided: he violated his duty of candor to the court in the Protective Order Litigation in an apparent effort to gain access to the relevant documents \u2014 his disclosures in the qui tam suit are therefore irrelevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b400-6\">. <em>See Quest Diagnostics Inc., </em>734 F.3d at 163 (citing <em>Bates v.

Holmes is an experienced lawyer, having spent over forty-seven years as a practicing attorney, including as a partner in one of this countiy's largest law firms. The district court therefore warned Holmes that, although he is appearing <em>pro se, </em>he \"is not automatically subject to the very liberal standards afforded to a non-attorney <em>pro se </em>plaintiff because an attorney is presumed to have a knowledge of the legal system and need less protections from the court.\u201d <em>See Richards v.

Later, the district court issued an Order on Miscellaneous Relief, admonishing Holmes and stating; \"in what appears to be a recurring practice of the relators in this case, they cite no case law, statute, or other legal authority indicating this Court\u2019s power to grant such relief, nor does the Court discern any legal basis for doing so.\u201d The court then specifically ordered that \"the relators shall refrain from filing any further motions in this case without citations to supporting legal authority.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b401-13\"><em>.
