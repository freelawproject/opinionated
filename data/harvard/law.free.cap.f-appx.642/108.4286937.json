As the appeal does not present a substantial question, we will summarily affirm the decision of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-11\">Petrucelli initiated this \u00a7 1983 action in 2014 against Kristin Rusin, the court reporter during a number of Petrucelli\u2019s criminal hearings in the Southern District of New York, where Petrucelli was sentenced to life in prison in 2003 on murder and racketeering charges. Petrucelli alleges that Rusin altered, destroyed, or incompletely transcribed audio recordings from his hearings, depriving him the ability to raise certain issues on appeal. Pe-trucelli filed this action in the Middle District of Pennsylvania, where he is currently incarcerated at FCI-Allenwood. Rusin, who currently resides in Nevada and claims to have no contacts with Middle District of Pennsylvania, filed a motion. to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction on March 17, 2015. On October 19, 2015 the Magistrate Judge recommended that Rusin\u2019s motion be granted, and in a November 19, 2015 order, the District Court adopted the Report and Recommendation in full, over Petrucelli\u2019s objections, and directed the Clerk to close the case. Petrucelli filed a timely notice of appeal from this order on December 9, 2015. Our Clerk advised Pe-trucelli that his appeal faced dismissal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915 or summary action and invited him to file a response. He has done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-16\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. \u2018We review a district court\u2019s decision that it possesses or lacks personal jurisdiction <em>de novo </em>[but review] factual findings ... for clear error.\u201d <em>Telcordia Tech Inc. v. Telkom SA Ltd., </em>458 F.3d 172, 176 (3d. Cir.2006). We may summarily affirm the District Court where \u201cit clearly appears that no substantial question is presented or that subsequent precedent or a change in circumstances warrants such action.\u201d 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-17\">When a defendant challenges a court\u2019s exercise of personal jurisdiction in a 12(b)(2) motion, the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing personal jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence and must do so by \u201cestablishing with reasonable particularity sufficient contacts between the defendant and the forum state.\u201d <em>Mellon Bank (East) PSFS, Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n v. Farino, </em>960 F.2d 1217, 1223 (3d Cir.1992) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-18\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(e) authorizes federal courts to exercise \u201cpersonal jurisdiction over non-resident defendants to the extent permissible under the law of the state where the district court sits.\u201d <em>Pennzoil Prods. Co. v. Colelli &amp; Assocs., Inc., </em>149 F.3d 197, 200 (3d Cir.1998). Pennsylvania\u2019s long-arm statute permits courts to exercise personal jurisdiction over nonresident defendants \u201cto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>the fullest extent allowed under the Constitution of the United States\u201d and \u201cbased on the most minimum contact with this Commonwealth allowed under the Constitution.\u201d 42 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 5322(b). The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that a non-resident defendant have certain minimum contacts with a forum state \u2014 contacts that would provide the defendant \u201cfair warning\u201d that he might be sued there \u2014 before a federal court in that forum can constitutionally exercise personal jurisdiction over that defendant. Ke<em>hm Oil Co. v. Texaco, Inc., </em>537 F.3d 290, 299-300 (3d Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, </em>471 U.S. 462, 472, 105 S.Ct. 2174, 85 L.Ed.2d 528 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">Personal jurisdiction may be general or specific; \u201c[g]eneral jurisdiction exists when a defendant has maintained systematic and continuous contacts with the forum state.\u201d <em>Marten v. Godwin, </em>499 F.3d 290, 296 (3d Cir.2007), Specific jurisdiction, on the other hand, requires a court to conduct a three-part inquiry: \u201cFirst, the defendant must have purposefully directed [its] activiti\u00e9s at the forum. Second, the litigation must arise out of or relate to at least one of those activities. And third, if the prior two requirements are met, a court may consider whether the exercise of jurisdiction otherwise comport[s] with fair play and substantial justice,\u201d <em>O\u2019Connor v. Sandy Lane Hotel Co., Ltd., </em>496 F.3d 312, 317 (3d Cir.2007) (internal citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Here, with respect to general jurisdiction, the District Court found that the facts plead indicated that Rusin has systematic contact -with only the states of New York and Nevada \u2014 she resided in New York during Petrucelli\u2019s criminal proceedings and then relocated to Reno, Nevada. The facts indicate no contact with Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">As to specific jurisdiction, the District Court accurately observed that the complained-of conduct was directed at New York \u2014 the state of Petrucelli\u2019s criminal proceedings \u2014 and that the only connection Petrucelli\u2019s criminal proceeding has with the Middle District of Pennsylvania is that he is now, thirteen years after his conviction, serving a portion of his life sentence at FCI-Allenwood.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">We have nothing to add to the District Court\u2019s reasoning.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because it is plain that the District Court lacked personal jurisdiction over Rusin, we will summarily affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b131-12\">This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not constitute binding precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b132-6\">. We have considered Petrucelli\u2019s arguments on appeal, but are unpersuaded by them.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
