Mazda RASASY, also known as Phatsavong Rasasy, also known as Phuts, Defendant-Appellant.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b450-13\">No. 15-30583</docketnumber>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"AA1\">Summary Calendar.</p>\n<court data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b450-14\">United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b450-16\">April 1, 2016.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b450-17\">Carol Mignonne Griffing, Assistant U.S. Attorney, Brandon Bonaparte Brown, Seth David Reeg, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Shreveport, LA, for Plaintiff-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b450-18\">Betty Lee Marak, Esq., Assistant Federal Public Defender, Federal Public Defender\u2019s Office, Shreveport, LA, for Defendant-Appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b450-19\">Mazda Rasasy, Oakdale, LA, pro se.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b450-21\">Before WIENER, HIGGINSON, and COSTA, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b450-22\">PER CURIAM: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b450-23\">The Federal Public Defender appointed to represent Mazda Rasasy has moved for leave to withdraw and has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Rasasy has filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>a response. The record is not sufficiently developed to allow us to make a fair evaluation of Rasasy\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel; we therefore decline to consider the claims without prejudice to collateral review. <em>See United States v. Isgar, </em>739 F.3d 829, 841 (5th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Rasasy\u2019s response. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, the motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b450-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
