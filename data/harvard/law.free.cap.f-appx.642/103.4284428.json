As the appeal does not present a substantial question, we will summarily affirm the decision of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">Locke initiated this \u00a7 1983 action in 2012 against several prison officials from the State Correctional Institution in Dallas, Pennsylvania (\u201cSCI-Dallas\u201d), alleging that these Defendants violated his Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights when his legal and personal property were lost during his cancelled prison transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">On March 20, 2015, the District Court granted Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and directed the Clerk of Court to close the case, finding that Locke failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as required by the Prison Litigation Reform Act. On April 1, 2015, Locke filed a \u201cMotion for Enlargement of Time\u201d to appeal this order, and on April 8, 2015, the District Court granted Locke\u2019s motion, extending the deadline to file a notice of appeal until April 30, 2015. Instead of filing a notice of appeal, Locke filed on April 29, 2015 a \u201cMotion for Amendment of Judgment and or Alter and Relief from Judgment,\u201d challenging the Court\u2019s exhaustion analysis and citing Rules 59(c) and 60(b). The District Court, in an August 20, 2015 order, construed this motion as a motion for reconsideration under Rule 59(e) and dismissed it as untimely. On September 8, 2015, Locke filed a notice of appeal from this order denying reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-14\">II..</p>\n<p id=\"b126-15\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. <em>See also Long v. Atl. City Police Dep\u2019t, </em>670 F.3d 436, 446 n. 19 (3d Cir.2012) (Observing that this Court has jurisdiction over \u201ca timely appealed order disposing of an untimely motion for reconsideration.\u201d). Locke\u2019s notice of appeal is timely as to the order denying his motion for reconsideration, but because he filed that motion more than 28 days after the District Court granted the motion for summary judgment, our review is limited to the District Court\u2019s dismissal of the motion for reconsideration. Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4); <em>Long, </em>670 F.3d at 446 n. 19. We review this order for abuse of discretion. <em>Lazaridis v. Wehmer, </em>591 F.3d 666, 669 (3d Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-16\">We need not decide whether Locke\u2019s motion properly falls under Rules 59 or 60 because it fails either way. To the extent it is a Rule 59 motion, the District Court correctly dismissed it as untimely. To the extent it is a 60(b) motion, the only section that could arguably apply is 60(b)(6), which requires extraordinary circumstances that are not present here. <em>Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>545 U.S. 524, 535, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005) (\u201c[0]ur cases have re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>quired a movant seeking relief under Rule 60(b)(6) to show \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 justifying the reopening of a final judgment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Accordingly, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b126-11\"> This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not constitute binding precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
