Robertson, Louisiana prisoner # 92760, appeals the dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint, which the district court dismissed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) as frivolous and for failure to state a claim. Robertson argues that the Allen Correctional Center (ACC) medical staff violated his Eighth Amendment rights by being deliberately indifferent to his medical needs when he contracted a staph infection. He has also filed a motion for the appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-24\">An action may be dismissed if it is frivolous or malicious or fails to state a claim. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae, (ii). This court will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>apply the de novo standard of review. <em>See Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">Robertson makes no argument challenging the district court\u2019s determination that the ACC, the sole defendant named by Robertson, is not a juridical entity that is amenable to suit. He has thus abandoned this issue. <em>See United States v. Scroggins, </em>599 F.3d 433, 446-47 (5th Cir.2010); <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Moreover, even if Robertson had sued a proper defendant, he fails to state a claim that ACC officials and medical staff acted with the requisite level of subjective intent to cause harm, as his disagreement with the medical care that he received does not rise to the level of a deliberate indifference claim. <em>See Domino v. Texas Dep\u2019t of Crim. Justice, </em>239 F.3d 752, 756 (5th Cir.2001); <em>McCormick v. Stalder, </em>105 F.3d 1059, 1061 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">This appeal is frivolous and is therefore DISMISSED. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th CiR. R. 42.2. The district court\u2019s dismissal and the dismissal of this appeal count as two strikes for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Coleman v. Tollefson, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 1759, 1761-63, 191 L.Ed.2d 803 (2015); <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996), Robertson is WARNED that if he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed in forma pau-peris in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g). Robertson\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b359-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
