For the reasons that follow, we will summarily affirm the judgment of the District Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-25\">On December 10, 2014, Shipman filed a complaint against his son\u2019s mother in Dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>trict Court pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Shipman asked the District Court to review and vacate a November 25, 2014 order of the Delaware Supreme Court affirming a Delaware Family Court decision that granted by default judgment custody of his son to his son\u2019s mother. Shipman alleged that the Family Court lacked jurisdiction and failed to follow state law and procedures. He claimed that the state court orders violate his rights to due process and equal protection and his rights under the Fourth Amendment. Shipman also moved to recuse the District Judge assigned to his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">The District Court dismissed the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). The District Court explained that the Rooker-Feldman<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> doctrine barred review of the Delaware state court decisions, that the Court must abstain to the extent the guardianship action remained pending in state court, and that, while the parties were presumably citizens of different states, the domestic relations exception to diversity jurisdiction applied. The District Court also denied Shipman\u2019s motion for recusal. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our standard of review of the order of dismissal is plenary. <em>Tourscher v. McCullough, </em>184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir.1999). We review the denial of the recusal motion for abuse of discretion. <em>Jones v. Pittsburgh Nat\u2019l Corp., </em>899 F.2d 1350, 1356 (3d Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">We agree with the District Court that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain Shipman\u2019s complaint under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, which established that federal district courts lack jurisdiction over suits that are essentially appeals from state-court judgments. <em>Great Western Mining &amp; Mineral Co. v. Fox Rothschild LLP, </em>615 F.3d 159, 165 (3d Cir.2010). \u201c[Tjhere are four requirements that must be met for the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine to apply: (1) the federal plaintiff lost in state court; (2) the plaintiff \u2018complaints] of injuries caused by [the] state-court judgments\u2019; (3) those judgments were rendered before the federal suit was filed; and (4) the plaintiff is inviting the district court to review and reject the state judgments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 166 (quoting <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 284, 125 S.Ct 1517, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-11\">These requirements are squarely met here. Shipman lost in state court when the Delaware Supreme Court upheld the Family Court\u2019s custody order. The state court judgments were rendered before he filed his complaint in District Court. As noted above, Shipman asks the District Court to vacate the state court decisions for lack of jurisdiction and failure to follow state law and procedures. To the extent Shipman claims violations of his rights to due process and equal protection and his Fourth Amendment rights, these claims stem from the state court decisions. <em>See id. </em>at 166-67 (federal court lacks jurisdiction when the source of the injury is the state court judgment as opposed to the defendant\u2019s actions).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because we conclude that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine applies, we need not address the other reasons advanced by the District Court in dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-12\">We also conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>Shipman\u2019s motion for recusal. Shipman sought recusal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a) based on the District Judge\u2019s adverse rulings in his other cases. As recognized by the District Court, \u201cjudicial rulings alone almost never constitute a valid basis for a bias or partiality motion.\u201d <em>Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994). To the extent Shipman contends that the District Judge formed opinions based on events occurring in his other proceedings, he has not shown a \u201cdeep-seated favoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment impossible.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Accordingly, because this appeal does not raise a substantial question, we will summarily affirm the judgment of the District Court. Shipman\u2019s motion to stay his appeal is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b107-8\"> This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not constitute binding precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b107-26\">. This appeal was previously dismissed for failure to pay the filing fee. We grant Ship-man\u2019s motion to reopen his appeal and motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b108-7\">. <em>Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923); <em>District of Columbia Court of Appeals v.

Shipman also asserted in his complaint that a constitutional challenge to a state statutory scheme is cognizable under \u00a7 1983, but he did not bring such a challenge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
