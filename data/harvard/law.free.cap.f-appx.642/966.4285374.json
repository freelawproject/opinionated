Mr. Perez-Prado, who pled guilty to one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), raises two issues on appeal. First, he argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Second, he contends that his 2011 marijuana possession conviction is not a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d under the Sentencing Guidelines. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-22\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b988-23\">On July 2, 2013, two police officers approached Mr. Perez-Prado and asked to question him following a suspicious vehicle transaction. Upon his consent to questioning, one of the officers asked Mr. Perez-Prado about an object he had just placed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>into his waistband. Mr. Perez-Prado admitted that it was a firearm, and the officers recovered a .25 caliber Berretta, loaded with seven rounds of ammunition, and two additional loaded magazines from his person.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">In December of 2013, Mr. Perez-Prado pled guilty without a plea agreement to being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Based on a total offense level of 20 and a criminal history category of VI, the probation officer calculated Mr. Perez-Prado\u2019s advisory guideline range to be 70 to 87 months in prison. <em>See </em>PSI at \u00b6 76; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A). The probation officer did not recommend a three-level downward adjustment for timely acceptance of responsibility because Mr. Perez-Prado tested positive for cocaine and was re-arrested for possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia while he was out on bond. <em>See id. </em>at \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">At his first sentencing hearing, held in February of 2014, Mr. Perez-Prado objected to the base offense level of 20, arguing that his conviction for marijuana possession was not a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d under the Guidelines. The district court sustained his objection and reduced the base offense level to 14, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(6). This resulted in a new advisory guideline range of 37 to 46 months. The court, however, imposed a 48-month sentence, reasoning that the upward variance of two months was reasonable because of Mr. Perez-Prado\u2019s high potential for violence, need for incarceration, and mental illness, as well as the benefits he might receive from a structured environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-7\">The government appealed his 48-month sentence and argued that the district court had erred in concluding that Mr. Perez-Prado\u2019s conviction for possession with intent to sell or deliver marijuana in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(1) was not a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d under the Guidelines. We ruled in favor of the government and remanded the case for re-sentencing on March 9, 2015. <em>See United States v. Perez-Prado, </em>598 Fed.Appx. 739, 740 (11th Cir.2015). In light of our determination that his 2011 offense qualified as a \u201ccontrolled substance offense,\u201d the advisory guideline range increased to 70 to 87 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-10\">At re-sentencing in June of 2015, the government requested a 70-month sentence and Mr. Perez-Prado asked for a downward variance to 60 months. After considering the statements of the parties, the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and the advisory guideline range, the district court decided not to vary and imposed a mi-drange sentence of 76 months\u2019 imprisonment followed by three years of supervised release with special conditions, including treatment for mental health, substance abuse, anger control, and domestic violence. Mr. Perez-Prado now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b989-12\">We review the reasonableness of sentences under a deferential abuse of discretion standard of review. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We first consider procedural unreasonableness and then determine whether the sentence was substantively reasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b989-13\">We will vacate a sentence only if \u201cwe \u2018are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en </em>banc). The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of showing that it is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3558(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">A. district court \u201cshall impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in \u00a7 3553(a), including the need \u201cto afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant [and] to provide the defendant with needed ... correctional treatment in the most effective manner.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B)-(D). Additional factors include \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant ... [and] ... the applicable category of offense committed by the applicable category of defendant as set forth in the guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (4)(A). The weight given to any specific factor is committed to the discretion of the district court. <em>See United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007). Furthermore, a district court does not commit reversible error simply because it attaches great weight to a single factor, but \u201c[a] district court\u2019s unjustified reliance on a single \u00a7 3553(a) factor may be a \u2018symptom\u2019 of an unreasonable sentence.\u201d <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">Here, the district court explicitly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and determined that a midrange sentence within the applicable advisory guideline range of 70 to 87 months was warranted. On appeal, Mr. Perez-Prado contends that the court discounted his tragic life, the substantial history of his mental health illness, and his lack of literacy, skills, and education. This argument, however, is not supported by the record. At re-sentencing, Mr. Perez-Prado conceded that his criminal history was significant, and the district court noted that he would receive some psychiatric therapy and his original medication while incarcerated. In its discussion of supervised release, the court also imposed special conditions to address Mr. Perez-Prado\u2019s need for mental health and substance abuse treatment. The court was not unsympathetic to Mr. Perez-Prado\u2019s concerns; rather, it was asked to balance his demonstrated history of being a danger to the community with his need for structure, incarceration, and mental health treatment where mental health facilities are no longer a viable option.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-7\">Mr. Perez-Prado also argues that the district court misapplied the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by focusing only on the need to protect the public from further crimes. Although the court did highlight his criminal history and the danger he posed to the community in choosing to impose a mi-drange sentence, reference to a single factor is not enough to establish unreasonableness. <em>See Williams, </em>526 F.3d at 1322. In any event, the court evaluated several other statutory factors, including Mr. Perez-Prado\u2019s mental health history and characteristics, the need to deter further criminal conduct, his need for correctional treatment and structure, and the applicable category of the offense committed. Finally, the 76-month sentence here is well below the statutory maximum of ten years and falls in the midrange of the advisory guidelines \u2014 both of these facts indicate reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir.2005) (comparing actual prison term imposed to twenty-year statutory maximum). <em>See also United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005) ([Although \u201cwe do not automatically presume a sentence within the guidelines range is reasonable, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>we \u2018ordinarily ... expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">Mr. Perez-Prado has not demonstrated that his sentence was substantively unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. We therefore conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a 76-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b991-7\">Mr. Perez-Prado also maintains that, at re-sentencing, the district court erroneously classified his prior conviction for possession with intent to sell or deliver marijuana as a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 4B1.2(b). His claim is foreclosed by both the law of the ease and binding precedent. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>775 F.3d 1262, 1268 (11th Cir.2014) (finding that a conviction under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(1) constitutes a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d as defined in \u00a7 4B1.2(b) of the Guidelines). Mr. Perez-Prado raises this issue only to preserve it for any future review.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b991-9\">We affirm Mr. Perez-Prado\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"AUZ\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b989-8\">. Mr. Perez-Prado does not argue that his sentence was procedurally unreasonable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
