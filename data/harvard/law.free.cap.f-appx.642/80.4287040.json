We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s order. <em>See Allah v. Seiverling, </em>229 F.3d 220, 228 (3d Cir.2000). For the reasons set forth below, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-22\">In 1992, Brookins was convicted in Pennsylvania state court of first-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. In 2014, he instituted an action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 in the District Court. He alleged, essentially, that the police officers and district attorneys involved in his case had ignored evidence that inculpated a different suspect and instead prosecuted him despite his innocence. Although he does little to identify discrete causes of action, construing his allegations generously, we understand him to present claims of false arrest, use of excessive force during arrest and interrogation, malicious prosecution, a violation of his rights under <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), and a due-process violation. He also purported to raise a state-law claim of obstruction of justice under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 5101. He requested a variety of declaratory and injunctive relief, including orders requiring the police to investigate his suggested suspect and to test a pair of gloves for DNA.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-23\">The District Court dismissed Brookins\u2019s action, concluding that his federal claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>were time-barred and that no civil cause of action exists under Pennsylvania for obstruction of justice. Brookins filed a timely notice of appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">We agree with the District Court\u2019s disposition of this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Brookins has not claimed that his state conviction has been set aside.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore, his claims are barred to the extent that success on the merits would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction. <em>See Wilkinson v. Dotson, </em>544 U.S. 74, 81-82, 125 S.Ct. 1242, 161 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005); <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). This includes his claims alleging malicious prosecution, <em>see Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 484-85, 114 S.Ct. 2364; <em>Kossler v. Crisanti, </em>564 F.3d 181, 186-87 (3d Cir.2009) (en 'banc), and a <em>Brady </em>violation, <em>see Skinner v. Switzer, </em>562 U.S. 521, 536, 131 S.Ct. 1289, 179 L.Ed.2d 233 (2011); <em>Amaker v. Weiner, </em>179 F.3d 48, 51 (2d Cir.1999).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We note, however, that these claims are properly dismissed <em>without </em>prejudice, and we modify the District Court\u2019s order accordingly. <em>See, e.g., Fottler v. United States, </em>73 F.3d 1064, 1065-66 (10th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Brookins\u2019s remaining claims \u2014 that the defendants falsely arrested him, used excessive force against him, and violated his due-process rights by refusing to test evidence for DNA \u2014 are not barred by <em>Heck. See Montgomery v. De Simone, </em>159 F.3d 120, 126 n. 5 (3d Cir.1998) (false arrest); <em>Lora-Pena v. FBI, </em>529 F.3d 503, 506 (3d Cir.2008) (excessive force during arrest); <em>Jackson v. Suffolk Cty. Homicide Bureau, </em>135 F.3d 254, 257 (2d Cir.1998) (excessive force after arrest); <em>Skinner, </em>562 U.S. at 534, 131 S.Ct. 1289 (DNA testing). They are, however, untimely. In Pennsylvania, the statute of limitations for claims under \u00a7 1983 is two years. <em>See Kach v. Hose, </em>589 F.3d 626, 634 (3d Cir.2009). Brookins\u2019s false-imprisonment claim accrued when he became held pursuant to legal process, <em>see Wallace v. Koto, </em>549 U.S. 384, 389-90, 127 S.Ct. 1091, 166 L.Ed.2d 973 (2007), which occurred in 1991. His claims concerning the officers\u2019 use of force accrued when he (allegedly) suffered his injuries in 1991. <em>See Each, </em>589 F.3d at 634-35; <em>Montgomery, </em>159 F.3d at 126. Finally, his challenge to the Government\u2019s failure to test evidence for DNA accrued, at the latest, when the state court denied his request for testing on April 28, 2011. <em>See Savory v. Lyons, </em>469 F.3d 667, 672-73 (7th Cir.2006). He filed his complaint in this case in January 20l4, well after the expiration of the two-year limitations period for each of these claims. He has offered no basis to toll the statute of limitations as to any of these claims, and the District Court therefore properly concluded that they were untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-12\">Finally, the District Court correctly ruled that Brookins is not entitled to maintain a civil claim under 18 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 5101, Pennsylvania\u2019s criminal obstruction-of-justice statute. <em>See D\u2019Errico v. DeFazio, </em>763 A.2d 424, 430 (Pa.Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>per.Ct.2000); <em>Pelagatti v. Cohen, </em>370 Pa.Super. 422, 536 A.2d 1337, 1342 (1987).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">Accordingly, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b102-18\">This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not constitute binding precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b103-7\">. We may affirm on any ground apparent in the record. <em>See, e.g., Hughes v. Long, </em>242 F.3d 121, 122 n. 1 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b103-8\">. Brookins has filed a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 in the District Court, which . remains pending. <em>See </em>E.Q. Pa. Civ. A. No. 2:14-cv-2645.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b103-10\">. In connection with these claims, Brookins asked for an order requiring the police to investigate the individual that he believes committed the murder. However, \"[t]here is no statutory or common law right, much less a constitutional right, to an investigation.\u201d <em>Mitchell v. McNeil, </em>487 F.3d 374, 378 (6th Cir.2007); <em>see also Capogrosso v. Supreme Court of N.J., </em>588 F.3d 180, 184 (3d Cir.2009) (\"individual citizens do not have a constitutional right to the prosecution of alleged criminals\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b104-16\">. Given the legal failings of Brookins\u2019s complaint, we are satisfied that amendment to the complaint would be futile, and therefore conclude that the District Court properly dismissed the complaint without providing leave to amend. <em>See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., </em>293 F.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
