KG, a German corporation and manufacturer of kitchen fixtures and accessories, brought a trademark infringement lawsuit against Vito Antonio Laera and two corporations of which he was president (collectively \u201cLaera\u201d). The parties ultimately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>reached a settlement and, in April 2013, jointly filed a stipulation of dismissal and a request for the court to enter a final judgment. Based on those filings, the district court entered a consent judgment, which set forth the parties\u2019 respective duties and obligations, provided for various remedies in the event of a breach, and stated that the district court retained jurisdiction to ensure the parties\u2019 compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">Soon after the ink dried on that judgment, Laera violated it blatantly, egregiously, and repeatedly. When Blanco discovered those violations, it filed two motions to hold Laera in contempt. The district court did so, and we affirmed. <em>See Blanco GmbH + Co. KG v. Laera, </em>620 Fed.Appx. 718 (11th Cir.2015). In the interim, Blanco filed two additional motions to hold Laera in contempt because of new violations. It also moved for attorney\u2019s fees and sanctions. Laera responded with five motions to hold Blanco in contempt and a motion for an injunction against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">The magistrate judge issued a report that recommended granting all of Blanco\u2019s motions and denying all of Laera\u2019s. The report provided the parties with fourteen days to file objections. On the deadline for filing objections, Laera filed twenty-nine pages of objections, which exceeded the twenty-page limit mandated by local rules, without seeking the court\u2019s permission to do so. The district court struck Laera\u2019s objections for that reason but provided him with an additional fourteen days to file new objections that complied with the page limits. On the deadline for refiling his objections, Laera instead filed a motion for leave to file a twenty-nine page objection, which the district court denied. Laera never filed objections that complied with the local rules. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation. Thereafter, Blanco moved for entry of judgment. The district court granted that motion and directed the clerk to enter judgment in favor of Blanco. This is Laera\u2019s <em>pro se </em>appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-9\">As we construe his notice of appeal, Laera appeals the district court\u2019s order adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He first contends that the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction, arguing that \u201cthe court ha[d] no jurisdiction to hold [him] in civil contempt.\u201d That argument fails. District courts have original jurisdiction over civil actions arising under an act of Congress relating to trademarks, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338, and Blanco\u2019s complaint stated claims under federal trademark law.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>Laera next contends that the district court erred by failing to consider his objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, and that the district court clearly erred in its factfinding. When a party fails to object to the findings of fact in a magistrate judge\u2019s report, \u201cthose findings are adopted by the district court and the party may not challenge them on appeal in the absence of plain error or manifest injustice.\u201d <em>Resolution Trust Corp. v. Hallmark Builders, Inc., </em>996 F.2d 1144, 1149 (11th Cir.1998). Despite having two opportunities to do so, Laera failed to timely file objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report that complied with the local rules regarding page limits. Although he is entitled to some leeway as a <em>pro se </em>litigant, Laera is not exempt from the requirements of procedural rules. <em>See Moton v. Cowart, </em>631 F.3d 1337, 1340 n. 2 (11th Cir.2011). Because he failed to timely object to the magistrate judge\u2019s factfind-ings in a document meeting the requirements of the local rules and has not shown plain error or manifest injustice, Laera cannot now challenge those factfindings on appeal. <em>Resolution Trust Corp., </em>996 F.2d at 1149.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">Finally, Laera contends that Blan-co failed to show that he acted in contempt because it did not establish that the consent judgment was \u201cvalid and lawful.\u201d Putting aside the fact that we already upheld the validity of the consent judgment in Laera\u2019s previous appeal, <em>see Blanco GmbH + Co. KG, </em>620 Fed.Appx. at 725-26, we adhere to the general rule that \u201ca party normally has no standing to appeal a judgment to which he or she consented,\u201d <em>Reynolds v. Roberts, </em>202 F.3d 1303, 1312 (11th Cir.2000) (quotation marks omitted). Because Laera consented to the consent judgment, he cannot now challenge its validity on appeal. And while he asserts that the district court \u201cexpanded [the consent judgment] beyond the meaning of its terms,\u201d he fails to explain how it did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">Laera makes various conclusory allegations that several judges involved in this case violated his due process rights as well as the Code of Judicial Conduct. Aside from baldly asserting those violations, however, he has \u201cfail[ed] to elaborate or provide any citation of authority in support of [his] allegation[s].\u201d <em>Flanigan\u2019s Enters., Inc. v. Fulton County, </em>242 F.3d 976, 987 n. 16 (11th Cir.2001). He has therefore waived those arguments. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b958-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b957-7\">. Laera filed his notice of appeal on February 18, 2015. It identified only the district court\u2019s order granting Blanco\u2019s motion for entry of judgment. In his initial appellate brief, however, Laera purports to appeal a host of orders and other court actions, including an order that was issued in 2013, the consent judgment, the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, and \"[a]U motions/orders/matters [sic] in this case, including any and all pending motions or future motions....\u2019\u2019 Although we liberally construe a pro se defendant\u2019s pleadings, \u201cwe nevertheless have required them to conform to procedural rules.\u201d <em>Moton </em>v. <em>Cowart, </em>631 F.3d 1337, 1340 n. 2 (11th Cir.2011) (quotation marks omitted). We will therefore not review any orders or judgments that were not specified in Laera's notice of appeal. <em>See Osterneck v. E.T. Barwick Industries, Inc., </em>825 F.2d 1521, 1528 (11th Cir.1987) (\u201c[A]n appellate court has jurisdiction to review only those judgments, orders or portions thereof which are specified in an appellant\u2019s notice of appeal.\u201d). Even if he had specified them, we would not consider his untimely appeal of orders or judgments from 2013. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. (4)(a)(l)(A) (\"In a civil case ... the notice of appeal ... must be filed with the district court within 30 days after the entry of the judgment or order appealed from.\u201d); <em>Green v. Drug Enf't Admin., </em>606 F.3d 1296, 1300 (11th Cir.2010) (\"The timely filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case is a jurisdictional requirement.\u201d) (quotation marks and alteration omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
