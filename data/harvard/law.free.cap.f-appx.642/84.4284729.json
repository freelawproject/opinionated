We will grant the Appellees\u2019 Motion for Summary Affirmance, as we agree that no substantial question is raised by Bush\u2019s appeal. <em>See </em>Third Circuit LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-22\">On June 24, 2015, we affirmed the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Bush\u2019s complaint for failing to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. <em>See </em>C.A. No. 14-4377. About a month later, Bush 'filed a motion in the District Court requesting permission to refile his complaint. When the District Court denied the motion, Bush filed a motion for reconsideration. The District Court denied that motion, and also denied Bush\u2019s subsequent motion for reconsideration. Bush appealed, and his appeal is timely as to each of the three orders he asks us to review. <em>See </em>Fed. RApp. P. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-23\">On appeal, Bush argues primarily that he should be allowed to refile his complaint and relitigate the matter because he was not afforded discovery before the District Court dismissed the complaint. He argues that the Defendants were required to automatically disclose certain information to him, pursuant to Rule 26 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>But as Appellees note, Bush was not entitled to discovery because he had not cured the legal insufficiency of his complaint. <em>See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 686, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (\u201cBecause respondent\u2019s complaint is deficient under Rule 8, he is not entitled to discovery.\u201d); <em>see also Chudasama v. Mazda Motor Corp., </em>123 F.3d 1353, 1367 (11th Cir.1997) (facial challenges to legal sufficiency, such as motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim, should be resolved before discovery begins); <em>Rutman Wine Co. v. E. &amp; J. Gallo Winery, </em>829 F.2d 729, 738 (9th Cir.1987) (\u201cThe purpose of [Fed. R.Civ.P.] 12(b)(6) is to enable defendants to challenge the legal sufficiency of complaints without subjecting themselves to discovery.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">In short, we have already reviewed and affirmed the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Bush\u2019s complaint. Bush\u2019s post-decision motion to refile, which could generously be construed as a motion to reopen, did not present any extraordinary circumstances that required the District Court to reopen proceedings. <em>See Reform Party of Allegheny Cty. v. Allegheny Cty. Dep\u2019t of Elections, </em>174 F.3d 305, 311-12 (3d Cir.1999) (Rule 60(b)(6) relief available only in extraordinary circumstances; Rule 60(b)(6) may not be used as substitute for appeal). We thus affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of that motion, and the denial of Bush\u2019s subsequent motions for reconsideration.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b106-15\"> This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not constitute binding precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b107-7\">.
