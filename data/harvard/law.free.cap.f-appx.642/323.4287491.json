HIGGINSON, Circuit Judge: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">A jury found Henry Gill guilty of one count of conspiracy to transport undocumented aliens for financial gain, in violation 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(ii) and (v)(I), and three counts of transporting illegal aliens for financial gain, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii) and (v)(II). The district court sentenced Gill to 37 months of imprisonment on each count, to be served concurrently. Gill appeals both his convictions and his sentence, arguing (1) that he was entitled to a mistrial due to improper statements by the prosecutor and (2) that the district court erred in applying the \u201cspecial skill\u201d enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3 based on Gill\u2019s commercial driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">Gill first challenges his conviction. He argues that the magistrate judge (who conducted voir dire) and the district court (who conducted the trial) abused their discretion by not granting his motions for \u201cmistrial.\u201d Gill moved for \u201cmistrial\u201d twice: first, during voir dire, after the prosecutor commented that three of Gill\u2019s codefen-dants had pled guilty, and again during trial, after the prosecutor asked Gill\u2019s testifying codefendant about the codefen-dant\u2019s own guilty plea. \u201cProsecutorial misconduct, including impermissible statements during jury voir, dire, is analyzed in two steps: (1) whether the prosecutor made an improper remark; and (2) whether the prosecutor's remarks prejudiced the defendant\u2019s substantive rights by casting serious doubt on the correctness of the jury verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Jefferson, </em>432 Fed.Appx. 382, 388 (5th Cir.2011) (unpublished). Here, during voir dire, the prosecutor told the jury panel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-16\">Now, in this case, there was four co-conspirators charged with this crime, three have pled guilty, we have one remaining. He is presumed innocent right now in this court. You will hear Jury Instructions regarding co-conspirators in the Jury Charge. You can follow those Instructions, right?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-17\">Gill moved for a \u201cmistrial,\u201d arguing that even if the magistrate judge tried to give a curative instruction, \u201conce that bell was run, we can\u2019t un-ring it.\u201d \u2022 After the panel was seated, he moved to \u201cquash\u201d the panel and for the panel to be dismissed and replaced with a new panel. The government concedes that the remark about the codefendants\u2019 guilty pleas, at least as to the two codefendants who did not testify, was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-18\">When a remark is improper, then we decide, under an abuse of discretion standard, \u201cwhether the remark affected the substantial rights of the defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. McCann, </em>613 F.3d 486, 494 (5th Cir.2010).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In making that deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>mination, we consider \u201c(1) the magnitude of the statement\u2019s prejudice, (2) the effect of any cautionary instructions given, and (3) the strength of the evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d <em>United States v. Morganfield, </em>501 F.3d 453, 467 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Here, as the government notes, the improper remark by the prosecutor during voir dire was a single \u201cisolated and inadvertent\u201d statement. The government did not repeat the statement about the nontes-tifying codefendant\u2019s pleas, nor did it later attempt to link the pleas to any of the substantive evidence introduced against Gill or to argue the pleas to the jury. <em>See United States v. Carraway, </em>108 F.3d 745, 756 (7th Cir.1997) (holding that the improper admission of codefendant guilty pleas was harmless when the court gave a cautionary instruction, \u201cthere was no fanfare when the pleas were admitted, ... the government made no improper arguments based on th[e] pleas,\u201d and the evidence of guilt was overwhelming).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">In addition, the jury received numerous cautionary instructions. Immediately after the improper statement, the magistrate judge instructed the panel (1) that the prosecutor had been \u201cdiscussing things that may or may not happen in this case,\u201d (2) that after trial the judge would instruct the jury as to the proper treatment of particular types of testimony, and (3) that all statements by the attorneys made during voir dire were, \u201csimply arguments.\u201d Thereafter, the district court, both in its preliminary instructions before trial and in the jury charge after trial, instructed the jury that the statements of attorneys were not evidence and that Gill was presumed innocent. Moreover, in the jury charge, the district court gave a near-pattern instruction that the \u201cfact an accomplice has entered a plea of guilty is not evidence of the guilt of any other person.\u201d As we stated in <em>United States v. Ramos-Cardenas, </em>\u201c[t]he \u2018almost invariable assumption\u2019 is that jurors follow such instructions.\u201d 524 F.3d 600, 611 (5th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Richardson v. Marsh, </em>481 U.S. 200, 206, 107 S.Ct. 1702, 95 L.Ed.2d 176 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">In addition, the evidence of Gill\u2019s guilt was substantial. It included, among other things, evidence that Gill confessed to the crime, text messages from Gill\u2019s phone that corroborated his confession, and testimony from his codefendant and coconspir-ator Rivera-Bianco about Gill\u2019s role as a driver for the scheme. Thus, all three factors support that the remark during voir dire did not affect Gill\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See Morganfield, </em>501 F.3d at 467.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">Gill also argues that the district court erred by denying his motion for mistrial after the prosecutor asked Gill\u2019s testifying codefendant, Riverar-Blanco, about his own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>guilty plea. Generally, \u201cevidence about the conviction of a coconspirator is not admissible as substantive proof of the guilt of a defendant.\u201d <em>Ramos-Cardenas, </em>524 F.3d at 610. But we recognize an exception to the general rule when a coconspirator testifies. <em>Id. </em>In that circumstance, \u201ceither the government or the defense may elicit evidence of a guilty plea for the jury to consider in assessing the codefendant\u2019s credibility as a witness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Baez, </em>703 F.2d 453, 455 (10th Cir.1983)). Because Riverar-Blanco testified at Gill\u2019s trial, the prosecutor\u2019s questioning of Rivera-Bianco regarding his guilty plea was not improper and did not constitute prosecutorial misconduct. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Gill also argues that the district court erroneously applied a two-level, enhancement under \u00a7 3B1.3 because his special skill as a commercial truck driver did not significantly facilitate the commission of the offense. As the Government correctly points out, Gill did not object to the enhancement on this basis before the district court. Gill objected only that a commercial driver\u2019s license was not a \u201cspecial skill.\u201d Thus, we review this issue for plain error. <em>See United States v. McElwee, </em>646 F.3d 328, 338 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Gill relies on <em>United States v. Gallardo, </em>266 Fed.Appx. 468 (7th Cir.2008), in support of his argument that his special skill was not necessary to commit the offense because the 15 undocumented aliens could have been transported by a noncommercial driver in another type of vehicle (i.e., small cargo truck or panel van). Unlike <em>Gallardo, </em>the Government does not concede that Gill could have transported the 15 undocumented aliens in an ordinary vehicle. Moreover, as noted by the district court, Gill did not transport the undocumented aliens in the cabin of his truck. <em>See United States v. Ordonez, </em>334 Fed.Appx. 619, 624 (5th Cir.2009) (distinguishing <em>Gallardo </em>because the drugs were hidden in the truck\u2019s cabin and not the trailer). Rather, Gill directed them to the truck\u2019s trailer, which gave the appearance that he was hauling a legitimate load and made it much more difficult to identify the aliens. Given the facts of this case, the district court did not commit error, plain or otherwise, in applying the special-skills enhancement under \u00a7 3B1.3. <em>See United States v. Willett, </em>751 F.3d 335, 344 (5th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">For the forgoing reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b346-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b346-19\">. Although the government states that \u2018\u2018Gill preserved his objection and request for a mistrial as to the prosecutor\u2019s statement during jury selection,\u201d we find no indication in the record that Gill raised his objection to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>prosecutor's comment during voir dire to the district court. Although many courts, including the Supreme Court, seem to assume that a magistrate\u2019s decisions during voir dire will be subject to district court supervision, <em>see, </em>e.g., <em>Gonzalez v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 242, 251-52, 128 S.Ct. 1765, 170 L.Ed.2d 616 (2008) (stating that when a magistrate conducts voir dire, \"the district judge \u2014 insulated by life tenure and irreducible salary \u2014 is waiting in the wings, fully able to correct errors\u201d), we have not located any decision by this court that addresses the consequences of a defendant\u2019s failure to affirmatively seek the district court\u2019s review of a magistrate\u2019s adverse ruling during voir dire, Because the government does not argue the issue, and because Gill's challenge fails even under the more favorable abuse-of-discretion standard, we do not decide whether plain error review would be warranted when a defendant fails to raise with the district court a magistrate\u2019s adverse ruling during voir dire. <em>See also United States v. Cervantes, </em>706 F.3d 603, 613 (5th Cir.2013) (reviewing a magistrate\u2019s ruling during voir dire under the same abuse-of-discretion standard . applicable to district court rulings, without mention of whether the objection was raised to the district court).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
