While en route to the disturbance, officers were advised that Ceasar was attempting to fight with his girlfriend and had struck one of her family members. Several officers made contact with Ceasar near the apartment that he shared with his girlfriend, but he ignored their commands and ran away. The officers searched for Ceasar and eventually located him back at his apartment. When Ceasar refused to open the door, they broke it down and arrested him. Ceaser was then booked at the Eunice Police Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-16\">In July 2014, Ceasar filed suit against the City of Eunice in Louisiana state court. He alleged several violations of state and federal law arising out of his July 15, 2013 arrest. Appellee removed to federal court and filed a motion for summary judgment. The district court granted this motion following a short hearing. Ceasar now appeals the district court\u2019s judgment. Though we construe Ceasar\u2019s pro se brief liberally, he has abandoned many of the claims that he pressed before the district court by failing to brief them.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At best, his opening brief discusses only four claims: (1) a Fourth Amendment claim; (2) \u00e1 false arrest claim; (3) an excessive force claim; and (4) a <em>Brady </em>claim. Having independently reviewed the record, we agree with the district court that all four are meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"A6l\">Ceasar\u2019s first claim is that the police violated his rights under the Fourth Amendment by entering his apartment without a warrant. Though Ceasar is correct that the police typically need a warrant to enter a dwelling, the Supreme Court has established several exceptions to this general rule. One of these exceptions allows \u201claw enforcement officers [to] enter a home without a warrant to render emergency assistance to an injured occupant or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>to protect an occupant from imminent injury.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In this case, the officers had received a credible report of domestic violence and were entitled to enter Ceasar\u2019s apartment to protect his girlfriend \u2014 who was eight months pregnant \u2014 from potential harm.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Once inside the apartment, the officers had probable cause to arrest Cea-sar based upon this same credible report of domestic violence. Whether alleged under federal or Louisiana state law, probable cause defeats a claim of false arrest.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Ceasar next argues that the police used excessive force both during his arrest and his booking at the police station. In particular, he contends that the police unnecessarily tased him a number of times. Ceasar, however, does not dispute the officers\u2019 allegations that he actively resisted throughout the course of his arrest and booking. We agree with Appellee that the officers\u2019 actions were an appropriate response to Ceasar\u2019s \u201cescalating verbal and physical resistance.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At the very least, Ceasar has not shown that the officers\u2019 actions violated clearly established law.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Ceasar\u2019s final claim is that Appellee violated <em>Brady v. </em>Maryland<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> by withholding his girlfriend\u2019s deposition testimony. Putting aside that <em>Brady </em>does not apply in civil proceedings, the record reflects that the district court was presented with, and considered, this deposition testimony prior to entering final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b410-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b410-14\">. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). We also note that many of his remaining claims are properly alleged against the individual officers involved in his arrest, not the City of Eunice \u2014 which is the only defendant in this suit. Because any pleading error is immaterial to the result, we assume that Ceasar's claims are properly alleged.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b411-21\">. <em>Brigham City v.
