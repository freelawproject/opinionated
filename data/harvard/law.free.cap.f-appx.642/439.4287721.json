On appeal, Zavala-Acosta argues that: (1) the district court committed procedural error when it failed to articulate why it denied his request for a downward departure under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 5H1.4 based on his ankle injury; and (2) his sentence was substantively unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-22\">We engage in a bifurcated review of the sentence imposed by the district court, first considering whether the district court committed a \u201csignificant procedural error,\u201d such as \u201cfailing to adequately explain the chosen sentence\u201d and then reviewing the substantive reasonableness of the sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Zavala-Acosta concedes that our review is for plain error because he failed to object below.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007). To show plain error, Zavala-Acosta must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, we have the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b462-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Zavala-Acosta argues that the district court procedurally erred by not conducting additional fact-finding and not explaining its rationale in denying his request for a downward departure under \u00a7 5H1.4. We have jurisdiction to review a district court\u2019s refusal to depart downward \u201conly if the district court\u2019s refusal is based on the mistaken belief that the court lacked discretion to depart.\u201d <em>United States v. Garay, </em>235 F.3d 230, 232 (5th Cir.2000). \u201cThe jurisdictional bar applies even where the district court responds to a request for downward departure with a \u2018summary denial without explanation\u2019 or with an implicit denial by imposing a Guideline sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>457 F.3d 416, 424 (5th Cir.2006) (citation omitted). Zavala-Acosta does not allege, and the record does not reflect, that the district court misunderstood the scope of its discretion in considering Zavala-Acosta\u2019s motion for a downward departure under \u00a7 5H1.4. Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to hear Zavala-Acosta\u2019s claim of procedural error.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">As to Zavala-Acosta\u2019s claim that his sentence was substantively unreasonable because it failed to take his ankle injury into account, a within-guidelines sentence is presumptively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 525 (5th Cir.2008). Zavala-Acosta\u2019s ankle injury was discussed at sentencing and the district court determined that a sentence at the bottom of Zavala-Acosta\u2019s guidelines range was appropriate. There was no indication that the injury rose to the level warranting a below-guidelines sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5H1.4; <em>Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d at 526. Zavala-Acosta is essentially asking us to reweigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, but \u201cthe sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their inx port under \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008). Zavala-Acosta has not shown that his sentence was substantively unreasonable. <em>See id.; Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d at 525-26.</p>\n<p id=\"Ac8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b461-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm, R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b461-23\">. Because we hold that the district court did not err, let alone plainly err, our result would be no different if we reviewed for abuse of discretion rather than plain error.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
