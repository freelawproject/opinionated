For the reasons set forth below, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-11\">In 1998, Pittman pleaded guilty in Pennsylvania state court to third-degree murder, reckless endangerment, and carrying a firearm without a license, and he was sentenced to 26 to 59 years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See Commonwealth v. Pittman, </em>737 A.2d 272, 273 (Pa.Super.Ct.1999). After an unsuccessful appeal, Pittman filed a petition under Pennsylvania\u2019s Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), and was denied relief. Subsequently, Pittman filed several additional PCRA petitions that the PCRA court dismissed as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-15\">In 2014, Pittman filed a complaint under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 in the District Court, alleging that the PCRA\u2019s statute of limitations violates his rights under the Pennsylvania and United States Constitutions. More specifically, he alleged that (1) the General Assembly\u2019s enactment of the statute of limitations encroached on the exclusive rulemaking authority of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court; (2) Pennsylvania courts have erred as a matter of Pennsylvania law in holding that the time limitation is jurisdictional; and (3) treating the time limitation as jurisdictional \u2018 infringes his right to challenge at any time a judgment that is void because it was entered by a court that lacked jurisdiction. He named as defendants various Pennsylvania courts, individual judges and justices, the General Assembly, Philadelphia and Le-high Counties, and the Philadelphia and Pennsylvania Associations of District Attorneys. The District Court dismissed Pittman\u2019s complaint, concluding that the PCRA\u2019s one-year limitation period represented a permissible procedural bar that Pennsylvania was free to impose.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-16\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C, \u00a7 1291. We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s order dismissing Pittman\u2019s complaint, <em>see Allah v. Seiverling, </em>229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir.2000), and review its denial of the Rule 59(e) motion for abuse of discretion, <em>see Max\u2019s Seafood Cafe ex rel. Lou-Ann, Inc. v. Quinteros, </em>176 F.3d 669, 673 (3d Cir.1999). We may affirm on any ground apparent in the record. <em>See, e.g., Hughes v. Long, </em>242 F.3d 121, 122 n. 1 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>There are numerous problems with Pittman\u2019s complaint. First, to the extent that Pittman challenges his conviction or sentence, \u201chabeas corpus is the exclusive remedy for a state prisoner who challenges the fact or duration of his confinement and seeks immediate or speedier release, even though such a claim may come within the literal terms of \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 481, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Second, to the extent that Pittman challenges the state court rulings that his successive petitions were untimely under the PCRA, his claims are barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. <em>See D.C. Ct. of App. v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983); <em>Rooker v. Fid. Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923). That doctrine deprives federal courts of subject-matter jurisdiction over claims when \u201c(1) the federal plaintiff lost in state court; (2) the plaintiff \u2018complaints] of injuries caused by [the] state-court judgments\u2019; (3) those judgments were rendered before the federal suit was filed; and (4) the plaintiff is inviting the district court to review and reject the state judgments.\u201d <em>Great W. Mining &amp; Mineral Co. v. Fox Rothschild LLP, </em>615 F.3d 159, 166 (3d Cir.2010) (alterations in original) (quoting <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 284, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">While this doctrine is \u201cnarrow,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 169, it encompasses at least some aspects of Pittman\u2019s complaint. The Pennsylvania courts have deemed Pittman\u2019s PCRA petitions time-barred; he argues that he has been injured by these judgments; the judgments preceded the federal action; and he asked the District Court to overrule the state-court orders. Accordingly, Pittman\u2019s claims are barred insofar as he challenges the application of the time-bar to his case. <em>See Alvarez v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>679 F.3d 1257, 1263-64 (11th Cir.2012) (holding <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>barred an as-applied due process claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">Finally, while Pittman\u2019s broad challenge to the PCRA\u2019s statute of limitations may not be barred by <em>Rooker-Feldman, see Skinner v. Switzer, </em>562 U.S. 521, 532-33, 131 S.Ct. 1289, 179 L.Ed.2d 233 (2011), or <em>Heck, see Wilkinson v. Dotson, </em>544 U.S. 74, 82, 125 S.Ct. 1242, 161 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005), his arguments lack merit. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which provides the \u201cauthoritative\u201d interpretation of Pennsylvania law, <em>Spence v. ESAB Grp., Inc., </em>623 F.3d 212, 216 (3d Cir.2010), has rejected Pittman\u2019s claims under state law, <em>Commonwealth v. Morris, </em>565 Pa. 1, 771 A.2d 721, 737 (2001) (subsection containing PCRA\u2019s limitations period does \u201cnot fall within the exclusive procedural rulemaking power of this court\u201d); <em>Commonwealth v. Peterkin, </em>554 Pa. 547, 722 A.2d 638, 643 (1998) (\u201cthe PCRA\u2019s time limitation upon the filing of PCRA petitions does not unreasonably or unconstitutionally limit [a petitioner\u2019s] constitutional right to habeas corpus relief\u2019). Moreover, contrary to Pittman\u2019s contention, the federal constitution does not provide a right to defendants to challenge the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction \u201cat any time and any place.\u201d <em>Cradle v. United States ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538 (3d Cir.2002); <em>see generally Dist. Attorney\u2019s Office for Third Judicial Dist. v. Osborne, </em>557 U.S. 52, 69, 129 S.Ct. 2308, 174 L.Ed.2d 38 (2009) (noting that petitioners have just a \u201climited interest in postconviction relief\u2019 and that states have flexibility in designing postconviction rules). Accordingly, we discern no error in the District Court\u2019s order dismissing Pittman\u2019s complaint.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>In his Rule 59(e) motion, Pittman essentially reiterated arguments that the District Court had rejected in dismissing his complaint. The District Court therefore did not err in denying that motion. <em>See Lazaridis v. Wehmer, </em>591 F.3d 666, 669 (3d Cir.2010) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">Accordingly, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment. Appellant\u2019s motion to file an overlong response to the order listing the matter for possible summary action is granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b110-12\"> This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not constitute binding precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b111-7\">. Given the legal failings of Pittman\u2019s complaint, we are satisfied that amendment to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>complaint would be futile, and therefore con-elude that the District Court properly dismissed the complaint without providing leave to amend. <em>See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., </em>293 F.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
