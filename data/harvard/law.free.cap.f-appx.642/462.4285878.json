Because the district court\u2019s remand order falls squarely within 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447\u2019s bar to appellate review, Burns\u2019s appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-27\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-28\">This case stems from a car accident between Plaintiff-Appellee Leland Howard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>and a drunk driver. As a result of the accident, Howard underwent surgery, which was performed by Burns and a surgical technician, Kurt Doyle. Burns and Doyle were then paid by Howard\u2019s employment-related benefit plan. His benefit plan is governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">After his surgery, Howard sued and settled with the drunk driver that caused his injuries. He then claims that the administrator of his benefits plan, UnitedHealth-care Insurance Company (\u201cUHC\u201d), asserted its right to subrogation for medical bills paid out of his benefit plan for his surgery. Around the same time, Howard learned that Burns received $1,087 for his \u201cin network\u201d services, and Doyle received $7,934.01 for his \u201cout-of-network\u201d services.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Unhappy with the extra cost of Doyle\u2019s \u201cout-of-network\u201d services, Howard filed suit in state court against Doyle, Burns, UHC, and UHC\u2019s subrogation vendor, Op-tumhealth Care Insurance Solutions, Inc. (\u201cOptum\u201d), for deceptive trade practices and seeking a declaratory judgment. The case did not remain in state court for long: roughly three months after the case was filed, Burns removed the case to federal court based on federal question jurisdiction, claiming that all of Howard\u2019s state-law causes of action were preempted by ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">After the case was removed to federal court, the fight to return the case to state court began. The district eourt denied Howard\u2019s initial motion to remand, finding that all of Howard\u2019s state-law claims were preempted by ERISA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Howard then voluntarily dismissed the institutional defendants, UHC and Optum, as well as his declaratory-judgment claim, and amended his complaint. The First Amended Complaint named only Doyle and Burns as defendants; asserted state-law claims of deceptive trade practices, fraud, and civil conspiracy; and added an ERISA claim \u201c[t]o the extent [the district court] rule[d] that [Howard\u2019s] state law claims remain preempted in the absence of an ERISA plan as a party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">\u25a0 Following the filing of his amended complaint, Howard again moved to remand the case to state court. The district court granted the motion, finding that Howard\u2019s state law claims were no longer preempted by ERISA- \u2014 primarily because he dismissed the benefit plan administrator, UHC, from the suit \u2014 and therefore concluded that the court did not have subject-matter jurisdiction. Burns filed a timely appeal, challenging the district court\u2019s remand order and asking this court to enter judgment in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-12\">We begin our analysis of the district court\u2019s remand order with the text of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d): \u201cAn order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise....\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d). The contours of Section 1447(d) are defined by reading it <em>in pari materia </em>with Section 1447(c), \u201cso that only remands based on the grounds specified in the latter are shielded by the bar on review mandated by the former.\u201d <em>Powerex Corp. v. Reliant Energy Servs., Inc., </em>551 U.S. 224, 229, 127 S.Ct. 2411, 168 L.Ed.2d 112 (2007). Section 1447(c) provides two bases for remanding cases to state court: (1) a defect in the removal procedure, and (2) the lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>See Big Country Vein Relief, L.P. v. Directory As</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number><em>sistants, Inc., </em>425 Fed.Appx. 287, 289 (5th Cir.2011); <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Since there is no contention of a defect in the removal procedure \u2014 in fact, the district court initially found that removal was proper \u2014 we examine only whether the district court\u2019s remand order was based on a lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Our precedent has simplified this analysis, as \u201c[w]e will only review remand orders if the district court affirmatively states a non-1447(c) ground for remand.\u201d <em>Price v. Johnson, </em>600 F.3d 460, 462 (5th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>Soley v. First Nat\u2019l Bank of Commerce, </em>923 F.2d 406, 408 (5th Cir.1991)). Here, the district court clearly remanded for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. The district court\u2019s analysis centered on whether it had subject-matter jurisdiction over Howard\u2019s state-law claims because of ERISA preemption \u2014 the court ultimately concluded that Howard\u2019s claims \u201care not preempted by ERISA and th[e] Court lacks jurisdiction.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, we are precluded from reviewing the order, even if it is erroneous. <em>Dahiya v. Talmidge Int\u2019l, Ltd., </em>371 F.3d 207, 209 (5th Cir.2004) (\u201cAfter a district court remands a case to state court for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d) bars a federal appellate court from reviewing the remand ruling \u2018no matter how erroneous.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Arnold v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>277 F.3d 772, 775 (5th Cir.2001)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Undaunted, Emms argues that two <em>cases </em>\u2014 Buchner <em>v. F.D.I.C., </em>981 F.2d 816 (5th Cir.1993), and <em>Cuevas v. BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP, </em>648 F.3d 242 (5th Cir.2011) \u2014 compel the conclusion that review is <em>proper. </em>He is mistaken. First, his reliance on <em>Buchner </em>is, at best, misplaced. The court in <em>Buchner </em>had authority to review the relevant remand order pursuant to 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1819(b)(2)(C), which provides that \u201c[t]he [FDIC] may appeal any order of remand entered by any United States district court.\u201d 981 F.2d at 818 <em>&amp; </em>n. 4. Bums fails to explain why we should consider him to be in the position of the FDIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">Burns\u2019s reliance on <em>Cuevas </em>is similarly unavailing. In <em>Cuevas, </em>the district court declined to exercise jurisdiction over the plaintiffs state-law claims after dismissing the only federal cause of action and therefore remanded the case to state court. 648 F.3d at 247. We considered the appeal under the well-established rule that a remand order is reviewable if it is based \u201con an affirmative exercise of discretion rather than on a finding of lack of jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 248 (quoting <em>Adair v. Lease Partners, Inc., </em>587 F.3d 238, 240 (5th Cir.2009)); <em>see also Carnegie-Mellon Univ. v. Cohill, </em>484 U.S. 343, 357, 108 S.Ct. 614, 98 L.Ed.2d 720 (1988) (\u201c[A] district court has discretion to remand to state court a removed case involving pendent claims upon a proper determination that retaining jurisdiction over the case would be inappropriate.\u201d). However, unlike <em>Cuevas, </em>the district court here was not faced with deciding whether to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over pendent state law claims. And, as previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>explained, the district court here did not indicate \u2014 much less affirmatively state\u2014 that it issued its remand order after an exercise of its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b484-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the. court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b485-8\">. In a separate order, the court granted Howard leave to amend his complaint to add an ERISA claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b486-6\">. Howard did include a federal cause of action in his complaint: an ERISA claim. However, as the district court explained, \"[h]e pled his ERISA claim .., as contingent on a holding ... that his state-law claims are preempted.\u201d Thus, the district court never considered the claim in its remand analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b486-7\">. The ban on appellate review of the remand order applies even though the case was properly removed in the first instance and the subject matter defect arose after removal. <em>See Powerex, </em>551 U.S. at 230, 127 S.Ct. 2411 (\"Nothing in the text of \u00a7 1447(c) supports the proposition that a remand for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction is not covered so long as the case was properly removed in the first instance.\u2019\u2019).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
