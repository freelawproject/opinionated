Routt contends that he was entitled to a two-level reduction of his base offense level under Amendment 782 and that, as a result, his new base offense level would be 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-18\">The record confirms that Routt was ineligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because Amendment 782 did not lower his base offense level. Routt fails to acknowledge that he was held responsible for 42.5 kilograms and four ounces of crack cocaine and 150 kilograms of powder cocaine. Under the retroactive, amended version of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l), which has now taken effect, Routt has a base offense level of 38 because he was responsible for the equivalent of more than 90,000 kilograms of marijuana. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l) (2015). His specific offense level enhancements added six more levels. Routt\u2019s total offense level of 44, together with a criminal history category of IV, results in a guidelines range of life imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Ch. 5, Pt. A. Because Amendment 782 did not reduce Routt\u2019s sentencing range, the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>properly found that he was ineligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B) <em>&amp; </em>comment. (n.1(A)); <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 826, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b460-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
