Following a contested sentencing hearing, the district court sentenced him to a term of imprisonment of 150 months, the middle of the guidelines range, to be followed by a supervised release term of four years. Cadena contends on appeal that the district court clearly erred when it enhanced his sentence on the basis of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(5) &amp; (b)(12).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">According to the presentence report (PSR), Cadena met Narcisco Rodriguez, his codefendant, in 2012. Soon thereafter, Cadena began supplying Rodriguez with quarter ounce quantities of cocaine for resale. In July 2018, a confidential source (CS) met Rodriguez at a gas station and purchased a quarter ounce of cocaine, that had been supplied by Cadena, with the expectation of conducting a larger transaction at a later date. Approximately two weeks later, Rodriguez agreed to sell one pound of methamphetamine to the CS. Although Rodriguez initially agreed to meet the CS at a second gas station, he changed his mind after speaking to Cadena, and the sale was cancelled. The next month, Rodriguez again agreed to sell one pound of methamphetamine to the CS and to conduct the transaction at the second gas station. Rodriguez and Cadena traveled to the gas station in different vehicles, and Cadena, who had supplied the methamphetamine, served as a lookout while Rodriguez completed the sale. When tested, the methamphetamine weighed 439.3 grams and was 98.6 percent pure. Given this quantity and purity, an FBI agent advised the probation officer that the methamphetamine- was more likely than not imported from Mexico. The agent based his opinion on his training and experience and his conversations with the DEA.</p>\n<p id=\"AJ1\">Cadena\u2019s complaint about the district court\u2019s imposition of the two guideline enhancements is a challenge to the procedural reasonableness of his sentence., <em>United States v. Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d 750, 752 (5th Cir.2009). \u201c[The] district court\u2019s interpretation or application of the Sentencing Guidelines is reviewed de novo, and its factual findings ... are reviewed for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Facts used to determine a sentence must be supported \u201cby a preponderance of the relevant and sufficiently reliable evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Alaniz, </em>726 F.3d 586, 619 (5th Cir.2013) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). As long as a factual finding is plausible in light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly erroneous and should be upheld. <em>Id. </em>at 618.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-12\">Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(5), a two-level upward adjustment should be assessed if the offense of conviction \u201cinvolved the importation of amphetamine or methamphetamine.\u201d We have held that this enhancement applies \u201cregardless of whether the defendant had knowledge of that importation.\u201d <em>United States v. Serfass, </em>684 F.3d 548, 552 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-13\">Cadena advanc\u00e9s that the enhancement may only be applied if (1) importation qualifies as relevant conduct and (2) U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3 requires his personal involvement in the importation or his reasonable foreseeability that the methamphetamine would be or was imported. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>contends that such requirements cannot be satisfied in this case. That argument is foreclosed by <em>Serfass. </em>684 F.3d at 552; see <em>United States v. Foulks, </em>747 F.3d 914, 915 (5th Cir.2014) (defendant need not know of or participate in importation) (citing <em>Serfass, </em>684 F.3d at 549-50, 553-54).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-3\">Finally, Cadena insists that our decision in <em>Serfass </em>was wrongly decided. He should know, however, that one panel of this court is precluded from overruling a decision made by a prior panel absent en banc consideration, a change in relevant statutory law, or an intervening decision by the Supreme Court. <em>See United States v. Lipscomb, </em>299 F.3d 303, 313 &amp; n. 34 (5th Cir.2002). The district court did not clearly err in applying the two-level enhancement under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(5). <em>See Serfass, </em>684 F.3d at 552.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Next, \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(12) authorizes a two-level enhancement if the defendant maintained a premises for the purpose of manufacturing or distributing a controlled substance, including storage of a controlled substance for the purpose of distribution. Cadena does not contest the district court\u2019s finding that he used an apartment for the receipt, storage, and distribution of cocaine. Rather, he argues that the district court erred in assessing the drug-premises enhancement because his distribution of cocaine was unrelated to his distribution of methamphetamine and thus did not qualify as relevant conduct under \u00a7 1B1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">In determining whether application of an enhancement is warranted, \u201ca court may consider, as \u2018relevant conduct,\u2019 acts in addition to those underlying the offense of conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. Dickson, </em>632 F.3d 186, 192 (5th Cir.2011). Relevant conduct includes \u201call acts and omissions ... that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.\u201d \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2). Factors to be considered in determining whether two offenses qualify as \u201cthe same course of conduct\u201d or \u201ca common scheme or plan\u201d include similarity, regularity, and temporal proximity. \u00a7 1B1.3, &lt;?mt. n. 9(B) (2014 ed.); <em>United States v. Culverhouse, </em>507 F.3d 888, 896 (5th Cir.2007). We review the district court\u2019s factual findings regarding a defendant\u2019s relevant conduct for clear error. <em>See United States v. Solis, </em>299 F.3d 420, 461 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">The district court concluded that Cadena\u2019s distribution of cocaine qualified as relevant conduct because (1) Cadena and Rodriguez jointly agreed to distribute narcotics, including both cocaine and methamphetamine; (2) the sale of methamphetamine to the CS was part of that broader agreement; and (3) the joint distribution of narcotics occurred over three or four months, during which time Cadena supplied Rodriguez with cocaine on at least 10 occasions. Cadena misconstrues the record when he contends that the district court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous because the methamphetamine transaction was temporally distinct from his sales of cocaine to Rodriguez, and the offenses were dissimilar. Cadena supplied Rodriguez with the cocaine sold to the CS in July 2013. That sale was made with the expectation that a larger sale of cocaine would follow. One month later, Rodriguez negotiated the sale of the methamphetamine, which Cadena also supplied. Given the similarity and temporal proximity of the cocaine and methamphetamine sales to the CS, the district court\u2019s relevant conduct finding is not implausible in light of the record as a whole, <em>see Culverhouse, </em>507 F.3d at 896, and application of the drug premises enhancement was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b329-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
