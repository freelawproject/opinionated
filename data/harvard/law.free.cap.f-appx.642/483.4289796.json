Denair RILEY, Defendant-Appellant.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b505-10\">No. 14-31168</docketnumber>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"AqC\">Summary Calendar.</p>\n<court data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b505-11\">United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b505-13\">April 7, 2016.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b505-14\">John Francis Murphy, Assistant U.S. Attorney, Kevin G. Boitmann, Assistant U.S. Attorney, Diane Hollenshead Copes, Esq., Assistant U.S. Attorney, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, New Orleans, LA, for Plaintiff-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b505-15\">Donald Anthony Sauviae, Jr., Esq., Man-dan, ND, for Defendant-Appellant.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b505-17\">Before BARKSDALE, CLEMENT, and ELROD, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b505-18\">PER CURIAM: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b505-19\">Pursuant to a plea agreement, Denair Riley pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute, and to possess with intent to distribute, 280 grams or more of cocaine base, and 500 grams or more of cocaine hydrochloride, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A) and (B), and 846; and use of a communication facility (telephone) to facilitate that crime, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b). The plea agreement contained, <em>inter alia, </em>a provision that, if Riley cooperated and provided \u201csubstantial assistance\u201d, the Government could, \u201cin its discretion\u201d, move for a sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-20\">At sentencing, the Government declined to exercise that discretion, citing Riley\u2019s lack of cooperation. The court sentenced him to the statutory mandatory minimum of 240 months\u2019 imprisonment. In challenging that sentence, Riley does not contend his plea agreement was unknowing or involuntary. Instead, he asserts only that the Government breached the agreement by failing, based on his substantial assistance, to move for a downward departure. He acknowledges, however, that the Government retained discretion to move for such a departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-21\">A court cannot grant a downward departure for substantial assistance unless the Government so moves. <em>E.g., United States v. Krumnow, </em>476 F.3d 294, 297 (5th Cir.2007). \u201cThe refusal to move for downward departure is reviewable only for unconstitutional motivation when [the Government\u2019s] sole discretion is retained.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number><em>United States v. Aderholt, </em>87 F.3d 740, 743 (5th Cir.1996). Riley fails to claim an unconstitutional motivation, asserting only that his refusal to cooperate was because he feared for his safety.</p>\n<p id=\"ANIi\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b505-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir, R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
