(\u201cCrown Point\u201d). After the grounding, another ves.sel, the <em>M/V Port Gibson </em>(the <em>\u201cPort Gibson\u201d), </em>sank to the bottom of the slip and pulled another ship, the Dredge <em>Buccaneer </em>(the <em>\u201cBuccaneer\u201d), </em>down with it. Crown Point, as owner and operator of both ships, undertook the salvage operation. Plaintiff-Appellant Osprey Underwriting Agency, Ltd. (\u201cOsprey\u201d), Crown Point\u2019s insurer, paid the related expenses. Osprey then sued Nature\u2019s Way, arguing that Nature\u2019s Way\u2019s negligence caused the sinking of the <em>PoH Gibson </em>and the <em>Buccaneer. </em>Following a bench trial, the district court found that Nature\u2019s Way was not liable. Because we conclude that the district court\u2019s factual findings were not clearly erroneous, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">On March 17, 2012, the <em>Commander </em>was headed eastbound near Crown Point, Louisiana, when it ran aground in the mouth of a narrow channel controlled by Crown Point. The <em>Port Gibson </em>and the <em>Buccaneer, </em>two vessels owned and operated by Crown Point, were moored in the channel at the time of the grounding. After the grounding, the <em>Commander </em>performed a number of engine maneuvers in an attempt to free itself. With the help of Crown Point\u2019s owner, Joe Dardar, the crew of the <em>Commander </em>was able to free the ship. However, Osprey contends that the <em>Commander\u2019s </em>engine maneuvers created \u201cextreme wave wash\u201d that broke the mooring lines of Crown Point\u2019s vessels and grounded them on an unimproved mud bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Several days after the grounding, on March 21, the <em>Port Gibson </em>began to take on water and sink, pulling the <em>Buccaneer </em>down with it. After raising the ships, the parties discovered that the <em>Port Gibson\u2019s </em>hull had been punctured by a protruding bolt from a large piece of timber. Both parties generally agree that this hull puncture caused the <em>Port Gibson </em>to sink.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">Both the <em>Port Gibson </em>and the <em>Buccaneer </em>were covered by a marine hull insurance policy underwritten by Osprey. Under the policy, Osprey paid for Crown Point\u2019s salvage expenses and reimbursed Crown Point for the actual damages that the vessels sustained as a result of sinking. As subrogee to Crown Point\u2019s rights against Nature\u2019s Way, Osprey filed suit, contending that Nature\u2019s Way negligently grounded the <em>Commander </em>and caused the sinking of both of Crown Point\u2019s vessels.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">A bench trial followed. In its post-trial findings, the district court explained that Osprey failed to prove a necessary element of its claim against Nature\u2019s Way: that the grounding of the <em>Commander </em>caused the sinking of the <em>Port Gibson </em>and the <em>Buccaneer. </em>The district court further found that even if Osprey met this causation burden, the failure of Crown Point\u2019s owner Joe Dardar and his employee Chad Dardar (the \u201cDardars\u201d)' to warn anyone of the timber impaled in the hull was a superseding cause of the sinking.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">Osprey timely appeals, contending that the district court erred in finding that (1) Osprey did not establish that the grounding of the <em>Commander </em>caused the sinking of the <em>Port Gibson </em>and the <em>Buccaneer, </em>and (2) the Dardars knew that the timber had impaled the <em>Port Gibson </em>and that their failure to respond prudently was a superseding cause of the sinking.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-12\">\u201cThe standard of review for a bench trial is well-established: findings of fact are reviewed for clear error and legal issues are reviewed <em>de novo.\u201d Guzman v. Hacienda Records &amp; Recording Studio, Inc., </em>808 F.3d 1031, 1036 (5th Cir.2015) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In a bench trial under maritime law, \u201ca district court\u2019s findings concerning negligence and causation are findings' of fact\u201d and are thus reviewed for clear error. <em>Ledet v. Smith Marine Towing Corp., </em>455 Fed.Appx. 417, 421-22 (5th Cir.2011) (quoting <em>Johnson v. Cenac Towing, Inc., </em>544 F.3d 296, 303 (5th Cir.2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-13\">A trial judge\u2019s factual finding \u201cis clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Guzman, </em>808 F.3d at 1036 (quoting <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 573, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985)). When reviewing for clear error, \u201c[w]e entertain a strong presumption that the court\u2019s findings must be sustained even though this court might have weighed the evidence differently.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>544 F.3d at 303; <em>see also Guz</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number><em>man, </em>808 F.3d at 1036 (\u201cThis standard plainly does not entitle this court to reverse the findings of the trial judge simply because we are convinced that we would or could decide the case differently.\u201d)- The district court\u2019s findings need only be \u201cplausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety\u201d to survive review. <em>Anderson, </em>470 U.S. at 574, 105 S.Ct. 1504.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">We analyze maritime tort eases using general principles of negligence law. <em>Canal Barge Co. v. Torco Oil Co., </em>220 F.3d 370, 376 (5th Cir.2000). \u201cTo establish maritime negligence, a plaintiff must \u2018demonstrate that there was a duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff, breach of that duty, injury sustained by {the] plaintiff, and a causal connection between the defendant\u2019s conduct and the plaintiffs injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration in original) (quoting <em>In re Cooper/T. Smith, </em>929 F.2d 1073, 1077 (5th Cir.1991)). Under general maritime law, \u201ca party\u2019s negligence is actionable only if it is a \u2018legal cause\u2019 of the plaintiffs injuries.\u201d <em>Donaghey v. Ocean Drilling &amp; Expl. Co., </em>974 F.2d 646, 649 (5th Cir.1992). \u201c[L]egal cause is something more than \u2018but for\u2019 causation, and the negligence must be a \u2018substantial factor\u2019 in the injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration in original) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe term \u2018substantial factor\u2019 means more than \u2018but for the negligence, the harm would not have resulted.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">The parties generally do not dispute that the bolt-studded timber punctured the <em>Port Gibson\u2019s </em>hull and caused that ship to take on water and sink. But, for Nature\u2019s Way to be liable, Osprey must establish that this hull puncture was caused by the negligent grounding<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and post-grounding maneuvering of the Commander.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Marquette Transp. Co. v. La. Mach. Co., </em>367 F.3d 398, 402 (5th Cir.2004) (noting plaintiffs burden to prove \u201ccausation by a preponderance of the evidence\u201d). The district court found that Osprey failed to meet this burden, noting that \u201cthere is insufficient evidence, from either side, to credibly establish by a reasonableness standard when, where, or how the hull impalement occurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">Osprey contends that the district court\u2019s factual finding is clearly erroneous. We disagree. In support of its contention, Osprey notes that two of its experts, Arnold Lachmann and John Pope, testified that they believed that the timber impaled the <em>Port Gibson\u2019s </em>hull as a result of a breakaway caused by the grounding and maneuvering of the <em>Commander. </em>However, Nature\u2019s Way\u2019s expert, Mark Shiffer, vehemently disagreed. Shiffer testified that he did not believe the described events could create a sufficient vertical force to impale the ship\u2019s hull. And indeed, Shiffer insisted that the \u201cvertical puncture\u201d of the ship\u2019s hull could not be reconciled with the horizontal movement of the boat. Faced with this battle of experts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>as to the cause of the hull puncture, the district court did not clearly err in determining that Osprey failed to meet its causation burden. <em>See Guzman, </em>808 F.3d at 1036 (\u201c[T]he great deference owed to the trial judge\u2019s findings compels the conclusion that \u2018[w]here there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Anderson, </em>470 U.S. at 575, 105 S.Ct. 1504)). Our review of the record does not leave us with the definite and firm conviction that the district court made a mistake. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Because the district court did not clearly err in finding that Osprey failed to prove causation, we need not reach its superseding cause finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Under our clear-error standard of review, we decline to second-guess the district court\u2019s permissible choice between conflicting expert testimony. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b414-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b416-6\">. Nature's Way has stipulated that the grounding of the <em>Commander </em>was due to its negligence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b416-7\">. In its briefing, Osprey largely asserts that the district court's ruling was based on the doctrine of superseding cause and thus argues that the court clearly erred in finding that the Dardars\u2019 failure to warn of the timber impaled in the <em>Port Gibson </em>was a superseding cause of tire ships' sinking. In contrast, Nature\u2019s Way contends that the district court found that Osprey failed to meet its burden of proof as to causation and its superseding cause finding was not necessary to the judgment. Our review of the district court\u2019s judgment confirms Nature's Way\u2019s reading: the district court noted throughout its opinion that neither side had proven how the <em>Port Gibson\u2019s </em>hull was punctured. We thus address whether this factual finding is clearly erroneous.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
