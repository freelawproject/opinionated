Ramirez contends his sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Along that line, he asserts the court failed to consider his reentry offense was a nonviolent crime, and his reason for returning was benign. Additionally, Ramirez maintains his sentence is not entitled to a presumption of reasonableness because the illegal reentry Guideline, \u00a7 2L1.2, is not empirically based, given that it double-counts a defendant\u2019s criminal history. He notes that, at the time of his prior illegal-reentry conviction, he received a 12-level sentencing enhancement based on his prior drug offenses; however, the same convictions now qualify for a 16-level enhancement because of a subsequent revocation sentence, although the facts underlying those convictions have not changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and a properly preserved objection to an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the Guidelines sentencing range for- use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 48-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, for issues preserved in district court, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Regarding Ramirez\u2019 substantive-unreasonableness claim, his 70-month sentence is within the advisory-Guidelines sentencing range; therefore, it is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>E.g., United States v. Rashad, </em>687 F.3d 637, 644 (5th Cir.2012). \u201cThe presumption is rebutted only upon a showing that the sentence does not account for a factor that should receive significant weight, it gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or it represents a clear error of judgment in balancing sentencing factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">As he concedes, Ramirez\u2019 assertion the presumption does not apply, based on his claim Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically based, is foreclosed by our precedent. (He raises the issue only to preserve it for possible further review.) <em>E.g., United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009). Additionally, our court has repeatedly rejected his assertions that: double-counting of prior convictions necessarily renders a sentence unreasonable; and, the Guidelines overstate the seriousness of illegal reentry. <em>E.g., id. </em>at 529-30; <em>United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 682-83 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">Moreover, the district court examined, <em>inter alia, </em>Ramirez\u2019 motive for reentering the United States, as well as his criminal and personal history, before pronouncing sentence. General disagreement with the propriety of his sentence and the court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See Cooks, </em>589 F.3d at 186; <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"AJn\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b510-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
