On appeal, Hope contends that he is eligible for a sentence reduction, even though he was sentenced to a statutory minimum sentence of life imprisonment, under an exception available when the guidelines calculations were a major factor in the decision to apply the mandatory statutory penalty. Hope also argues that United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7 1B1.10, the policy statement governing sentence reductions under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), violates equal protection because it permits a certain class of defendants to be resentenced without regard to the mandatory minimum but denies that benefit to similarly situated defendants such as himself. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-14\">Hope was indicted by a federal grand jury in 1990 for his role in a conspiracy to distribute cocaine. Hope proceeded to trial and a jury found him guilty of one count of conspiracy to distribute cocaine, in violation 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846, and one count of using a firearm during and in relation to a drug-trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-15\">Before Hope\u2019s sentencing, a probation officer prepared a presentence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d) finding that Hope\u2019s base offense level was 32, based on drug quantity, and that his criminal history category was IV. This established a guideline range of 168 to 210 months of imprisonment. However, the PSR noted that Hope\u2019s cocaine offense carried a statutory mandatory minimum term of life imprisonment, \u25a0 pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), because Hope had multiple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>prior felony convictions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Due to the mandatory minimum, Hope\u2019s guideline range for the drug offense became life imprisonment, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b) (\u201cWhere a statutorily required minimum sentence is greater than the maximum of the applicable guideline range, the statutorily required minimum sentence shall be the guideline sentence.\u201d), to be followed by a consecutive five-year term of imprisonment for the \u00a7 924(c) offense, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">In 1991, the district court sentenced Hope to the minimum term of life imprisonment for the drug offense followed by a consecutive five-year term for the firearm offense. At Hope\u2019s sentencing, the court noted that it was bound to sentence Hope as required by the relevant statutes. Hope\u2019s direct appeal from his conviction was affirmed without opinion. <em>See United States v. Gibson, </em>996 F.2d 314 (11th Cir.1993) (unpublished table decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">In 2014, the Sentencing Commission issued Amendment 782, which reduced the offense level for certain drug-trafficking offenses by two levels. That same year, Hope, proceeding <em>pro $e, </em>filed a motion to reduce his sentence under \u00a7 3682(c)(2) based on Amendment 782. The government opposed the motion, arguing that Hope was ineligible for a sentence reduction because he had been sentenced to the minimum statutory penalty. Hope replied that a reduction is authorized in the \u201csingular and unique\u201d situation where the underlying guidelines calculation was a dominant factor in the decision to apply the enhanced statutory penalty. For that proposition Hope cited to an unpublished federal district court decision from the District of Minnesota. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>No. 4:89-cr-00120-JMR, 2010 WL 3119768 (D.Minn. Aug. 6, 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-9\">The district court denied Hope\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, determining that he \u201cis ineligible for a reduction in sentence because he was subject to the mandatory statutory penalty in excess of the guideline range, specifically, a mandatory life sentence.\u201d Hope now brings this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-11\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Colon, </em>707 F.3d 1255, 1258 (11th Cir.2013). A district court may modify a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment if the defendant was sentenced based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be consistent with the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statements. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b985-12\">The Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statement on \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reductions explains that a reduction is not authorized if an amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). The commentary to that policy statement further explains that a reduction is not authorized if the amendment \u201cis applicable to the defendant but the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline-range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision <em>(e.g., </em>a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprison<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>ment).\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n.l(A) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">A district court therefore is without authority to grant \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief \u201cwhen the defendant was sentenced on the basis of a mandatory minimum,\u201d even if the amendment would alter the guideline range applicable in the absence of the minimum statutory penalty. <em>United States v. Mills, </em>613 F.3d 1070, 1078 (11th Cir.2010). An amendment has no effect on a guideline range set solely by a statutory mandatory minimum under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b). <em>See United States v. Glover, </em>686 F.3d 1203, 1206 (11th Cir.2012) (\u201c[A]n amendment that alters the initial calculation of a guidelines range is not to be applied in a case where the difference in the initial calculation would have made no difference because a mandatory minimum would have trumped the initial calculation and dictated the final guidelines range anyway.\u201d). \u25a0 Consequently, a defendant is ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction when the minimum statutory penalty exceeds, and therefore supplants, the otherwise-applicable guideline range. <em>See United States v. Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d 535, 540 (11th Cir.2013) (holding that U.S.S.G. Amendment 750 did not lower a defendant\u2019s guideline range where he was sentenced to a mandatory minimum under \u00a7 841(b)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">Here, the district court correctly determined that it lacked the authority to reduce Hope\u2019s sentence. Hope was sentenced to life imprisonment on the basis of the mandatory minimum under 21 U.S.G. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Though Amendment 782 affects his initial calculations under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, the amendment does not lower his guideline range because that range was established solely by the mandatory minimum. <em>See Glover, </em>686 F.3d at 1206; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b). Despite Amendment 782, \u201c[Hope\u2019s] guidelines range was \u2014 and still is \u2014 life in prison.\u201d <em>Glover, </em>686 F.3d at 1208. Accordingly, Hope is not eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because Amendment 782 did not lower his guideline range. <em>See Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d at 540-42; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n.l(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b986-10\">Hope\u2019s reliance on <em>Miller </em>is misplaced because it is non-binding authority and it is contrary to circuit precedent and the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statements. In addition, Hope is mistaken that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S. 522, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), permits re-sentencing in his case without regard to the mandatory minimum.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>Lawson, </em>we held that <em>Freeman </em>did not overrule our case law concerning situations \u201cwhere the defendants were assigned a base offense level under one guideline section, but then assigned a total offense level and guideline range under a different guideline section.\u201d <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir.2012). Although <em>Lawson </em>concerned the career-offender guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, we have recognized that there is no substantive distinction, for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) purposes, between the analysis of career-offender designations and statutory mandatory m\u00ednimums under \u00a7 841(b)(1). <em>Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d at 542. Accordingly, <em>Freeman </em>does not change the result here.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-11\">Hope also argues that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 violates his equal-protection rights because this policy statement permits a certain class of defendants \u2014 those who received an original sentence below the mandatory minimum due to a govem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>ment motion for substantial assistance \u2014 to be resentenced in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding without regard to the mandatory minimum or U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1, while excluding Hope and other defendants otherwise similarly situated from that same benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">The equal-protection guarantee broadly prohibits the government from drawing distinctions between individuals based on differences that are irrelevant to a legitimate government purpose. <em>Lofton v. Sec\u2019y of Dep\u2019t of Children &amp; Family Servs., </em>358 F.3d 804, 817 (11th Cir.2004). Because the challenged classification does not burden a fundamental right or target a suspect class, as Hope admits, we review the classification to determine if it is supported by a rational basis. <em>See id. </em>at 818. \u201cTo pass the rational basis test, the legislation must have a legitimate purpose, and it must have been reasonable for lawmakers to believe that the use of the challenged classification would promote that purpose.\u201d <em>United States v. King, </em>972 F.2d 1259, 1260 (11th Cir.1992) (reviewing an equal-protection challenge to the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 disparate penalties for crack cocaine and powder cocaine).</p>\n<p id=\"b987-6\">Here, Hope\u2019s equal-protection arguments are unavailing. We have held that a provision allowing a defendant to be sentenced below a mandatory minimum for \u201csubstantial assistance\u201d does not violate equal protection because \u201cthere is a rational relationship between the statute and Congress\u2019 purpose\u201d of encouraging those with information about drug kingpins to disclose such information. <em>United States v. Musser, </em>856 F.2d 1484, 1486-87 (11th Cir.1988) (concerning 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) and Rule 35, Fed.R.Crim.P.), Section lB1.10(c) of the Sentencing Guidelines merely extends that rational distinction to a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding by permitting defendants originally sentenced below the mandatory minimum due to substantial assistance to be resentenced under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) below the mandatory minimum.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In that way, the classification furthers legitimate governmental purposes by maintaining the distinction between those defendants who provide substantial assistance and those who do not. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Supp. App. C, Amend. 780 (Reason for Amendment) (2014); <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(n) (directing the Commission to \u201cassure that the guidelines reflect the general appropriateness of imposing a lower sentence than would otherwise be imposed, including a sentence that is lower than that established by .statute as a minimum sentence, to take into account a defendant\u2019s substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense\u201d). Accordingly, \u00a7 lBl.lO\u2019s distinction between defendants based on \u201csubstantial assistance\u201d does not violate equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-10\">In sum, the district court properly found that Hope was not eligible for \u00e1 sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because his sentence was based on a statutory mandatory minimum that remains unaffected by Amendment 782.</p>\n<p id=\"AXI\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b985-7\">.
