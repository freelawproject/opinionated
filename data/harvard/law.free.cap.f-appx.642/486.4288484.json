We have reviewed counsel\u2019s briefs and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Pena\u2019s responses. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th C\u00ede. R. 42.2. Pena\u2019s pro se motion for the appointment of substitute counsel is DENIED. His motions to seal his pro se responses and attachments are GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b509-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
