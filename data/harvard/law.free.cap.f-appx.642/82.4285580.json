He was sentenced to life in prison after the District Court adopted the recommendation in the presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) of an adjusted offense level of 45 (a base level of 40 enhanced by a two-point adjustment for the possession of a weapon and a three-point adjustment for his role as a \u201csquad leader\u201d). This Court affirmed the judgment. <em>United States v. Price, </em>13 F.3d 711, 736 (3d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-21\">In December 2013, Reaves, through counsel, filed a motion for reduction of sentence. He argued that he was entitled to a sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and (in tandem) Amendments 505 and 599 to the Sentencing Guidelines. The Government opposed the motion on the basis that Amendment 599 was inapplicable and, although Amendment 505 reduced Reaves\u2019 base level to 38, he was not eligible for a reduction in sentence because his total offense level and criminal history category still supported a sentence of life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-22\">The District Court denied the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. The District Court noted the parties\u2019 agreement about the applicability of Amendment-505 in lower<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>ing the offense range and the conceded necessity of a \u201ctandem\u201d application of both Amendments to win a reduction of sentence. (The District Court concurred with the Government that Reaves\u2019 sentence remained life imprisonment even after the application of Amendment 505.) The District Court explained that Amendment 599 was not applicable because Reaves had not been convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). In so doing, the District Court also rejected Reaves\u2019 argument to apply the Amendment more generally to his enhancement for possession of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Reaves, now pro se, appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He submits a motion for appointment of counsel. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. In considering the denial of Reaves\u2019 \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, we exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines and otherwise review the denial of relief for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Mateo, </em>560 F.3d 152, 154 (3d Cir.2009). We may summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s ruling if there is no substantial question presented on appeal. 3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Upon review, we will affirm. It is clear that Reaves was not convicted of a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), so, as the District Court concluded, he was not entitled to a reduction of sentence in light of Amendment 599. Under Amendment 599, courts are directed not to \u201capply any weapon enhancement in the guideline for the underlying offense\u201d if the defendant was convicted of a \u00a7 924 offense. U.S.S.G. Manual, Appx. C, Amendment 599 (modifying \u00a7 2K2.4 cmt. n. 2). The purpose of the amendment was to \u201cclarify under what circumstances defendants sentenced for violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) in conjunction with convictions for other offenses may receive weapon enhancements contained in the guidelines for those other offenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the District Court, Reaves\u2019 counsel argued for a wider application of Amendment 599 beyond cases that include \u00a7 924(c) convictions. However, we cannot find support for applying the amendment in cases that do not involve \u00a7 924(c) convictions. .</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">As noted, Reaves based his claim for a sentence reduction on the \u201ctandem\u201d application of Amendments 599 and 505. Because ohe is not applicable, his \u201ctandem\u201d theory cannot succeed. As the District Court explained, based on the information in Reaves\u2019 PSR, Amendment 505 alone would not result in a reduction of sentence for Reaves. The Government conceded that the retroactively applicable amendment would reduce Reaves\u2019 original base level from 40 to 38. However, as the District Court noted, even if Reaves were given the benefit of Amendment 505, his sentence would remain life imprisonment in light of the enhancements totaling five points and his criminal history (his adjusted offense level would be 43). Because the guideline range did not actually change, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Reaves\u2019 motion. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G., \u00a7 lB.10(a)(2)(B); <em>see also United States v. Flemming, </em>723 F.3d 407, 410 (3d Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">For these reasons, we conclude that the District Court did not err in denying Reaves\u2019 motion for a reduction in sentence. Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment. Reaves\u2019 motion for appointment of counsel is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b104-24\"> This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not constitute binding precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b105-11\">.
