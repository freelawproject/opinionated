As the appeal does not present a substantial question, we will summarily affirm the decision of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-12\">Artis initiated this \u00a7 1983 action in 2013 against Byunghak Jin, Medical Director at SCI \u2014 Greene; Min H. Park, Physician at SCI \u2014 Greene; and Corizon Health, a former contractual medical service provider to the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections, alleging that these Defendants denied him adequate medical care in connection with an unspecified left ankle injury he suffered while incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-13\">Artis alleges that he started experiencing problems with the ankle on July 12, 2010, and that Dr. Jin initially told him, at an unspecified time, that \u201cthere was nothing wrong.\u201d Artis, however, acknowledges receiving an x-ray on July 12, 2010. He alleges that Jin continued to advise him that nothing was wrong until, according to his complaint, he \u201clost complete range of motion in November] 2010\u201d and was referred at that time for physical therapy. Artis claims that in December of 2010, he read a chart in a physical therapy session in which the physical therapist recommended an MRI, but that on January 18, 2011, instead of ordering an MRI, Dr. Jin \u201cbegan a process of pacification by allowing me to order outside shoes\u201d and ordered harmful doses of Acetaminophen. He claims that Jin \u201crefused to acknowledge the injury and consisted to tell me it was merely swelling,\u201d and that Jin continually ordered x-rays<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> instead of ordering an MRI.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-18\">Artis contends that, at an unspecified time, Jin acknowledged that he had ligament damage, and that Jin \u201ctried to mas[k] the pain\u201d by prescribing Vicodin from February 2012 through October 2012. Artis acknowledges receiving an MRI on April 16, 2012, which he contends revealed soft tissue swelling, fracture fragments, and chronic tears. Artis also acknowledges receiving \u201cair cushioned shoes\u201d and two ankles braces some time before September of 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-19\">On September 30, 2012, Artis was placed in the Restricted Housing Unit (RHU) for allegedly selling a portion of his Vicodin prescription, and Artis contends that Dr. Jin suspended his air cushioned shoes, ankle braces, and pain medication the following day. He also contends that Jin directed his subordinates to not treat him while he was in the RHU. .Artis grieved this suspension of medical treatment on October 12, 2012, and upon final review of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>grievance on April 8, 2013, the Chief Grievance Officer found that Jin suspended the braces and shoes because there was no medical need for these items based on Artis\u2019 limited activity in the RIM,</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">On November 2, 2012, Artis filed a separate grievance related to his lack of medical care in the RHU, but acknowledges in this grievance, contrary to the allegations in his complaint, that he was examined by medical staff at least three times in the RHU in October of 2012. Regarding the alleged discontinuation of the Vicodin, the Chief Grievance Officer found, upon final review of this grievance, that \u201cmedication adjustments [were] made after you were caught selling your Vicodin.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Artis acknowledges the return of his braces and shoes on January 7, 2013, four days after his release from the RHU, and contends that,- on January 24, 2013, he \u201cwas placed on a walker because I was unable to walk on my own will.\u201d He then claims to have been treated, at an unspecified time, by an orthopedic specialist from Allegheny General Hospital, who allegedly observed damage to Artis\u2019 right ankle resulting from Artis overcompensating for the injury to his left ankle. Artis received surgery on his left ankle at Allegheny General Hospital on June 10, 2013. The surgical report indicates that Artis had a chronic tear of two ligaments in the ankle, and that treatment options for this injury included both operative and non-operative interventions. The report also notes that Artis had previously received \u201cconservative measures,\u201d which were not successful.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Following the surgery, Artis alleges that Jin delayed prescribing him a blood thinner for six days \u2014 though he does not allege that he had a blood clot \u2014 and \u201cforced\u201d him to use crutches when his right ankle could not sustain the increased weight. He also contends that Park and Jin prescribed only Motrin for the swelling, a medication Artis claims to be allergic to.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">On May 27, 2015, the Magistrate Judge recommended that respective motions to dismiss filed by the Medical Defendants and Corizon be granted. On August 14, 2015, the District Judge entered an order adopting the Report and Recommendation over Artis\u2019 objections and directed the Clerk to close the case. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-11\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the District Court\u2019s dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) using the same test that the District Court should have applied and ask whether it has \u201csufficient factual matter; accepted as true; to state a claim to relief that is plausible on this face.\u201d <em>Fantone v. Latini, </em>780 F.3d 184, 186-193 (3d Cir.2015) (citing <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009)). We may summarily affirm any decision of the District Court where \u201cit clearly appears that no substantial question is presented or that subsequent precedent or a change in circumstances warrants such action.\u201d 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-12\">As to Defendants Jin and Park, the District Court relied on the exhibits attached to Artis\u2019 complaint and brief in opposition <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u2014 primarily Artis\u2019 grievances and responses \u2014 to determine that Artis\u2019 claim amounted to a mere difference in opinion over his particular course of treatment, which is not actionable under the Eighth Amendment. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>The facts, derived from Artis\u2019 complaint and exhibits, indicate that he received a variety of medical interventions beginning on July 12, 2010 \u2014 the date of his injury \u2014 and continuing until after his surgery on June 10, 2013. Beyond the surgery itself, Artis received at least six x-rays, an MRI, physical therapy, various pain medication, supportive braces, cushioned shoes, crutches, and a walker. The gravamen of Artis\u2019 complaint is that Defendants should have more aggressively treated his condition and pursued a surgical intervention sooner. The operative report, however, acknowledges that his condition could be treated with \u201cboth operative and non-operative treatment options,\u201d though it also acknowledges that \u201cthe attempted conservative measures ... had failed.\u201d Artis is essentially dissatisfied with the result of the conservative course of treatment and believes, instead, that his providers should have opted for a more aggressive course.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In other words, his claim arises from \u201c[m]ere disagreement as to the proper course of medical treatment,\u201d which is insufficient to state an Eighth Amendment claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Spruill v. Gillis, </em>372 F.3d 218, 235 (3d Cir.2004) (citing <em>Monmouth County Correctional Institutional Inmates v. Lanzaro, </em>834 F.2d 326, 346 (3d Cir.1987)); <em>See also Norris v. Frame, </em>585 F.2d 1183, 1186 (3d Cir.1978) (\u201cWhere the plaintiff has received some care, inadequacy or impropriety of the care that was given will not support an Eighth Amendment claim.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">Having determined that no constitutional violation occurred, we find no error in the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Corizon and need not address the question of whether of whether Corizon maintained a policy, custom, or practice causing the alleged violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">Accordingly, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b115-14\"> This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not constitute binding precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b115-20\">. Artis acknowledges receiving x-rays on six separate occasions between July of 2010 and April of 2012.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b116-7\">. The District Court properly considered these documents. <em>See Pryor v. Nat'l Collegiate Athletic Ass\u2019n., </em>288 F.3d 548,' 559 (3d Cir.2002) (noting that \"a trial court has discretion to address evidence outside the complaint when ruling on a motion to dismiss\u201d and may consider documents attached to a party\u2019s complaint or brief) (citing 62 Fed. Proc., L.Ed. \u00a7 62:508).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b117-5\">. In his Argument in Support of Appeal, Artis asks **[i]s it sound judgment for a doctor to know for two years that a[n] injury is apparent but fails to use proper test to further investigate?\" This alleged failure in judgment sounds in medical malpractice and is not actionable under the Eighth Amendment <em>Kost v. Kozakiewicz, </em>1 F.3d 176, 185 (3d Cir.1993) (\"[M]edical malpractice does not become a constitutional violation merely because the victim is a prisoner.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b117-6\">. In his Argument in Support of Appeal, Artis argues that the District Court erred in dismissing his claim as it relates to his 90 days in the RHU when the Defendants allegedly refused to examine him and suspended his assistive devices and pain medication. Artis acknowledges in his complaint, however, that he was examined at least three times while in the RHU. Responses to his grievances indicate that assistive devices were not medically necessary based on his limited activity there, and that Artis\u2019 medication was <em>adjusted </em>when he was caught selling Vicodin, not that he was altogether deprived of it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
