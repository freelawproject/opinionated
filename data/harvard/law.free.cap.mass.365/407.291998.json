(the carrier), is a \u201cpublic service corporation\u201d for the purposes of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 10, permitting an exemption from the zoning bylaw of the town of Truro (the town). The carrier transports passengers for sightseeing purposes on a fixed route into the Cape Cod National Seashore, pursuant to a DPU certificate of public convenience and necessity and to a license from the town and a permit from the National' Park Service. During 1969 and 1970 the carrier employed three vehicles, each having a capacity of seven passengers ir addition to the driver. The DPU granted an exemptior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>from the zoning by-law of the town, and we order affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">We summarize the evidence bearing on the status of the carrier. Since 1962 it has engaged in the transportation of passengers for hire by motor vehicle from a motel in Truro over a fixed route within the National Seashore. The DPU issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity limiting the carrier to operation for sightseeing purposes only. In 1962 the carrier served the public with one vehicle. Pursuant to a permit issued by the Department of Public Works it constructed a terminal and parking facility across a State highway from the motel, and in 1969 and 1970 it employed three vehicles. It picked up passengers who had made reservations at other motels in Truro, and a Superior Court injunction against its operations had an unfavorable effect on the earnings of the other motels.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">At the DPU hearing counsel for the town argued that the carrier was not a public service corporation, citing <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Haverhill Gas Light Co. </em>215 Mass. 394, 398 (1913). The DPU took note of that argument, but decided that the carrier\u2019s use of its terminal facility was reasonably necessary for the convenience and welfare of the public, and granted an exemption from the zoning by-law of the town under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 10. The town appealed under G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, and a single justice of this court reserved and reported the case without decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">As the DPU apparently thought, the carrier was literally within the definition of \u201cpublic service corporation\u201d in the <em>Haverhill Gas Light Co. </em>case: \u201cone private in its ownership but having an appropriate franchise from the State to provide for a necessity or convenience of the general public incapable of being furnished through the ordinary channels of private competitive business and dependent for its exercise upon eminent domain or some agency of government\u201d (398). Eminent domain power was held unnecessary to the status of \u201cpublic service corporation\u201d for the purposes of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 10. <em>Wenham </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util. </em>333 Mass. 15, 16-17 (1955). But the language of the <em>Haverhill Gas Light Co. </em>case was not primarily directed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>problems presented by common carriers by motor vehicle. Compare <em>Arizona Corp. Commn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>105 Ariz. 56, 61 (1969). The Attorney General has ruled that a \u201ctrucking company\u201d subject to G. L. c. 159B, \u201cwhile it may well be a common carrier, is not a \u2018public service corporation\u2019 within the purview of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 10.\u201d Rep. A. G., Pub. Doc. No. 12, 1962, pp. 182-184. But compare <em>Freight, Inc. </em>v. <em>Township Trustees of North field Center Township, </em>107 Ohio App. 288, 293 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">Our decisions under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 10, have involved gas and electric companies and railroads.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Compare the list of \u201cpublic service corporations\u201d in G. L. c. 3, \u00a7 5, including * railroads and street railways. In a variety of contexts we have long recognized the quasi public character of such corporations and the duties owed by them to the public. See, e.g., <em>Weld </em>v. <em>Gas &amp; Elec. Light Commrs. </em>197 Mass. 557, 558 (1908); <em>Western Union Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>224 Mass. 365, 372 (1916).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The carrier involved here has a license from the town of Truro under G. L. c. 159A, \u00a7 1, and a certificate of public convenience and necessity under \u00a7 7. By \u00a7 10, stemming from St. 1918, c. 226, \u00a7 2, it is expressly declared to be a \u201ccommon carrier.\u201d See <em>Burgess </em>v. <em>Mayor &amp; Aldermen of Brockton, </em>235 Mass. 95, 98 (1920); <em>Roberto </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util. </em>262 Mass. 583, 585 (1928). Since 1918 regulation of such carriers has rested on their similarity to street railways and railroads. Today \u00a7 1, as amended through St. 1956, c. 99, applies to a motor vehicle operating on a public way for the carriage of passengers for hire, \u201cin such a manner as to afford a means of transportation similar to that afforded by a railway company, by indiscriminately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>receiving and discharging passengers along the route on which the vehicle is operated or may be running, or for transporting passengers for hire as a business between fixed and regular termini.\u201d We are not here concerned with taxicabs or with buses providing \u201ccharter service,\u201d \u201cspecial service,\u201d or \u201cschool service\u201d under G. L. c. 159A, \u00a7 11A, as amended through St. 1971, c. 561, but with \u201cmotor vehicles engaged in what might be described as public service transportation.\u201d <em>Goodwin </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util. </em>351 Mass. 25, 27 (1966). Under \u00a7 10 the DPU has general supervision and regulation of, and jurisdiction and control over, such common carriers \u201cto the same extent as it has over railway companies,\u201d except as to the issue of securities.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">We think it follows that such a common carrier of passengers by motor vehicle, like a railroad, is a \u201cpublic service corporation.\u201d See Adler, Business Jurisprudence, 28 Harv. L. Rev. 135, 140-146 (1914). It is subject to the public duties of a common carrier, bound to observe the conditions of its certificate, to observe filed rates and schedules, and to serve the public without discrimination. See <em>Holton </em>v. <em>Boston Elev. Ry. </em>303 Mass. 242, 245 (1939); <em>Blair </em>v. <em>Boston Elev. Ry. </em>310 Mass. 1, 2-3 (1941). The town contends that a public service corporation must be \u201cimportant,\u201d that its business must be \u201cnecessary and substantial,\u201d and that it must possess some \u201cright of eminent domain or other large privilege.\u201d It is true that the carrier service involved in this case could lawfully be provided by an individual or a partnership rather than a corporation. But the statute does not disqualify a small enterprise merely by virtue of its size.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">One purpose of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 10, is to ensure \u201cbroad and balanced consideration of all aspects of the general public interest and welfare and not merely examination of the local and individual interests which might be affected.\u201d <em>New York Cent. R. R. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util. </em>347 Mass. 586, 592 (1964). Public service corporations often operate beyond the boundaries of a single city or town. See <em>New York Cent. R.R. </em>v. <em>Ridgefield, </em>84 N. J. Super. 85, 94 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>(1964); Rathkopf, Zoning and Planning (3d ed.) c. 72 (1972). The carrier here operated only within the town and the National Seashore, but it served tourists from afar. The DPU is empowered to balance the general interest against the local interest under the statute, and we think the town\u2019s fear that residential zoning will be \u201csubstantially im-perilled if not eliminated altogether\u201d is overdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">A final decree is to be entered in the county court affirming the decision and order of the DPU.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b419-6\"> <em>Wenham </em>v. <em>Department of Pub.
