L. c. 272, \u00a7 28A, for knowingly having in their possession on August 30,1973, for the purpose of exhibition, an \u201cobscene, indecent and impure motion picture film entitled \u2018The Devil In Miss Jones.\u2019 \u201d The corporate defendant was also indicted under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 32, for knowingly showing \u201ca lewd, obscene, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>indecent, immoral and impure show and entertainment by presenting and exhibiting a motion picture film entitled \u2018The Devil In Miss Jones.\u2019 \u201d The judge charged the jury on the basis of the constitutional standard set forth in <em>Miller </em>v. <em>California, </em>413 U. S. 15 (1973). The defendants were found guilty on each indictment. Each defendant was fined $5,000 on the \u00a7 28A indictments and the individual defendant was sentenced to two and one-half years in the house of correction. The indictment under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 32, was filed. The cases are before us on the defendants\u2019 appeals under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Although the defendants have argued numerous assignments of error, we need not deal with most of them. Our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Horton, ante, </em>164, decided this day, indicates that G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 28A, is unconstitutionally vague under the standard of the <em>Miller </em>case. The verdict under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 32, may not stand because \u00a7 32 is subject to the same constitutional infirmities as is \u00a7 28A. Our decisions construing \u00a7 32 have not given specificity to the general prohibition of \u00a7 32. We have suggested that the standard of \u00a7 32 is the same as that of \u00a7 28A for the purpose of determining obscenity <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moniz, </em>338 Mass. 442 [1959]), and have in effect given to \u00a7 32 a scope of application as broad as has been constitutionally permissible under the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. See P. B. <em>I. C. Inc. </em>v. <em>District Atty. of Suffolk County, </em>357 Mass. 770 (1970). Section 32, therefore, fails to meet the standard of specificity required by the <em>Miller </em>decision, and for the same reasons expressed in our decision in the <em>Horton </em>case, <em>ante, </em>164, we decline to reinterpret \u00a7 32 to provide judicially the description of specific sexual conduct which must exist to satisfy First Amendment requirements as now defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">\n<em>Judgments reversed and verdicts set aside.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b190-7\">Hennessey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aoi\">(concurring). I concur in the result and reasoning of the court\u2019s opinion, since I agree that we should apply the same constitutional consideration to G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 32, as we applied to G.

According to the court\u2019s opinion in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Horton, ante, </em>164, <em>Miller </em>v. <em>California, </em>413 U. S. 15 (1973), reduces the area of First Amendment protection in the field of obscenity. Perversely, however, this development is held to render invalid applications of the Massachusetts obscenity statutes which would have been valid before the <em>Miller </em>case. The <em>Miller </em>decision, it is said, renders our statutes unconstitutionally vague. In effect (with an inexplicable exception for material \u201charmful to minors\u201d), the Commonwealth now has no operative obscenity statutes. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">The court holds our statutes deficient with respect to only one element of the <em>Miller </em>standard: \u201cThe applicable State law, \u2018as written or authoritatively construed,\u2019 must specifically define the sexual conduct whose depiction or description is interdicted.\u201d Before the <em>Miller </em>case was decided, we had limited the operation of the Massachusetts statutes on the subject to portrayal of \u201cactual sexual congress or other activities commonly known as hard core pornography.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Palladino, </em>358 Mass. 28, 32 (1970). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donahue, </em>358 Mass. 803 (1970). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bitsocos, </em>361 Mass. 859 (1972). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Claflin, </em>Mass. App. Ct., (1973).<footnotemark>a</footnotemark> So limited, the statutes, as \u201cauthoritatively construed,\u201d contain the necessary reference to specifically defined sexual conduct. Within the limits set by our past decisions, the <em>Miller </em>case and its companions established no new constitutional obstacles. The Supreme Court of the United States now construes Federal obscenity statutes so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>as to conform to the <em>Miller </em>standard. <em>United States </em>v. <em>12 200-Ft. Reels of Super 8 MM. Film, </em>413 U. S. 123, 130, fn. 7 (1973). It clearly indicates that \u201cexisting state statutes, as construed heretofore or hereafter, may well be adequate.\u201d <em>Miller </em>v. <em>California, </em>413 U. S. at 24, fn. 6. We should follow the lead of the Supreme Court of the United States and construe our Massachusetts statutes to conform to the <em>Miller </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">The opinion of the court does not discuss the specific results they are reaching in the name of \u201cfreedom of speech\u201d and the need for \u201cguidance\u201d to our citizens. We think some elaboration is needed. The defendants were convicted of possessing an obscene motion picture film for the purpose of exhibition after the jury had been fully instructed on the basis of the <em>Miller </em>standard. We have viewed the film. After an opening scene in which the heroine commits suicide by slashing her wrists with a razor blade while in a bathtub, most of the film consists of a portrayal of her education in lust during an interval before she is to spend eternity in Hell. The scenes include her anal stimulation by a man with an artificial male organ, coitus and oral and anal copulation with the man, mutual masturbation and oral copulation with another woman, masturbation with fruit, with a snake, and with a hose, simultaneous oral copulation of two women with a man, simultaneous coitus and anal copulation by two men with the heroine, and finally, presumably in Hell, her unsuccessful attempts at seduction and masturbation in front of a disinterested man. The portrayal is explicit and detailed; the accompanying dialogue is explicitly and vulgarly anatomical.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">The court indicates that a statute referring to obscene pictures gives no guidance as to the status of the motion picture film involved in this case. The intimation is that an exhibitor might not know whether the film is obscene or not. An \u201cexpert\u201d called by the defendant proposed to testify that the film was \u201ca very interesting religious parable.\u201d We think, however, that with or without such expert help a jury could properly find that the film was hard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>core pornography and therefore obscene. Such a finding would not come as a surprise to any competent adult.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Since the court does not discuss other issues raised by the defendant, we do not consider them.</p>\n<footnote label=\"a\">\n<p id=\"pA3s\"> 298 N.
