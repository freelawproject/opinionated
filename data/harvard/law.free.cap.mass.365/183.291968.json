L. c. 272, \u00a732.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>Each of the films showed \u201cexplicit sexual congress.\u201d A controversy existed between the parties because the defendant had indicated that any film which showed explicit sexual congress was obscene and a showing of it would violate G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 32. After viewing the films and hearing testimony, including evidence from experts, the judge made extensive findings and rulings in January, 1973, applying then existing constitutional law principles as he interpreted them. He ruled that the films were \u201cnot utterly without social redeeming value\u201d and that they did not \u201caffront the current community standards of candor in depicting sexual material.\u201d A final decree was entered declaring that the showing of the films in the downtown or entertainment district of Boston, clearly rated \u201cX\u201d and restricted to adult patrons, and without provocative advertising, was constitutionally protected. Additionally, the defendant was enjoined from prosecuting, as violating G.L. c. 272, \u00a7 32, any theatre owner exhibiting the films under the conditions described in the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">In this appeal by the defendant, concerned with future showings of the films, the parties have urged us to decide whether after the decision in <em>Miller </em>v. <em>California, </em>413 U. S. 15 (1973), the showing of any of the films would constitute a violation of the Massachusetts obscenity statutes. Our decisions of today in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Horton, ante, </em>164 , and in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Capri Enterprises, Inc., ante, </em>179, which hold that G. L. c. 272, \u00a7\u00a7 28A and 32, are unconstitutional and unenforceable, demonstrate that the controversy which was the basis of the bill for declaratory relief can no longer properly exist. There is no reason for declaratory relief or for the continuance of the order against the defendant enjoining him from prosecuting the plaintiff under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 32, for showing any of the three films.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">The final decree is reversed and a new final decree shall be entered dismissing the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b194-10\">Hennessey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AjM\">(concurring). I concur in the result and reasoning of the court\u2019s opinion and would add the com-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>merits contained in my concurring opinion in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Horton, ante, </em>164.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b195-5\">Kaplan, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"aee-dedup-0\">concurring, refers to his concurring opinion in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Horton, ante, </em>164.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b195-6\">Braucher, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ABI\">(dissenting, with whom Reardon and Quir-</p>\n<p id=\"A7t\">ico, JJ., join). For the reasons stated in our dissenting opinion in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Capri Enterprises, Inc., ante, </em>179, we do not agree that G. L. c. 272, \u00a7\u00a7 28A and 32, are totally unconstitutional and unenforceable. This case is presented in a form which makes blanket condemnation of the statute even less appropriate than it is in the other cases. The exhibitor here obtained an injunction against prosecution for future crimes. Compare <em>P. B. I. C. Inc. </em>v. <em>District Atty. of Suffolk County, </em>357 Mass. 770 (1970). Any lack of specificity in the statute and our past decisions can be fully remedied by granting the declaratory relief sought. We should proceed to decide the case, applying the standard of <em>Miller </em>v. <em>California, </em>413 U. S. 15 (1973). Compare G. L. c. 272, \u00a7\u00a7 28B-28H, relating to books.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">We have examined the subsidiary findings made by the trial judge with respect to each of the three motion picture films which are the subject of this case. As to each, we conclude that exhibition in a public theatre could constitutionally be punished under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 32, as we would construe it. We would therefore so declare and deny injunctive relief.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
