The defendant was also convicted of assault with intent to murder another individual and of unlawfully carrying a firearm. In this appeal under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 \u00a7 33A-33G, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>defendant argues assignments of error relating to his claim that the admission of testimony of a clergyman violated the provisions of G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20A, which grants a testimonial privilege as to certain communications made to a clergyman.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AvP\">In order to set forth the circumstances under which the clergyman\u2019s testimony was admitted, it is not necessary to describe the trial in detail. It was not disputed that Miller died and another man was wounded as a result of being shot by a gun held by the defendant. There was conflicting testimony as to the circumstances under which the gun was discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"An8q\">The defendant testified on direct examination that he had never owned a weapon or carried one in his life. On cross-examination he testified that for at least a year prior to February 15,1973 (the date of the shootings) he neither owned nor possessed a gun. In the course of his testimony the defendant said that it was Miller and not he who had possession of a gun from time to time.</p>\n<p id=\"AcU5\">After the defendant had rested, the Commonwealth offered testimony from the Rev. Dennis Orson, pastor of a Lutheran Church in East Boston. He testified that he knew the defendant and was in his company around Christmas of 1972. At this point defence counsel requested a voir dire \u201cwith respect to the provisions of... [G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20 A].\u201d A bench conference was then held. The prosecutor indicated that he did not \u201cexpect to elicit any communication, any speech from this minister. I expect to ask him what he saw with regard to the defendant. Did he see a gun <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>in his possession? And I don\u2019t believe that is covered by this particular statute.\u201d Defence counsel pressed his request for a voir dire, arguing that the showing of a gun could be a communication whose disclosure was barred under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20A, in the absence of the defendant\u2019s consent. In the course of further colloquy, the Commonwealth stipulated that \u201cthe purpose of... [Mr. Orson and the defendant] being together was in accord with the statute.\u2019\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">The judge denied the request for a voir dire, and the defendant excepted to the ruling. The judge instructed Mr. Orson not to relate \u201cany conversation or other communications that you might have had with the defendant\u201d and advised him that his testimony would be limited by the prosecutor\u2019s questions to what he observed. It seems reasonably clear that the judge concluded that the act of displaying a gun would not be a \u201ccommunication\u201d within the meaning of that word in \u00a7 20A, even if performed in the course of a conversation protected under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Mr. Orson then testified, over the defendant\u2019s further objection and exception, that around Christmas time in 1972 when he was traveling in his car with the defendant, the defendant took a handgun from his clothing and placed it in the glove compartment of the car, and that at the end of the trip the defendant removed the gun from the glove compartment and took it with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">In the context of this case the only portion of \u00a7 20A which is arguably applicable is that which provides that no minister shall \u201ctestify as to any communcation made to him by any person in seeking religious or spiritual advice or comfort . . . without the consent of such person.\u201d The Commonwealth\u2019s stipulation that the purpose of Mr. Orson and the defendant\u2019s being together was \u201cin accord with the statute\u201d amounts to a concession that the defendant was \u201cseeking religious or spiritual advice or comfort\u201d in the course of the automobile trip. Thus under \u00a7 20A all conversation between the two as an incident to a quest for religious or spiritual advice or comfort was inadmissible in the absence of the defendant\u2019s consent. If the word \u201ccommunication\u201d in \u00a7 20A includes the act of the defendant in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>displaying the gun, testimony as to that fact was also inadmissible under \u00a7 20A without the defendant\u2019s consent, provided the display took place as part of a quest for religious or spiritual advice or comfort.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">We believe that the word \u201ccommunication\u201d in \u00a7 20A is not limited to conversation and includes other acts by which ideas may be transmitted from one person to another. Such is the general rule with respect to the scope of the attorney-client privilege (see Wigmore, Evidence [McNaughton rev.] \u00a7 2306 [1961]; McCormick, Evidence [2d ed.] \u00a7 89 [1972]; <em>Klefbeck </em>v. <em>Dous, </em>302 Mass. 383, 389 [1939] [letters]; <em>Vigoda </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>348 Mass. 478, 485 [1965] [letters]; <em>City &amp; County of San Francisco </em>v. <em>Superior Court of the City &amp; County of San Francisco, </em>37 Cal. 2d 227, 235 [1951]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Douglass, </em>20 W. Va. 770 780-781 [1882]), and we see no reason for construing more narrowly the privilege granted in \u00a7 20A. We think it significant that G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20, uses the word \u201cconversations\u201d in dealing with the testimonial disqualification of a spouse as to \u201cprivate conversations.\u201d Such \u201cconversations\u201d have been interpreted as not including written communications. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caponi, </em>155 Mass. 534, 537 (1892). The adoption by the Legislature of the word \u201ccommunication\u201d (and not \u201cconversation\u201d) in the very next section of G. L. c. 233 manifests an intention to include more than conversations in the privilege concerning testimony of a clergyman.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Because the act of showing a gun might constitute a privileged communication under \u00a7 20A and because we do not know whether the defendant\u2019s action with respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>the gun in the presence of Mr. Orson was in the course of \u201cseeking religious or spiritual advice or comfort,\u201d the defendant\u2019s request for a voir dire should have been granted. Thus Mr. Orson\u2019s testimony concerning the gun may have been admitted in violation of \u00a7 20A.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Although on this record it is possible that Mr. Orson\u2019s testimony that the defendant displayed a gun to him was not admissible under \u00a7 20A, we do not regard the admission of that testimony as prejudicial error justifying reversal of the defendant\u2019s convictions. Proof that the defendant had had a gun in his possession two months before the shootings was not essential to the Commonwealth\u2019s case. Thus the rebuttal evidence offered through Mr. Orson dealt with a collateral issue and was presumably offered solely to impeach the defendant\u2019s testimony that he had not possessed a gun during the year before the crime.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Moreover, the Commonwealth presented other witnesses, including two rebuttal witnesses, who testified that they had seen the defendant in possession of a gun within a year before the shootings. Mr. Orson\u2019s testimony was therefore only cumulative and its admission not prejudicial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gliniecki, </em>339 Mass. 464, 469 (1959). In these circumstances there is no reasonable basis for setting aside the convictions because of any error in the admission of the clergyman\u2019s testimony. Nor is there any basis for us to order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>a new trial or to direct the entry of a lesser verdict of guilt upon our consideration of the whole case under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Arf\"> General Laws c. 233, \u00a7 20A, inserted by St. 1962, c. 372, reads as follows: \u201cA priest, rabbi or ordained or licensed minister of any church or an accredited Christian Science practitioner shall not, without the consent of the person making the confession, be allowed to disclose a confession made to him in his professional character, in the course of discipline enjoined by the rules or practice of the religious body to which he belongs; nor shall a priest, rabbi or ordained or licensed minister of any church or an accredited Christian Science practitioner testify as to any communication made to him by any person in seeking religious or spiritual advice or comfort, or as to his advice given thereon in character, without the consent of such person.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b251-7\"><em> </em>Because of the Commonwealth\u2019s concession and because there was no evidence concerning the specific circumstances under which the gun was shown to Mr. Orson, we have no occasion to consider whether a privileged situation existed. For cases concerned with the existence of privileged circumstances see Wigmore, Evidence (McNaughton rev.) \u00a7 2395, fn. 2 (1961).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b251-9\"> We note that in the statute concerning the privilege of a patient to bar the disclosure of any \u201ccommunication\u201d to a psychotherapist (G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B, inserted by St. 1968, c. 418), the word \u201ccommunication\u201d is defined to include \u201cactions\u201d and \u201coccurrences\u201d as well as \u201cconversations\u201d and \u201ccorrespondence.\u201d This statute was enacted after St. 1962, c. 372, inserting \u00a7 20A, and thus should not be construed as affecting the meaning of the word \u201ccommunication\u201d in \u00a7 20A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b252-6\"> A nonprivileged communication from a person to a clergyman could, of course, be made at about the same time as other communications which are granted statutory privilege. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>95 Iowa 381, 385 (1895). Obviously the clergyman\u2019s statements concerning the circumstances surrounding the communication must be given considerable weight. His view is not conclusive, however, because it is the judge who must make the determination whether a communication occurred in circumstances described in \u00a7 20A. Although it may not always be easy to pass on this factual question without trespassing into the possibly privileged communication itself, in circumstances such as exist in this case the attempt should nevertheless be made.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b252-7\"> Extrinsic evidence to rebut a witness on a collateral matter is not admissible as of right (see <em>Gorham </em>v. <em>Moor, </em>197 Mass. 522, 525 [1908]; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>308 Mass. 481, 495 [1941]) although, in the judge\u2019s discretion, it is not error to admit such testimony. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hersey, </em>324 Mass. 196, 202 (1949). Here, however, the defendant raised no objection to the admissibility of the impeaching evidence on this ground, perhaps because the defendant himself raised the subject first by testifying on direct examination that he had never owned or carried a gun.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
