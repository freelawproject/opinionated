It is no argument against this construction and this inter\u25a0pretation of the legislative intent, that the attempt to invest justice\u2019s courts with jurisdiction was defeated by the constitutional provision which restricts the jurisdiction of these courts, in cases of tort, not only to one hundred dollars, but to injuries to personal property, thus excluding penalties for the non-performance of a public duty. The case of <em>Solomon </em>v. <em>Western TJnion Telegraph </em>Company, 92 <em>Ga. </em>360, reviewed and affirmed. <em>Judgment reversed.</em></headnotes>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b449-6\">April 21, 1894.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"p\" id=\"AY1\">Argued at the last term.</p>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-7\">Action for penalty.

Plaintiff appealed to the superior court, where defendant filed a demurrer on the ground that the county court had no jurisdiction of the case, it being a suit to recover a penalty, and the jurisdiction of the county court being limited to suits on -contracts and torts. The demurrer was sustained.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
