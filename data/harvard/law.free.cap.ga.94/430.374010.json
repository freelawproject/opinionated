If the case of <em>Cincinnati &amp;c..Railway </em>v. <em>Disbrow &amp; Co., </em>76 <em>Qa. </em>253, is to be construed as at variance with this ruling, it is in conflict with sections 3767, 3768, of the code, as well as with the established law as it existed prior to the code. For this reason the case mentioned should be treated as colored and controlled by its own peculiar facts, including the circumstance that the party whose duplicate of the contract was not lost was probably put upon notice prior to the trial that the duplicate of the other party had been lost, this notice resulting from the examination of a witness by interrogatories before the trial to prove the loss and verify a copy of the instrument.</headnotes>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b446-9\">March 26, 1894.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"p\" id=\"AhY\">Argued at the last term.</p>\n<disposition data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"Aea\">\n<em>Judgment reversed,.</em>\n</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-10\">Action for damages.

To John C. Hines, 515 Broad street, Rome, Ga. Have work; come at once. J. B. Dabney.\u201d Plaintiff alleged, that because of said nondelivery he did not go to Birmingham, and thereby failed to obtain employment which, under previous contract with Dabney (setting it forth), he would have obtained had he received the notice contained in the message and gone to Birmingham in response thereto. He obtained a verdict, and defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial was overruled. The only ground of the motioxx material to this report is, that the court allowed plaintiff to testify to the contents of the message set out in the declaration, over objection that it did not appear that the ox\u2019iginal message filed in the Birmingham office was lost or mislaid, and that said origixial was the best evidence of its owxi contents. It appeared from plaintiff\u2019s evidence, that the message set out in the declaration was delivered to him, but xxot until twelve days after its date, axxd not uxxtil he had gone to the telegraph office and inquired if there was a message for him; and that he delivered this dispatch to his counsel, and it was afterwards lost, and though diligently searched for, could not be found. He testified that the copy set out in the declaration was correct.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
