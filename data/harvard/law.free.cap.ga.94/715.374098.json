He claimed to have been upon a street or road <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>crossing; that the train ran against him without any signal or warning of its approach having been given; and that he was unable to see it before going upon the track, by reason of a train of freight-cars standing on a side-track next to the main line.
