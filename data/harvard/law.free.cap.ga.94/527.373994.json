Where a tenant is proceeded against as holding over, and he files a counter-affidavit denying the tenancy, he may be charged with double rent for the time he held over, up to the date of the trial, although nothing is said of rent in the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit to obtain the warrant. The statute annexes this incident to a wrongful holding over.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b544-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>\u25a02.

By counter-affidavit- Pettis denied that he held the land, by lease or rent or at will or sufferance from Brewster or any one holding under him. By amendment he alleged, that he went into possession under contract of purchase; that the land was useful only for farming, and it was necessary to expend much money for repairs to houses and fences, clearing land, etc., which improvements he made by direction of Brewster\u2019s agent who assured him he would not lose the same; and he asked to recoup their value against the claim for rent. 'The jury found for the plaintiff\" $371 rent, and the premises. Defendant\u2019s motion for anew trial was overruled. The motion alleged, in addition to the general grounds, that the court erred in admittin g testimony of Pettis that the land was worth about $240 a year for rent, over objection of his counsel that the affidavit on which the warrant was based did not allege any amount which the land was worth for rent; that the court erred in charging the jury that plaintiff would be entitled to recover interest on whatever amount was found to be \u25a0double the amount the land was worth for rent; and further erred in charging that before defendant could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>.set off the value of improvements against the demand for rent, the parties must have agreed as to the kind of improvements to be made and the amount to be expended therefor, except such improvements as were necessary to protect crops.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AZ7\">L.
