The executors had the right to proceed, after the probate in common form, with the due administration of the estate, and the issue of <em>devisavit vel non </em>could not be thus collaterally raised.</headnotes>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b495-9\">April 9, 1894.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"p\" id=\"Ard\">Argued at the last term.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"A6m\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<summary id=\"b496-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>Petition.
