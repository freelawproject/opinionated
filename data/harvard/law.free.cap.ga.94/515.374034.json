And the like presumptions prevail as to the regularity of the proceeding, such as the necessary order directing the county surveyor to lay off the homestead, and the due administration of the statutory oath to the surveyor touching the correctness of the plat and the value of the property. In any collateral attack upon the homestead made after such a lapse of time, the burden of proving the want <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>of jurisdiction, or the omission of any essential step in the proceeding is upon the party making the attack.</headnotes>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b532-3\">April 23, 1894.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"p\" id=\"AG1\">Argued at the last term.</p>\n<disposition data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"Az4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-4\">Levy and claim.

C. Williams as agent for the minor children of Joel Williams. The case, was submitted to the judge upon the question whether the homestead of Joel Williams, on which the claim rested, was good or not, it not having expired, and said minors being original beneficiaries thereunder. The homestead papers were admitted in evidence, over objections that they did not show that the applicant was the head of a family, nor set forth any reason why he was entitled to a homestead ; that they did not show he was a resident of Calhoun county; that they showed no order of the ordinary to the surveyor to lay off a homestead, and the surveyor\u2019s return did not show that this was done in accordance with such order, and his return was not properly sworn to. The homestead papers were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-6\">\u201c Georgia, Calhoun county.
