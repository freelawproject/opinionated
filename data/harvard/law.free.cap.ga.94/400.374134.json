He was convicted, and his motion for a new trial was overruled. The grounds of the motion are, that the verdict is contrai\u2019y to law and evidence; and that \u201cthe court erred in allowing witness Wilkins to testify as to confessions made to him at the jail, and after certain inducements had been made to the defendant by a partner of \u25a0said Wilkins,\u201d and \u201cin allowing witness Wilkins and William E. Jones to state that they went to the jail because they had received a message from defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A-q\">William E. Jones testified: Defendant was arrested \u2022on Tuesday after the burglary on Saturday night. I had a talk with him; we tried to get him to tell us if he had been down in the store or not; then I had another talk with him at the jail. He sent me word by his father to come there to see him, and I went. I never \u25a0offered him any inducement at all to make any confes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>siou to me. He admitted to me that he was in the store at time of burglary. He told me all about how burglary was committed, and that he went to the store before we closed up. I told him that it would be better if he told the whole thing. I told him that the court was sometimes lighter on parties who told it all. I swore that I said that to him in the committing court; but what I have told that he told me about his committing burglary, was first told me by him without any inducements from me whatever; and then after that I told him that the court was sometimes lighter on the party who told it all, but I offered him no inducement to get him to tell what he did. He sent for me to come out there, that he wanted to tell me all about it; and when I got there he told me that he had sent his father for me so that he could make to me this confession. This pin goes through the window-facing, and this key is inserted in the hole; and he told me that they would go around there on Saturday night, pretending to get water, and pull the pin or key out and put it down over the pin this way (indicating), and then they could go on the outside and pull the pin out and get in that way, and then they would close the window'and key it properly and come out the door and leave it open, so we would not get on to how they got in. We had had burglaries to occur, and we had endeavored to find out how they got in, but could not. He said that they had been in there several times; that they got two guns, two pairs of shoes and \u201crashins,\u2019 and carried them off. I tried to get him to tell who was with him, but he would not; and I told him if he would come out and tell the whole thing, it might be lighter on him, and then he gave me a list of names who he said were in there with him. I came back to the store, and I found the window just as he said it was; and I could see a little sign on the wall on the outside where they had climbed in through the window. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>also told me that the coat was his, and that he pulled it off so if he had to run he did not want any coat on. (The coat was identified by other witnesses as having been left in the storehouse on the night of the burglary, and a's belonging to defendant.) He told me who the other parties were, and I had them arrested; but I could not find out anything against them except what he said, and I turned them loose.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Apq\">G. F. Cox and T. O. Lovett, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Aqd\">W. H. Davis, solicitor-general, <em>contra.</em></attorneys>\n<p id=\"b418-3\">W. A. Wilkins testified: I had a talk with Alfred a few days after he was arrested. I think it was the same day Jones had his convei\u2019sation with him. (Question : \u201cWhat did he tell you?\u201d Counsel for defendant here objected to Wilkins testifying to any confession made by defendant to him, on the ground that Jones had held out inducement. By the court: \u201cIf there was any promise held out to the defendant, it was to te.ll who the other parties were; and any admissions as to who the other parties were I don\u2019t think would be admissible, and so rule. But, according to the witness\u2019s testimony, he held out no promise to him to get any confession as to his own guilt.\u201d) Witness : I went there in response to a message that I had received, and he told me how they got in (describing the mode of entrance, etc., substantially as stated in Jones\u2019 testimony). He told me that he stole a gun, a watch and some shoes; and these articles were missed. He said that they carried the things off; that they had been in there before four or five times. We always found the door open and the window closed; it was always on Saturday night,, because the store would be open until 10 or 11 o\u2019clock, and these boys would go in there and pretend to get-water and unkey this window; and if he had not told us, we would not have known anything about it yet.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
