The money was claimed by various, creditors who obtained their judgments under the petition above mentioned, April 1, 1893. Branan Bros.,, who had obtained judgment on May 19, 1892, after the appointment of the receiver but upon suit begun before such appointment, insisted that the money should be first applied to their judgment, as it was of older date than those of the other creditors mentioned. The judge held that, after paying costs and attorney\u2019s fees to certain mortgages older than any \"judgment, the money should be prorated between all the judgments; and refused to give any preference to Branan Bros.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
