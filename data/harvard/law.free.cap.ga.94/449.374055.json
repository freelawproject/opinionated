Consequently, upon a subsequent trial of the claim \u25a0case a verdict should have been rendered for the claimant as to - three fourths of the premises embraced in the levy, and it was error to direct a general verdict in favor of the plaintiff in execution. <em>Judgment reversed,.</em></headnotes>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b465-10\">March 26, 1894.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"p\" id=\"AME\">Argued at the last term,</p>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Levy and claim.
