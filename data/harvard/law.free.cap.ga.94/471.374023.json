In order for a common carrier by whom the transportation begun on a preceding connecting line is to be completed, to take the benefit of a special contract between the shipper and the initial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>carrier, limiting liability in. case of loss to a stipulated value per' hundred pounds, it must appear either that the contract was such as to bind the initial carrier for full performance, so as to make the second carrier the agent of the first, or else that the reduced, rate forming the consideration of. the special contract was not confined to the line of the first carrier, but was, either by the contract itself or by the act of the second carrier in rating and billing the goods over his line, extended and applied to that line also.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b488-4\">2. A special contract expressed in a bill of lading and in the written assent of the shipper to its terms, which relates to a consignment' of goods from a given point on one railway to a given point on another, and which purports on its face to be a through bill of lading but expressly limits the undertaking of the first company to performance on its own line, with no further duty on its part but to deliver to the connecting line, and which names no rate of freight further than the terminus of the first line, but expressly excludes any guaranty of a rate beyond that point, does not bind the first company, the one with which the contract was made, to complete, either by itself or by the second company as its agent, the whole transportation. And although the contract provides on its face for extension to the second company, at the option of the-latter, of the benefits secured to the former in consequence of the reduced rate, yet, it not appearing that the second company availed itself' of this privilege by shipping the goods over its line at a reduced rate, and the goods having been destroyed by fire upon that line, presumably by reason of negligence on the part of this company, the latter is liable to account therefor to the owner at full value, there being, so far as appears, no consideration to uphold any agreement with it, express or implied, to accept the conventional value agreed upon with the first company and specified on the face of the bill of lading. <em>Judgment affirmed.</em></headnotes>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b488-5\">April 9, 1894.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"p\" id=\"AWX\">Argued at the last term.</p>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-6\">Action for damages. Before Judge Jenkins. Wilkinson superior court. April term, 1893.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Mrs. Bridger obtained a verdict against the Central Railroad Co. for the admitted market value of goods-shipped by her from Toccoa, Ga., by the Richmond &amp; Danville Railroad Co., to be carried from there to Atlanta, and thence by defendant\u2019s line to Gordon, Ga. The goods were received in good order by defendant-from the Richmond &amp; Danville Co., and were desti\u2019oyed by fire while in defendant\u2019s possession at Sunnyside station. It does not appear how the fire occurred. De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>fendant moved\u2019 for a new trial on the general grounds,, and because the court ruled that the bill of lading under which the goods were shipped was not an express contract as between plaintiff and defendant; that plaintiff was not bound by the valuation expressed in the bill <em>of </em>lading; and that any benefits that might belong to the Richmond &amp; Danville Co. thereunder, would not inure to the benefit of defendant. The motion was overruled. The bill of lading (which was signed for the shipper as well as for the carrier) purports to be a through bill of lading. The material parts of it are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\">\u201cMarked, R. Bridger, Gordon, Ga. Rates guaranteed only from Toccoa to Atlanta, at 33 cts. per hundred pounds.
