If the plaintiff was the sole stockholder whose interest was affected by the default attributed to the directors, he should have so alleged in his petition. As the corporation is, in contemplation of law, the party directly and immediately aggrieved by any want <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>of diligence or fidelity in the conduct of its directors, it should be a party defendant to an action brought by the stockholders, in order that the result may bind it and bar any future action which it might bring for the same cause. <em>Judgment affirmed.</em></headnotes>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b503-5\">April 9, 1894.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"p\" id=\"ATY\">Argued at the last term.</p>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-6\">Equitable petition.

Defendants demurred for want of proper parties, and because they were not liable to plaintiff as a stockholder for damages sustained by reason of negligence. The demurrer was \u25a0sustained, and plaintiff excepted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
