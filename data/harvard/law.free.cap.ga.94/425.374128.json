Plaintiff obtained judgment of the justice for $95 with interest and cost. Defendant carried the case to the superior court by <em>certiorari, </em>alleging that the justice erred, in sustaining plaintiff\u2019s motion to strike the plea that the vendor\u2019s purchase money debt had been satisfied; in giving judgment for plaintiff, contrary to law and evidence, in that the testimony of defendant of a former suit was received without objection, and yet judgment was given for plaintiff; in giving judgment for plaintiff, contrary to law and evidence, in that the testimony introduced by plaintiff showed that she was not defendant\u2019s vendor, and that his vendor had his purchase money debt satisfied by plaintiff paying said vendor a valuable consideration on the purchase money note, without holding the vendor liable in the event the note was not paid by the maker (defendant); and in giving judgment for plaintiff, contrary to law and evidence, in that it appeared from the testimony for the plaintiff that she did not sell the mule to defendant, and therefore she could not sustain her attachment for purchase money. In the superior court the <em>certiorari </em>was dismissed on plaintiff\u2019s motion, because there should have.been an appeal, the amount involved being over $50, and there being a disputed question of fact. Defendant assigned this judgment as error, because, (1) \u201cthere was no question of disputed facts involved in the certiorari\u201d; and (2) \u201cthere was an unmixed proposition of law, the adjudication of which would have completely and finally overruled the justice\u2019s judgment* and disposed of the case.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
