Sanders, Jr., of the city of New York, in the county of New York and State of New York, of the second part, witnesseth that the said party of the first part, for and in consideration of the sum of ten hundred and fifty dollars, lawful money of the United States of America, to them in hand well and truly paid by the party of the second part at and before the sealing and delivery of these presents, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, and the yearly assessment or rent, and covenants .hereinafter mentioned and reserved to be kept paid and performed, have demised, leased and let and hereby do demise, lease and let unto the said Charles W.

II., c. 28), </em>and was first enacted in New Jersey in \u201cAn act concerning landlords and tenants,\u201d passed March 10th, 1195. Its main object, as stated in the act of 1195, was to get rid of the inconveniences caused by \u201cthe many niceties that attend' re-entries at common law\u201d for non-payment of rent, and it authorizes a landlord, to whom six months' rent is due and who has a right to enter therefor, to bring his action of ejectment without the formal demand and re-entry required by the common law. It seems applicable to every species of rent between landlord and tenant, provided, of course, the other circumstances mentioned in the statute are present.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">\u201cRent\u201d is defined by Bouvier as \u201cthe compensation, either in money, provisions, chattels or labor, received by the owner of the soil from the occupant thereof.\u201d Although .rent is usually paid in money, yet this species is the ancient \u201crent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>service,\u201d which Chief Baron Gilbert defined as \u201can annual return made by the tenant, either in labor, money or provisions, in retribution for the land that passes\u201d <em>(GilB. rents </em>9), the return in money being a substitute for the service originally required. Gilbert further said: \u201cWhen the services are expressed in the contract the <em>quantum </em>must be either certainly mentioned or be such as, by reference to something else, may be reduced to a certainty,\u201d and he cites as sufficiently certain a contract to shear all the landlord\u2019s sheep in a designated manor. <em>Id. </em>10. This degree of certainty is one of the properties .of rent at common law. <em>Tayl. Land. &amp; T., </em>\u00a7 369.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Beyond controversy the sum payable under this lease has all the qualities of rent, except, perhaps, certainty. The landlord, the demise of land for a term of years, the tenant, and the annual recompense to be made by the tenant to the landlord for the use of the land, are all embodied in the instrument. We think also that the requisite degree of certainty exists. The lease itself .fixes a maximum limit, and within that limit the precise sum is to be ascertained each year by the landlord\u2019s requisition upon the tenant. This is as definite as in the case mentioned by Gilbert, where the landlord had control of the number of sheep to be sheared, provided, I suppose, he did not surcharge the pasture of the manor. Although the lease calls the sum thus ascertained an assessment, yet it cannot, under other expressions in the lease, be deemed an assessment in any sense inconsistent with its being also, as the lease styles it, \u201ca yearly rent for the demised premises.\u201d It has no resemblance to an assessment levied under the taxing power of government either for general purposes or for special benefit received; it is an assessment only as any charge fixed by one person on another is such.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">The seventh section of our Landlord and Tenant act-applies to the rent reserved in this lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">The second question certified is whether the notice in this case, which is in evidence, is in compliance with the terms of this lease, and is it such a notice as would work a forfeiture even if found to have been given ?</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">The <em>notice </em>here referred to is <em>Exhibit </em>7, which, at the be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>ginning, is addressed to the defendant by his proper name, and notifies him that the rent of his lots for several designated years, at designated rates, is due, and then proceeds to demand that \u201cyon, the said JEL M. Sanders,\u201d pay the same or incur the forfeiture prescribed in the lease. The objection made to this notice is that in the <em>demand </em>it refers to the defendant as \u201cyou, the said PI. M. Sanders,\u201d that being the name of the defendant\u2019s brother, who owned four adjoining lots in the Grove. We think it clear that this clerical error did irot impair the effect of the writing as a <em>notice </em>to the defendant, which is the thing required by the lease, and that even in the <em>demand </em>it did not mislead the defendant or leave him in any doubt that he was the person intended. Outside of this <em>Exhibit </em>7, the testimony in the case was such as to present \u00e1 question of fact whether due notice had not been annually given.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">The third question certified is whether the form and method of laying the assessment by the trustees, as proven by the minutes in evidence, was a proper .official act for so doing, and did legally levy an assessment under the power conferred by the lease or demise in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">The following entries in the minutes are samples of the acts of the trustees, so far as recorded:</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">October 11th, 1886, annual meeting. \u2014 \u201cIt was ordered to make the assessment six ($6) dollars for 1887.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">October 15th, 1890. \u2014 \u201cIt was ordered to make the assessment for 1891 $7.50 per lot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">These resolutions are very meagre, but they seem to have been understood by all parties as fixing the rent for each lot in Ocean Grove held under the association for the stated year, which for each tenant would be the year of his term beginning or ending in that year, according to his previous payments. If so understood, they were legally sufficient for all the purposes of the lease, since, thus construed, they expressed the will of the landlord, which, within the contractual limit, is untrammeled as to both form and substance.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
