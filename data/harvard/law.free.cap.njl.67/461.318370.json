By the ordinance, the sidewalk is to be laid at the cost of. the owners of the land in front of which the same is laid, and the owners are permitted to do the work, if done within thirty days, else to he done by the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>The power to pass this ordinance is derived from the third subdivision of the thirty-third section of \u201cA general act relating to boroughs\u201d [Revision of 1897] <em>(Pamph. L., p. </em>285), which is: \u201cThe council shall have power and authority, by general or special ordinance to provide for constructing, relaying, repairing and keeping in repair the sidewalks of any and all streets, roads or public places in the borough, at the cost and expense of the owner or owners of the lands in front of which the same may be so constructed, relaid or repaired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">The provisions of the ordinance. were within the power of the council to pass, and the law was-complied with in all respects as to the manner of its passage.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">In-the year 1895, and previous to the passage of the ordinance, a sidewalk had been laid on South Orange avenue, in front of the property of the prosecutors, by the property owners, consisting of four-foot flagging, one and one-fourth inches thick, with flags of an average width of two feet nine inches. The ground was graded and the flags laid on the ground, not with cement, so as to prevent the weeds from coming between the joints. A few of the flags had become broken, and grass and weeds grew up between the stones. The flags are laid at varying distances from the curbstone. South Orange avenue is the main street of the borough, and is eighty feet wide and has much travel upon it; and the engineer of the prosecutors testifies that it is not a permanent sidewalk.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">The law imposes upon the council the duty of saying when sidewalks shall be constructed, relaid or repaired, and when, .as in this case, it appears from the evidence that their discretion has been exercised in a reasonable and proper manner, the court has no power to interfere. <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Paterson, </em>37 <em>Vroom </em>533; <em>Van Reipen </em>v. <em>Jersey City, </em>29 <em>Id. </em>262; <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Passaic, </em>31 <em>Id. </em>404; <em>Oakley </em>v. <em>Atlantic City, </em>34 <em>Id. </em>127. In the last case cited the court held that \u201cin the absence of fraud or palpable abuse of discretion on the part of the municipal authorities in the exercise of power granted by the legislature, the only question for judicial cognizance is whether there has been any violation of legal principles or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>neglect of prescribed formalities in entering into the engagement which is the subject of controversy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">The ordinance ip affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
