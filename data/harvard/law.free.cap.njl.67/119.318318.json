Rosenfeld </em>v. <em>Einstein, </em>17 <em>Vroom </em>479.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">The right is not to be given to gratify curiosity or for speculative purposes, but only when its exercise is sought in good faith and for a specific purpose. Such purpose must appear by the proofs on the application or the writ will be denied. <em>Matter of </em>Steinway, 159 <em>N. Y. </em>250; <em>Ph\u0153nix Iron Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>113 <em>Pa. St. </em>563; <em>Rosenfeld </em>v. <em>Einstein, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">The allowance of the writ is within the discretion of the court, upon the facts presented in each particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">In the application now before the court there is no evidence indicating the purpose of the relator in seeking the right to inspect the cash-book and other books of the company, and in that condition of the proof the writ must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">Among the books mentioned in this application is the stock-book. Every stockholder, by our statute, has a right to inspect that at all times during business hours. <em>Pamph. L. </em>1896, <em>p. </em>288, \u00a7 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">There was no claim on the argument that the right to inspect the stock-book alone was'denied to the relator. Indeed, the proof shows that it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-11\">The writ in this case is denied, but without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
