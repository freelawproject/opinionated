L., p. </em>201.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-15\">The purpose of that act is to give to certain municipalities the power to adopt the internal machinery provided by its terms. One of the distinguishing features to be possessed by each member of the class upon which this legislation is operative is that it shall either have a special charter or be governed by a special act of incorporation. I am unable to distinguish the case the court is now called upon to decide from those that already it has decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-16\">The act in question is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-17\">The relator is entitled to judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
