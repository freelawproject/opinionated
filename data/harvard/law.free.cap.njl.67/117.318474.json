The jurisdiction conferred upon a justice of the peace in suits for a penalty under the act entitled \u201cAn act to regulate the practice of pharmacy in this state,\u201d approved March 19th, 1901, is to be exercised by such justice as a judge of the Court for the Trial of Small Causes, and not as a common law magistrate.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b161-10\">2.

Large.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b162-7\">For the defendant, <em>George E. Clymer.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b162-8\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b162-9\">Fort, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ar3\">This is a suit to recover a penalty under the act entitled \u201cAn act to regulate the practice of pharmacy in this state,\u201d approved March 19th, 1901. <em>Pamph. L., p. 85.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">The return shows that the proceedings were brought in the Court for the Trial of Small Causes. It is contended that this is error, and that the proceeding should have been before a justice of the peace as a common law magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-11\">We cannot so construe this statute. We think that the proceeding was rightly brought in the Court for the Trial of Small Causes.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-12\">The statute reads as follows: \u201cAny person who shall violate any of the provisions of this act shall forfeit and pay for each and every offence the sum of one hundred dollars (together with costs) as a penalty therefor; to be sued for and recovered by and in the name of the \u2018board of pharmacy of the State of New Jersey.\u2019 * * * Any justice of the peace in the county or any District Court in the city, where the offence shall have been committed, under any section of this act, shall have authority and jurisdiction to hear and determine said action,, and to render judgment therein, with costs, according to the laws and practice governing said courts in similar actions,\u201d &amp;c. <em>Pamph. L. </em>1901, <em>p. </em>90, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-13\">The penalty here provided for is to be recovered by a suit in a court not before a magistrate. This must be so as to the District Court, and it is equally clear that it was intended that the justice of the peace, sitting in such cases, should sit in the Court for 'the Trial of Small Causes \u2014 the only \u201ccourt\u201d which that official holds. The language of this statute is much the same as that passed upon by this court in <em>Pennsylvania Rail</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number><em>road Co. </em>v. <em>New Jersey </em>Society, <em>&amp;c., </em>10 Vroom 400, and should receive the same construction as there given. <em>White </em>v. <em>Neptune </em>City, 27 <em>Id. </em>222.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The action was properly commenced by a summons, duly served under the Small Cause act, and by a state of demand filed in that court stating the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">This finding makes it necessary to consider only one other objection found in the record. The justice refused a demand for a trial by jury, and proceeded to the trial of the cause before himself without a jury. This was error. The defendant is entitled to a trial by jury under the \u201cAct for the trial of small causes in eases triable in that court.\u201d <em>Gen. Stat., p. </em>1871, \u00a7 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">The justice had no jurisdiction to try the case without a jury, a timely demand for one having been made. <em>Cary </em>v. Forsyth, <em>Pen. </em>*432; <em>Meirs </em>v. Bussom, 28 <em>Vroom </em>383.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">The conviction is set aside, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
