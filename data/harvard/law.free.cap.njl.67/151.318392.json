On the 26th day of December, 1899, the town of Montclair entered into a contract with the prosecutor with relation to the public lighting of the streets of the town, by the terms of which the prosecutor was required to erect and maintain at such places, within the public streets of the town, as might be directed by its \u201clighting committee,\u201d two hundred or more incandescent lamps, and to furnish and erect the necessary poles therefor. In pursuance of this contract the locations of the lamps called for by its provisions were agreed upon by the parties to it, and the prosecutor thereupon proceeded to erect poles at the points so fixed. At one of these points it erected a pole without obtaining the consent, in writing, of the owner in front of whose property it was located; and this is the act which is alleged by the town to be a violation of the ordinance of November 18th, 1895, and which is the foundation of the conviction had against the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">The duty imposed upon the prosecutor, by the contract of December 26th, 1899, of erecting poles in such places in the public streets as the \u201clighting committee\u201d of the town should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>direct, was an absolute one, and not a duty the performance of which was conditioned upon the ability of the prosecutor to obtain the consent of abutting owners thereto. The necessary effect of the imposition of this duty upon the prosecutor was to -relieve it from the prohibition of the ordinance so far as the erection of poles in the locations designated by the \u201clighting committee\u201d was concerned. Eor this reason the Court of Common 'Pleas should have set aside the conviction had before the recorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">The judgment under review should be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
