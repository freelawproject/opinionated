This criticism is well founded as to the clause \u201csetting forth the plaintiff as a common thief /\u2019 but as to the charge that the defendant caused to be published that the plaintiff had a wire unknown to the defendant, &amp;c., the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>criticism is borne out by the plain import of the language of the <em>narr. </em>With respect to this latter charge the plaintiff\u2019s pleading purports to state just what the defendant caused to be published, which included the published statement that the plaintiff \u201cwas and did willfully and fraudulently cheat the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Despite the disregard of grammar in the construction of this statement, it would, J think, be generally taken to be sufficiently derogatory to the reputation of the plaintiff to be actionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">The demurrer is overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
