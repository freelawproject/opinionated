Tansey.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b134-11\">The opinion of the court was delivered by-</p>\n<author id=\"b134-12\">VAN Syckel, J.</author>\n<p id=\"APl\">This <em>certiorari </em>is prosecuted to review the action of commissioners appointed under the provisions of an \u201cAct to enable small landowners to drain and improve their lands,\u201d approved March 28th, 1883. <em>Gen. Stat., p. </em>2059, \u00a7 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-13\">On the 11th of June, 1900, Bridget Dolan, the defendant in <em>certiorari, </em>filed a petition for relief under said act, in pursuance of which a chosen freeholder and surveyor of the highways were appointed and made their certificate in accordance with the requirements of said act on the Ith day of July, 1900.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-14\">Bridget Dolan, being dissatisfied with the finding of the freeholder and surveyors of the highways, took no proceeding to set aside their action, but on the 13th day of August, 1900, filed a new petition under said act, and had another chosen freeholder and two other surveyors of the highways to act upon her petition and view the premises. Their report, bearing date August 25th, 1900, is satisfactory to Bridget Dolan, but the legality of the second proceeding is denied by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>prosecutrix, who has certified it into this court to have that question settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">The statute provides that the decision of the tribunal appointed under the act shall be final and conclusive, and such must be the effect given to the action of the officers appointed under the first petition, such appointment having been duly made. <em>Stout </em>v. <em>Chosen Freeholders, </em>1 <em>Dutcher </em>202; <em>Aldridge </em>v. <em>Essex Road Board, </em>22 <em>Vroom </em>166; <em>In matter of Highway, </em>1 <em>Harr. </em>391.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">The defendant contends that the persons appointed under the first petition were not disinterested, and therefore that proceeding was no bar to the second proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">The evidence does not establish this infirmity in the first proceeding, but if it did, it cannot be set up in a collateral attack upon it. Its validity can be questioned only by certifying it into this court for review..</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">The proceedings certified were taken without legal authority, and must be set aside, with costs. They could nof be lawfully instituted until the first proc\u00e9eding was set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">There was no laches on the part of the prosecutrix in this case, as she gave full notice to the defendant that she would contest the validity of her proceeding.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
