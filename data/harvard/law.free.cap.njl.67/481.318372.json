This was evidence sufficient to go to the jury upon the liability of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">It also appears that when the plaintiff\u2019s mother fell with the'child in her arms, it began to cry; that a doctor was sent for who set the plaintiff\u2019s leg in plaster of paris; that the plaintiff continued to cry for about a week; that the doctor did not come every day and that there is a lump on the child\u2019s leg. This was evidence sufficient to go to the jury upon the question of the child\u2019s injuries and the damages charged to which it was entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">The judgment should be affirmed, 'with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
