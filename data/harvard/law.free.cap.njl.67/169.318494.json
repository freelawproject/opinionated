The proceedings purport to be had under the eleventh section of the Landlord and Tenant act, and the only question, therefore, which can be considered is whether the justice had jurisdiction in the matter, for, by virtue of the provision of section 18 of the act, \"proceedings had <em>by virtue of </em>the eleventh section of the act shall not be appealed from or removed by <em>certiorari.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b213-15\">The primary fact which must exist'in order to give the justice jurisdiction is that the relation of the parties to the proceeding is that of landlord and tenant, for it is only where that relationship exists that the act has any application, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>this fact must appear affirmatively in the affidavit which the statute requires to be filed with the justice as a preliminary step in the proceeding. <em>Fowler </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>1 <em>Dutcher </em>549.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The affidavit in the present proceeding sets out that the prosecutor is in possession of the premises whereof a recovery is sought \u201cupon an agreement made and entered into between one Ethel Covas (who subsequently conveyed them to Mrs. Reynolds, the defendant), and Gray, bearing date April 1st, 1899, whereby Ethel Covas let and rented the said farm and premises, together with the buildings thereon, unto said Gray for a period of one year; that the terms upon which said agreement was based were that the said Gray was to farm said premises on shares, a copy of which agreement is hereto annexed and made a part hereof.\u201d The agreement is in the following words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-6\">\u201cFirst of April, 1899.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-7\">\u201cagreement</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-8\">\u201cBetween Mrs. E. Covas' of the first part and Aaron Grey of the second part.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-9\"><em>\u201cWitnesseth: </em>That the party of the second part shall farm on half shares the property .known as Scio farm, situated on the Bound Brook Turnpike, two and one-half miles from the city \u00f3f New Brunswick, Somerset Co., New Jersey, free of rent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-10\">\u201cThat 'he shall employ and pay all necessary and sufficient labor to properly cultivate, gather and market all the crops and produce, the proceeds to be equally divided.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-11\">\u201c2d. The expenses of seeds will be equally divided, also in grass seeds, allowing the farmer the cut of hay the first year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-12\">\u201c3d. Mr. Aaron Grey will weed very early in the spring the strawberry bed, gather and sell the fruit, proceeds equally divided after each sale in this as well as any other produce.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-13\">\u201c4th. The cornstalks and oat straw to be used on the place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-14\">\u201c5th. All the hay to be sold, either to be divided in the fields or money divided when sold.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-15\">\u201c6th. Mr. Grey will raise three calves every year, serving-two quarts of milk daily to Mrs. Covas, having the balance of the milk to himself until the herd is complete in number.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>\u201c7th. Emits of the garden to be sold and the money equally divided after each sale.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-5\">\u201c8th. Garden to have potatoes for the use of the two parties, Grey and Oovas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\">\u201c9th. Also some sweet potatoes raised.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-7\">\u201c10th. Hill fronting turnpike road for oat field.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-8\">\u201c11th. The field next to the hill is rented to Frank Boderiseo and ho must be allowed to attend to it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-9\">\u201c12th. Small meadow next to Ed. Smalley to have the fence put up if needed to serve as pasture for Mr. Grey\u2019s horses and Mrs. Oovas\u2019 cows.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-10\">\u201cAaron L. Grey,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-11\">\u201cWitness\u2014C. Covas. E. Covas.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-12\">It is apparent from a reading of it that this agreement does not constitute a lease. It is a contract for the farming of the lands and a division of the proceeds, and nothing more. That such an agreement does not constitute the relationship of landlord and tenant between the parties has been frequently decided- by this court. <em>Guest </em>v. <em>Opdyke, </em>2 <em>Vroom 552; Edgar </em>v. <em>Jewell, </em>5 <em>Id. </em>259; <em>McQuade </em>v. <em>Emmons, </em>9 <em>Id. </em>397; <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>20 <em>Id. </em>519.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-13\">Assuming that, under this agreement, Gray is, by implieacation, entitled to the use of the buildings thereon during the period covered by it, his occupation of it is a mere remuneration in part for his services, and does not create him a tenant. <em>Edgar </em>v. <em>Jewell, 5 Vroom </em>260, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-14\">The affidavit, after referring to the written agreement in the manner above set forth, goes on to state that \u201cthe period for which said premises were let and rented to said Gray, as subsequently agreed upon and understood between said Ethel Covas and said Gray, expired on the first day of April, 1900.\u201d This statement in the affidavit does not save the case by showing the existence of a lease. It assumes that the agreement before referred to (or perhaps some other agreement which is not before us) created the relationship of landlord and tenant between the parties. That the agreement annexed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>the affidavit does not have that effect has already been shown; whether any other agreement between the parties (if there was one) was, in its legal effect, a lease, depends upon the contents of that instrument. It is not enough that the affiant swears that the party in possession is her tenant, or that the premises were let and rented to him. This is a mere conclusion of law based upon facts which are not disclosed. <em>Fowler </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>1 <em>Dutcher </em>549; <em>Shepherd </em>v. <em>Sliker, </em>2 <em>Vroom. </em>432; <em>Wooley </em>v. <em>Lane, 22 Id. </em>504.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Upon the hearing of this matter before the justice no proof was offered by the owner of the premises in support of her contention that the prosecutor was in the occupation of the premises belonging to hex as her tenant, she having elected to rest her case upon the facts set out in the jurisdictional affidavit, following the rule laid down in <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Idler, </em>25 <em>Vroom </em>407, and <em>Lloyd </em>v. <em>Richman, </em>28 <em>Id. </em>385. She therefore failed to establish the existence of the relation of landlord and tenant between herself and the prosecutor, either by her preliminary affidavit or upon the hearing. It results that the case as presented was not within the jurisdiction of the justice under the Landlord and Tenant act, and the judgment, therefore, must be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
