Should these conditions not be complied with no vacation takes place at all; and there is also a provision that if the present owner or owners, or his, her or their grantees, cease to use the portion of the street sought to be vacated by the ordinance for manufacturing purposes, the vacation of the street becomes null and void, and the same land again becomes a public street or highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">This is not an ordinance vacating Myrtle street. The ordinance itself states that it is passed under the act to amend the charter of Elizabeth, the supplements thereto and the general laws of the state, but our attention has not been called to, nor do we know of, any law, general or special, authorizing the passage of an ordinance vacating streets under conditions similar to those contained in the ordinance under review, whereby the ordinance may become effective upon the performance of certain conditions. There are statutes authorizing the passage of ordinances vacating streets when certain conditions appear to exist, after certain preliminaries have been taken; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>such, an act is that of 1897 <em>(Pamph. L., p. </em>215), where, if a portion of a street has not heen opened for twenty years or more, that the opening will involve large expenditures, and would be of no public benefit, and all the owners of abutting lands consent, in writing, to the vacation by filing a consent, duly acknowledged, with the city clerk, then the governing body of the city may pass an ordinance declaring such portion of a street vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">The ordinance brought up should be set aside.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
