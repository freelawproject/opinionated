An ordinance which imposes a penalty for failure to- file with .the secretary of the board of health a plan of the contemplated plumbing work, \u201csigned by the owner,\u201d will not be held to impose a liability to such a penalty upon the plumber who- may be engaged by the owner to do the work. The duty imposed by the ordinance is cast upon the owner, and he only is liable for such failure.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b147-8\">2.

Before any portion of the plumbing and drainage system of any building shall be constructed there shall be filed with the secretary of the board of health a plan thereof, signed by the owner, showing the said plumbing and drainage system entire, from its connection with the sewer, cesspool or vault, throughout the entire building, together with the location of all fixtures, traps, ventilating pipes, &amp;c. Said plan must be approved and the name of the plumber attached thereto before any portion of the work shall be executed,\u201d &lt;^c.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The complaint seems to charge two offences:</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\"><em>First. </em>Constructing the work \u201cwithout their having first filed with the secretary of the board of health a plan thereof, signed by the owner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\"><em>Second. </em>Because they constructed the work \u201cwithout the approval of the board of health being first secured therefor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">We think that there is no penalty imposed upon the plumber for the failure to file with the secretary of the board \u201ca plan thereof, signed by the owner, showing the said plumbing and drainage system entire.\u201d The ordinance does not say that the plumber must do that. It does say that such plan shall be filed, \u201csigned by the owner;\u201d and if the duty to file is cast upon anyone, it would seem to be upon the owner. A plumber will not be held to this duty by implication. Penal ordinances are construed strictly, and will not be held to create a liability where the words are not clear in fixing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">Nor do we think that the provision of the ordinance which says \u201csaid plan must be approved and the name of the plumber attached thereto before any portion of the work shall be executed\u201d makes it clear that the plumber must get such approval. A proper construction seems otherwise. The plumber does not have to sign. Is it not clear that this ordinance places <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>a duty upon the owner to file a signed plan of his work, and to attach thereto the name of the plumber who is to do it, and to then obtain the approval of the board of health thereto, with all this information before it? It is not necessary for the owner to do this in person; his architect, or even his plumber, may no doubt do it; but for a failure to do it he alone, as we construe this ordinance, is liable. It is his building, and his work that is to be done, and with the construction of his building that the board of'health has concern. If it is desired to hold plumbers liable, the ordinance must say so specifically.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The conviction will be set aside.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
