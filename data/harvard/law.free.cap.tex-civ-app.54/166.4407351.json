There was testimony tending to show that the plaintiff made an assault upon the porter with a knife, and that the porter acted in self-defense. On that phase of the case the trial court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-3\">\u201cIf you believe from the evidence that the plaintiff assaulted the defendant\u2019s said porter, and that said porter in repelling such attack struck the plaintiff and thereby injured him, and that in so doing he exercised that high degree of care to avoid injuring plaintiff herein-before charged to have been his duty; in other words, if you believe that he exercised that degree of care in repelling the attack which a very cautious and prudent person would have exercised towards plaintiff under the same or similar circumstances to avoid injuring him, then if you so find you will find for the defendant; but in this connection you are instructed that if you should find that plaintiff did make an assault upon defendant\u2019s porter, unless you find that said porter exercised that high degree of care to avoid injuring him in repelling said attack that a very cautious and prudent person would have exercised towards plaintiff under the same or similar circumstances, then you can not find for defendant under this paragraph.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">Appellant requested, and the court refused, the following instruction: \u201cIf you believe from the evidence that \"defendant\u2019s porter was assaulted by the plaintiff with an open knife in his hand, and that the defendant\u2019s porter, in defense of himself and his person, struck-the plaintiff with his fist, and that said porter did not use any more force or resistance than was necessary to repel plaintiff\u2019s assault, if' any, and you believe that\u2014which you may find he did\u2014was necessary to repel said assault, if any, and that a person of ordinary prudence in the exercise of the care mentioned in the court\u2019s charge would have done as did defendant\u2019s porter in repelling the said assault, if any,' you will find for defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">But one assignment of error is presented in appellant\u2019s brief, and it complains of the refusal of the requested instruction. We think appellant had the right to have the requested instruction given, because it would have presented the law of self-defense more specifically and affirmatively than did the court\u2019s charge. However, we are of the opinion that both the charges\u2014the one given by the court and the one refused\u2014placed upon appellant a greater burden than did the law. In New Orleans &amp; N. E. Ry. Co. v. Jopes, 142 U. S., 24, which is quite similar to this case, the Supreme Court of the United States held that if the conductor of the railway acted in self-defense in shooting the plaintiff, who was a passenger, that the railway company was not liable, and that the doctrine of the high degree of care which applies in other cases when a passenger is injured had no application. In Galveston, H. &amp; S. A. Ry. Co. v. LaPrelle, 27 Texas Civ. App., 496, this court recognized and announced the same doctrine. But if it should be held that by requesting the refused instruction appellant acquiesced in and adopted the degree of care mentioned in the court\u2019s charge, still the refused instruction constituted a more direct application of the law to the case as developed by the testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>many, and the court erred in refusing it. (Missouri, K. &amp; T. Ry. Co. v. McGlamory, 89 Texas, 635.)</p>\n<p id=\"b196-3\">For the error pointed out the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
