We conclude that the plain and unambiguous language of the insurance policy limits coverage to compensation benefits awarded under the New Jersey Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">Plaintiff Hornet Express, a trucking company with a base of operations in New Jersey, applied for workers\u2019 compensation coverage through the New Jersey Workers Compensation Insurance Plan (NJWCIP). The NJWCIP provides involuntary assigned risk coverage to New Jersey employers that cannot obtain coverage in the voluntary market. The risk covered by policies issued through the NJWCIP is defined as \u201cthe entire insured operations within the State of New Jersey or to which the New Jersey Compensation Law is applicable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">The application form for workers\u2019 compensation coverage that Hornet submitted to the NJWCIP asked: \u201cDo you have operations in states other than New Jersey?\u201d Hornet answered: \u201cno.\u201d The application form also included a \u201cTracker Supplemental Application\u201d page, which stated: \u201cIf you or your employees spend a majority of driving time in a certain state, name that State for yourself and each employee.\u201d In the blank following this inquiry, Hornet identified \u201cNJ\u201d as the only state where its employees spend a majority of driving time. Contrary to the representations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>set forth in its application to the NJWCIP, Hornet employed drivers who operated trucks solely in Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The application containing these misrepresentations was prepared on Hornet\u2019s behalf by its insurance broker, defendant Garden State Brokers, Inc. Defendant Harry DelBosco is the principal of this brokerage company.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">The NJWCIP assigned responsibility to defendant Zurich American Insurance Group to provide coverage to Hornet under the New Jersey Assigned Risk Program. Under this program, the policy Zurich issued to Hornet was required to contain the specific policy provisions set forth in the New Jersey Workers Compensation Insurance Manual.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">In conformity with this manual and the application Hornet submitted to the NJWCIP, Zurich issued a policy to Hornet, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-9\">3A. WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE: Part One of the policy applies to the Workers Compensation Law of the state(s) listed here:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-10\">NJ</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-11\">The policy also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-12\">3C. OTHER STATES INSURANCE: Part Three of the policy applies to the states, if any, listed here:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-13\">COVERAGE EXCLUDED</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-14\">Hornet did not obtain any workers\u2019 compensation coverage other than the policy issued by Zurich.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-15\">On June 7, 2001, one of Hornet\u2019s Pennsylvania drivers, Bret Kegarise, was involved in a fatal accident while operating a Hornet truck in the course of his employment in Pennsylvania. Kegarise\u2019s work for Hornet consisted exclusively of driving a daily route between King of Prussia, Pennsylvania and Allentown, Pennsylvania. Kegarise also lived in Pennsylvania with his family and parked the Hornet truck in Pennsylvania when he was not working.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-16\">Kegarise\u2019s widow filed a workers\u2019 compensation death benefit claim against Hornet in the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation of the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry. Zurich <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>disclaimed coverage for this claim on the ground that the policy it had issued to Hornet only provided coverage for New Jersey workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Hornet did not defend the claim petition, and a Pennsylvania Workers\u2019 Compensation judge issued a final decision requiring Hornet to pay death benefits to Kegarise\u2019s widow. This decision included a finding that Hornet \u201cdid not carry Workers\u2019 Compensation insurance coverage in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Hornet subsequently brought this action against Zurich, Garden State Brokers and DelBosco. Hornet sought a declaration that the Zurich policy provided coverage for the death benefits awarded to Kegarise\u2019s widow by the Pennsylvania Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation. In the alternative, Hornet asserted a negligence claim against Garden State Brokers and DelBosco for failing to obtain comprehensive workers\u2019 compensation coverage that would apply to the Pennsylvania claim by Kegarise\u2019s widow.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The ease was brought before the court by Zurich\u2019s motion for summary judgment seeking dismissal of Hornet\u2019s complaint on the ground that the policy it issued to Hornet did not provide coverage for benefits awarded by the Pennsylvania Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation. Garden State filed a cross-motion for summary judgment seeking a declaration that Zurich was required to indemnify Hornet for defense costs and the Pennsylvania compensation award.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">The trial court concluded in an oral opinion that because Zurich would have provided coverage to Hornet if Kegarise\u2019s widow had filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation in the New Jersey Division of Workers\u2019 Compensation, it was required to provide \u201cNew Jersey coverage\u201d to Hornet for the Pennsylvania workers\u2019 compensation award. Accordingly, the court denied Zurich\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granted Garden State\u2019s cross-motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">We conclude that the policy Zurich issued to Hornet only provided coverage for workers\u2019 compensation benefits awarded under the New Jersey Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Therefore, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>reverse the orders denying Zurich\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granting summary judgment to Garden State.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">It is the court\u2019s responsibility \u201cin construing ... [a] polic[y] of insurance, as with any other contract, ... to search broadly for the probable common intent of the parties in an effort to find a reasonable meaning in keeping with the express general purposes of the polic[y].\u201d <em>French v. N.J. Sch. Bd. Ass\u2019n Ins. Group, </em>149 <em>N.J </em>478, 493-94, 694 A.2d 1008 (1997) (quoting <em>Royal Ins. Co. v. Rutgers Cas. Ins. Co., </em>271 <em>N.J.Super. </em>409, 416, 638 A.2d 924 (App.Div.1994)). It cannot be \u201cemphasize[d] too strongly that when an insurance policy is clear and unambiguous ... the court is bound to enforce the policy as it is written.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 494, 694 A.2d 1008 (quoting <em>Royal Ins. Co., supra, </em>271 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 416, 638 A.2d 924).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">Under the clear and unambiguous terms of the policy Zurich issued to Hornet in accordance with the NJWCIP assigned risk plan, coverage was limited to workers\u2019 compensation benefits awarded under the New Jersey Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-1 to -128. Part 1(b) of the policy stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-8\">We will pay promptly when due the benefits required of you by the workers compensation law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">The general section defined \u201cworkers compensation law\u201d to mean \u201cthe workers or workmen\u2019s compensation law ... of each state or territory named in Item 3.A. of the Information Page.\u201d Item 3A of the information page stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-10\">WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE: Part One of the policy applies to the Workers Compensation Law of the state(s) listed here:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-11\">NJ</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-12\">Item 3C of the information page stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-13\">OTHER STATES INSURANCE: Part Three of the policy applies to the states, if any, listed here:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-14\">COVERAGE EXCLUDED</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-15\">In addition, section 3(A)(4) of the policy stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-16\">If you have work on the effective date of this policy in any state not listed in Item 3.A. of the Information Page, coverage will not be afforded for that slate unless we are notified within thirty days.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>Therefore, these policy provisions clearly and unambiguously indicated that unless \u201cother states\u201d coverage was provided under item 3(C) of the information page, which Hornet\u2019s policy explicitly excluded, coverage was provided solely for New Jersey workers\u2019 compensation benefits and not for workers compensation benefits awarded under the laws of any other state.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">In addition to these policy provisions, an insert accompanying the policy, which was required under instructions issued by the NJWCIP, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-6\">ATTENTION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-7\">NOTICE TO POLICYHOLDERS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-8\">IF YOU HAVE EMPLOYEES WHO TRAVEL OR WORK OUT OF STATE, YOU MAY NEED ADDITIONAL WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION INSURANCE. CONSULT YOUR INSURANCE ADVISOR OR CARRIER PRIOR TO COMMENCEMENT OF OPERATIONS IN ANY STATE NOT LISTED ON YOUR POLICY.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">Despite the clarity of the policy language and the notice accompanying the policy that the coverage provided by Zurich was limited to benefits awarded under the New Jersey Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, the trial court held that Zurich must pay the portion of the judgment entered by the Pennsylvania Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation for which Zurich would have been liable if Kegarise\u2019s widow had filed her claim in the New Jersey Division of Workers\u2019 Compensation. The trial court did not determine the amount of such liability or indicate how this determination would be made.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nor did the court point to any policy language that supported its conclusion that the Zurich policy provided coverage not only for workers\u2019 compensation benefits awarded under the New Jersey Workers\u2019 Compensation Act but also for the portion of an award made under the laws of another state that hypothetically would have been awarded if the claim petition had been filed in New Jersey rather than that other state.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>Instead, the trial court relied upon this court\u2019s decision in <em>Toebe v. Employers Mut. of Wausau, </em>114 <em>N.J.Super. </em>39, 274 A.2d 820 (App.Div.1971) to support imposition of such liability upon Zurich. In that case, an employee of a Minnesota trucking company suffered a work-connected injury while operating one of his employer\u2019s trucks in New Jersey. The employee filed a claim petition in the New Jersey Division of Workers\u2019 Compensation and was awarded benefits. When the employer failed to pay the award, the injured employee filed a Law Division action against the employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurer. <em>Id. </em>at 41, 274 A.2d 820. The insurer defended on the ground that the policy it had issued to the employer only provided coverage for benefits payable under the Minnesota workers\u2019 compensation law. <em>Id. </em>at 43, 274 A.2d 820. In support of this defense, the insurer relied on a provision of the declarations page of the policy, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-6\">Coverage A of this policy applies to the Workmen's compensation law ... of each of the following states: Minnesota.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-8\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">The court rejected this defense and held that \u201can insurer may be liable for an award granted in a state other than that specified in the policy, to the extent that the award would have been granted under the compensation law of the latter state.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 48, 274 A.2d 820. In reaching this conclusion, the court stated that \u201cby holding defendant insurer liable for only that portion of the award, be it part or all, as would have been recoverable pursuant to Minnesota\u2019s workmen\u2019s compensation law, the terms of the policy and its premium base are not changed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 49, 274 A.2d 820.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">The Supreme Court granted the insurer\u2019s petition for certification, <em>Toebe v. Employers Mut. of Wausau, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>599, 279 A.2d 684 (1971), and on March 21, 1972, the Court held oral argument, <em>Toebe v. Employers Mut. of Wausau, </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>198, 306 A.2d 66 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">On May 2,1972, with the consent of the parties, the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>entered an order that stated in pertinent part:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-5\">(1) that plaintiff shall within 60 days from the date hereof institute an appropriate proceeding in the State of Minnesota against the employer and also against the defendant carrier if permitted by Minnesota law to join the carrier, for the recovery of workmen\u2019s compensation benefits arising out of the accident involved in the present proceeding;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-6\">(2) that the defendant carrier shall accept service of process in such proceeding on behalf of its assured and also on behalf of itself if it is also a party defendant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-7\">(3) that the defendants in the Minnesota proceedings shall not dispute their liability to plaintiff for the payment of workmen\u2019s compensation benefits under the Minnesota law and shall not assert any claim that notice was not given or that the proceedings were not instituted timely, all to the end that the amount of such liability shall be determined and an appropriate judgment entered therefor in the State of Minnesota;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-8\">(4) that upon the satisfaction of such judgment in the State of Minnesota, the proceedings before this Court shall be terminated by an order reversing the judgment of the Appellate Division and directing the dismissal of the proceedings in this State against the defendant carrier, all such orders in this State to be entered without costs in favor of any party[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">On May 9, 1973, counsel notified the Court that the claim petition filed by the employee with the Minnesota Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission had been settled and that the employee had been paid Minnesota compensation benefits in accordance with the terms of that settlement. After receiving this notice, the Court entered an order on June 19, 1973, in accordance with the May 2, 1972 consent order, \u201creversing the judgment of the Appellate Division and directing the dismissal of the proceedings in [New Jersey] against the defendant carrier.\u201d <em>Toebe, supra, </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>at 199, 306 A.2d 66. Since the Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the Appellate Division in <em>Toebe </em>based on the award of compensation benefits in Minnesota, we do not believe that the Appellate Division decision in <em>Toebe </em>is entitled to any precedential weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">In any event, the provisions of the insurance policy involved in <em>Toebe </em>were not comparable to the policy Zurich issued to Hornet. Although the policy involved in <em>Toebe </em>contained a provision similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>to item 3A <em>of the </em>Zurich information page, which stated that the workers\u2019 compensation coverage provided therein applied to a specified state, in that instance Minnesota, there is no indication the policy involved in <em>Toebe </em>included a provision for \u201cOther States Insurance\u201d coverage, which the employer had explicitly excluded from its coverage, as Hornet did in this case. Nor is there any indication that the policy contained a provision comparable to 3(A)(4) of the Zurich policy, which provided: \u201cIf you have work on the effective date of this policy in any state not listed in Item 3.A. of the Information Page, coverage will not be afforded for that state unless we are notified within thirty days[,]\u201d or an accompanying notice to the policyholder that additional coverage may be needed if it has any employees who travel or work out-of-state. Therefore, even if this court\u2019s decision in <em>Toebe </em>were supportable under the terms of the policy involved in that case, the result in <em>Toebe </em>could not be justified under the clear and unambiguous language of the Zurich policy limiting Hornet\u2019s coverage to workers\u2019 compensation benefits awarded under the New Jersey Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Garden State also argues, in the alternative, that Zurich is estopped from denying coverage for Kegarise\u2019s Pennsylvania claim petition because it did not disclaim coverage in a timely manner. This argument is clearly without merit. Zurich notified Hornet by letter dated September 5, 2001, less than a month after the filing of Kegarise\u2019s Pennsylvania claim petition, that the Zurich policy \u201c[does] not provide coverage in Pa[,]\u201d and that unless Hornet has a separate policy for its workers\u2019 compensation liability in Pennsylvania, it \u201cwill need to retain counsel to defend [its] position.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Accordingly, the orders denying Zurich\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granting summary judgment to Garden State are reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b444-10\"> The parties subsequently entered into a settlement agreement establishing this amount. The determination whether this amount is payable by Zurich or Garden State is contingent upon the outcome of the present appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b446-11\"> Although this order is not published in the New Jersey reports, it is on file with the Clerk of the Supreme Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
