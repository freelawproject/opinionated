Defendant further argues that additional error occurred when (5) the court allowed the prosecutor to cross-examine defendant on the details of his past burglary conviction and related statement, which defendant had given to a detective; (6) the prosecutor committed misconduct from opening through summation; (7) trial counsel rendered ineffective assis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>tance, by falling to seek severance of the charges, to seek limiting instructions regarding the charges, and to object to the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct; (8) the court allowed Dr. Lind to testify about the cause of Edward Jr.\u2019s death; and (9) the court imposed an excessive twenty-seven-year imprisonment term.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">We have reviewed each of these arguments in light of the record and pertinent law and have concluded that none of the arguments warrant reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction or sentence, and that points (1) and (3) through (5) and (7) through (9) are without sufficient merit to warrant further discussion. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(2). Consequently, in this opinion, we discuss only defendant\u2019s argument (6), dealing with the prosecutor\u2019s alleged misconduct, and defendant\u2019s argument (2), claiming that the trial court erred, under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>436, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>1602,16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), when it denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress his September 26th confession, which was obtained despite defendant\u2019s request to speak with his parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">Here is what happened. Defendant and his girlfriend, Melanie Holton, were the parents of twin seven-week-old boys. Holton, the grandparents, and the babies\u2019 godfather and defendant\u2019s best friend, Michael Wilkins, all testified that defendant appeared, before the unfortunate incident to be a loving, protective, and fully involved parent of the newborns.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">On September 23, 2001, however, defendant was babysitting the newborns while Holton was shopping with a friend. While the newborns were in defendant\u2019s care, Edward Jr. died. Defendant\u2019s initial version of the death, which he provided during a 9-1-1 call and thereafter at the hospital, was that Edward Jr. fell off a couch while defendant was assisting the other twin.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">An autopsy revealed, however, that Edward Jr. died from multiple skull fractures, hemorrhaging, front subdural bleeding and a swelling of the brain that was allegedly caused by blunt force to two different parts of his head. The autopsy also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>revealed twenty-seven fractures of the newbom\u2019s ribs in various stages of healing. An examination of the other twin disclosed seventeen rib fractures also in different stages of healing. Consequently, during the investigation of Edward Jr.\u2019s death, the Division of Youth and Family Services temporarily removed the other twin from the care of defendant and Holton.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">On September 25th, the prosecutor\u2019s office followed up on some statements taken at the hospital and further interviewed defendant and Holton. During this interview, the officers were informed that Holton\u2019s parents had retained an attorney to represent the couple. The attorney requested that the police stop interviewing defendant and Holton and inform the couple that he advised them to stop speaking with the police. The officers informed defendant of the representation and gave him the lawyer\u2019s phone number.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">At trial, the officer could not recall whether he had also informed defendant of the attorney\u2019s advice to stop speaking with the police. Defendant testified at trial that after being given the attorney\u2019s phone number he asked the officers what the attorney had said. The officers allegedly responded that they did not know, but if defendant did not do anything wrong, he did not need an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">In any event, one of the officers asked defendant whether he wished to continue speaking with them and defendant agreed by signing a \u201cReed Advisory.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant also signed a <em>Miranda </em>Warning and Waiver <em>of </em>Rights form and continued speaking with the police until counsel arrived, when defendant exercised his right to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>That night, one of the investigators received a message from defendant\u2019s father on his home answering machine. Defendant\u2019s father and the investigator knew each other and had a social relationship. When the investigator called back, defendant\u2019s father asked the whereabouts of his son and \u201cwhat was going on.\u201d The investigator explained that \u201ceverything was going fine with the questioning and they had a few more questions to answer, but the lawyer stopped it all\u201d and that defendant \u201cshould come back and finish his statement.\u201d The investigator told the father that \u201cthe autopsy wasn\u2019t matching up with the questioning of ... the statements that [defendant] was making.\u201d Defendant\u2019s father told the investigator that his son wanted to return to clear everything up. Defendant\u2019s father asked how his son could come in or continue the statement. The investigator advised defendant\u2019s father that his son \u201cha[d] a right to hire a lawyer and ... a right to fire a lawyer[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Later that evening, defendant came to his parents\u2019 home seeking advice. Apparently trusting the investigator, defendant\u2019s father told defendant to go back the next day and finish the statement without the attorney. Defendant also spoke with his friend, Wilkins, who also encouraged defendant to go back and continue the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">The next day, September 26th, defendant fired his attorney and reported to police headquarters where an investigator and detective continued defendant\u2019s interrogation. Defendant received <em>Miranda </em>warnings and waived his right to an attorney, expressing his desire to revoke the previously asserted right to remain silent and continue with his statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">Defendant began his statement by discussing the details of the children\u2019s birth, development, and care. The investigator was impressed with defendant\u2019s knowledge of his children and suspected, at that time, that defendant was a very involved, interested parent. When asked about the events of September 23rd, defendant repeated his original explanation of the incident. But, this time, the investigator confronted defendant with the autopsy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>report and said there were \u201ctwo kids in your house who are seven weeks old. One kid is dead and the other kid is following the same path, got multiple injuries.\u201d Considering \u201cthe autopsy, it didn\u2019t happen the way you said it. Now there\u2019s something very wrong here and this is what we need to talk about.\u201d The investigator explained that the baby \u201ccould not get injuries ... more than one head fracture[,] from one fall,\u201d by falling off a couch of that height. At this point, \u201cthe tenseness in the room was ratcheted up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Defendant then decided to tell the investigator something he \u201creally never told\u201d anyone and divulged the following second version of the incident: \u201cin his haste to save the baby,\u201d after Edward Jr. had fallen from the couch, \u201che had picked the baby up and had run toward the bedroom where he was going to do CPR. But, in his haste, he tripped and the baby fell out of his arms and now he hit the floor.\u201d When questioned about the newborn\u2019s old injuries, however, defendant could not provide any credible explanation. The investigator was not impressed with the second version and kept pressing defendant, who then came up with a third version of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">In the third version, defendant stated that, when he dropped the baby, \u201che actually slid across the floor and he hit the wall with some force.\u201d The investigator again expressed his disbelief, but did not threaten, coerce, or scream. In fact, throughout the examination, the investigator claimed to have treated defendant as if he were a father with a dead son, not a criminal suspected of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">At some point according to defendant, both the investigator and detective left the room, and a woman lieutenant entered and began questioning him. She told defendant that he was lying and that his other son was going to be placed for adoption. At that moment, defendant claimed to be very upset and testified at trial that he decided to tell the investigators \u201cwhatever they want[ed] to hear.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>The investigator disagreed with defendant\u2019s recollection of this occurrence. He testified that the lieutenant, who was his superior officer, did not enter the room until after the confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">In any event, after the investigator had informed defendant that his stories were not jibing with the physical evidence, and the tension had been significantly increased, defendant asserted that he needed \u201cto talk to my parents; I want to talk to my father.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The interrogating investigator, tried to find out precisely what defendant meant. The investigator asked \u201cdo you want to tell your father first, and you\u2019re going to tell us?\u201d In response, defendant said \u201cI want to talk to my father.\u201d The investigator then sat for maybe thirty seconds, \u201cmulling over where we were.\u201d He then got up and told defendant he was \u201cgoing to go get your father,\u201d and he left the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">The investigator did not attempt to contact defendant\u2019s father. Instead, he spoke to his superiors and wanted to check on the status of the interview with Holton, who was also being questioned at that time. About two or three minutes later, the investigator reentered the interrogation room intending to tell defendant they were bringing in his father. When the investigator reentered the room, defendant was sobbing and telling a detective that he was the murderer who killed his son.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">The detective, who had remained with defendant after the investigator left the room, explained at trial that when the investigator left, he thought defendant\u2019s parents would be brought in. He \u201cwasn\u2019t sure what was going to happen next.\u201d He asked defendant, according to his trial testimony, \u201cwhat\u2019s going on? ... what do you want to talk to your parents about and [defendant] says don\u2019t worry \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 I\u2019ll tell you what happened after I talk to my parents.\u201d The detective stated that he had \u201cknown [defendant] for a while____you want to tell me?\u201d Defendant then \u201cbecame <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>very emotional and he put his hands up like this and he said I murdered my son.\u201d Defendant then explained how he \u201clost it\u201d and \u201cslammed the baby in between [his] knees because he wouldn\u2019t stop crying.\u201d The detective was \u201cshocked\u201d and slid his chair toward defendant, putting his arm on defendant\u2019s shoulder to \u201ccomfort\u201d him.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Upon the investigator\u2019s return, defendant was crying: \u201cI\u2019m a murderer; I killed my son; I\u2019m a murderer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Defendant subsequently repeated the confession to his parents and in a tape recorded statement. However, defendant denied ever striking the babies before, but admitted to having been tempted to do so in the past. He then stated that all previous versions of the incident were not true. After the recording was over, defendant listened to the tape and signed an affidavit acknowledging his taped statement and swearing that it was given voluntarily and truthfully.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">At trial, three medical experts testified that Edward\u2019s injuries were the result of intentional infliction of child abuse.. The head fractures were most likely caused by a forceful striking of the head, although one expert believed the fractures \u201ccould also have occurred were the head to have been squeezed between the knees of the individual holding him.\u201d The experts also opined that the rib fractures on both left and right sides of Edward Jr.\u2019s rib cage were consistent. with squeezing the newborn. They were not caused, as urged by the defense, at birth, by administering CPR, or by hugging or burping the babies. The experts also believed that all of the fractures did not occur on the day of Edward Jr.\u2019s death, but some of the child\u2019s ribs had been broken previously.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">Defendant testified on his own behalf. He first admitted pleading guilty as an accessory to third-degree burglary when he was twenty years old. He then testified to his girlfriend\u2019s high risk pregnancy and delivery of the twins. He portrayed himself as an involved concerned parent, helping with doctor appointments and caring for the babies.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>He explained the September 23rd incident as follows: he was exhausted and trying to feed Edward Jr., but the baby refused to take the formula and was moving his head from side to side screaming. Defendant grabbed Edward Jr. and unintentionally hit him against his knee caps once and the baby became unconscious. As a result, formula started to come out of the newborn\u2019s mouth and nose, and defendant ran into his bedroom trying to suction formula and blow air into the baby\u2019s lungs.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Defendant admitted lying about the incident to the 9-1-1 dispatcher, the police, hospital personnel, his parents, and friends. He stated that he told the investigators what they wanted to hear because he wanted his other son to stay with Holton and because he felt scared and confused. He denied shaking, squeezing, or abusing his children.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">The jury acquitted defendant of aggravated assault, pertaining to the twins, and of endangering the welfare of both twins for the period preceding Edward Jr.\u2019s death. However, the jury found defendant guilty of aggravated manslaughter, as a lesser included offense to first degree murder, of Edward Jr. After being sentenced to twenty-seven years in prison with application of the No Early Release Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.2, defendant appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">Defendant argues, in point (6), that the prosecutor committed misconduct through the entire trial, by making \u201cinflammatory remarks\u201d designed solely to \u201cgenerate sympathy for the victim and [ ] hatred for the defendant\u201d and by improperly cross-examining defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-10\">\u201c[R]hetorical excesses ... invariably attend litigation,\u201d <em>State v. Williams, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>393, 456, 550 A.2d 1172 (1988), and prosecutors are afforded considerable leeway in their remarks to a jury. <em>State v. Purnell, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>518, 540, 601 A.2d 175 (1992). Nevertheless, as we have said numerous times, the prosecutor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>primary duty is not to obtain convictions, but to see that justice is done. <em>E.g., State v. Frost, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>76, 83, 727 A.2d 1 (1999). Prosecutors must avoid \u201cimproper methods\u201d to obtain convictions. <em>State v. Smith, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>158, 177, 770 A.2d 255 (2001). In this case, particular circumspection by the prosecutor was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">The evidence against defendant was powerful. For example, medical testimony opined that the skull fractures on both sides of the child\u2019s head were caused either by squeezing the head between an adult\u2019s knees or by swinging the baby\u2019s body with full force against a wall, table or floor, hitting the baby on one side of his head and then swinging again and hitting the other side of the head. Because of the great emotion and sympathy this evidence could generate for the infant victim, the State\u2019s attorney was obligated to prosecute with great care.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">The assistant prosecutor who presented the state\u2019s case nevertheless structured her opening around the characterizations \u201cunthinkable\u201d and \u201cunspeakable\u201d to describe the conduct attributed to defendant. That formulation was used no less than eight times in a relatively brief opening statement. Toward the end of the prosecutor\u2019s opening, she urged the jury, after all of the evidence was admitted, to deliberate fully, and to decide \u201cwhat witnesses are credible and what witnesses aren\u2019t credible, whose opinion you\u2019re going to believe, whose opinion you\u2019re not going to believe.\u201d She then stated as her last thought, \u201ckeep this in mind. He is the one who\u2019s responsible for the unthinkable. He is the one who\u2019s responsible for the unspeakable. And let that speak volumes in your verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">The tone of the opening statement generally, with its unduly repetitive emphasis on the \u201cunthinkable\u201d and the \u201cunspeakable,\u201d could well be viewed as an appeal to the jury\u2019s passions rather than an argument focusing on the facts to be proved. And, the peroration only fortified the offending theme. The choice of words and the manner of presentation qualify, in the circumstances, contextually, as prosecutorial misconduct. Not only did the prosecutor seemingly vouch for the guilt of defendant, but she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>also impliedly told the jury to send a message by requesting that they \u201cspeak volumes\u201d in the verdict. <em>See State v. Farrell, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>99, 103, 293 A.2d 176 (1972); <em>State v. Buscham, </em>360 <em>N.J.Super. </em>346, 364-65, 823 A.2d 71 (App.Div.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">The prosecutor also stated in opening that \u201c[y]ou don\u2019t want to talk about things that are seen on kids. I mean we\u2019re all adults, it\u2019s our job to protect them.\u201d This comment contains the same distortion as the statements we criticized in <em>Buscham, supra, </em>360 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 364-65, 823 A.2d 71, and <em>State v. Acker, </em>265 <em>N.J.Super. </em>351, 354-57, 627 A.2d 170, <em>certif. denied, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>485, 634 A.2d 530 (1993). It is not the jury\u2019s function to protect anyone. <em>Buscham, supra, </em>360 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 365, 823 A.2d 71. \u201cThe jury\u2019s role was to determine whether the State had proven its ease against this defendant beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">Yet, in addition to the flaws we have described, the prosecutor detailed for the jury the evidence that she would be presenting during the trial to establish defendant\u2019s guilt. In considering the opening statement taken as a whole, we interpret the accusatory elements and the last thought expressed, as merely an inartful pledge to the jury that the evidence at the end of the trial would demonstrate the guilt of defendant. With all of the highlighted defects in mind in the context of the case considered as a whole, we do not conclude that a reversal is warranted on those bases, alone or in combination with other flaws we discuss below.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">Defendant also alleges prosecutorial misconduct in other phases of the trial. For example, defendant attempted to explain the differences between his testimony and his prior inconsistent statements by focusing on the time he had to gather his thoughts and think clearer. The prosecutor cross-examined by stressing that defendant had access to the State\u2019s case through discovery and \u201chad the opportunity to listen to every one of the State\u2019s witness[es].\u201d Our Supreme Court has stated clearly that a prosecutor may cross-examine a defendant about tailoring testimony when \u201cthere is evidence in the record that a defendant tailored his testimony,\u201d ... [but] <em>\u201cat no time during cross-examination </em>may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>the prosecutor reference the defendant\u2019s attendance at trial or his ability to hear the testimony of preceding witnesses.\u201d <em>State v. Daniels, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>80, 99, 861 A.2d 808 (2004) (emphasis added). The line of cross-examination the prosecutor employed here clearly violated that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Defendant further objects to the prosecutor attempting to demonstrate in cross-examination that defendant \u201cwas nothing more than a despicable liar.\u201d A prosecutor must, of course, refrain from using epithets about a defendant or his character. <em>See, e.g., State v. Clausell, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>298, 341, 580 A.2d 221 (1990). In this matter, however, defendant had advanced several prior versions of what had occurred to Edward Jr. In these circumstances, cross-examination about defendant\u2019s changing stories was completely proper, as was an argument to the jury inviting its disbelief. At worst, the prosecutor here was guilty only of hyperbole. In <em>State v. Morton, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>383, 457, 715 A.2d 228 (1998), for example, our Supreme Court did not find reversible error even when the prosecutor characterized defendant\u2019s testimony as a \u201cself-serving pack of lies.\u201d This was so because the Court concluded that the comment \u201cwas based on reasonable inferences drawn from the evidence presented during the trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 457-58, 715 A.2d 228. So too here. There is no ground for reversal on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">Defendant also complains about the portions of the prosecutor\u2019s summation in which she stated \u201cI know [defendant] had exclusive control over this child and did something to that child\u2019s head that was so horrific he sent him into respiratory arrest and cardiac arrest.\u201d Later, the prosecutor explained that the child\u2019s distress would \u201cgive you the heebie-jeebies\u201d and several times repeated her description of the serious bodily injury suffered by the newborn as \u201chorrific.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">We consider the statement referring to respiratory and cardiac arrest together with the \u201cheebie-jeebie\u201d and \u201chorrific\u201d observations, to be fair comment based upon the evidence and not objectionable, because they were well grounded in the evidence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>In <em>Morton, </em>for example, the Court found the evidence supported the prosecutor\u2019s reference to defendant as a \u201ccold-blooded killer.\u201d <em>Morton, supra, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>at 457, 715 A.2d 228. As explained in <em>Farrell, supra, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>at 108, 298 A.2d 176, a prosecutor\u2019s expression of personal belief is error only when the jury understands the belief to be based upon information outside the evidence, which was not the case here. The single comment, \u201cI know ...\u201d did not, in context, suggest that the prosecutor\u2019s view was based on personal knowledge unavailable to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">We do not expect prosecutors \u201cto act in a manner appropriate to a lecture hall.\u201d <em>Acker, supra, </em>265 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 356, 627 A.2d 170 (citing <em>State v. Johnson, </em>31 <em>N.J. </em>489, 510-11,158 A.2d 11 (I960)). A prosecutor may present her case forcefully within the bounds of advocacy \u201cestablished by decisional law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 356, 627 A.2d 170 (quoting <em>State v. Marshall, </em>123 <em>N.J. </em>1, 160-161, 586 A.2d 85 (1991)). So long as a prosecutor bases her comments and inferences on facts in the record, \u201cwhat is said in discussing them, \u2018by way of comment, denunciation or appeal, will afford no ground for reversal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith, supra, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>at 178, 770 A.2d 255 (2001) (quoting <em>Johnson, supra, </em>31 <em>N.J. </em>at 510, 158 A.2d 11).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">To explain why Edward Jr.\u2019s rib fractures were not accidents, however, the prosecutor used a football-player analogy. Even allowing for the considerable leeway prosecutors enjoy in fashioning arguments, and the need to rebut forcefully defendant\u2019s contrary arguments, <em>see State v. Williams, </em>317 <em>N.J.Super. </em>149, 158, 721 A.2d 718 (App.Div.1998), <em>certif. denied, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>647, 725 A.2d 1128 (1999), the football-player analogy was potentially misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">Expert testimony had offered the opinion that because a newborn\u2019s ribs are \u201cflexible and pliable,\u201d great force by compression is required to induce a fracture, such as that which would result from a fall from a third floor window or the intentional use of force. The prosecutor attempted to explain the amount of force necessary to crack a newborn\u2019s ribs by, in essence, inviting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>jury, with no support in the experts\u2019 analyses, to imagine the force required to break a professional football player\u2019s ribs. She then asked the jury rhetorically \u201c[s]o what kind of force [upon the newborns] do you really think is necessary to inflict those rib fractures?\u201d She went on and stated, \u201c[w]hatever it is you\u2019re thinking about probably can\u2019t compare to what he did to these kids.\u201d The invited comparison was inappropriate and created a danger of undue prejudice to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">We, therefore, agree with defendant that prosecutorial excesses occurred in the opening statement and that misconduct transpired when the prosecutor argued that adults need to protect children, analogized the newborns\u2019 broken ribs to a football player\u2019s, and cross-examined by implying that defendant\u2019s presence during the presentation of the State\u2019s case was improper. Yet, such flaws alone do not justify a reversal of the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">To reverse defendant\u2019s conviction, the prosecutorial misconduct must be so severe as to deprive defendant of a fair trial. <em>State v. Josephs, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>44, 124, 803 A.2d 1074 (2002). We are mindful, moreover, that defendant did not object to any of the claimed improprieties. \u201cThe failure to object suggests that defense counsel did not believe the remarks were prejudicial at the time they were made.\u201d <em>Frost, supra, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>at 84, 727 A.2d 1. The absence of objection deprived the trial judge of an opportunity to correct the error at the time calling for application of the plain error standard of review. <em>See R. </em>1:7-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">Our review of the record by that standard leads us to conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct did not cause the jurors to reach a result that they would not otherwise have reached. See <em>R. </em>2:10-2. When all of the offending conduct is considered against the strength of the State\u2019s evidence, we cannot conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s tactics deprived defendant of a verdict that fairly reflected the evidence. <em>See, e.g., State v. Negron, </em>355 <em>N.J.Super. </em>556, 578-79, 810 A.2d 1152 (App.Div.2002)(determining that a reversal was required because, in balancing the prosecutorial misconduct against the strength of the proofs, \u201cwe [were] left <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>without the requisite sense of confidence that the verdict was the result of a jury assessment of permissible considerations based on the evidence in the case\u201d). The evidence against defendant was strong and could easily have justified the murder conviction sought by the prosecutor, yet defendant was acquitted of murdering Edward Jr. and convicted of lesser-included aggravated manslaughter. Defendant was also acquitted of the endangering and aggravated assault charges that related to his conduct toward both twins preceding Edward Jr.\u2019s death. It seems evident that, because the charges of conduct preceding the infant\u2019s death were based upon the forty-four fractured ribs of the newborns, the jury apparently was not swayed by the prosecutor\u2019s misleading football-player analogy.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Accordingly, we reject argument (6) and proceed to discuss defendant\u2019s argument (2), the claimed <em>Miranda </em>violation, pertaining to defendant\u2019s September 26th confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">Judge Alvarez denied defendant\u2019s suppression motion because it focused on defendant\u2019s re-appearance after firing his attorney. No findings were made concerning the occurrences following defendant\u2019s request to speak with his parents because defendant did not raise this argument until he appealed. .. Ordinarily, we might return this issue to the trial court for further findings. However, the evidence is rather clear and mostly uncontested. Consequently, as the Supreme Court did in <em>State v. Bey II, </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>128, 140, 548 A.2d 887 (1988), we make our own findings and conclude that defendant\u2019s argument is wanting. <em>See R. </em>2:10-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">Judge Alvarez felt defendant\u2019s rights were fully protected by being \u201cre-Mirandized\u201d when he returned for further questioning. The judge concluded that \u201cto suggest that the authorities should have done anything but what occurred here would make interrogations impossible.\u201d The court believed that \u201cdefendant\u2019s waiver of his right to remain silent and his right to counsel was knowingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>intelligently and voluntarily made.\u201d We basically agree with these observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">It is apparent to us that defendant\u2019s father, perhaps motivated by defendant\u2019s protestations of innocence, wished to have defendant speak with the police ostensibly to clear up this matter. Obviously, the investigating officers were interested in keeping defendant cooperative. It is also important to realize that in the beginning and indeed through most of defendant\u2019s interrogation, the police were uncertain whether they were dealing -with a criminal or a distraught father who had just lost his son through an unfortunate accident. In fact, the police described the discussions with defendant, who was known by several of the officers, as an interview rather than an interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">The statement to defendant\u2019s father, which was made the night before defendant returned for further questioning, that lawyers can be hired and can also be fired, was made in response to the father\u2019s question about how his son could continue to cooperate. Defendant\u2019s father had a previous relationship with this officer who was described as \u201csoft-spoken\u201d with a \u201cgrade-school teacher\u201d demeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">The communication implicitly suggested that defendant would be better off speaking to the police, and attempting to explain the discrepancies in his story, than remaining silent as cautioned by his lawyer. This implicit suggestion, within another context, could be considered deceptive and an impairment of defendant\u2019s right to the unrestricted advice of counsel. <em>See State v. Kennedy, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>278, 289, 478 A.2d 723 (1984) (noting that \u201cthe State may not interfere with or prevent defendant\u2019s relationship with his attorney.\u201d). Here, however, the record reflects that defendant\u2019s father was the motivating force in requesting a means to allow his son to finish his statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">Defendant undoubtedly accepted his father\u2019s advice and returned to the prosecutor\u2019s office after filing his attorney. He promptly waived his right to silence and began answering questions asked by a detective and investigator. The interrogating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>officers continued to press defendant for explanations regarding the discrepancies between his story and the autopsy and physical evidence. At a particularly tense moment in the questioning, defendant requested to speak with his parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">If a defendant \u201cindicates in any manner, at any time ... during questioning, that he wishes to remain silent, the interrogation must cease.\u201d <em>Miranda, supra, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>at 473-74, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1627, 16 L.Ed.2d at 723. Once a defendant invokes his or her right to remain silent, the invocation must be scrupulously honored. <em>Michigan v. Mosley, </em>423 <em>U.S. </em>96, 103-04, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>321, 326, 46 L.Ed.2d 313, 321 (1975). A defendant\u2019s request to terminate an interrogation must be honored, \u201chowever ambiguous.\u201d <em>Bey II, supra, </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>at 123, 548 A.2d 887, (quoting <em>State v. Hartley, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>252, 263, 511 A.2d 80 (1986) (quoting <em>Kennedy, supra, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>at 278, 478 A.2d 723 (1984))).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">Not merely the words spoken, however, but the full context in which they were spoken have to be considered in determining whether there has been an invocation of the right to remain silent. <em>State v. Martini, </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>176, 231-32, 619 A.2d 1208 (1993). (Martini\u2019s request to speak with a co-defendant was found not to be an invocation of the right to remain silent). In <em>State v. Brooks, </em>309 <em>N.J.Super. </em>43, 52-57, 706 A.2d 757 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>386, 718 A.2d 1215 (1998), which the State relies upon, we found defendant did not assert his right to silence when he asked to speak to his mother because defendant was not seeking his mother\u2019s advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">Although both <em>Martini </em>and <em>Brooks </em>found that defendant did not invoke his right to silence, in those cases defendants\u2019 requests to discontinue the interrogations were immediately granted by the police. Here, defendant\u2019s request to speak with his parents was not immediately granted, and the detective did not re-administer <em>Miranda </em>warnings before asking defendant what \u201che had to talk to his parents about.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>In <em>State v. Harvey, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>407, 581 A.2d 488 (1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>499 <em>U.S. </em>931, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>1336, 113 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>268 (1991), defendant requested to speak with his father during the interrogation. Harvey said \u201che would tell [them] about the murder but he first wanted to speak to his father.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 417, 581 A.2d 483. The police in <em>Harvey </em>granted his request and then resumed interrogation three and one half hours later without re-administering <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>Id. </em>at 417-18, 581 A.2d 483. The Supreme Court held that defendant\u2019s request to speak to his father before telling the police about the murder invoked his right to remain silent, and the police were required to give fresh <em>Miranda </em>warnings before recommencing questioning and obtaining his confession. <em>Id. </em>at 419-421, 581 A.2d 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Although defendant\u2019s request is quite similar to that contained in <em>Harvey, </em>the situation here is different. As we made clear in <em>Brooks, </em>it is \u201cnot merely the words spoken, but the full context in which they were spoken\u201d that determines \u201cwhether there had been an invocation of the right to remain silent.\u201d <em>Brooks, supra, </em>309 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 55, 706 A.2d 757 (citing <em>Martini, supra, </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>at 231-32, 619 A.2d 1208).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">In <em>Harvey, </em>it was clear that defendant was uncooperative and did not want to speak with the police. As the Court noted in <em>Martini, </em>Harvey\u2019s \u201c \u2018conduct during three days of interrogation and his refusal to answer questions\u2019 were expressions of his unwillingness to talk with police.\u201d <em>Martini, supra, </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>at 232, 619 A.2d 1208 (quoting <em>Harvey, supra, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>at 419, 581 A.2d 483). In addition, when Harvey was finally given \u201ca new set of <em>Miranda </em>warnings after his oral confession[] \u2018[defendant immediately demanded an attorney before any statement could be reduced to writing.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Harvey, supra, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>at 420, 581 A.2d 483).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">In our case, defendant never gave the police any indication that he wanted to stop talking. At best, he indicated that he wanted to take a break from the interrogation to speak with his parents. As our Supreme Court explained in <em>Bey II, supra, </em>112</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number><em>N.J. </em>at 136-37, 548 A.2d 887, \u201c[l]aw enforcement officials ... are not obligated to accept any words or conduct, no matter how ambiguous, as a conclusive indication that a suspect desires to terminate questioning.\u201d The police need not accept at face value a defendant\u2019s request for a break in the interrogation as an assertion of the right to silence. The police are free to inquire as to the reason for the request. That is what occurred here.</p>\n<p id=\"Ap\">When the detective asked why defendant wished to speak with his parents, the detective did not violate defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>Bey II, supra, </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>at 136-37, 548 A.2d 887. He was merely attempting to discern whether defendant was invoking his right to silence. It is only an actual invocation of the right to silence that activates the bright-line rule of <em>Hartley </em>and requires reiteration of defendant\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights before any further questioning is undertaken. <em>Hartley, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 255-58, 511 A.2d 80 (Hartley\u2019s invocation of his right to silence was \u201cI don\u2019t believe I want to make a statement at this time.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Defendant\u2019s request to speak with his parents should have been granted. Nevertheless, defendant volunteered his confession before the investigator returned with the alleged intention of telling defendant that his parents were going to be brought in.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">To hold that the detective had to re-administer <em>Miranda </em>warnings before asking why defendant wished to speak with his parents, would be contrary to <em>Bey II </em>and <em>Martini. </em>During an interrogation, the police are permitted to attempt to determine whether a request to take a break from the interrogation is in fact an assertion of a defendant\u2019s right to remain silent. Obviously, once defendant invokes his right to silence, the police are obligated to respect defendant\u2019s choice immediately, without question, and without any attempt at dissuasion. <em>See Michigan, supra, </em>423 <em>U.S. </em>96 at 103-04, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 326, 46 L.Ed.2d at 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">Under the circumstances, however, we conclude that defendant\u2019s request to speak with his parents was clarified by the detective as not being a re-assertion of his right to silence. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>fact, during trial, on direct examination, defendant was asked \u201cwhy did you want to see your parents,\u201d and defendant answered, \u201cI wanted to tell them, you know, what I was going to do.\u201d Accordingly, additional <em>Miranda </em>warnings were not necessary, and Judge Alvarez did not err by declining to suppress the oral and written confessions of September 26th, which followed defendant\u2019s request to speak with his parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b81-9\"> <em>State </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>237, 269, 627 A.2d 630 (1993) (when officers know that \"an attorney has been retained on behalf of a person in custody on suspicion of crime and is present or readily available to assist that person, the communication of that information to the suspect is essential to making a knowing waiver of the privilege against self-incrimination[.]\")</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b84-9\"> The following account of the circumstances surrounding defendant\u2019s request to speak with his parents is derived from the testimony presented at the motion to suppress, unless trial testimony is specifically referenced.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
