The wok was allegedly manufactured, in whole or in part, sold, or distributed by defendants Farberware, Inc., S.W. Farber, Inc., Federated Department Stores, Inc., Walter Kidde Company, Inc., Bruckner Manufacturing Corp., Sterns, Salton/Maxim Housewares, Inc., (collectively \u201cFarberware\u201d) and Leviton Manufacturing Company, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-12\">On February 27, 2002, plaintiff Leonora Mansour, by her father and guardian ad litem, Mansour Mansour (\u201cLeonora\u201d), and Mans-our Mansour individually (\u201cMansour\u201d) filed a products liability complaint against the alleged manufacturers and retailers of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>wok, claiming the product was defective. Mansour individually also named plaintiffs\u2019 former attorney, Leslie Bierman, Esq., alleging professional negligence in his failure to file a complaint on Mansour\u2019s behalf for negligent infliction of emotional distress (also known as \u201cbystander liability\u201d) under <em>Portee v. Jaffee, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>88, 417 A.2d 521 (1980), and failure to advise Mansour to do so within the two-year statute of limitations generally applicable to negligence actions, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-2.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">For purposes of these appeals, we accept the factual allegations as set forth by appellants in their opposition to attorney Bierman\u2019s summary judgment motion. Mansour was in the living room when the incident occurred and ran into the kitchen upon hearing his daughter Leonora scream, followed by a bang. Mansour heard her continuing screams and saw steam coming out of her body. He saw the wok, the lid, and water on the floor. Mansour first rushed Leonora into the bathroom shower and then to the hospital. About five hours later, he returned to the home and threw the wok and lid away.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Bierman filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, arguing that there was no basis for the malpractice claim against him because Mansour\u2019s claims against Farberware and Leviton for negligent infliction of emotional distress, if they existed,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> were tolled by statute and therefore not time-barred. Farberware, joined by Leviton, opposed Bierman\u2019s summary judgment motion on the ground that Mansour failed to state a <em>Portee </em>cause of action because he did not witness the accident, and in the alternative, if Mansour did have a <em>Portee </em>claim, the statute of limitations for such a claim was not tolled, leaving Bierman potentially liable for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>Mansour\u2019s damages as an injured bystander.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">The judge granted Bierman\u2019s motion for summary judgment, holding that Mansour\u2019s allegations stated a cause of action under <em>Portee, </em>and that the statute of limitations for Mansour\u2019s <em>Portee </em>claim was tolled. On that basis, the judge concluded that Mans-our had no malpractice claim against Bierman for failing to bring or advise Mansour to bring the claim within two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">By leave granted, defendants Farberware and Leviton each appeal the summary judgment dismissing all claims against attorney Bierman. We have consolidated the Farberware and Leviton appeals in this opinion. Taken together, the appeals raise two questions: First, if we assume that the father\u2019s complaint states a cause of action under <em>Portee </em>(despite appellants\u2019 arguments to the contrary),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is the statute of limitations on such a claim tolled by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-2.1, for as long as the child\u2019s cause of action is tolled? Second, does a father who heard the screams of his infant child as she was scalded by hot water \u201cwitness\u201d the incident for purposes of stating a <em>Portee </em>claim? We answer both questions \u201cyes\u201d and affirm the summary judgment dismissing Mansour\u2019s legal malpractice claim against attorney Bierman, who neither filed nor advised him to file a <em>Portee </em>claim within two years of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">We note that none of the counts in the products liability complaint against Farberware and Leviton expressly alleges a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress, apparently because plaintiff Mansour (and presumably his attorney) were of the belief that the statute of limitations had run on such a claim. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>It is in the several counts alleging liability against Bierman that Mansour spelled out the elements of a <em>Portee </em>claim against Farberware and Levit\u00f3n, as well as the allegation that the statute had run. Thus the products defendants clearly have been on notiee of that claim and have litigated fully the issue of its timeliness. There is no inherent unfairness, then, in permitting Mansour on remand to amend his complaint to more specifically allege his bystander liability claim against those defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Here, as we said, defendants Farberware and Leviton responded to Bierman\u2019s motion for summary judgment by arguing in the alternative: first, that Mansour failed to state a <em>Portee </em>claim, but even if he did, the two-year statute was not tolled, the claim was time-barred, and Bierman must be held in.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On this appeal, all parties have fully briefed the question whether Mansour\u2019s allegations, if proved at trial, could support recovery under Portee.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> All parties have assumed that the judge decided that question in plaintiff Mansour\u2019s favor. We therefore deem it appropriate and in the interest of fairness to the parties and judicial economy to decide that issue now.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">Leviton argues that the father here does not meet the basic elements of a <em>Portee </em>plaintiff because he was not in the same room and did not see the wok fall on the child. In dismissing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>malpractice claim because the <em>Portee </em>claim was not tolled, the judge essentially stated that he found that the complaint stated a valid cause of action, thus he was <em>not </em>dismissing on the ground that there was no merit to the underlying claim (an argument Bierman made).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">The cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress, recognized by the Court in <em>Portee, </em>\u201crequires proof of the following elements: (1) the death or serious physical injury of another caused by defendant\u2019s negligence; (2) a marital or intimate, familial relationship between the plaintiff and the injured person; (8) observation of the death or injury at the scene of the accident; and (4) resulting severe emotional distress.\u201d <em>Portee, supra, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>at 101,417 A.2d 521. Leviton alleges that plaintiffs cannot meet the <em>Portee </em>criteria because Mansour did not witness the injury to his daughter,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and therefore he cannot establish the required third element of such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">As set forth in <em>Portee, </em>the party seeking recovery must have \u201cobserv[ed] ... the death or injury at the scene of the accident ....\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In <em>Portee, </em>the Court relied substantially on a California Supreme Court decision which described and combined what became the third and fourth elements under <em>Portee: </em>\u2018Whether the shock resulted from a direct emotional impact upon plaintiff from <em>the sensory and contemporaneous observance of the accident, </em>as contrasted with learning of the accident from others after its occurrence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 97, 417 A.2d 521 (citing <em>Dillon v. Legg, </em>68 <em>Cal.2d </em>728, 740-41, 441 P.2d 912, 920, 69 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>72, 80 (Cal.1968)) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>Leviton cites the Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Dunphy v. Gregor, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>99, 642 A.2d 372 (1994), in which the Court noted cases where it \u201cencouraged narrow applications\u201d of the elements of such a claim, \u201cincluding] a requirement that the bystander contemporaneously observe both the wrongful act and its resulting harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 107, 642 A.2d 372 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">One of the decisions cited by the Court in <em>Dunphy </em>is its earlier decision in <em>Frame v. Kothari, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>638, 649, 560 A.2d 675 (1989), which is described, parenthetically, as \u201crequiring contemporaneous observation of both act of malpractice and fatal or gravely-injurious effects of that act on victim[.]\u201d <em>Dunphy, supra, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>at 107, 642 A.2d 372. Addressing <em>Portee </em>claims in the medical malpractice context, the <em>Frame </em>Court noted that \u201c[t]o justify recovery, the plaintiff should observe the kind of result that is associated with the aftermath of an accident, such as bleeding, traumatic injury, and cries of pain.\u201d <em>Frame, supra, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>at 643, 560 A.2d 675 (citation omitted). The Court further noted that to recover, \u201cthe plaintiff must witness the victim when the injury is inflicted <em>or immediately thereafter.\u201d Id. </em>at 644, 560 A.2d 675 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">It is plain to us that the products defendants would not be entitled to summary judgment dismissing Mansour\u2019s <em>Portee </em>claim on the ground that the father did not witness the accident. He heard the child\u2019s contemporaneous screams. The \u201cobservation\u201d required by <em>Portee </em>involves sensory perception, and sight is only one of the senses. Hearing is a form of perception that constitutes an observation. It is inconceivable that we would fail to recognize the claim of a blind parent who was in the room and heard the child\u2019s screams as she was being burned, simply because the parent could not see the accident. It is entirely consistent with <em>Pottee </em>and <em>Dillon </em>to recognize that auditory \u201cobservation\u201d of a traumatic accident meets the third element of a bystander liability claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Mansour also alleges that he came upon his injured child immediately after the accident, that he immediately rushed to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>room and saw the child\u2019s body steaming as a result of her burns. We need not determine whether seeing the immediate results of such an accident, without having perceived the moment of that accident (like coming upon an injured child lying in the street after being hit, without having actually seen or heard the collision), would itself be enough to meet the <em>Portee </em>requirement. <em>See, e.g., Mercado v. Transp. of New Jersey, </em>176 <em>N.J.Super. </em>234, 422 A.2d 800 (Law Div.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">We merely conclude that Mansour\u2019s complaint is sufficient to state a claim for bystander liability under <em>Portee, </em>and that if his proofs at trial are consistent with the allegations of the complaint, a reasonable jury could find in his favor. We do not suggest the result of such a trial, only that Mansour may proceed on that claim. The next question, then, is whether Bierman on the one hand, or Farberware and Leviton on the other, must defend that claim. The answer depends upon whether the two-year statute of limitations, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-2, is tolled on Mansour\u2019s <em>Portee </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-2.1, enacted in 1964, well before <em>Portee </em>was decided in 1980, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-8\">Where a parent or other person has a claim for damages suffered by him because of an injury to a minor child caused by the wrongful act, neglect or default of any person within this State, an action at law upon such claim may be commenced by the said parent or other person within the same period of time as provided by law in the case of the said minor child so injured provided that, if an action is commenced by or on behalf of the said minor child, the said claim of the parent or other person shall be asserted and maintained in such action brought on behalf of the injured minor child either as a plaintiff' or third party plaintiff and if not so asserted shall be barred by the judgment in the action brought on behalf of said injured minor child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">The plain language of that statute allows a parent, who claims to have suffered damages as a result of injury to his child, to wait to file suit until the child\u2019s suit is brought, but no longer.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-10\">The tolling statute enacted in 1964 obviously did not contemplate the specific circumstances of <em>Portee, </em>a 1980 decision. But the bystander liability cause of action, albeit narrower, existed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>1964. And the Legislature, presumed to be aware of the common law, has never, in the twenty-five years since the 1980 decision in <em>Portee, </em>amended the tolling statute to exclude bystander liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">The tolling statute does not define a parent\u2019s allowable \u201cclaim for damages suffered by him because of an injury to a minor child caused by\u201d another\u2019s wrong. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-2.1. It merely provides that such a claim, insofar as it is otherwise allowed, will be tolled. The underlying assumption of the tolling statute is that proof of the child\u2019s cause of action is an essential element of the parent\u2019s. <em>See Model Jury Charge </em>5.15.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> That is what makes the claim \u201cderivative.\u201d <em>Compare Procanik v. Cillo, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>339, 355-56, 478 A.2d 755 (1984) (addressing the parents\u2019 claim for negligent advice and treatment during pregnancy that deprived them of an opportunity to avoid birth of a child with severe defects). \u201cThe defect in the parents\u2019 argument in the present case is that their right to recover is not \u2018because of injury\u2019 to their child, but because of direct injury to their own independent rights. Consequently, the parents\u2019 right to recover is not derivative from the claim of the child and is, therefore, barred by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-2 [and not tolled by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-2.1].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 356, 478 A.2d 755.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">An injured child\u2019s negligence or products liability claim is tolled during legal infancy, allowing time for the full extent of the child\u2019s injuries to be assessed, and for the child upon reaching majority to act on his or her own behalf. The essential elements of a parent\u2019s <em>Portee </em>claim will include the elements of the child\u2019s claim. Yet if the parent is not allowed the same tolling period, the parent will be forced within two years to file (and try) the same products claim that the child may pursue years later. Such duplication of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>effort and expense, with its potential for inconsistent verdicts, makes no sense and cannot have been intended by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">Just as in a per quod action, which unquestionably is governed by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-2.1, a <em>Portee </em>action requires all of the same proofs on liability as the underlying negligence/products liability action. It would make little or no sense to allow, much less effectively to require, separate lawsuits, especially when the parent\u2019s case likely would be tried first to avoid the two-year time bar. The statute itself implies exactly that rationale, by allowing the parent\u2019s action the same tolling period as an action on behalf of the child, but no more: requiring the parent\u2019s action to be brought no later than the child\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Most significant to our conclusion that the <em>Portee </em>claim is tolled for as long as the child\u2019s claim is tolled is that the practical effect is entirely consistent with the entire controversy doctrine, <em>see Rule </em>4:30A, and its underlying rationale: to avoid multiple lawsuits on related claims involving the same parties, thereby also to avoid the risk of inconsistent results, and to promote judicial economy, all in a fair and equitable manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">The products defendants\u2019 reliance here upon language in <em>Goncalvez v. Patuto, </em>188 <em>N.J.Super. </em>620, 458 A.2d 146 (App.Div.1983), is misplaced. The cited language describes the \u201cemotional injury claim\u201d on behalf of the surviving infant brother as \u201cnot derivative\u201d of the death action and therefore entitled to its own tolling under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-21. <em>Id. </em>at 628-29, 458 A.2d 146. <em>Goncalvez </em>does not support defendants\u2019 argument. In that ease, one child died in a 1978 accident; by definition there was no basis for tolling the wrongful death or survivorship claims arising from his death. <em>See id. </em>at 623, 458 A.2d 146. The surviving child\u2019s <em>Portee </em>claim was tolled on account of his own infancy, and the parents\u2019 per quod claim, arising out of that surviving child\u2019s emotional injury from witnessing his brother\u2019s accidental death, was held to be tolled by the statute at issue here. <em>Id. </em>at 627-30, 458 A.2d 146. Only the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>parents\u2019 own <em>Portee </em>claim, arising out of the death of the first child, was held to be time-barred.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Having concluded that the statute of limitations on Mansour\u2019s bystander liability claim against Farberware and Leviton (and any other defendants) was tolled by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-2.1, it is obvious that Mansour cannot prove damages against Bierman. Summary judgment dismissing all claims and cross-claims against Leslie Bierman, Esq., therefore is affirmed, and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. On remand, plaintiff Mansour shall be permitted to amend his complaint against the products defendants to allege his <em>Portee </em>cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b627-8\"> Mansour's complaint did not explicitly allege a <em>Portee </em>claim against Farberware and Leviton. We shall come back to that procedural concern later in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b627-9\"> Bierman, plaintiffs' former lawyer, takes the same position as Farberware and Leviton in this appeal: that Mansour has no <em>Portee </em>claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b628-7\"> Of course, if Mansour had no <em>Portee </em>claim, or if the <em>Portee </em>claim was viable but the two-year statute applied, then Farberware and Leviton would be entitled to partial summary judgment on that portion of Mansour\u2019s individual suit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b628-8\"> Farberware argues, in all three Points of its brief, that the tolling statute invoked by the motion judge, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-2.1, does not apply to a <em>Portee </em>claim, that the statute of limitations ran on Mansour\u2019s claim against Farberware, and therefore Mansour\u2019s malpractice case against Bierman should not have been dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b629-8\"> Of course, if Mansour had no <em>Portee </em>claim, those defendants would be entitled to partial summary judgment on that claim. On the other hand, if Mansour\u2019s complaint states a <em>Porree </em>claim, then the argument that the statute is not tolled works against the products defendants as well as in favor of Bierman. Apparently, the products defendants sought a ruling on the legal merits of the <em>Portee </em>cause of action in order to avoid the necessity of addressing the tolling question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b629-9\"> Farberware argues on appeal that summary judgment dismissing Bierman should be reversed because the <em>Portee </em>claim was not tolled, and the legal malpractice action against Bierman should go forward. Leviton argues first that \"plaintiff does not establish the four elements of negligent infliction of emotional distress,\" and second, that if Mansour has stated a viable <em>Portee </em>claim, the statute has run as to the products defendants. Leviton then urges us to affirm the summary judgment in favor of Bierman, but only on the ground that no <em>Portee </em>claim has been stated against any defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b630-8\"> We need not address Leviton's contention that plaintiffs cannot establish defendants' negligence as the proximate cause of the accident. <em>Portee </em>does not require, as Levit\u00f3n contends, that plaintiff must \"relate the injury to any negligence of these defendants, or defects in the product, at that time.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b633-8\"> The model charge provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-9\">If the Court has already instructed the jury on the issue of liability vis-\u00e0-vis the victim and the defendant, use the following instruction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-10\">You should understand that if you have found in accordance with my previous instructions that the injury to (victim's name) was not a result, of defendant\u2019s negligence, then the plaintiff who witnessed the injury cannot recover damages from the defendant for emotional distress.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b635-12\"> In our recent opinion addressing a <em>Portee </em>claim, <em>Maldonado v. Leeds, </em>374 <em>N.J.Super. </em>523, 865 <em>A.2d </em>741 (App.Div.2005), we reversed summary judgment for the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 532, 865 A.2d 741. With respect to the statute of limitations argument, we did not address the tolling issue now before us; we reversed because there was a fact question on the accrual of the mother's <em>Portee </em>claim under the discovery rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
