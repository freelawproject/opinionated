Sometime after midnight, they noticed a man lying on the side of the street, and when they drove near him, they heard him say \u201cweed\u201d several times. Intending to make sure the man was not dead or in need of help, they slowed their automobile. When the driver, Brown, stopped the car, a man, later identified as defendant, approached, opened an unlocked rear door and entered the car uninvited. Defendant then provided verbal directions to a certain house and told the teenagers that if they took him to the house, he would get them marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-15\">Once at the house, defendant left the vehicle and told the teenagers he would be right back. When he returned, he said he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>needed to go to another location for the drugs. After instructing them to take him to a second location, defendant demanded that one of the females accompany him into the house, and Jones went with him. At trial, she testified that defendant locked her in a room inside the house and choked her to unconsciousness. When she awakened, he threatened her by saying he had a knife, and he raped her. None of the teenagers used their cell phones to call for help because they were afraid of defendant and afraid of being punished for attempting to purchase illegal drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Approximately twenty minutes after entering the house, defendant and Jones returned to the automobile. Defendant opened the unlocked driver\u2019s door and told Brown to move. Jones, who was crying, entered the back seat, exhibiting a cut on her eye and marks on her neck. Morgan testified that Jones subsequently told her that defendant had raped her.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">About forty-five minutes after taking control of the automobile, defendant stopped the car, took the keys and left. The teenagers then exited the automobile and ran away; Jones ran with untied shoes and unbuttoned pants. The teenagers eventually found help and contacted the police. A detective took Jones to the hospital, where she underwent a sexual assault exam. After the exam, a detective photographed the visible injuries on her face and neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">The vehicle was later found abandoned. A crack pipe was found inside. Jones and Brown identified defendant from a photo lineup. His DNA profile matched the spermatozoa profile on Jones\u2019s underwear.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">Defendant testified to a different version of events that occurred on the night of September 16, 2000. He testified that when he first encountered the teenagers, he got permission to enter the automobile after yelling to them that he had drugs for sale. Defendant testified that the teenagers purchased $10 worth of crack, and that he offered to give them extra if they drove him to West Trenton. Defendant also testified that while in the ear, he had a conversation with Jones about an exchange of sex for money, that Jones agreed to engage in sexual intercourse for $50, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>and that he paid her $25 \u201cupfront.\u201d Defendant testified that he demanded his money back when intercourse did not occur, and that when Jones tried to leave, he \u201cgrabbed her around the neck\u201d and told her to give him back his money.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">They returned to the car, and defendant suggested to Brown that he, defendant, should drive because it was late, and he knew how to get back to where he had been picked up. He repeatedly stopped to conduct drug sales from the car over a period of about forty-five minutes. Defendant testified that the teenagers were afraid because people were on the streets, jumping on cars; therefore, before making his last sale, he drove them to a secluded area and took the automobile keys so they would not leave him. When he returned to find the teenagers gone, he drove around looking for them. Then he parked the car and left the keys.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2a(3) raises second-degree sexual assault to first-degree \u201caggravated\u201d sexual assault if the sexual assault occurred under specific conditions, including if it occurred \u201cduring the commission, or attempted commission, ... of robbery, kidnapping, homicide, aggravated assault on another, burglary, arson or criminal escape.\u201d Carjacking is not explicitly enumerated in that statute. Prior to trial, the State moved to re-indict defendant on Counts 2 and 3, each of which alleged aggravated sexual assault by \u201can act of penetration ... during the commission or attempted commission of carjacking,\u201d because \u201ccarjacking\u201d was not one of the expressly listed offenses in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2a(3). The State moved to take the case back to the grand jury in order to seek an amended indictment alleging \u201ckidnapping,\u201d which is an enumerated offense in the statute, instead of \u201ccarjacking\u201d as the underlying offense. The trial judge deemed the request unnecessary, and therefore denied the motion. The judge analogized to the offense of \u201cmurder,\u201d which also is not in the statute, whereas the broader offense of homicide is.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-8\">THE COURT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-9\">It doesn\u2019t say anything about murder either, but I think we would all agree that murder would be one of the crimes that if committed during the course of a sexual assault, would cause it to be upgraded to aggravated sexual assault, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>DEFENSE COUNSEL:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-5\">Yes, your Honor, I would agree with that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">The judge then stated that the crime of carjacking is an upgrade of the crime of robbery, which is an enumerated offense in the statute. The judge also reiterated his analogy to murder and manslaughter (which are not enumerated offenses in the statute) and homicide (which is an enumerated offense in the statute), contending that even though \u201cmurder\u201d and \u201cmanslaughter\u201d are not expressly listed in the statute, they are crimes that are raised to the \u201caggravated\u201d status pursuant to the accepted contention that they fall under the generic \u201chomicide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">Prior to rendering sentence, the judge noted that he had reviewed the pre-sentence report, and named defendant\u2019s prior convictions. The judge then found aggravating factors 1, 3, 6, and 9, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1a(1), (3), (6), and (9), but no mitigating factors, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1b, and sentenced defendant to an aggregate term of forty-five years with a twenty-seven-year minimum prior to eligibility for parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">The judge expressly based aggravating factor 1, the nature of the offense, on his finding that defendant had generated fear in multiple victims for a substantial period of time. The judge appears to have based aggravating factors 3 (the risk that defendant would commit another crime), 6 (whether defendant\u2019s prior criminal record justifies a substantial sentence), and 9 (whether there is a need for deterrence) on defendant\u2019s prior criminal record,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> stating that \u201cit seems his crimes are more serious as they occur,\u201d that the defendant\u2019s \u201cprior criminal record justifies the imposition of a substantial prison term,\u201d and that \u201cthere is a very real and very definite need for deterrence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>The judge ruled that defendant\u2019s sentences on the carjacking counts would run concurrent to each other but consecutive to the aggravated sexual assault sentence; and the sentences on each kidnapping count would run concurrent to those for carjacking but consecutive to the sentences for aggravated sexual assault and terroristic threats. The judge explained that he imposed consecutive sentences because carjacking and kidnapping:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-6\">\u201c[a]re separate and distinct from the crime of aggravated assault ... and each of the carjacking and kidnapping counts are a separate and distinct crime and for three out of the four counts of each there are other victims ... and in light of all the circumstances before the court, there\u2019s a justification for a consecutive sentence for the carjacking and kidnapping that is consecutive to the aggravated sexual assault count of the indictment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">The judge also stated that he felt strongly about imposing a consecutive sentence for the kidnapping and carjacking counts, but did not do so because of the similarity between those crimes and because of the potential for reversal on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">Defendant contends that he was entitled to dismissal of the charge of aggravated sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b509-11\">Defendant first argues that because \u201ccarjacking\u201d is not an expressly enumerated offense in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2a(3), defendant\u2019s sexual assault offense should not have been elevated to first-degree aggravated sexual assault. Defendant adds that criminal statutes are to be strictly construed, citing <em>State v. Sewell, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>133, 603 A.2d 21 (1992), as support for that proposition. Second, defendant contends that even if <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2a(3) is construed to apply to carjacking, defendant\u2019s conviction should be vacated because the sexual penetration in this case did not occur \u201cduring the commission or attempted commission of the carjacking\u201d; the sexual act occurred before the carjacking began. In other words, defendant argues that the State did not prove the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>elements of an aggravated sexual assault beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Whether the unenumerated \u201ccarjacking\u201d falls within <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2a(3) is a question of law, and our review is de novo. <em>See Manalapan Realty L.P. v. Tp. Committee, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">The Code of Criminal Justice states that a person is guilty of aggravated sexual assault if the act of sexual penetration is committed \u201cduring the commission, or attempted commission, ... of robbery, kidnapping, homicide, aggravated assault on another, burglary, arson or criminal escape....\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:14-2a(3). While carjacking is not one of the explicitly enumerated crimes in that section of the Code, robbery is.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">Comparing the statutory elements of carjacking with the elements of robbery demonstrates the similarity between the two, and that carjacking is a form of robbery. The elements of robbery are set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-1a:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-10\">A person is guilty of robbery if, in the course of committing a theft, he:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-11\">(1) Inflicts bodily injury or uses force upon another; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-12\">(2) Threatens another with or purposely puts him in fear of immediate bodily injury; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-13\">(3) Commits or threatens immediately to commit any crime of the first or second degree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-14\">Both the robbery statute and the sexual assault statute were enacted and became effective in 1979, as part of Title 2C, the newly enacted Code of Criminal Justice. The carjacking statute was not enacted until 1993, fourteen years later.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-15\">The elements of carjacking are set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-2a:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa1\">A person is guilty of caijacking if <em>in the course of committing an unlawful taking </em>of a motor vehicle, as defined in R.S. 39:1-1, or in an attempt to commit an unlawful taking of a motor vehicle he:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-16\">(1) <em>inflicts bodily injury or uses force </em>upon an occupant or person in possession or control of a motor vehicle;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-17\">(2) <em>threatens </em>an occupant or person in control with, or purposely or knowingly puts an occupant or person in control of the motor vehicle in fear of, <em>immediate bodily injury;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>(3) <em>commits or threatens immediately to commit any crime of the first or second, degree; </em>or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-6\">(4) operates or causes said vehicle to be operated with the person who was in possession or control or was an occupant of the motor vehicle at the time of the taking remaining in the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-7\">An act shall be deemed \u201cin the course of committing an unlawful taking of a motor vehicle\u201d if it occurs during an attempt to commit the unlawful taking of a motor vehicle or during an immediate flight after the attempt or commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-8\">[Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">We agree with the trial judge and with the State\u2019s argument that carjacking is a form of robbery which the Legislature chose to single out for enhanced punishment. In <em>State v. Garretson, </em>313 <em>N.J.Super. </em>348, 712 A.2d 1226 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>428, 719 A.2d 1026 (1998), we explained that the carjacking statute created \u201c[a] new kind of robbery that is punishable more severely than robbery under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-1, with the specified added element in the carjacking statute of the taking of a motor vehicle....\u201d <em>Garretson, </em>313 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 355, 712 A.2d 1226.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">When we compare the robbery and carjacking statutes, it is apparent that the required elements mirror each other, except that carjacking includes the more specific element that the property taken unlawfully is a motor vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 356, 712 A.2d 1226.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It would be entirely illogical to conclude that the crime of carjacking, a more specific form of the crime of robbery, would not establish the required element of an aggravated sexual assault; one that is committed in the course of a robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b511-12\">Defendant contends that even if carjacking is a form of robbery which <em>could </em>satisfy <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2a(3) and thus establish a first-degree aggravated sexual assault, the evidence at trial does not support the required finding that sexual penetration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>the victim was committed \u201cduring the commission, or attempted commission\u201d of the carjacking.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In his charge to the jury with respect to count three, the judge instructed: \u201cAn actor is guilty of aggravated sexual assault if he commits an act of sexual penetration with another person during the commission or attempted commission of robbery.\u201d He also instructed that \u201cthe law defines carjacking as a form of robbery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">The record clearly supports the jury\u2019s finding on count 3 that defendant committed an act of penetration, but it does not support the finding that defendant was attempting or in the commission or in flight from commission of the carjacking during the time he was inside the house with the victim of the sexual assault. Irrespective of whether defendant had formed the intention of taking the vehicle before the sexual assault, he had not yet done so. Nor had he taken any \u201csubstantial step\u201d toward doing so. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-1a(3). The driver remained in control of the vehicle until after defendant and the victim of the sexual assault returned to the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">The question then is whether the record permits us to conclude that the jury found the elements of second-degree sexual assault under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2c(l), that is, an act of penetration when defendant \u201cuse[d] physical force or coercion, but the victim [did] not sustain severe personal injury.\u201d There is no question that the evidence supports such a finding; we must be satisfied, however, that the jury actually made that finding, and we are. Second-degree sexual assault, as defined by <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:14-2, requires proof of sexual penetration under one of several circumstances, including the actor\u2019s use of \u201cphysical force or coercion.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>The jury found defendant guilty on Count 4, charging the separate crime of terroristic threats against Jones, that is, threatening \u201cto commit any crime of violence with the purpose to terrorize....\u201d <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-3. That finding meets the required element of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2c(1). We therefore exercise our original jurisdiction to modify defendant\u2019s conviction on Count 3, which is reduced to second-degree sexual assault, and defendant shall be resentenced accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">Defendant contends that the trial court improperly permitted the State to impeach defendant with his 1996 conviction for fourth-degree aggravated assault. Defendant reasons that the trial court did not \u201cproperly balance the lapse of time and the nature of the crime to determine whether its relevance with respect to credibility ... outweighed the prejudicial effect to the defendant,\u201d citing <em>State v. Sands, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>127, 386 A.2d 378 (1978). Defendant argues that the 1996 conviction was remote in that it occurred more than \u201cseven years\u201d ago, was not \u201cserious\u201d under <em>Sands, </em>and does not involve a lack of veracity, dishonesty or fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">The standard of review requires us to defer to the trial court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of evidence of other crimes, unless that ruling constitutes an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Erazo, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>112,131, 594 A.2d 232 (1991); <em>see, e.g., Benevenga v. Digregorio, </em>325 <em>N.J.Super. </em>27, 32, 737 A.2d 696 (App.Div.1999), <em>certif. denied, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>79, 747 A.2d 287 (2000). \u201cIf the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the threat of prejudice, the evidence should be excluded ... The trial court, because of its intimate knowledge of the case, is in the best position to engage in this balancing process.\u201d <em>State v. Ramseur, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>123, 266, 524 A.2d 188 (1987). We disregard trial court errors unless they are \u201cclearly capable of producing an unjust result.\u201d <em>R. </em>2:10-2; <em>Gill-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number><em>man v. Bally Mfg. Corp., </em>286 <em>N.J.Super. </em>528, 528, 670 A.2d 19 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>174, 675 A.2d 1122 (1996) (the appellate court must not interfere unless the lower court \u201cpursue[d] a manifestly unjust course\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">The decision to admit evidence of a prior conviction rests \u201cwithin the sound discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Sands, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>at 144, 386 A.2d 378. This discretion is broad, and the key to exclusion is remoteness. <em>Ibid. </em>The trial judge should consider the passage of time and the nature of the prior convictions, but also may consider whether the defendant has an extensive prior criminal record and the crime for which he is being tried. <em>Id. </em>at 145, 386 A.2d 378. If the decision is made to admit evidence of a prior crime that is the same or similar to the crime charged, the trial judge must \u201csanitize\u201d the admissible evidence and limit cross examination on the prior crime to the degree and the date of the offense, excluding \u201cany evidence of the specific crime of which defendant was convicted.\u201d <em>State v. Brunson, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>377, 390-91, 625 A.2d 1085 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">The State asserts that it is common in New Jersey for courts to find that convictions that are fewer than ten years old are admissible when used for impeachment purposes. <em>State v. Spivey, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>229, 243, 844 A.2d 512 (2004) (six years from the date of the prior conviction to the date of the trial did not exceed the permissible threshold); <em>State v. Lagares, </em>247 <em>N.J.Super. </em>392, 398, 589 A.2d 630 (App.Div.1991) <em>affd in part, rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>20, 601 A.2d 698 (1992). The State argues that defendant\u2019s 1996 conviction is not remote because it occurred just four years prior to charges lodged against him in 2000 for these crimes, and just seven years prior to defendant\u2019s trial. The State also argues that <em>Sands </em>does not limit prior convictions used for impeachment to those that involve a lack of veracity, dishonesty or fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">Here, the trial judge held a hearing as to the admissibility of defendant\u2019s 1996 conviction, and determined it was admissible for impeachment purposes pursuant to <em>Sands. </em>The judge found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>the conviction serious, not remote, opining that it was a \u201cGraves Act offense for pointing <em>a firearm,\u201d </em>that an eighteen-month sentence had been imposed for the crime, and only four years had passed between the conviction and the charge for the current crime. The judge also restricted the use of that conviction under <em>Brunson, </em>because both the prior conviction and current charges involved assault. During cross-examination of defendant, the State properly restricted its use of the prior conviction to the degree and date of the crime. We reject defendant\u2019s argument on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Defendant contends that the State improperly questioned him at trial on his post-arrest silence, in violation of his right to a fair trial. Defendant acknowledges that he did not raise this issue at the trial level, and we address the issue under the plain error standard, that is, to be disregarded unless \u201cclearly capable of producing an unjust result.\u201d <em>R. </em>2:10-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">Unquestionably, the State may not question a testifying defendant about why he was silent during police questioning. <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 <em>U.S. </em>610, 619, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>2240, 2245, 49 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>91, 98 (1976); <em>State v. Deatore, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>100, 115, 358 A.2d 163 (1976) (holding that \u201ca defendant is under no obligation to volunteer to the authorities at the first opportunity the exculpatory story he later tells at his trial and cannot be penalized directly or indirectly if he does not\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">Our review of the trial transcript supports the State\u2019s contention that defendant was not questioned in violation of that rule, and defendant\u2019s argument is without merit. <em>See R. </em>2:11-3(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b515-11\">Defendant contends generally that his sentences \u201cabove the presumptive, including parole disqualifiers, violated [his] con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>stitutional rights to trial by jury and due process of law.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s argument invokes <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 <em>U.S. </em>296, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004); <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 <em>U.S. </em>466, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>2348, 147 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>435 (2000); and the New Jersey Supreme Court\u2019s 2005 decisions in <em>State v. Natale, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>458, 878 A.2d 724 (2005), and <em>State v. Abdullah, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>497, 878 A.2d 746 (2005). Under those cases, a defendant may not be sentenced to a term beyond the maximum that could be imposed based upon the jury\u2019s verdict alone, except for the \u201crecidivism\u201d exception. <em>Abdullah, supra, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>at 506, 878 A.2d 746. The Supreme Court has held that under the Code as enacted, presumptive terms constituted the maximum. <em>Natale, supra, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>at 484, 878 A.2d 724. In <em>Natale, </em>the Court excised the Code\u2019s presumptive terms in order to maintain the sentencing ranges otherwise prescribed. Thus a defendant whose appeal involves a sentence above the presumptive, based upon aggravating factors other than prior convictions, is entitled to a new sentencing proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">The Supreme Court in <em>Natale </em>held that its decision is to apply retroactively to cases then on direct appeal. <em>Natale, supra, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>at 494, 878 A.2d 724. Defendant\u2019s appeal was filed on January 1, 2004, and his sentence on remand shall be governed by <em>Natale.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">But <em>Natale </em>does not apply to defendant\u2019s sentences for carjacking or kidnapping. The sentencing range for first-degree carjacking, ten to thirty years, is higher than the general range of ten to twenty years for most first-degree crimes, <em>compare N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-2b <em>with N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6(a)(l); the sentencing range for first-degree kidnapping, fifteen to thirty years, is also higher than the general range for a first-degree crime, <em>N.J.S.A. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>2C:13-1c. Under the Code, however, there is no presumptive term for kidnapping or carjacking. <em>See State v. Bryant, </em>217 <em>N.J.Super. </em>72, 84, 524 A.2d 1291 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>202, 528 A.2d 24, <em>cert. denied, </em>484 <em>U.S. </em>978, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>490, 98 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>488 (1987) (no presumptive sentence for kidnapping); <em>State v. Zadoyan, </em>290 <em>N.J.Super. </em>280, 290, 675 A.2d 698 (App.Div. 1996) (no presumptive sentence for carjacking). Defendant\u2019s sentences for those crimes do not themselves require resentencing under <em>Natale. </em>The only sentence defendant received that requires a remand under <em>Natale </em>is his five-year sentence on Count 4 for third-degree terroristic threats. That sentence exceeds the four-year presumptive term that was in effect at the time, and was based upon more than defendant\u2019s prior record. It therefore requires resentencing under <em>Natale.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Defendant\u2019s twenty-year sentence for first-degree aggravated sexual assault is moot. As we said in Part II of this opinion, defendant must be resentenced in light of the reduction of his sexual assault conviction to a second-degree crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">We briefly address defendant\u2019s remaining arguments respecting his sentence, as guidance for the court on remand. Defendant correctly notes that aggravating factor 1 may be found only upon a showing that the crime was committed in a matter that is heinous, cruel or depraved. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1(a)(1); <em>State v. Jarbath, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>394, 404, 555 A.2d 559 (1989). However, defendant is incorrect in contending that the trial judge here made no finding related to the seriousness of the offenses. In fact, while the sentencing judge did not expressly use the terms \u201cheinous,\u201d \u201ccruel,\u201d or \u201cdepraved,\u201d the judge demonstrated his finding that the crimes fit those descriptions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-8\">I had the opportunity to preside over this trial and there\u2019s no question in my mind that what Mr. Drury did here was to subject the victims to a night of terror, a nightmare that they will never forget. He held them in the car for a substantial period of time in an area where they were not familiar in an area which has been described as a high crime area by the witnesses who testified. They didn\u2019t know what to do. They didn\u2019t know whether or not they would leave with their lives. This terror was especially apparent in the case of Ms. Axner [sic] who was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>victim of Mr. Drury\u2019s sexual assault ... Mr. Drury took advantage of his situation. Took advantage to the peril of the people involved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">So long as defendant\u2019s new sentence on each crime is within the statutory range, we see no reason to disturb the judge\u2019s findings respecting aggravating factor 1.</p>\n<p id=\"AeJ\">Likewise, in finding aggravating factor 9, the judge prefaced his finding with a review of defendant\u2019s prior conviction history and stated that \u201c[t]here is a very real and very definite need for deterrence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">Finally, defendant contends that the trial judge\u2019s decision to impose his carjacking and kidnapping sentences consecutive to his aggravated sexual assault conviction violates the sentencing principles articulated in <em>State v. Yarbough, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>627, 498 A.2d 1239 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 <em>U.S. </em>1014, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1193, 89 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>308 (1986), because the offenses here were \u201cinterdependent.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We perceive no merit to defendant\u2019s contention. We do note that in <em>Abdullah, </em>the Court found <em>Blakely </em>inapplicable to imposition of consecutive sentences under the State\u2019s sentencing standards. <em>Abdullah, supra, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>at 512-13, 878 A.2d 746. The Court held that sentencing courts have the discretion to impose consecutive sentences when a defendant is convicted of multiple offenses, as long as the sentencing court articulates its reasoning with respect to the <em>Yarbough </em>factors. <em>Id. </em>at 513, 515, 878 A.2d 746 (citing <em>Yarbough, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>at 643,498 A.2d 1239).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">Defendant\u2019s convictions on Counts 4 through 8 and 10 through 13 are affirmed, defendant\u2019s conviction on Count 3 is modified and affirmed as modified, and the case is remanded for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b504-13\"> The Judgment of Conviction indicates that defendant was acquitted on Count 1 (second-degree aggravated assault, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-1b(1)), but the jury actually convicted him of a lesser-included, third-degree aggravated assault. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-1b(7). On remand the judge shall correct the judgment and sentence defendant on the lesser-included offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b505-16\"> We have used fictitious names for each of the victims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b508-9\"> The judge noted that defendant had a 1996 conviction for aggravated assault, a 1998 conviction for conspiracy, \"two disorderly persons convictions as an adult,\" and a juvenile delinquency history which included \"an adjudication for robbery.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b511-13\"> In a press release announcing the signing of the carjacking statute, then New Jersey Governor James Florio was quoted; \u201c[U]ntil now, carjacking could be punished as robbery, assault, kidnapping or under other crimes ... the new law makes carjacking a separate first degree crime punishable by between ten and thirty years in jail.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 357, 712 <em>A.2d 1226.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b512-7\"><em> N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-2 provides, in pertinent part, that the sexual act</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-8\">[s]hall be deemed \"in the course of committing an unlawful taking of a motor vehicle\u201d if it occurs during an attempt to commit the unlawful taking of a motor vehicle or during an immediate flight after the attempt or commission.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b512-12\"> Criminal coercion, defined by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:13-5a(1), is established by a threat to \"inflict bodily injury ... or commit any other offense\u201d when acting \"with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>purpose unlawfully to restrict another\u2019s freedom of action to engage or refrain from engaging in conduct....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b516-7\"><em> </em>Defendant's brief refers only to \"prison terms above the presumptive.\u201d It does not specify which sentences he addresses.
