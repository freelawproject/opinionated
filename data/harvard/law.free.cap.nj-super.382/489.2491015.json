A similar summary judgment motion was denied as to plaintiff Cristina Pardo, and that matter was subsequently settled.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-11\">Plaintiff argues that she satisfied the threshold because \u201ca herniated disc diagnosed through the use of an MRI, a bulging disc diagnosed through the use of MRI, and TMJ displacement diagnosed through MRI are all credible objective medical evidence of a permanent injury\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and because she \u201chas illustrated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>significant impact on her life that is causally related to her injuries.\u201d Because <em>DiProspero v. Penn, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>477, 874 A.2d 1039 (2005), decided after summary judgment was entered, held that there is no \u201cserious life impact\u201d prong of the threshold, the only issue before us relates to whether the record reveals objective medical evidence of a permanent injury and plaintiffs contention that \u201cthe trial judge improperly took judicial notice by finding that a herniated disc must also correlate with a positive EMG test at the same level in order for a permanent injury within a reasonable degree of medical probability to exist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">There is no dispute that an MRI of plaintiffs lumbar spine reveals a \u201c[hjerniated disc at L1-L2 central and to the right extending to the right neural foramina,\u201d and that an MRI of plaintiffs cervical spine reveals a \u201cbulge of the disc at C6-C7.\u201d In granting summary judgment dismissing the complaint as to Capilla, the motion judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-7\">Alright. I have reviewed the motion papers, the medical records and the deposition transcripts that have been attached as well as counsel\u2019s argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-8\">While I appreciate counsel for the plaintiffs argument about cracking the door, I think you need to do a little bit more than that and in this situation, unlike [Cristina] Pardo where I find that the treatment, the findings and the injury and the surgery tie in directly with her limitations, I do not find in this situation that there is objective credible evidence of a serious permanent injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-9\">Even assuming that there were[,] in reviewing the lifestyle impact and reviewing the deposition transcripts once again, the blanket assertion as to limitations on sexual activities, it\u2019s not the same as [Cristina] Pardo. Hers is more direct and more resulting from the actual surgical procedure and I don\u2019t believe that even if I\u2019m wrong on the objective permanent serious injury, I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s a significant enough lifestyle impact for Claudia Capilla considering all the other activities that she\u2019s still able to do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">The summary judgment must be reversed because the motion judge gave no reasons for his conclusion that there was no \u201cobjective credible evidence of a serious permanent injury,\u201d despite the claims of plaintiff which include the reference to the MRIs. <em>See R. </em>1:7-4(a). However, the parties seem to agree that the following colloquy during argument of the motion embodied the judge\u2019s reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>THE COURT: [T]he herniated disk was found on an MRI at L-l L-2. Was there any additional testing that shows any limitations or symptoms as a result of that herniated disk?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-5\">[PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: Judge, I believe in this case, if I\u2019m not mistaken, I may be confusing the two. There was a positive EMG as well that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">THE COURT: Let me just check because I \u2014 \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-7\">[PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: \u2014 adds further evidence or at least adds further issues of fact for this court to consider in this motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-8\">THE COURT: See the EMG testing shows radiculopathy of the cervical area. I didn\u2019t see anything in the lumbar area. That\u2019s what my concern was. I didn\u2019t see anything that would attribute objective signs or symptomatology from the herniation in the lumbar area.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">We reject the suggestion that a judge\u2019s comment or question in a colloquy can provide the reasoning for an opinion which requires findings of fact and conclusions of law, and the granting of a motion for summary judgment requires such findings. <em>See R. </em>l:7-4(a) (providing that \u201c[t]he court shall by an opinion or memorandum decision, either written or oral, find the facts and state its conclusions of law thereon ... on every motion decided by a written order that is appealable as of right ... \u201d). <em>See also Vartenissian v. Food Haulers, Inc., </em>193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>603, 611-12, 475 A.2d 626 (App.Div.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">We also conclude that the finding of the herniated disc satisfies the threshold. Certainly, by definition, \u201c[a]n injury shall be considered permanent when the body part or organ, or both, has not healed to function normally and will not heal to function normally with further medical treatment.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8a. While there is merit to defendants\u2019 contention that plaintiffs life has not been adversely impacted, and therefore that she functions normally, there is no expert report suggesting the disc is function<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>ing normally or, in any event, that her herniated disc can \u201cheal\u201d to so function.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Moreover, in <em>Moreno v. Greenfield, </em>272 <em>N.J.Super. </em>456, 462-63, 640 A.2d 335 (App.Div.1994), we reversed the grant of summary judgment dismissing a complaint and held that \u201cthe objective evidence of injury [was] clear\u201d since the doctor \u201cobserved spasms in the [plaintiffs] cervical musculature and the thoraco/lumbosacral area over a two-year period\u201d and, \u201cmore important[ly],\u201d there was a \u201cdocumented L5-S1 herniated disc and the attendant problems suffered by plaintiff.\u201d <em>See also Bennett v. Lugo, </em>368 <em>N.J.Super. </em>466, 477, 847 A.2d 14 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>180 <em>N.J. </em>457, 852 A.2d 193 (2004) (stating that \u201cif a jury finds that plaintiffs disc herniation has been caused by the current accident, the jury can likewise reasonably find that the injury is serious and permanent\u201d (citing <em>Serrano v. Serrano, </em>367 <em>N.J.Super. </em>450, 459, 843 A.2d 358 (App.Div.2004), <em>rev\u2019d o.g., </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>508, 874 A.2d 1058 (2005)). Similarly, in <em>Martin v. Chhabra, </em>374 <em>N.J.Super. </em>387, 393, 864 A.2d 1155 (App.Div.2005), we also held that the trial court correctly determined that the verbal threshold\u2019s permanency requirement was satisfied since the \u201cplaintiff submitted sufficient objective, credible evidence of permanent injury\u201d by demonstrating the existence of a \u201ccentral herniation of the L5-S1 disc\u201d and a \u201cL4-5 disc bulge.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>We conclude that the existence of a herniated disc was sufficient to satisfy the verbal threshold.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We therefore need not address whether a disc bulge would have the same effect. To the extent defendants assert that there must be a Electromyogram and Nerve Conduction Study to confirm related nerve impingement, we reject the contention for purposes of summary judgment, and adhere to the conclusion in <em>Moreno v. Greenfield, supra, </em>272 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 466, 640 A.2d 835, that proof of nerve impingement is not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The grant of summary judgment is reversed, and the matter is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b520-12\"> Capilla was a passenger in the vehicle being driven by Ms. Pardo at the time of the accident with a vehicle being operated by defendant Omar Dominguez.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b520-13\"> Plaintiff asserts she satisfied the threshold by suffering \"a permanent injury within a reasonable degree of medical probability, other than scarring or disfigurement.\" <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8a.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b522-11\"> Electromyogram and nerve conduction studies reflected the presence of a left C5-C7 and right L5-S1 \"polyradiculopathy with acute and subacute features.\u201d Although there is no correlation between these studies and the MRI finding at L1-L2, we deal only with a motion for summary judgment and have never required \"nerve impingement\" to corroborate an MRI. <em>Moreno v. Greenfield, </em>272 <em>N.J.Super. </em>456, 466, 640 A.2d 335 (App.Div.1994). Moreover, while defendants repeat that there was no objective medical evidence of a permanent injury, they do not develop this argument before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b523-7\"> In the report of Dr. Gino S. Ramundo, the chiropractor who provided the certification required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8a, it is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-8\">Due to structural weakening of the spinal column, traumatically induced, [Capilla] can still anticipate future recurrences of the pain in the cervical and lumbar regions, from time to time. They will be especially prevalent at times of stress, fatigue, or emotional upset. There is little anyone can do to prevent this. Within a certain degree of medical probability this patient has suffered from a partial permanent disability that is causally related to this accident.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b523-9\"> <em>Martin, </em>nevertheless, upheld the trial court's summary judgment dismissal of the plaintiff's claim for noneconomic damages, finding that the court correctly determined that the serious life impact prong of the verbal threshold was not satisfied. <em>Martin, supra, </em>at 394, 864 A.2d 1155. As previously noted, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>Supreme Court subsequently eliminated that prong from the verbal threshold in <em>DiProspero, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b524-13\"> There may be cases in which a doctor may report that the herniation has or may shrink within a relatively short period of time following an accident, <em>see </em>mayoclinic.com/health/herniated disk, and may, in any event, present a fact issue. We need not consider that possibility in this case because there was no medical evidence or suggestion of shrinkage.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
