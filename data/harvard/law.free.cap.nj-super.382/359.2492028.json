The compensation judge ruled that the insurer failed to satisfy the statute because of two clerical errors contained in the typed notice that the insurer mailed to the Department. We reverse, concluding that the clerical errors did not materially impair the insurer\u2019s adherence to the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">The relevant facts are not complicated. Respondent Country Flooring Enterprises (\u201cCountry Flooring\u201d) procured workers compensation insurance coverage from appellant Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company (\u201cFireman\u2019s Fund\u201d) in a policy effective from December 24, 1998 through December 24, 1999. Country Flooring fell behind its payments on that policy. This caused Fireman\u2019s Fund to send a cancellation notice by certified mail to Country Flooring on February 19, 1999, reciting a cancellation date of March 6,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">Although Country Flooring did not receive or accept the certified mailing, that does not nullify the cancellation of its coverage. Under the applicable statutory provision, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-81,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>canceling insurer is not obligated to secure the insured\u2019s acknowledgment that it actually received the notice. Rather, subsection (a) of the statute only requires the insurer to send the cancellation notice to the insured at the insured\u2019s address listed on the insurance policy. That was indisputably done here. <em>Accord Cardinale v. Mecca, </em>175 <em>N.J.Super. </em>8, 11-12, 417 A.2d 551 (App.Div.1980)(certified mail deemed to satisfy the requirement of \u201cregistered mail\u201d for cancellation notices under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-81(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">There is also no dispute that Fireman\u2019s Fund afforded Country Flooring the full ten days notice required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-81(a). In fact, the cancellation date specified in the notice, March 6,1999, was fifteen days after the date of Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s mailing to Country Flooring.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">However, the statute prescribes a second step in order to make a policy cancellation effective. Specifically, subsection (b) of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-81 also requires the insurer to transmit a \u201clike notice\u201d to the Department of Banking and Insurance, along with a certified statement verifying that the notice to the insured called for by subsection (a) has been issued. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-81(b). As an administrative matter, such companion notices are routed to the Compensation Rating and Inspection Bureau (\u201cCRIB\u201d), a unit within the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Here, Fireman\u2019s Fund mailed such a companion notice to CRIB on April 7, 1999, informing the Department that it had canceled Country Flooring\u2019s coverage. However, as Fireman\u2019s Fund acknowledges, its typewritten notice to CRIB included two errors: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>(1) it listed the effective date of Country Flooring\u2019s one-year policy as \u201c12-24-99\u201d when it should have read \u201c12-24-98\u201d; and (2) it mistakenly stated that the employer\u2019s cancellation notice was mailed on \u201c3-25-99\u201d to Country Flooring, rather than the actual mailing date of February 19,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Based on these two errors in Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s notice to CRIB, the compensation court ruled that Fireman\u2019s Fund had failed to provide the Department the \u201clike notice\u201d required by the statute. Accordingly, the compensation court declared the policy cancellation ineffective. That ruling signified that Country Flooring continued to have compensation coverage with Fireman\u2019s Fund on May 5, 1999, the date on which its employee, petitioner Andrea Ongaro,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> sustained a workplace injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">We address the \u201clike notice\u201d issue on a clean slate. Although the relevant statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-81, dates back to 1917, no reported case law identifies the elements of the \u201clike notice\u201d called for under subsection (b). Nor have counsel pointed us to any germane legislative history on that narrow issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">As we understand it, from our reading of the statute as a whole and also from our colloquy with counsel at oral argument, the regulatory purpose of subsection (b) of the statute is to alert the State that an employer within New Jersey has caused its workers compensation coverage to lapse. Because such coverage provides employees in our State with an important safety net for workplace accidents, the Department has good reason to track which employers have active compensation coverage, and which ones do not. Such coverage through an insurance policy, or through a self-insurance fund, is mandatory for most employers in New Jersey. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>34:15-71 and -72. We were advised at oral argument that at times the Department conducts inspections of employers to assure that employers maintain such coverage, and that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>promptly obtain replacement coverage when their compensation policies are canceled.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">The question before us is whether the attempted \u201clike notice\u201d furnished by Fireman\u2019s Fund to the Department on April 7, 1999 comported with the statute in a manner sufficient to enable the State to carry out these regulatory objectives. We believe that it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">We conclude that the two incorrect dates contained in the insurer\u2019s notice to CRIB do not amount to a material deviation from the \u201clike notice\u201d requirements of subsection (b). No one has argued to us how those inaccuracies did or could have affected any regulatory action by CRIB or by the Department of Banking and Insurance, or any decisions by third parties who might have cheeked CRIB\u2019s records.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Respondent Country Flooring argues that \u201clike notice\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-81(b) connotes, in essence, \u201cidentical notice.\u201d In making this argument, respondent urges us to consider dictionary definitions of the adjective \u201clike,\u201d definitions which respondent interprets as requiring perfect replication of one thing for another. But we observe that the dictionary meaning of \u201clike\u201d is far broader than the mirror-image connotation advocated by respondent. For example, <em>Webster\u2019s II New College Dictionary </em>635 (1999) primarily defines the adjective \u201clike\u201d as \u201chaving the same <em>or almost the same </em>characteristics; similar.\u201d (our emphasis). That same dictionary lists, as synonyms for \u201clike,\u201d a number of flexible words such as \u201csimilar,\u201d \u201canalogous,\u201d and \u201ccomparable.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">We believe that a sensible reading of \u201clike notice\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-81(b) should not be guided by which dictionary definition one pulls off the shelf, but rather by the functional purposes of the statutory scheme. <em>Clifton v. Zweir, </em>36 <em>N.J. </em>309, 323, 177 A.2d 545 (1962)(courts should construe statutes realistically and sensibly, rather than mechanistically); <em>Scaffidi v. Horvitz, </em>343 <em>N.J.Super. </em>552, 558, 779 A.2d 439 (App.Div.2001)(codified provisions must be construed \u201cin a sensible manner that furthers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>the underlying purpose of the statute\u201d). Bearing those functional purposes in mind, we must respectfully part company with the compensation judge\u2019s rigid interpretation of subsection (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The errors in the April 7, 1999 document appear to be purely clerical in nature. Neither error reasonably could have thwarted the Department from recognizing that Country Flooring had lost its compensation coverage with Fireman\u2019s Fund. There was no deception or obfuscation. The remainder of the document accurately contained more than ample information to put the Department on notice of Country Flooring\u2019s policy cancellation.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">First, we do not see how the misstated effective (not cancellation) date listed for Country Flooring\u2019s policy in the CRIB notice made any difference here. A logical reading of the form is that the \u201cDecember 1999\u201d reference was simply a typographical error for \u201cDecember 1998.\u201d Otherwise, the form submitted to CRIB in April 1999 literally would have been canceling a policy that did not yet even exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">Second, the CRIB form\u2019s mistaken recitation of a <em>later </em>mailing date for the employer\u2019s cancellation notice, i.e., March 25 instead of February 19, caused no prejudice. Perhaps we would be concerned if an <em>earlier </em>date had been recited and the insured employer had been deprived of its full ten days under the statute to cure the non-payment of its premium. But that was not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">In sum, because we do not equate \u201clike notice\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-81(b) with \u201cidentical notice\u201d or \u201cperfect notice,\u201d we hold that the April 7, 1999 notice transmitted to the Department by Fireman\u2019s Fund sufficiently complied with the statute. Thus, Country Flooring\u2019s policy was lawfully cancelled on April 17,1999, ten days after the CRIB notice was filed. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-81(c). Because that date preceded petitioner Ongaro\u2019s May 5, 1999 workplace injury, the accident was not covered by Fireman\u2019s Fund, and recourse may now be pursued from the uninsured employers compensation fund. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-120.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>Although we certainly do not wish to encourage sloppiness by insurers or by others who file forms with state agencies, we do not believe the minor clerical mistakes specifically presented here warrant the adverse consequences imposed by the compensation court.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b391-11\"><em> J.S.A. </em>34:15-81 provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-12\">Any contract of insurance issued by a stock company or mutual association against liability arising under this chapter may be canceled by either the employer or the insurance carrier within the time limited by such contract for its expiration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-13\">No such policy shall be deemed to be canceled until:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Abd\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>a.
