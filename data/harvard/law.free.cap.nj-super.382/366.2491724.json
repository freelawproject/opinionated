Petitioner was rendered totally and permanently disabled from a combined Major Depression Disorder and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder as a direct result of a verbal assault committed by a squad sergeant. The central issue to be decided in this appeal is whether the abuse suffered by petitioner qualifies as a traumatic event in accordance with <em>Kane v. Board of Trustees, Police &amp; Firemen\u2019s Retirement System, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>651, 663, 498 A.2d 1252 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>(1985). Under the circumstances of this case, we conclude, that petitioner\u2019s permanent and total disability resulted directly from a series of traumatic psychic events entitling him to an accidental disability retirement allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The undisputed facts, which were presented to the ALJ by stipulation, are as follows.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Petitioner enrolled in the State Police Retirement System in November 1987, at which time he was almost twenty-three years old. In January 1998, he was charged with domestic violence involving an altercation with his girlfriend wherein he broke her nose. As a result, he was required to surrender his service revolver, assigned to desk duty, and transferred to the Hightstown Station. At approximately 9:00 p.m. on the first day of his new assignment, petitioner, who was working the 2:00 p.m. to midnight shift, came in contact with the squad sergeant, supervisor of an overlapping shift. The squad sergeant assembled his subordinates in the briefing room while petitioner remained at his desk in the radio room. After the squad was assembled, the squad sergeant called petitioner into the briefing room and introduced him by saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-6\">This is Bob Patterson, he\u2019s a Fat Fuck, a piece of shit rat, he will drag you down, [d]on\u2019t look at him don\u2019t talk to him, if he says anything to you ignore him, have no interaction with him, he\u2019s only here until he gets fired.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">The squad sergeant then told petitioner to get the \u201cfuck\u201d out of the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">Petitioner returned to the radio room. He felt like vomiting. Later, the squad sergeant came into the radio room, stood directly in front of petitioner with clenched fists, and asked, \u201cDo you have a problem?\u201d Petitioner looked down rather than at the squad sergeant. The squad sergeant then asked, \u201cDo you have a problem understanding me?\u201d Petitioner responded \u201cNo sir.\u201d The squad sergeant then told petitioner to \u201cgo downstairs and get changed you piece of shit, I don\u2019t want to be in the same building as you.\u201d Petitioner obeyed. There was no doubt in petitioner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>mind that if he did not submit he would be physically assaulted. As petitioner was about to leave the building, the squad sergeant approached and, standing a few inches from petitioner\u2019s face, said, \u201cFrom now on when my squad relieves you, you are to leave the building, DO YOU UNDERSTAND?\u201d Petitioner again felt that if he did not passively acquiesce to the squad sergeant\u2019s bullying he would be physically assaulted. Petitioner left and drove around for hours, contemplating suicide. He was \u201chumiliated\u201d and felt \u201cstripped of [his] manhood.\u201d He finally arrived home at 3:00 a.m. but could not sleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">When petitioner returned to work, he was told by another Sergeant that he did not have to leave the building when the squad sergeant\u2019s squad reported for duty but he would have to go back to the detective\u2019s office and stay out of sight until the end of his shift. Petitioner stated in his affidavit that he \u201cliterally hid in a closet for months.\u201d According to petitioner, he felt physically ill at the start of his shift and was shunned by his colleagues. When he entered a room, the other troopers would leave. According to petitioner, he received telephone calls from other troopers he knew who told him that rumors were \u201cspreading like wild fire.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">At another time, following his altercation with the squad sergeant, petitioner attended in-service training with 100 other troopers. The speaker gave a lecture on troopers involved in domestic violence, using petitioner\u2019s pending case as an example. The troopers in the room laughed and shook their heads. He overheard other troopers say that his case had also been used as an example on other days when they attended the lecture. Petitioner gained 100 pounds and became increasingly introverted and depressed, until he could no longer perform his duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">Petitioner was referred by a State Police physician to the Environmental and Occupational Health Services Institute (EOHSI) to be evaluated for fitness for duty. He was tested on June 4, 2002. In a report, the EOHSI found in part that petitioner</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-9\">has been off duty on stress leave since May 2001 due to depression and anxiety he attributes to a hostile work environment. [Petitioner] meets DSM-IV criteria for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>current diagnoses of Major Depressive Disorder and Social Phobia. He also meets criteria for the provisional diagnosis of Binge Eating Disorder. Personality testing reveals paranoid ideation of delusional proportions, social alienation depression, and anxiety.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">In a report dated June 27, 2002, petitioner\u2019s psychiatrist, Dr. Samuel Schneider, also diagnosed petitioner with \u201cMajor Depressive Disorder as well as features of a Post Traumatic Stress Disorder\u201d and found that petitioner\u2019s life has \u201cspiraled downward.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Dr. Carl J. Chiappetta, a Diplomate of the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology, performed an independent psychiatric evaluation at the Board\u2019s request. In a report dated February 13, 2003, Dr. Chiappetta concluded that petitioner is <em>\u201ctotally </em>and <em>permanently disabled </em>from the performance of his job duties as a N.J. State Trooper.\u201d He also reported that in his professional opinion <em>\u201cthe event of [February 1, 1998] \u2018constitutes the essential significant or the substantial contributing cause of the disability.\u2019\u201d </em>The Retirement System\u2019s Medical Review Board (MRB) concurred with Chiappetta\u2019s conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">On April 11, 2003, the Board requested both Chiappetta and the MRB to explain how the \u201cverbal altercation\u201d of February 1 \u201ccould constitute the essential contributing cause of [petitioner\u2019s] total and permanent disability.\u201d Chiappetta responded on April 23, 2003. Rendering the same causation conclusion he had given in his earlier report, Chiappetta pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-8\">The work-related \u201coccurrence\u201d ... has been, and continues to be, the critical event in question. According to the applicant, that occurrence did <em>not </em>involve a simple one or two minute verbal altercation, but involved a number of comments and/or interactions on that day. Furthermore, the applicant described the events of that day as being only the \u201cbeginning\u201d of a continuous process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-9\">What is important to consider is the fact that Trooper Patterson perceived the events of [February 1, 1998] as the immediate/ongoing critical occurrence, which was only the beginning point of a downward spiral regarding his job.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-10\">Therefore, I can only state that the IME Examiner is <em>not the trier of truth. </em>That is, the reviewing Board is ultimately given the responsibility to decide whether or not there was a \u201cfactual event\u201d in regards to a traumatic incident. I can only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>report my opinions, which <em>are </em>based <em>primarily on </em>the \u201cperceived\u201d reactions and revelations of the applicant, barring actual documentation to the contrary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">The MRB reported again that it concurred with Chiappetta respecting causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">Pointing out that \u201c[t]he normal work of a trooper does not include public humiliation and/or threat of harm from a superior officer,\u201d the ALJ concluded \u201cthe combined public humiliation and fear of physical retribution coming as one event sequence on February 1, 1998, was ... a piercing assault upon the mind\u201d and qualified as a traumatic event. The Board found that the ALJ\u2019s decision was \u201cerroneous\u201d because his conclusion of law ran \u201ccontrary to established precedent in this area.\u201d It differentiated the administrative decision in <em>Just-Cornelius v. Bd. of Trustees of the State Police Ret. Sys., </em>OAL Dkt. No. TYP 01804-95, decided August 29, 1997, where the petitioner, a female undercover trooper, was found to qualify for accidental disability based upon psychic trauma resulting from continued harassment from her supervisor over a period of months. The Board noted that, unlike the <em>Just-Cornelius </em>decision, petitioner\u2019s case involved \u201c[a] single instance of abusive language\u201d and fell \u201cfar short of the intense, sustained and brutal treatment experienced by that trooper.\u201d The Board also concluded that because the ALJ\u2019s decision was based upon stipulated facts and not a finding of credibility, it did not have to defer to the ALJ\u2019s conclusions of law, with which it disagreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">To be eligible for an accidental disability allowance, a person must be found to be permanently and totally disabled as a direct result of a traumatic event occurring during and as a result of the performance of the employee\u2019s duties. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-7(1). In <em>Kane, supra, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>at 663, 498 A.2d 1252, the Court enunciated a three-prong test for determining whether an event is traumatic. First, the injury must not have been \u201cinduced by the stress or strain of the normal work effort\u201d; second, the employee must have \u201cmet involuntarily with the object or matter that was the source of the ham\u201d; and third, the \u201csource of the injury itself was a great rush of force or uncontrollable power.\u201d On appeal, the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>concede that the only issue to be resolved is whether the third prong is satisfied. The Board argues that petitioner failed to establish that his injuries were caused by a great rush of force or uncontrollable power. It asserts that the administrative decision in <em>Just-Cornelius </em>is an \u201caberration.\u201d It also distinguishes <em>Just-Cornelius, </em>contending that the facts there were \u201cfar more insidious\u201d and involved intense and repugnant harassment occurring over a period of six years rather than a single incident. The Board finally asserts that <em>Just-Cornelius </em>is not binding upon us, but at the same time argues that it is inconsistent with other administrative decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">We need not consider the various administrative decisions. Instead, we begin our analysis with <em>Pushko v. Board of Trustees of the Teachers\u2019 Pension &amp; Annuity Fund, </em>208 <em>N.J.Super. </em>141, 505 A.2d 154 (App.Div.1986). In <em>Pushko, </em>the underlying question was whether a purely psychiatric trauma can constitute a \u201ctraumatic event\u201d within the <em>Kane </em>definition. <em>Id. </em>at 143-44, 505 A.2d 154. John Pushko, a physical education teacher, was brutally assaulted by a student who hit him across the face with a cane in October 1977. <em>Id. </em>at 142, 505 A.2d 154. In December 1980, Pushko was attacked by another student who punched him in the chest and threatened to get a gun and kill him. <em>Id. </em>at 142-43, 505 A.2d 154. In February 1981, while Pushko was walking a hallway, he came upon a group of ten students who were encouraging two male students engaged in a fistfight. Pushko broke up the fight. Pushing aside one of the students, and not being aware of what he was doing, he began choking the other student. Another teacher separated Pushko from the student. <em>Id. </em>at 143, 505 A.2d 154. The third episode was deemed to be a contributing cause of a psychic disability suffered by Pushko following that incident. <em>Ibid. </em>Differentiating between physical trauma and psychic assault, the panel in <em>Pushko </em>pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">If petitioner\u2019s body had been struck as a result of trying to stop the fight, that physical blow, had it caused physical injury, would clearly have qualified as a great rush of force or uncontrollable power. Here it was petitioner\u2019s mind which was dealt a blow as a consequence of the fight. Thus, <em>if the fight itself constituted a </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number><em>psychic assault which inevitably set into motion petitioner\u2019s physical and ultimately devastating psychological responses, </em>it may be viewed as constituting an external uncontrollable power.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 145-46, 505 A.2d 154 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">We are aware that another panel of this court recently held that psychic stimulus alone, absent the application of \u201cexternal physical force\u201d does not qualify as a traumatic event sufficient to establish eligibility for accidental disability benefits under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43A5A-43. <em>Moore v. Bd. of Trs. of the State Police Ret. Sys., </em>382 <em>N.J.Super. </em>347, 349, 889 A.2d 445, 446. The panel in <em>Moore </em>rejected the theory espoused in <em>Pushko, supra, </em>208 <em>N.J.Super. </em>141, 505 A.2d 154, that a psychic assault could constitute a great rush of force or uncontrollable power and thus satisfy the third prong enumerated in <em>Kane. Moore, supra, 382 N.J.Super. </em>at 358, 889 A.2d at 451. Contrary to our colleagues, we conclude that, like the psychic event in <em>Pushko, </em>the squad sergeant\u2019s tirade and subsequent threats constituted an ongoing, continuous psychic assault amounting to a great rush of uncontrollable power.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">The Board asserts that petitioner\u2019s reliance on <em>Taylor v. Metzger, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>490, 706 A.2d 685 (1998), is misplaced. The plaintiff in <em>Taylor, </em>an African American woman, worked in the Burlington County Sheriff\u2019s Office. She claimed that she suffered emotional distress as a result of the utterance of a racial epithet against her by the Sheriff when she was being introduced to another supervisor, the Undersheriff. Concluding that \u201c[rjacial slurs, especially when used by an employee\u2019s superior at the workplace, can wound,\u201d the Court held that the plaintiff presented sufficient evidence to withstand summary judgment on her claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress and violation of the Law Against Discrimination (LAD). <em>Id. </em>at 518-20, 706 A.2d 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">At oral argument, the Board essentially argued that <em>Taylor </em>does not apply to the circumstances under consideration because the statutorily required traumatic event evidences the legislative intent to require something more than a single incident of abusive behavior. We agree that the proofs required to carry the day in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>an accidental disability claim under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-7 are different from those necessary to establish violation of the LAD and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Where we part company with the Board is with its finding that the circumstances are insufficient to establish a traumatic event because it arises out of a single event of abusive language.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">The undisputed evidence established that there was a series of events, albeit on the same day, which spontaneously progressed into an ongoing process leading inextricably to petitioner\u2019s psychological and physical disability. The first event occurred in the briefing room when the squad sergeant humiliated petitioner in front of the squad sergeant\u2019s subordinates and effectively ordered them not to interact with petitioner. The next event occurred after the squad sergeant completed the briefing and confronted petitioner in the radio room, rhetorically asking whether petitioner had a problem understanding him, and ordering him to leave the building. The third event occurred when petitioner was leaving and the squad sergeant told him to leave the building when his squad was present.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">To be sure, the squad sergeant\u2019s abusive and brutal verbal confrontations amounted to psychic assaults. Coming from a superior officer in a paramilitary organization, the squad sergeant\u2019s verbal assaults had the indicia of great power. Moreover, they were not within petitioner\u2019s control. The ongoing deleterious effect of the squad sergeant\u2019s order to stay away was reinforced by the direction petitioner received from another superior officer that he hide in the detective\u2019s office when the squad sergeant\u2019s squad was present. That advice and the subsequent incidents of being shunned and mocked by colleagues were additional psychic events that served to intensify the February 1 traumatic events. Simply put, the undisputed evidence established multiple traumatic psychic events evidencing intense, brutal, and hostile treatment, not the \u201csingle instance of abusive language\u201d characterized by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>Equally unavailing is the Board\u2019s assertion that the ALJ placed too much weight on petitioner\u2019s statement that the squad sergeant\u2019s confrontations in the radio room and at the time he was leaving the building put him in fear for his personal safety. The Board concedes that it did not object to the submission of petitioner\u2019s affidavit, which was included in the stipulated facts and expressed petitioner\u2019s perception that he experienced fear for his personal safety during the confrontations with the squad sergeant. The Board also argues that there was \u201cno mention that petitioner had such an intense fear in any of the three psychological evaluations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Generally, an appellate tribunal need not consider questions not properly presented to a trial court, unless the issue raised concerns matters of great public interest. <em>Nieder v. Royal Indem. Ins. Co., </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>229, 234, 300 A.2d 142 (1973). Contrary to the Board\u2019s assertion, however, there was sufficient evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s findings. Dr. Chiappetta\u2019s response to the Board\u2019s inquiry as to how the verbal altercation could constitute the essential contributing cause of petitioner\u2019s disability emphasized, \u201cWhat is important\u201d is that petitioner \u201cperceived the events of [February 1, 1998] as the immediate/ongoing critical occurrence, which was only the beginning point of a downward spiral regarding his job.\u201d We are satisfied on this record that the ALJ was justified in his factual conclusions concerning the petitioner\u2019s perceived fear, given the confrontational setting in which petitioner found himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b398-11\"> The stipulated facts appear in the ALJ\u2019s written decision and are acknowledged as stipulated by the Board in its final decision of January 27, 2005.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
