Plaintiffs alleged racial discrimination based on (1) failure to promote, (2) disparate treatment, (3) hostile work environment, and (4) unlawful aiding and abetting liability by the individual defendants. In an amended complaint the plaintiffs further asserted (5) retaliation against plaintiffs by virtue of the filing of the complaint, and (6) spoliation of evidence by destroying a \u201changman\u2019s noose\u201d and \u201cwhite cross\u201d which had allegedly been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>displayed in retaliation for the suit. Plaintiffs assert that summary judgment was improperly granted on the failure to promote, disparate treatment, hostile work environment and aider and abettor liability counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">We dismiss the appeal as interlocutory.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See R. </em>2:5-6. <em>See also R. </em>2:2-4. Counts five and six of the complaint remain pending for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">At the argument before us, plaintiffs noted that defendants\u2019 prior motion to dismiss the appeal, filed shortly after the appeal was filed, had been denied. We have obtained and reviewed that motion, and conclude that, in the absence of an order or statement granting leave to appeal <em>nunc pro tunc </em>(which plaintiffs never sought), the denial of the motion to dismiss merely preserved the issue for later review in the context of the plenary appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">We note that plaintiffs argued in the motion papers that if the appeal is not decided before trial on the surviving counts, they will be \u201cprejudiced if they are forced to try their claims for retaliation without being able to introduce evidence and testimony concerning the harassment and other discriminatory behavior which occurred at Trenton Water Works.\u201d However, we have reviewed the trial judge\u2019s oral decision of May 12, 2004, and find no suggestion that evidence of the alleged discrimination cannot be introduced to explain the reasons for the alleged retaliation and spoliation. To the contrary, the evidence is relevant to the surviving claims. <em>See N.J.R.E. </em>402; <em>Rosenblit v. Zimmerman, </em>166 <em>N.J. </em>391, 409-10, 766 A.2d 749 (2001); <em>Kluczyk v. Tropicana Prods., </em>368 <em>N.J.Super. </em>479, 492-94, 500, 847 A.2d 23 (App.Div. 2004) (noting that \u201cthe evidence overlapped and proof of the harassment claim was necessary to show why defendants retaliat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>ed\u201d). As a result, our review of the record presented on the appeal convinces us that the appeal should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">We recognize the existence of cases like <em>Caggiano v. Fontoura, </em>354 <em>N.J.Super. </em>111, 125, 804 A.2d 1193 (App.Div.2002), in which leave to appeal has been granted <em>nunc pro tunc </em>in similar circumstances. However, if we treat every interlocutory appeal on the merits just because it is fully briefed, there will be no adherence to the Rules, and parties will not feel there is a need to seek leave to appeal from interlocutory orders. At a time when this court struggles to decide over 7,000 appeals a year in a timely manner, it should not be presented with piecemeal litigation and should be reviewing interlocutory determinations only when they genuinely warrant pretrial review. <em>See State v. Reldan, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>187, 205, 495 A.2d 76 (1985); <em>State v. Alfana, </em>305 <em>N.J.Super. </em>178, 190-92, 701 A.2d 1296 (App.Div.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">It may well be that this case will have to be tried twice if the partial summary judgment is ultimately reversed, but that is true of many cases involving grants of partial summary judgment. We do not perceive that this trial will be especially time-consuming or costly.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b487-9\"> The notice of appeal stated that the order was \"certified as final pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:42-2.\u201d There is no present contention that the matter could have been certified as final. <em>See R. </em>4:42-2. In fact, no certification was ever entered, and there is no judgment which can be enforced pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:59.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
