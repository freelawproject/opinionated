Plaintiff was diagnosed as having suffered disc herniations at C3-4, C4-5 and C5-6, along with straightening of the normal curvature of the cervical spine as a result of the accident. Apparently, there was no dispute that she suffered a permanent injury. The jury rendered a verdict in plaintiffs favor, awarding $100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">On February 27, 2004, defendants moved for a new trial or, alternatively, J.N.O.V. After hearing oral argument, the trial judge rendered a written decision denying the motion. An order memorializing the decision was entered on May 5, 2004. In this appeal defendants argue (1) their pre-trial motion for summary judgment should have been granted because plaintiff failed to satisfy the \u201cserious impact\u201d prong of <em>Oswin v. Shaw, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>290, 609 A.2d 415 (1992); (2) the trial judge improperly injected racial issues into the jury selection process and prohibited defense counsel from using peremptory challenges; and (3) the trial judge improperly injected racial issues into the cross-examination of defendants\u2019 expert doctor.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">Defendants\u2019 first point may be disposed by virtue of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>DiProspero v. Penn, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>477, 481, 874 A.2d 1039 (2005), which held that the plain language of the Automobile Insurance Cost Reduction Act (AICRA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-1.1 to -35 or 39:6A-8(a), does not contain a serious life impact standard and that a plaintiff need only demonstrate a permanent injury to satisfy the verbal threshold. We subsequently held that <em>DiProspero </em>afforded \u201cpipeline retroactivity\u201d to \u201call pre-judgment matters pending in the trial courts and to those matters that are on direct appeal.\u201d <em>Pungitore v. Brown, </em>379 <em>N.J.Super. </em>165, 169, 877 A.2d 305 (App.Div.2005); <em>Beltran v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number><em>Dehima, </em>379 <em>N.J.Super. </em>169, 176-77, 877 A.2d 307 (App.Div.2005). Since this matter was pending appeal when <em>DiProspero </em>was decided by the Supreme Court, this argument is rendered moot. <em>B. </em>2:8-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">The second issue on appeal arose during the course of jury selection. The jury pool included three African-American women. After exercising one peremptory challenge excusing a white male, defense counsel exercised a second challenge excusing an African-American woman. Immediately after defense counsel exercised the challenge, the following colloquy occurred between the court and defense counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">THE COURT: Juror number 7.... [Defense counsel], let me see you at side bar.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-8\">[Plaintiffs counsel], let me see you at side bar.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">(Side Bar)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-10\">THE COURT: Just so that the record is clear, you\u2019ve just excused the black juror. I have a black plaintiff. In order to protect the class, you\u2019ve got to put on the record the reasons why you excused her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I excused her for the same reason that I excused the white male juror. Just struck me as a person who would be generous to the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-12\">THE COURT: How do you know that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-13\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I don\u2019t know that. I don\u2019t know if the white male would have been generous to the plaintiff or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-14\">THE COURT: You\u2019re going to have a better reason next time you excuse a member of a protected class, especially when it\u2019s a black juror and you have a black plaintiff. Just your own gut feeling is not going to be enough in my court room.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHQ\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-15\">THE COURT: If there was something she said or something that had background that would point to that, that\u2019s fine, but just say \u2014 just say\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-16\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I would ask that you keep your voice down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-17\">THE COURT: Pardon me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-18\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I would ask Your Honor that \u2014 I think the people can hear what you\u2019re saying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-19\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t think so, but I know you can hear it and you\u2019re not happy with it, but guess what, I don\u2019t like people who excuse black jurors in a situation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>where I have a black plaintiff because that leads to charges later on, counselor. Charges that are perhaps not founded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-6\">That\u2019s why the case was decided the way it was, and that\u2019s why I ask you to put the reasons on the record and to tell me I think that she\u2019s going to be too generous is not enough for me. I need specific reasons based on the facts that you have on this juror.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Beyond the fact that I believe, Your Honor, there has to be an indication of some kind of pattern before this kind of unfortunate accusation is made, she was a third grade teacher. The plaintiff works with children at the school \u2014 at the religious school that she works at\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-8\">THE COURT: That\u2019s all you have to tell me. You see, now you\u2019re giving me a valid excuse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I\u2019m very disturbed. I really am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-10\">THE COURT: You should be. Just like I was disturbed when you gave the first reason, but when you give me that kind of a reason, now I can say absolutely correct. If the situation is she\u2019s a third grade teacher. The plaintiff is a teacher\u2014 children, and therefore, there might be some kind of a situation there where there might be some \u2014 I can understand that, but you have to give me some reasons, counselor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, Your Honor, I believe that this entire discussion is premature. There\u2019s two other black women\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-12\">THE COURT: It\u2019s never premature, counselor. Not in my book.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-13\">(Side Bar Concluded)</p>\n<p id=\"b471-14\">Juror number seven was then excused and replaced by another African-American female. Defense counsel did not seek to excuse the second African-American woman nor did he state any further objections to the trial judge\u2019s intervention. The remaining jurors were selected without incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-15\">In their motion for a new trial, defendants argued that the trial court improperly injected racial issues into the jury selection, depriving them of a fair trial. The trial judge, in his written decision, concluded that he had the authority to <em>\u201csua sponte </em>contest a peremptory challenge by a party even if the opposing party has failed to do so. It is this court\u2019s duty to ensure the ends of justice and to guarantee that every litigant, including a litigant of a protected class, has a fair trial by an impartial jury that is a representative cross-section of the community.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>We begin our analysis of the peremptory challenge issue with the United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Batson v. Kentucky </em>in which the Court held, \u201c[t]he Equal Protection clause forbids the prosecutor to challenge potential jurors solely on account of their race or on the assumption that black jurors as a group will be unable impartially to consider the State\u2019s case against a black defendant.\u201d 476 <em>U.S. </em>79, 89, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1712, 1719, 90 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>69, 83 (1986). The principles of <em>Batson </em>were extended to civil trials in the interest of protecting each juror\u2019s equal protection right to be free from \u201cstate-sponsored group stereotypes rooted in, and reflective of, historical prejudice.\u201d <em>J.E.B. v. Ala. ex rel T.B., </em>511 <em>U.S. </em>127, 128, 114 <em>S.Ct. </em>1419, 1421, 128 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>89, 96 (1994). While <em>Batson </em>set the parameters for the exercise of peremptory challenges, it did not specifically instruct state courts how best to implement them. 476 <em>U.S. </em>at 99 n. 24, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1712.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The New Jersey Supreme Court molded its peremptory challenge jurisprudence on the state constitutional right to \u201ctrial by an impartial jury drawn from a representative cross-section of the community.\u201d <em>State v. Gilmore, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>508, 522-23, 511 A.2d 1150 (1986). The Court explicitly divorced its peremptory challenge jurisprudence from <em>Batson\u2019s </em>equal protection underpinnings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-6\">We refer to federal constitutional law only as establishing the floor of minimum constitutional protection. Furthermore, when we cite federal or other state court opinions in construing the provisions of our Constitution, we rely upon them merely for the purpose of guidance, not as compelling the result we reach on independent state grounds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 523-24, 511 A.2d 1150].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">The Court cautioned, however, that \u201c[t]he representative-cross-section rule by itself is insufficient to insure an impartial jury....</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">On the other hand, the representative-cross-section rule, applied unflinchingly, exalts demographic representativeness above the overall impartiality it aims to further.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 530, 511 A.2d 1150. In formulating the procedures for trial courts to monitor the exercise of peremptory challenges, the Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-10\">We must be careful not to place on the defendant a crippling burden of proof that is so inaptly tailored to the right to trial by an impartial jury in all criminal prosecutions that it effectively leaves the defendant a \u201cright\u201d without a remedy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>At the same time, we must be cautious not to discourage the prosecutor from using peremptory challenges in all proper instances to further, though not to undermine, the right to trial by an impartial jury. In aiming for this mean, we adapt to this context (rather than directly adopting) the burden-of-proof rules fashioned in \u201cdisparate treatment\u201d eases brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2000e to 2000e-17. <em>See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 <em>U.S. </em>792, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973); <em>Texas Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 <em>U.S. </em>248, 101 <em>S.Ct,. </em>1089, 67 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>207 (1981).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 533-34, 511 A.2d 1150].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">The Court in <em>Gilmore </em>articulated a burden-shifting test that begins with the rebuttable presumption that the party exercising the peremptory challenge did so on permissible grounds. This presumption may be rebutted upon a party\u2019s prima facie showing that the peremptory challenge was exercised on constitutionally-impermissible grounds, meaning that the party objecting to the peremptory challenge \u201cmust establish that the potential jurors wholly or disproportionately excluded were members of a cognizable group within the meaning of the representative cross-section rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 53-5-36, 511 A.2d 1150. If a prima facie case is established, the burden then shifts back to the party exercising the challenge to provide evidence that the \u201cchallenges under review are justifiable on the basis of concerns about situation-specific bias;\u201d that is, the party \u201cmust articulate \u2018clear and reasonably specific\u2019 explanations of its \u2018legitimate reasons\u2019 for exercising each of the peremptory challenges.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 537, 511 A.2d 1150 (quoting <em>Burdine, supra, </em>450 <em>U.S. </em>at 258, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1096, 67 L.Ed.2d at 218). These reasons \u201cneed not rise to the level justifying challenges for cause.\u201d <em>Gilmore, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 538, 511 A.2d 1150. The trial court must judge the prima facie case against the rebuttal \u201cto determine whether the [proponent] has carried the ultimate burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence,\u201d that the challenge was exercised on \u201cconstitutionally-impermissible grounds of presumed group bias.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 539, 511 A.2d 1150.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">The burden-shifting test is intended to secure the \u201cright to trial by an impartial jury drawn from [a] representative cross-section of the community.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 543, 511 A.2d 1150. In short, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>the \u201cgoal of peremptory challenges is to secure an impartial jury.\u201d <em>State v. DiFrisco, </em>137 <em>N.J. </em>434, 468, 645 A.2d 734 (1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>516 <em>U.S. </em>1129, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>949, 133 L.Ed.2d 873 (1996). A constitutionally-impermissible challenge, therefore, \u201cmay not be treated as harmless error.\u201d <em>Gilmore, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 544, 511 A.2d 1150. Although <em>Gilmore </em>was a criminal case, its core principles are equally applicable to civil actions. <em>Russell v. Rutgers Gmty. Health Plan, </em>280 <em>N.J.Super. </em>445, 453, 655 A.2d 948 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>452, 663 A.2d 1359 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">We have no doubt that a trial judge has the authority to raise the issue of racial bias in the exercise of peremptory challenges sua sponte. Indeed, we agree with the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that it is the \u201ccourt\u2019s <em>duty </em>to ensure the ends of justice and to guarantee that every litigant, including a litigant of a protected class, has a fair trial by an impartial jury that is a representative cross-section of the community.\u201d (Emphasis added). Our concern is with the question of <em>when </em>the trial court\u2019s duty to raise the issue sua sponte is triggered.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Since this issue has not been addressed in New Jersey, we look to other states that have considered it. The Washington Court of Appeals was presented with the question of whether a trial judge may raise a <em>Batson </em>issue sua sponte and whether the trial judge improperly raised the issue before a prima facie case of invidious discrimination was shown. <em>State v. Evans, </em>100 <em>Wash. App. </em>757, 998 P.2d 373, 375-76 (2000). There, a criminal defense attorney excused a minority juror in his exercise of one peremptory challenge. The court sua sponte required counsel to provide an explanation for the challenge \u2014 an explanation the judge ultimately rejected. <em>Id. </em>at 376. The Court of Appeals held that \u201ca trial court, in the sound exercise of its discretion, may raise a <em>Batson </em>issue sua sponte.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 380. It found, however, that the trial judge erred by requiring a race-neutral explanation for the exercise of a single peremptory challenge. <em>Ibid. </em>The Washington court was reluctant \u201cto view the exercise of a peremptory challenge against a person of color, without more, as sufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>establish a prima facie case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 381. The problem with equating a mere challenge to a single person of color with a prima facie case is that to do so improperly eliminates the first prong of the <em>Batson </em>test.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 380-82. A sua sponte <em>Batson </em>hearing absent a prima facie ease represents an erroneous directive by the trial judge. <em>Id. </em>at 381. The Washington court held that \u201c \u2018[i]ntervention sua sponte is only authorized when a prima facie case is abundantly clear with respect to a particular juror.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 382 (quoting <em>Williams v. State, </em>669 <em>N.E.2d </em>1372, 1382 (Ind.1996), <em>cert. denied, </em>520 <em>U.S. </em>1232, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>1828, 137 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>1034 (1997)). The court declined to apply a harmless error standard when the juror was excused without evidence that the peremptory challenge was exercised on constitutionally-impermissible grounds, and determined that it was \u201creversible error without a showing of prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 383.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">The Michigan Supreme Court addressed a similar issue in <em>People v. Bell, </em>473 <em>Mich. </em>275, 702 <em>N.W.2d </em>128,134 (2005). There, in the murder trial of an African-American defendant, defense counsel attempted to excuse a third consecutive white juror and the trial court, sua sponte, raised the <em>Batson </em>issue. <em>Id. </em>at 1.31. After hearing defense counsel\u2019s race-conscious justification, the trial court disallowed the challenge and reseated the juror. In reviewing the matter, the Michigan Court held that the trial judge did not err in disallowing the race-conscious peremptory challenge. <em>Id. </em>at 130. The prima facie case was self-evident because the trial court \u201cspecifically stated that it was disallowing the challenges because [opposing] counsel, for the better part of the day, had only excused Caucasian male jurors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 135. In doing so, however, the Court made clear that a \u201ctrial court may [only] make an inquiry sua sponte <em>after </em>observing a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination through the use of peremptory challenges.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 134 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>In Indiana, the Supreme Court addressed a trial court\u2019s imposition of \u201ca requirement that, in order, to exercise a peremptory challenge, the party attempting that challenge must give to the court a race, ethnic, religious, sex-neutral reason for the challenge.\u201d <em>Williams, supra, </em>669 N.E.2d at 1376. There, the Court found no reversible error but provided the following guidance for future cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-5\">[A]bsent extraordinary circumstances a trial court should <em>not </em>require each side to present a race-neutral justification for each of its peremptory challenges. Trial courts should wait for an objection by an opposing party before deciding whether a prima facie case of discrimination is made and demanding a race-neutral explanation. <em>Intervention sua, sponte is only authorized when a prima facie case is abundantly clear with respect to a particular juror. </em>Obviously, a judge who adopts a blanket policy of demanding explanations, as the court did here, would not have articulated a particularized showing and would commit error.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 1382 (emphasis added)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">The Pennsylvania Supreme Court considered the case of an African-American criminal defendant seeking a new trial because the trial judge sua sponte raised a <em>Batson </em>issue and denied a peremptory challenge to excuse a white juror. <em>Commonwealth v. Carson, </em>559 <em>Pa. </em>460, 741 A.2d 686, 693 (1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>530 <em>U.S. </em>1216, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>2220, 147 L.Ed.2d 252 (2000). There, the trial court seated the juror because [opposing] counsel justified his exercise of the peremptory challenge by stating, \u201cthere was something about the juror\u2019s face that made him feel she was untrustworthy.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Pennsylvania Court held that the \u201ctrial court is duty bound to make a sua sponte inquiry <em>after </em>observing a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination by way of peremptory challenges.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 695. (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">Against this legal framework, defendants argue that while a trial court may, sua sponte, initiate a <em>Batson/Gilmore </em>inquiry, it may do so only <em>after </em>identifying a prima facie showing of discrimination. We agree. Trial courts \u201cmust be cautious not to discourage the [attorneys] from using peremptory challenges in all proper instances to further, though not to undermine, the right to trial by an impartial jury.\u201d <em>Gilmore supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 533, 511 A.2d 1150. Requiring the trial court to identify a prima facie case of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>discrimination before initiating a <em>Batson/Gilmore </em>inquiry will avoid a chilling effect on counsel\u2019s further exercise of peremptory challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Here, with three African-American women in the jury pool, the trial judge sua sponte questioned defendants\u2019 exercise of a single peremptory challenge against juror number seven, an African-American woman. In our view, there was no prima facie evidence of discriminatory intent when defense counsel exercised his challenge to excuse juror number seven. Once the judge initiated the inquiry, however, defense counsel provided a nondiscriminatory reason for excusing the juror and the judge sustained the challenge. Consequently, the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">If the judge had seated the juror, however, the unprovoked sua sponte inquiry would have resulted in reversible error. <em>Gilmore, supra, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>at 544, 511 A.2d 1150. In order to avoid reversible error in the future, trial judges are advised to avoid a <em>Batson/Gilmore </em>inquiry without some evidence of discriminatory intent in the exercise of a peremptory challenge. Here, defense counsel had only exercised one previous challenge, excusing a white male juror. Juror number seven was the first minority juror defense counsel sought to excuse. We see nothing in the record to justify a <em>Batson/Gilmore </em>inquiry under the circumstances presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">Defendants next argue that the trial judge improperly injected racial issues into defendants\u2019 cross-examination of their expert, depriving them of a fair trial. After voir dire and qualification of Dr. Douglas Chalmers, defendants\u2019 expert in orthopedic surgery, defense counsel asked him about his examination of plaintiff. Chalmers responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-10\">A. Well, the history was that of a thirty-seven-year-old Jamaican woman. She was seen incidentally in the company of two individuals who had been involved in the same motor vehicle accident, which took place or occurred on August 20th, 1999.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>The doctor went on to explain what plaintiff reported to him and his use of the various diagnostic tools, including X-rays and MRIs. At the conclusion of Chalmers\u2019 direct testimony, the judge called counsel into chambers and the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-5\">THE COURT: All right. Counsel, I called you into chambers a few minutes ago, and I advised you of the fact that in his direct examination at the very beginning after he was qualified as an orthopedic surgeon by the court, in response to really the first question \u2014 by the defense or on direct, he said within a reasonable degree of medical probability, he talks about the fact that he did this IME on March 21st, 2003, and that he observed a thirty-seven-year old Jamaican woman who had been involved in a motor vehicle accident, which she was struck from behind, her car was struck from behind, etc., etc., etc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-6\">What struck me with respect to that testimony is the fact that he used the term, \u201cthirty-seven-year-old Jamaican woman.\u201d No basis for the conclusion that she\u2019s Jamaican, number one. Number two, I need to know and I wanted to have the record clear as to why it is that the fact that this lady is of Jamaican extraction is relevant and material to any issue before this jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-7\">So I have advised both attorneys of my concern with regards to that, and they may question the doctor about it. If they don\u2019t, I have advised them that I think I have an obligation as the judge to make sure that any inferences that may be drawn from the fact that she\u2019s Jamaican either for her or against her would not be proper, would be based on a race factor and absolutely would be a miscarriage of justice. And, therefore, I intend to question the doctor as to the relevancy of that statement, that observation in this matter, and of course, his ultimate conclusions as to the fact that she was not injured in this accident that occurred back in 1999. Do you wish to be heard? [plaintiffs counsel], I\u2019ll allow you first.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-8\">[PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: Judge, no, only to say that I didn\u2019t think it was necessary for him to characterize her as \u2014 or say that she was Jamaican. I don\u2019t know how he knew she was Jamaican, and I can tell you that my client, Ms. Hitchman, did express to me grave concern about the fact that Dr. Chalmers did say that she was a thirty-seven-year-old Jamaican woman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-9\">One of the things that my client said to me was that I\u2019m a hardworking person, I\u2019ve worked all my life, and I\u2019ve completed college\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-10\">THE COURT: It has nothing to do with whether she\u2019s a hardworking person or not. It\u2019s just I don\u2019t know the relevancy of bring somebody\u2019s race into the cases\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Anq\">[PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: Right, judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-11\">THE COURT: \u2014 into the testimony. I mean, it bothers me, and I think it has to be clarified before the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-12\">[PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: I\u2019m concerned it may unfairly paint her as I don\u2019t know, whatever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-13\">THE COURT: [Counsel]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-14\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, as a preliminary matter, I note that I forgot to mark the report, and I think in view of this issue, it\u2019s important that I do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>that. He mentioned her as a Jamaican woman. In fact, his report says, the first sentence, \u201cthis thirty-seven-year-old Jamaican woman was seen in the company of two additional individuals.\u201d No\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\">THE COURT: Who were also \u2014 who were also in the accident, by the way. I didn\u2019t miss that part. I got it in my notes, and I thought it was a little prejudicial, but I \u2014 you know, there was no objection. So I \u2014 and that I \u2014 that doesn\u2019t bother me, that two other people were there and they were also injured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And, of course, there\u2019s no objection by counsel to the word \u201cJamaican\u201d in the report. It\u2019s like a fifth word in the report. Nobody made any issue out of it before. The report also says that she was driving a Toyota which does not appear by any proofs in this case to be significant. It says that the accident happened in Somerset which, of course, it doesn\u2019t matter if it happened in Somerset or anywhere else.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-8\">All of these things are mere background; they\u2019re not issues in the case. The fact that she\u2019s Jamaican is not an issue in the ease, and it\u2019s of no moment, and to underline this and signify it to the jury is in my view creating an issue where none exists, and I believe it\u2019s improper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-9\">THE COURT: So you do agree with me that there is no relevance and materiality to the fact that this lady is a Jamaican woman?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I agree with that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-11\">THE COURT: I might be able to just charge this jury that they\u2019re to disregard that testimony by the doctor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I would also like to point out\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-13\">THE COURT: \u2014 because it\u2019s not relevant and material to any issue before them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWN\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: The \u2014 and the other thing I\u2019d like to point out, judge\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AzT\">THE COURT: Now I could either question him or I could just say, ladies and gentlemen, this doctor said that this lady was a Jamaican woman. He didn\u2019t give us any basis for that conclusion, and even if she is Jamaican, it\u2019s of no consequence. You\u2019re not to consider it in any way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-14\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Judge, if you look at the diagnostic report which has been referred to although not word for word, the first sentence is that she\u2019s a thirty-four-year-old [sic] right-handed Afro\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-15\">THE COURT: Doesn\u2019t matter\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-16\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:-African-American female.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-17\">THE COURT: \u2014 I don\u2019t care ... I don\u2019t care what\u2019s in the reports. I care what goes before the jury because the jury is the one who has to make the decision, and I think what racial profiling being what it is in this state and being what it has been in the [past], I think we have to be very, very careful and we have \u2014 this is a court of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-18\">I have an obligation to make sure that this matter is decided based on the facts and only on the facts and not on any type of racial consideration, and I will not allow anyone, Dr. Chalmers or an attorney or anyone else to use race in any way during a trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOr\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Now, yesterday, if you remember, we had a little bit of a \u2014 of a problem when you excused an African-American female because she was a teacher. The juror that replaced her is an African-American female that\u2019s also a teacher. She was not excused.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-5\">I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on here. I just want the record to be clear, and I want to tell you I will not \u2014 as the judge, I believe I have an obligation and a duty and a responsibility to make sure that this lady who is here seeking justice has her case decided based on the facts and nothing but the facts and that no race gets involved in any way that no improper evidence is used by the jurors or by anybody else to decide this matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\">End of story. That\u2019s all there is. I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s relevant. Maybe he has a reason why it\u2019s relevant, and I\u2019ll ask him for it. I\u2019ll ask the doctor what\u2019s the relevance of her being Jamaican. Is she different than an Italian-American, a Russian-American, a Norwegian-American other than the color of her skin. All right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">The judge then returned to the courtroom, brought in the jury and proceeded with cross-examination. Plaintiffs counsel never raised the question of why Chalmers referred to plaintiff as a Jamaican woman; nor, did defense counsel request redirect examination of Chalmers to ask the question raised by the judge. After cross-examination, the judge questioned the doctor himself:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Agu\">THE COURT: Doctor, I have two questions and one can clarify [sic]. You say that there were long standing degenerative changes. That was your opinion, degenerative changes, long standing degenerative changes you said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-8\">THE WITNESS: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-9\">THE COURT: When you say that, what part of the spine were you talking about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqt\">THE WITNESS: Cervical, the neck.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-10\">THE COURT: Only the cervical?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-11\">THE WITNESS: Yes. Only the neck.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-12\">THE COURT: In this case, the degenerative changes, long standing degenerative changes were only for the cervical spine and not for the other and not for the lumbosacral or thoracic or anything else, and \u2014 okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-13\">Now the other question I have, you stated in your findings with the IME several things, and one of the things you stated was that this was a thirty-seven-year-old Jamaican woman. How did you come to the conclusion that she\u2019s Jamaican?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A16\">THE WITNESS: I asked her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-14\">THE COURT: Okay. And what relevance does that have on your findings as a doctor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-15\">THE WITNESS: None in this case. We were taught in medical school basically to learn the origin or individuals who we evaluated and treated because, more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>medically than orthopedieally, there are certain areas where certain disease entities may be indigenous for example. It may affect that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-6\">In this situation, I was semi-chastised a number of years ago, when I was doing an IME and someone said, you know, basically said I didn\u2019t even know where the person was born, and so for that reason, I\u2019ve made a habit \u2014 well with private patients I\u2019ve always done it but to make it a habit not only to ask but to put it in. I\u2019ve been\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-7\">THE COURT: But, in this particular ease, it\u2019s of no relevance to the issues before the jury\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-8\">THE WITNESS: Zero.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-9\">THE COURT: The jury doesn\u2019t have to consider that at all and should disregard it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-10\">THE WITNESS: It\u2019s absolutely without any significance in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-11\">THE COURT: Thank you very much.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-12\">Defendants now argue that the judge unfairly characterized Chalmers\u2019 testimony in front of the jury to defendants\u2019 detriment.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-13\">Clearly, a trial judge may intervene in the interest of assuring a fair trial. \u201cOur courts have long rejected the \u2018arbitrary and artificial methods of the pure adversary system of litigation which regards the lawyers as players and the judge as a mere umpire whose only duty is to determine whether infractions of the rules of the game have been committed.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Medina, </em>349 <em>N.J.Super. </em>108, 130, 793 A.2d 68 (App.Div.) (quoting <em>State v. Riley, </em>28 <em>N.J. </em>188, 200, 145 A.2d 601 (1958), <em>cert. denied, </em>359 <em>U.S. </em>313, 79 <em>S.Ct. </em>891, 3 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>832 (1959)), <em>certif. denied, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>193, 803 A.2d 1165 (2002). The \u201cintervention of a trial judge in the questioning of a witness is both a power and a duty, and forms part of the judiciary\u2019s general obligation to ensure a fair trial \u2018conducted in [an] orderly and expeditious manner.\u2019 \u201d <em>Medina, supra, </em>349 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 130-31, 793 A.2d 68 (quoting <em>State v. Laws, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>159,181, 233 A.2d 633 (1967), cert. <em>denied, </em>393 <em>U.S. </em>971, 89 <em>S.Ct. </em>408, 21 L.Ed.2d 384 (1968)). A trial judge must nevertheless be cautious not to compromise his or her impartiality by taking over the proceedings and creating prejudicial error. <em>Medina, supra, </em>349 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 131, 793 A.2d 68. An isolated instance of \u201cjudicial annoyance,\u201d however, does \u201cnot warrant the drastic remedy of vitiating an otherwise valid [judgment].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 132, 793 A.2d 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>Our standard in reviewing a claim of prejudicial intervention by a trial judge is whether \u201c \u2018it appears [the] trial judge has turned the jury against the defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mercer v. Weyerhaeuser, </em>324 <em>N.J.Super. </em>290, 298, 735 A.2d 576 (App.Div.1999) (quoting <em>State v. Zwillman, </em>112 <em>N.J.Super. </em>6, 21, 270 A.2d 284 (App.Div.1970), <em>certif. denied, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>603, 274 A.2d 56 (1971)). Our scope of review includes considerations of the entire transcript to determine whether \u201cthe conduct of the trial judge toward defense counsel \u2018tended strongly to prejudice the defendant in the eyes of the jury.\u2019\u201d <em>Mercer, supra, </em>324 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 299, 735 A.2d 576 (quoting <em>Zwillman, supra, </em>112 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 22, 270 A.2d 284). Even if \u201cno single instance may have been sufficient to warrant a reversal,\u201d we must determine whether, in the aggregate, \u201cthe actions of the trial judge deprived the defendant of a fair trial.\u201d <em>Mercer, supra, </em>324 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 299, 735 A.2d 576. We have admonished trial judges to \u201cnever unfairly criticize or humiliate defense counsel or a defense witness.\u201d <em>Zwillman, supra, </em>112 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 21, 270 A.2d 284. Moreover, we will not find harmless error simply \u201cbecause we may believe that the defendant was guilty as charged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20, 270 A.2d 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Here, the trial judge appears to have overreacted to Chalmers\u2019 statement that plaintiff was a \u201cthirty-seven-year-old Jamaican woman.\u201d It is common knowledge that certain diseases and conditions affect individuals of a particular race or ethnic background. Once the judge expressed his concern to counsel, however, defense counsel had the opportunity to diffuse the issue simply by requesting redirect examination and asking Chalmers whether the fact that plaintiff was a \u201cJamaican woman\u201d had any impact on his diagnosis. Defense counsel chose not to so. When the trial judge questioned Chalmers, however, he softened the inquiry by initially asking which part of the spine Chalmers was referring to when he stated that there were long-standing degenerative changes. When the judge asked Chalmers whether plaintiffs Jamaican ancestry had any relevance to his findings, the doctor answered clearly and unequivocally, \u201cNone in this case,\u201d and went on to explain the reason for his inclusion of a person\u2019s ancestry in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>his diagnoses. Nevertheless, the judge persisted in asking two more questions as to whether plaintiffs ancestry had any relevance to the issues before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">In our view, the judge\u2019s inquiry was over-reaching. The judge could have easily directed defense counsel simply to ask the witness whether plaintiffs Jamaican ancestry had any impact on the medical findings or was in any way relevant to the jury\u2019s determination. The judge did not do so, nor did defense counsel pick up on the judge\u2019s concerns and pursue the inquiry himself. In our review of the entire transcript, however, we find the judge\u2019s questioning of Chalmers to be harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">Trial judges clearly have a duty to assure that both parties obtain a fair trial. When either party is a member of a protected class, the judge must be particularly alert to ensure a fair trial. Judges must not be trigger-happy, however, and respond instantly to every racial or ethnic reference in a trial. The judge must take such references in the context of the situation and weigh them carefully before intervening, lest he or she gives the impression of siding with one party or the other. <em>Weyerhaeuser, supra, </em>324 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 298, 735 A.2d 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">We have carefully considered the entire record in this matter, and we are satisfied that defendants were not prejudiced by the judge\u2019s sua sponte <em>Batson!Gilmore </em>inquiry, intervention in the cross-examination of defendants\u2019 expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b475-7\"> The first prong of the <em>Batson </em>test places the burden on the party who alleges discrimination to prove the existence of purposeful discrimination. <em>Batson, supra, </em>476 <em>U.S. </em>at 93, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1721, 90 L.Ed.2d at 85.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
