We reverse. We hold that an employer who is on notice that one of its employees is using a workplace computer to access pornography, possibly child pornography, has a duty to investigate the employee\u2019s activities and to take prompt and effective action to stop the unauthorized activity, lest it result in harm to innocent third-parties. No privacy interest of the employee stands in the way of this duty on the part of the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">The case having been dismissed on summary judgment, we set out the facts, as well as the inferences from the facts, in the light most favorable to plaintiff.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 540, 666 A.2d 146 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">A. EMPLOYEE\u2019S WORKPLACE HISTORY.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">Defendant employed approximately 250 employees at its headquarters in Somerset County, where Employee was an accountant. His workspace consisted of a small cubicle located along a wall which also contained the cubicle of another accountant, as well as corner offices of defendant\u2019s Director of Finance and its Controller, Pamela Martin. The cubicles had no doors and opened into a hallway.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">Sometime in 1998 or 1999, Corey Shelton, defendant\u2019s former Internet Services Manager, informed George Griesler, defendant\u2019s Senior Network Administrator, that he had noted, on reviewing computer log reports, that Employee had been visiting pornographic sites. Griesler and Shelton told Employee to stop the activity but did not inform any of their supervisors. In early 2000, Employee\u2019s immediate supervisor, Keith Russinoff, also told Griesler that Employee was visiting inappropriate websites. Russinoff asked Griesler if he could track Employee\u2019s Internet usage and Griesler conducted a limited investigation by reviewing computer logs for a day or two and isolating those visited by Employee. Although Griesler had the ability to open those websites, he did not do so, nor did he print out a list of the sites in question. Based on the website titles, Griesler recognized the sites as pornographic, although he only recalled the name of one site, \u201cSextracker,\u201d that Employee had visited several times. Griesler advised Russinoff and Jessica Carroll, defendant\u2019s Director of Network and PC Services, about the results of his investigation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>but was shortly thereafter admonished by Carroll not to access any employee\u2019s logs, including that of Employee, ever again.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Carroll recalled being told by Griesler that Employee\u2019s server logs revealed that he was visiting pornographic sites on his office computer, including \u201cbestiality\u201d and \u201cnecrophilia\u201d sites. Carroll did not report the matter further or discuss it with Employee, because of a company policy communicated by e-mail to certain management personnel from Kevin O\u2019Connor, Senior Director of Business Information Systems, that prohibited monitoring of or reporting the Internet activities of employees. Violation of the policy could result in a penalty ranging from reprimand to termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Around December 2000, another accounting department employee, Mary Ann Carlson, told her manager, Jill Ray, that Employee was acting strangely by shielding his computer screen and quickly minimizing it so that others could not see what he was doing. Carlson saw Employee act in this manner two or three times a day, and discussed his behavior with Ray, who had also seen it at least five times. They surmised that Employee was viewing pornography. Ray eventually discussed the matter with the Manager of Financial Reporting, Suzanne Colon, advising her that she and Carlson were uncomfortable with Employee\u2019s conduct. Nevertheless, no action resulted from their complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">In February 2001, Carroll herself looked at the sites Employee had been visiting and concluded that they were pornographic. She did not open the sites and did not discuss her findings with anyone or take any action.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">In late March 2001, Carlson discussed Employee\u2019s computer activities with Russinoff, telling him that while walking past Employee\u2019s cubicle she had seen a picture of a woman in a bikini with \u201cvery large breasts\u201d in a \u201csultry pose\u201d on Employee\u2019s computer screen. Russinoff acknowledged to Carlson that he had also seen Employee blocking his computer screen. That same month, Russinoff went into Employee\u2019s cubicle during lunch when Employee was out, and clicked on the \u201cwebsites visited\u201d on Employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>ee\u2019s computer. Russinoff discovered that Employee had visited \u201cvarious porn sites\u201d and printed out what was displayed on the screen. The printout identified obvious porn sites (\u201cBig Fat Monkey Blowjobs,\u201d \u201cYahoo Groups \u2014 Panties R Us Messages\u201d and \u201cSleazy Dream Main Page\u201d) as well as one that specifically spoke about children: \u201cTeenflirts.org: The Original Non Nude Teen Index.\u201d Russinoff, however, did not scroll down the \u201cwebsites visited\u201d to see what other sites Employee had visited. Russinoff was not sure what the various \u201cYahoo Groups\u201d sites were and did not open any of the sites to further investigate their contents. Russinoff showed the printout to his boss, Colon, who showed signs of disgust. Later that day, Russinoff met with Colon and her boss, Pamela Martin, \u201cto discuss what to do.\u201d They decided that Russinoff should talk to Employee. Russinoff met with Employee on March 6, 2001 and told him that there had been reports of inappropriate computer usage. He told Employee to stop these activities and Employee said he would. Russinoff confirmed his conversation with Employee in an e-mail to Colon and Martin on March 7, 2001. Employee appeared to stop his activities, but in early June 2001, Russinoff saw that he had started again. Nevertheless, he told no one and left on a business trip, not returning until after Employee\u2019s arrest on child pornography charges on June 21,2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">B. EMPLOYEE\u2019S CONDUCT WITH JILL.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Employee and plaintiff were married in October 2000. For about five months prior to his arrest, Employee had been secretly videotaping and photographing Jill at their home in nude and semi-nude positions. Jill was ten years old at the time. Jill had been at defendant\u2019s headquarters for Take Your Daughter To Work Day and had attended company outings. As a result, supervisory personnel were aware that defendant had married a woman with a young child.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">On June 15, 2001, Employee transmitted three of the clandestinely-taken photos of Jill Doe over the Internet from his work<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>place computer to a child porn site in order to gain access to the site. Employee later acknowledged that he stored child pornography, including nude photos of Jill Doe, in his workplace computer. He admitted to downloading over 1000 pornographic images while working for defendant. Employee was arrested on June 21, 2001 following a June 19, 2001 search of his work space and work computer based on a search warrant. At that time, his computer showed e-mails being sent to pornographic websites and interactions with others regarding child pornography. Indeed, photographs of Jill found in a dumpster at defendant\u2019s headquarters apparently led to his arrest. According to Martin, her search of Employee\u2019s desk on June 20 as part of defendant\u2019s exit policy<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> turned up a folder with seventy downloaded pornographic photos, including ones of young females. In addition, the Prosecutor\u2019s Office, in searching Employee\u2019s computer, found numerous child pornography images. Specifically, Detective DeBella searched Employee\u2019s workplace computer as it was on the day of Employee\u2019s arrest and found that Employee had indeed been visiting \u201cIncest Taboo\u201d and \u201cYoung Girls Nude 18 to 17 years old.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">C. DEFENDANT\u2019S MONITORING CAPABILITIES.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Defendant possessed and could have implemented software that would have permitted it to monitor employees\u2019 activities on the Internet. Specifically, defendant\u2019s Director of Network Services testified that defendant tried Web Trends, the most common such software, which would allow it to monitor where anybody goes on the Internet, and for how long they visit a particular site. Moreover, Griesler, then defendant\u2019s Network Administrator, described how readily defendant could have discovered the child pornography sites Employee visited everyday on his work computer. Griesler testified that defendant\u2019s network maintained log files by date. Each daily file identified all websites accessed on each particular day. By entering a code, Griesler could have isolated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>all of Employee\u2019s websites visited for any given day for months and could have opened them. Of course, another way to have monitored websites Employee visited, at least recently, would have been to simply open his computer and click on \u201cwebsites visited,\u201d which is what Russinoff did in March 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Defendant recognized its right to monitor employee website activity and e-mails by promulgating and distributing a policy to that effect during the relevant time period. Specifically, the policy made clear that e-mails were the property of defendant and were not confidential. According to that policy, anyone who became aware of the misuse of the Internet for other than business reasons was to report it to Personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">Plaintiffs complaint, filed February 6, 2004, was in two counts. The first count alleged, in part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-9\">15. XYC Corp- knew or should have known that Employee was using its computer and internet at his workstation to view and download child pornography and to interact with child pornography web sites.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-10\">16. Given the nature of the offense, XYC Corp. had a duty to report Employee to the proper authorities for the crimes committed on its property during the course of the work day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-11\">17. XYC Corp. negligently, carelessly, with reckless indifference and or intentionally breached its aforesaid duty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-12\">18. As a direct and proximate cause of XYC Corp.\u2019s breach of duty, Employee was able to continue clandestinely photographing and molesting Jill Doe resulting in Jill Doe suffering severe and permanent harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-13\">In the second count, Jane sought damages for money she had expended for Jill\u2019s care and treatment as a proximate result of defendant\u2019s breach of duty, as alleged in count one.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-14\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b161-15\">In granting summary judgment, the motion judge, in a detailed oral opinion covering thirty pages of transcript, correctly focused on the critical issue as being \u201cwhether or not the employer had a duty, as argued by the plaintiffs, to do more than it did with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>respect to this defendant employee and whether there was a standard of conduct to which the duty required this corporate defendant to conform,\u201d citing <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 328B (1965). The judge went on to note <em>Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 314 (\u201cThe fact that the actor realizes or should realize that action on his part is necessary for another\u2019s aid or protection does not of itself impose upon him a duty to take such action\u201d) and \u00a7 317, which we consider most relevant to the issues under review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-5\">A master is under a duty to exercise reasonable care so to control his servant while acting outside the scope of his employment as to prevent him from intentionally harming others or from so conducting himself as to create an unreasonable risk of bodily harm to them, if</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-6\">(a) the servant</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-7\">(i) is upon the premises in possession of the master or upon which the servant is privileged to enter only as his servant, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-8\">(ii) is using a chattel of the master, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-9\">(b) the master</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-10\">(i) knows or has reason to know that he has the ability to control his servant, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-11\">(ii) knows or should know of the necessity and opportunity for exercising such control.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-12\">The judge concluded that Employee\u2019s \u201cconduct at home\u201d was not under defendant\u2019s control, specifically referencing \u201cthe molestation of [Jill].\u201d He continued, again referring to \u00a7 317, finding that it did \u201cnot appear that [Employee\u2019s] conduct at work was dangerous to others and [defendant] did not have direct knowledge or indirect knowledge of this misconduct until a report was made by [his] co-employees.\u201d Restating the issue as \u201cwhether [defendant] used reasonable care,\u201d the judge determined that defendant,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-13\">acted as a reasonably prudent corporation. The corporation exercised the foresight, prudence and control that a reasonably prudent company would have under the similar circumstances. Upon receipt of complaints from [its] employees, defendant instructed the [Employee] to stop [his] conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-14\">Because there is no evidence that they were aware that the employee was viewing child pornography, and under <em>Blakey [v. Cont\u2019l Airlines, Inc., </em>164 <em>N.J. </em>38, 751 A.2d 538 (2000)] there is [no] duty to monitor private communications of [its] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>employees, this court finds that there has been no breach of a duty and no negligence on the part of the defendant corporation as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Further, the judge found that defendant had no duty to investigate the private communications of its employees. Finally, he found an absence of proximate cause, in that using ordinary care defendant could not have foreseen the ultimate harm, \u201cthat result being molestation of the child at home---- Terminating the employee would not have resulted ... in protecting the [minor] plaintiff.\u201d He continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-9\">The harm to the plaintiff did not occur at the defendant\u2019s premises. It did not involve a chattel belonging to the defendant. The harm caused by the employee was inflicted at the plaintiffs home outside of the defendant\u2019s control during nonworking hours by the errant employee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-10\">The duty to monitor employee\u2019s internet activities does not exist. In this case the defendant reprimanded the plaintiff and pursuant to its own company policy could have fired the employee for using the internet for nonbusiness related proposes. That action in the employer\u2019s view would have been the most drastic penalty it could have imposed. The company saw fit not to terminate but rather to reprimand. Termination of the employee, the most drastic measure under the existing policy, would not have protected the plaintiff from the injury alleged in the plaintiffs complaint: the clandestine photographing and molestation of the plaintiff at her residence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-11\">There is no way that this Court can conclude that this corporate defendant in any way could have controlled and/or in any way protected the plaintiff from that injury. Jane Doe married the employee on October 28, 2000. He was arrested June 21, 2001. On June 15th, 2001, he transmitted three photos that he had clandestinely taken of the minor stepchild on the internet on his workplace computer to a child porn site to gain access to the site. In March of 2001 the employee was advised to stop viewing inappropriate sites at work. It is unclear of the exact date that the employer \u2014 the employee began viewing pornography at work, although it appears to have been sometime in 2000. Even if this Court were to conclude that the defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate in any fashion in light of the dates presented, in light of the clandestine photography taking place in the employee\u2019s home, how any failure to take action by the company could demonstrate that that breach caused the injuries to plaintiffs\u2019 suffer. This Court finds that the employer has not breached a duty, was not negligent, did not act in an unforeseeable fashion and did not actually or proximately in any way, cause the injuries to which the plaintiffs complain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-12\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b163-13\">On appeal plaintiff argues that defendant had \u201cthe right and <em>the </em>ability to monitor Employee\u2019s Internet, knew or should have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>known of his interaction with child porn sites, had a duty to report him to the authorities and its failure to do so renders it liable to plaintiffs.\u201d We agree in large part with plaintiff\u2019s arguments but not with the final leap to defendant\u2019s liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">At the outset, we note our consternation over a significant procedural defect in plaintiffs case. Plaintiff takes the motion judge to task for having \u201cmistakenly focused on the conduct of Employee at home in taking the nude photos, over which the Court concluded [defendant] had no duty to control. The focus, however, should have been on Employee\u2019s use of [defendant\u2019s] chattel, i.e., its computer network, to transmit [Jill\u2019s] photos on the Internet, over which it did have control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">It is true that the motion judge did focus on the Employee\u2019s conduct at home in taking the photographs of Ms stepdaughter. However, the reason for that focus, now claimed to be mistaken, rests at plaintiffs own doorstep. While the complaint did allege that defendant breached \u201ca duty to report Employee to the proper authorities for the crimes committed on its property during the course of the work day,\u201d it continued by alleging that the proximate cause of defendant\u2019s breach of duty was that Employee \u201cwas able to continue clandestinely photographing and molesting Jill Doe....\u201d Thus, the judge\u2019s focus was precisely that of plaintiff herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">When the summary judgment motion was argued plaintiffs counsel asserted that \u201cpart of\u2019 his damage claim was for the transmission of Jill\u2019s photos over the Internet. As we have seen, that was clearly not the case. Defense counsel, however, did not challenge that assertion but simply argued the absence of proximate cause between any breach of duty on the part of defendant and Employee\u2019s conduct at home. On appeal defendant still does not contend that plaintiffs present theory, the Internet transmission of the photos, constitutes a marked deviation from the complaint. Defendant argues only that plaintiff has waived any argument that defendant is liable for Employee\u2019s conduct in photographing and molesting Jill at home, by virtue of having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>failed to advance that claim in her appellate brief. In her reply brief plaintiff does argue that a \u201cfactual issue existed as to whether it was foreseeable, given Employee\u2019s conduct, that he would attempt to obtain photos of his stepdaughter, or other children, to transmit on the internet.\u201d Despite this ambiguous assertion, we conclude that plaintiff has limited her claim to Employee\u2019s conduct in transmitting the photos, the only conduct which took place at work.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Since defendant has not argued, before the motion judge or on appeal, that plaintiffs claim based on that workplace activity was not pled in the complaint, and since the issues raised are of considerable importance, we will address the merits. Nevertheless, as we have noted, plaintiffs criticism of the motion judge for analyzing the case based on the allegations in her complaint, is manifestly unfair and unfounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">In analyzing plaintiffs claim, the following issues must be addressed: (1) whether defendant had the ability to monitor Employee\u2019s use of the Internet on his office computer; (2) assuming defendant had the ability to do so, whether it had the right to monitor Employee\u2019s activities; (3) whether defendant knew, or should have known, that Employee was using the office computer to access child pornography; (4) whether defendant had a duty to act to prevent Employee from continuing his activities; and (5) whether any failure to act on the part of defendant proximately caused harm to Jill. We discuss each question in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">A. DEFENDANT\u2019S ABILITY TO MONITOR EMPLOYEE\u2019S INTERNET ACCESS ON HIS WORK COMPUTER.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">The first question is readily answered in the affirmative. In response to an interrogatory asking whether it had the \u201ccapability ... to monitor and/or track employee use of the internet and/or emails at work on their work computer,\u201d defendant responded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>it \u201ccould have implemented software that would have permitted it to monitor employees\u2019 activity on the Internet.\u201d Indeed, as the facts recited earlier reveal, on at least two occasions defendant conducted a limited investigation of Employee\u2019s computer use, thereby demonstrating its capability to do so. Griesler, defendant\u2019s Network Administrator, testified that he was able to use the network\u2019s daily log system to isolate and identify pornographic websites visited by Employee. However, he did not open any specific sites and, after reporting his findings to his supervisor, was instructed not to investigate Employee\u2019s Internet usage again. Further, Russinoff, Employee\u2019s immediate supervisor, opened Employee\u2019s computer while he was at lunch and clicked on \u201cwebsites visited.\u201d Here again, none of the sites identified were actually explored and no further action was taken to determine the nature of Employee\u2019s pornographic related computer activities. Instead, Russinoff was simply instructed to tell Employee to stop whatever he was doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Thus, defendant\u2019s capability to monitor Employee\u2019s activities on his work computer was clearly established.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">B. DEFENDANT\u2019S RIGHT TO MONITOR EMPLOYEE\u2019S ACTIVITIES ON HIS OFFICE COMPUTER.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">Defendant argued, and the motion judge agreed, that Employee\u2019s privacy interest trumped defendant\u2019s right to monitor his computer use at work. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">We begin by addressing whether, as defendant claims, <em>Blakey v. Cont'l Airlines, Inc., </em>164 <em>N.J. </em>38, 751 A.2d 538 (2000), is dis-positive of this issue. That case involved a sexual discrimination/hostile work environment claim by Blakey, a female pilot for Continental. In part, Blakey contended that \u201ca number of Continental\u2019s male pilots posted derogatory and insulting remarks about Blakey on the pilots\u2019 on-line computer bulletin board called The Crew Members Forum (Forum). The Forum is accessible to all Continental pilots and new members through the Internet Provider, CompuServe.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 48, 751 A.2d 538. In remanding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>the case, the Court instructed the trial court to \u201cfirst determine whether Continental derived a substantial workplace benefit from the overall relationship among CompuServe, the Forum and Continental.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 60, 751 A.2d 538. This was necessary for determining whether the Forum \u201cshould be considered sufficiently integrated with the workplace to require,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 61, 751 <em>A.2d </em>538, the employer to respond to \u201cthe posting of offensive messages on company ... e-mail systems when the employer is made aware of those messages.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>It was in that connection that the Court made the following observation, relied on by defendant: \u201cBusiness counselors caution employers that they should have policies that deal with sexual harassment on the message centers of this changing world. <em>That does not mean that employees ham a duty to monitor employees\u2019 mail. Grave </em>privacy concerns <em>are </em>implicated.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citations omitted) (emphasis supplied). The Court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-5\">To repeat, employers do not have a duty to monitor private communications of their employees; employers do have a duty to take effective measures to stop co-employee harassment when the employer knows or has reason to know that such harassment is part of a pattern of harassment that is taking place in the workplace and in settings that are related to the workplace.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 62, 751 A.2d 538.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">Clearly, <em>Blakey </em>does not answer the question posed in this case, which does not involve \u201cprivate communications\u201d of Employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">To begin, this is not a criminal case in which the State seeks to use evidence obtained through a search of his workplace computer against Employee. <em>See United States v. Angevine, </em>281 <em>F.3d </em>1130 (10th Cir.) (no Fourth Amendment right to suppress evidence of child pornography located on erased files of professor\u2019s workplace computer which was part of university network), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 <em>U.S. </em>845, 123 <em>S.Ct. </em>182, 154 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>71 (2002); <em>United States v. Simons, </em>206 F.3d 392, 398 (4th Cir.2000) (employee had no legitimate expectation of privacy in contents of his workplace computer where employer had notified employees that their computer activities could be monitored), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 <em>U.S. </em>930, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>292, 151 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>216 (2001); <em>United States v. Bailey, </em>272 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>822 (D.Neb.2003) (same). In the present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>case, we deal with whether defendant employer could monitor Employee\u2019s use of his workplace computer in the context of civil litigation brought by a third-party claiming injury resulting from those computer activities. On this question, we have found no authorities directly on point. In <em>Biby v. Bd. of Regents of the Univ. of Nebraska, </em>419 F.3d 845 (8th Cir.2005), Biby was terminated by the University based on information obtained in a search of his workplace computer files. <em>Id. </em>at 849. The University computer policy stated that computer files would be searched only if a legitimate reason existed, such as investigation of improper or illegal use of resources. <em>Id. </em>at 848. Biby sued the University, raising a number of theories, including a claim under 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1983 based upon violation of his Fourth Amendment right to privacy. Specifically, he claimed that \u201che had a constitutionally protected privacy interest in his work computer, that the university\u2019s reasons for searching his computer were illegitimate, and that the scope of the search was unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 850. The district court granted summary judgment dismissing Biby\u2019s claim and the circuit court affirmed. Applying the standards set out in <em>O\u2019Connor v. Ortega, </em>480 <em>U.S. </em>709, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>1492, 94 L.Ed.2d 714 (1987), also a \u00a7 1983 case, the court found no legitimate expectation of privacy by Biby in his computer files. In doing so, the court emphasized the existence of the university\u2019s workplace privacy policy, <em>id. </em>at 850-51, one of the facts which <em>O\u2019Connor </em>deemed relevant in determining the reasonableness of an employee\u2019s expectation of privacy. <em>O\u2019Connor, supra, </em>480 <em>U.S. </em>at 723, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1498, 94 L.Ed.2d at 717. While those decisions do not apply directly to the question posed here, they do offer some guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">In this case, defendant had an e-mail policy which stated that \u201call messages composed, sent or received on the e-mail system are and remain the property of the [defendant]. They are not the private property of any employee.\u201d Further, defendant reserved the \u201cright to review, audit, access and disclose all messages created, received or sent over the e-mail system as deemed necessary by and at the sole discretion of [defendant].\u201d Concerning the internet, the policy stated that employees were permitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>to \u201caccess sites, which are of a business nature only\u201d and provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-6\">Any employees who discover a <em>violation of </em>this policy shall notify <em>personnel Any </em>employee who violates this policy or uses the electronic mail or Internet system for improper purposes shall be subject to discipline, up to and including discharge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">The written e-mail policy contained an acknowledgement page to be signed by each employee. While the record does not contain a copy of such acknowledgement signed by Employee, there is no suggestion that he was not aware of the company policy. In addition, as we have noted, Employee\u2019s office, as with others in the same area, did not have a door and his computer screen was visible from the hallway, unless he took affirmative action to block it. Under those circumstances, we readily conclude that Employee had no legitimate expectation of privacy that would prevent his employer from accessing his computer to determine if he was using it to view adult or child pornography. As a result, we turn to whether defendant had reason to investigate Employee\u2019s use of his computer.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">C. INFORMATION KNOWN OR ATTRIBUTABLE TO DEFENDANT CONCERNING EMPLOYEE\u2019S PORNOGRAPHY ACTIVITIES.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">We see no need to repeat the facts set out earlier in this opinion. Assessing those facts and the reasonable inferences to be drawn from them, as we must in the summary judgment context, we conclude that defendant, through its supervisory/management personnel, was on notice that Employee was viewing pornography on his computer and, indeed, that this included child pornography. Knowledge includes \u201cimplied\u201d knowledge, which \u201cmeans knowledge based on other known facts that would inform a reasonably prudent person of the ultimate fact.\u201d <em>Black v. Pub. Serv. Elec. &amp; Gas Co., </em>98 <em>N.J.Super. </em>366, 375, 237 A.2d 495 (App.Div.1968). Such was the case here. Based on the company\u2019s policy, quoted above, such computer use was certainly not \u201cof a business nature\u201d but was, rather, \u201cfor improper purposes.\u201d That same policy required that violations be reported to personnel. We can reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>ably assume that such reporting was not simply intended as an idle gesture but was intended to trigger an investigation so that it could be determined if, according to the policy, the offending employee needed to be disciplined. While defendant asserted that in 1999 a policy had been instituted and communicated to certain management personnel by O\u2019Connor, that \u201cno employee should monitor any other employee\u2019s computer use just for the sake of monitoring,\u201d and that an employee who did so could be terminated, the monitoring of Employee\u2019s computer could not, on the facts presented, have been considered \u201cjust for the sake of monitoring.\u201d Here, the reports of improper computer use by Employee were not merely gossip, but based on credible, first-hand information. Indeed, it is inexplicable why such a policy was deemed applicable to several reports, such as that of Griesler to Carroll in early 2000 based on his review of computer logs which showed visits to pornographic sites such as \u201cSextracker.\u201d Thus, defendant was on notice of Employee\u2019s activities and was under a duty to investigate further. Such an investigation would have readily uncovered the full scope of Employee\u2019s activities, as did the Prosecutor\u2019s Office when it searched his computer on June 19, 2001. We impute to defendant knowledge that Employee was using his work computer to access pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">D. DID DEFENDANT HAVE A DUTY TO PREVENT EMPLOYEE FROM CONTINUING HIS ACTIVITIES?</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">With actual or imputed knowledge that Employee was viewing child pornography on his computer, was defendant under a duty to act, either by terminating Employee or reporting his activities to law enforcement authorities, or both? We conclude that such an obligation exists. The existence of a duty is a matter of law, \u201cderiving] from considerations of public policy and fairness.\u201d <em>Hopkins v. Fox &amp; Lazo Realtors, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>426, 439, 625 A.2d 1110 (1993) (citing <em>Kelly v. Gwinnell, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>538, 552, 476 A.2d 1219 (1984)). The Court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-7\">Whether a person owes duty of reasonable care toward another turns on whether the imposition of such a duty satisfies an abiding sense of basic fairness under all of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>the circumstances in light of considerations of public policy. <em>Goldberg v. Housing Auth., </em>38 <em>N.J. </em>at 578, 583, 186 A.2d 291 (1962). That inquiry involves identifying, weighing, and balancing several factors \u2014 the relationship of the parties, the nature of the attendant risk, the opportunity and ability to exercise care, and the public interest in the proposed solution. <em>Ibid </em>The analysis is both very fact-specific and principled; it must lead to solutions that properly and fairly resolve the specific case and generate intelligible and sensible rules to govern future conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-6\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">We begin by noting that it is a crime, both state and federal, to possess or view child pornography, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4b(5)(b); 18 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2252, \u00a7 2256(8)(B).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Given the public policy against child pornography, as reflected in these statutes, and the fact that \u201cpublic policy favors the exposure of crime,\u201d <em>Higgins v. Pascack Valley Hosp., </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>404, 423, 730 A.2d 327 (1999) (citing <em>Palmateer v. Int\u2019l Harvester Co., </em>85 <em>Ill.2d </em>124, 52 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>13, 421 N.E.2d 876, 880 (1981)), we agree with plaintiff that defendant had a duty to report Employee\u2019s activities to the proper authorities and to take effective internal action to stop those activities, whether by termination or some less drastic remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">At this point, we return to the <em>Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 317. That section places upon a master, in this case defendant, the duty to control his servant, here Employee, while the servant is acting outside the scope of his employment, as in the present case, to prevent the servant from \u201cintentionally harming others or from so conducting himself as to create an unreasonable risk of bodily harm to them.\u201d That type of duty finds support in our case law, <em>DiCosala v. Kay, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>159, 172, 450 A.2d 508 (1982), and we discern no sound reason not to apply it here. Defendant was under a duty to exercise reasonable care to stop Employee\u2019s activities, specifically his viewing of child pornography, which by its very nature has been deemed by the state and federal lawmak<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>ers to constitute a threat to \u201cothers;\u201d those \u201cothers\u201d being the children who are forced to engage in or are unwittingly made the subject of pornographic activities. We reject defendant\u2019s argument that a \u201cspecial relation\u201d must exist between the master (in this case the employer) and the person who is likely to be harmed. Defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 315 as support for that proposition is misplaced, at least in the present context. Indeed, \u00a7 315(a) supports plaintiff\u2019s position, not that of defendant. The section provides that \u201cthere is no duty to control the conduct of a third person as to prevent him from causing physical harm to another unless (a) a special relation exists between the actor and the third person which imposes a duty upon the actor to control the third person\u2019s conduct....\u201d In this ease, there is a special relation between defendant (the actor) and the third person (Employee), that being the master-servant (employer-employee) relation. It is for that reason that \u00a7 317 follows \u00a7 315 since the former explains the circumstances in which the master comes under a duty to control the servant\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">Returning to \u00a7 317, all of the requirements for liability in that section are present here. The servant was \u201cusing a chattel of the master\u201d and the master both \u201cknows or has reason to know that he has the ability to control his servant\u201d and \u201cknows or should know of the necessity and opportunity for exercising such control.\u201d Under these circumstances, a risk of harm to others was \u201creasonably within the [master\u2019s] range of apprehension.\u201d <em>Clohesy v. Food Circus Supermkts., </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>496, 503, 694 A.2d 1017 (1997) (quoting <em>Hill v. Yaskin, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>139, 144, 380 A.2d 1107 (1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">For these reasons we are unable to agree with the motion judge\u2019s conclusion that defendant had no knowledge that Employee had \u201cengaged in any conduct that would cause a person to have reasonable cause to believe that [Jill] had been subjected to child abuse or acts of child abuse.\u201d On the contrary, as we have explained, the record and reasonable inferences therefrom support the conclusion that defendant had knowledge that Employee was engaging in activities that posed the threat of harm to others, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>although not necessarily Jill. We see no unfairness in the imposition of a duty on defendant in these circumstances. <em>Kuzmicz v. Ivy Hill Park Apts., Inc., </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>510, 515, 688 A.2d 1018 (1997). Whether Employee\u2019s activities, which defendant had the means and duty to stop, were likely to have caused injury to Jill goes to proximate cause, an issue to which we now turn our attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">E. DID DEFENDANT\u2019S BREACH OF DUTY PROXIMATELY CAUSE HARM TO PLAINTIFF</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">In <em>Reynolds v. Gonzalez, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>266, 284, 798 A.2d 67 (2002), the Court most recently summarized the applicable principles:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXR\">One of the underlying principles of tort law is that \u201can actor\u2019s conduct must not only be tortious in character but it must also be a legal cause of the invasion of another\u2019s interest.\u201d <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 9 cmt. a (1965) <em>(Restatement </em>). It follows from that principle that the issue of a defendant\u2019s liability cannot be presented to the jury simply because there is some evidence of negligence. \u201cThere must be evidence or reasonable inferences therefrom showing a proximate causal relation between defendant\u2019s negligence, if found by the jury,\u201d and the resulting injury. <em>Germann v. Matriss, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>193, 205, 260 A.2d 825 (1970).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-8\">Similarly, <em>Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts </em>states that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Act\">[t]he plaintiff must introduce evidence which affords a reasonable basis for the conclusion that it is more likely than not that the conduct of the defendant was a cause in fact of the result. A mere possibility of such causation is not enough; and when the matter remains one of pure speculation or conjecture, or the probabilities are at best evenly balanced, it becomes the duty of the court to direct a verdict for the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-9\">[W. Page Keeton et. al., <em>Prosser &amp; Keeton on the Law of Torts, </em>\u00a7 41, at 269 (5th ed. 1984) <em>(Prosser &amp; Keeton).]</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-10\">Thus, absent \u201cproof of cause, there is no connection between the injury complained of and the fault of anyone.\u201d J.D. Lee <em>&amp; </em>Barry A. Lindahl, <em>Modern Tort Law: Liability and Litigation, </em>\u00a7 4.01,127 (rev. ed. 2000).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">In the present context, there are two distinct proximate cause-of-injury issues. First, whether defendant\u2019s breach of duty could be said to have resulted in the specific action of Employee which is claimed to have caused harm to Jill, that action being identified as the transmission of three images via e-mail on June 15, 2001. Thus, the inquiry becomes whether there were sufficient facts in the record from which a reasonable fact-finder could conclude that had defendant not breached its duty, no harm would have result<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>ed. In other words, had defendant acted to stop the activities of Employee when it had, or reasonably should have had, sufficient information on which to act, could the harm to Jill have been averted? If so, then proximate cause has been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Viewed in a light favorable to plaintiff, defendant was on notice of Employee\u2019s pornographic related computer activity by early 2000. By late March 2001, defendant had knowledge, through its supervisory personnel, that Employee had visited a variety of \u201cporn sites\u201d including one that suggested child pornography. Yet, despite being reported to high level management, np action was taken. A reasonable fact-finder could conclude that an appropriate investigation at that time would have revealed the extent of Employee\u2019s activities and, presumably, would have led-to action to shut down those activities. It is true, as defendant contends, that Employee could still have possibly utilized a computer elsewhere, such as at home or at a library, to transmit Jill\u2019s photos. But that possibility does not negate proximate cause as a matter of law; it simply presents a contested issue for a jury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Arvanitis v. Hios, </em>307 <em>N.J.Super. </em>577, 585, 705 A.2d 355 (App.Div.1998). As Judge Conley said there:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-6\">[f]oreseeability that relates to proximate cause (as distinguished from that relating to a duty of care) involves \u201c 'the question of whether the specific act or omission of the defendant was such that the ultimate injury to the plaintiff\u2019 reasonably flowed from the defendant\u2019s breach of duty.\u201d (quoting <em>Clohesy, supra, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>at 503, 694 A.2d 1017 (quoting <em>Hill, supra, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>at 143, 380 A.2d 1107)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">Proximate cause questions are generally for the trier of fact. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">The second proximate cause question, however, cannot be resolved on the present record. Plaintiff must establish that Jill suffered some harm to her person as a result of the Internet transmission of her photos. Of course, that harm could be psychological in nature, but there must be a showing of some harm proximately caused by defendant\u2019s breach of duty. Perhaps be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>cause the arguments before the motion court were focused on liability, little, if anything, was said about damages. As a result, we remand the matter to the Law Division at which time the issue of proximately caused harm may be addressed within the summary judgment context. Although we have rejected most of defendant\u2019s arguments concerning its potential liability, we do not foreclose the possibility that summary judgment may yet be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Reversed and remanded.
