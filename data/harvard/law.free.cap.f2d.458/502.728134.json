The district court granted the writ 323 F.Supp. 585. The Warden appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-17\"> It is the position of this court that as a general rule assistance of counsel is not an essential element of due process in such a proceeding because \u201calternatives adequate in point of fairness may well exist in routine cases.\u201d The ultimate test in each case is \u201cwhether the procedures followed by the Adult Authority were reasonably and fairly designed to enable it to ascertain whether issues existed concerning the asserted violation and to make an informed decision upon such issues.\u201d Dennis v. California Adult Authority, 456 F.2d 1240 (9th Cir., 1972). <em>See </em>Ellhamer v. Wilson, 445 F.2d 856 (9th Cir. 1971), and cases cited there.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-11\">Measuring petitioner\u2019s pleading against this standard, we conclude that he failed to allege facts demonstrating that assistance of counsel was an essential element of due process in this case. The order granting the writ is therefore reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
