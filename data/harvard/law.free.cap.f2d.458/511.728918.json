All have been carefully considered and found lacking in substance. The district judge, in a soundly reasoned opinion reported at 332 F.Supp. 1166 (E.D.Mo.1971), demonstrated that appellant\u2019s defenses were tenuous and insufficient to relieve appellant from liability on the cashier\u2019s cheek which it had issued. We affirm on the basis of the district court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
