Transportation Co. The Board found that respondent had violated Sections 8(a)(1) and 8(a)(3) of the Labor Management Relations Act, in that he had intimidated and discharged employees because of their union activities.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-22\"> Respondent raises the threshold question of whether or not the Board possessed power to make the order; he urges that his employees, whose rights were found to be violated, were \u201cagricultural laborers,\u201d a class expressly excluded from the purview of the Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Respondent was not engaged in farming; he was a contract carrier by motor truck of farm produce grown by others; the employees in question were his truck drivers, who operated a part of the fleet of trucks with which he hauled such agricultural products from farm to market. Respondent\u2019s employees were thus not \u201cagricultural laborers.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> N.L.R.B. v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Olaa Sugar Co., 242 F.2d 714 (9th Cir. 1957); N.L.R.B v. Strain Poultry-Farms, Inc., 405 F.2d 1025 (5th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Turning to the merits, we are clear that the Board\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. There being no other issues,</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The Board\u2019s order will be enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b539-10\">. Section 8(a) (1) and 8(a) (3) make it an unfair labor practice for an employer to \u201c(1) interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed by Section 7 of this title; * * * \u201c(3) by discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment . to . discourage membership in any labor organization. . . . \u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a) (1), (a) (3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b539-15\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(3) provides that the term \u201cemployee\u201d used throughout the Act \u201cshall not include any individual employed as an agricultural laborer. . . . \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b539-17\">. The L.R.M.A. does not define the term \u201cagricultural laborer\u201d appearing in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(3). However, as stated in N.L.R.B. v. Strain, infra, \u201cSince 1946, Congress lias added a rider to the N.L.R.B.\u2019s appropriation bill providing that no part of the appropriation shall be used in connection with bargaining units composed of \u2018agricultural laborers\u2019 as defined in Section 3(f) of the FLSA (Fair Labor Standards Act). \u2018Agriculture\u2019 is thus defined to include: \u2018 . . . farming in nil its brandies and among other things includes the cultivation and tillage of the soil, dairying, the production, cultivation, growing and harvesting of any agricultural or horticultural commodities . and any practices (including any forestry or lumbering operations) performed by a farmer or on a farm as an incident to or in conjunction with such farming operations, including . . . delivery to storage or to market . . . . \u2019\u201d 405 F.2d 1025 at 1027-1028.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-27\">Farmers Reservoir and Irrigation Co. v. McComb, 337 U.S. 755, 69 S.Ot. 1274, 93 L.Ed. 1672 (1949) is instructive with respect to the jurisdictional issue raised by respondent. There, the Court pointed out that the definition set out in Section 3(f) has \u201ctwo distinct branches. First, there is the primary meaning. Agriculture includes farming in all its branches. Certain specific practices such as cultivation and tillage of the soil, dairying, etc. are listed as being included in this primary meaning. Second, there is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>broader meaning. Agriculture is defined to include things other than farming as so illustrated. It includes any practices whether or not themselves farming practices, which are performed either by a farmer or on a farm, incidentally to or in conjunction with \u2018such\u2019 farming operations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-14\">Here, Respondent\u2019s employees were not engaged in farming, given its \u201cprimary meaning\u201d nor do they come within the second branch of the definition. Even granting that the work they did constituted \u201ca practice performed as an incident to or in conjunction witli farming,\u201d the exemption did not operate unless, as required by Section 3(f), the work was performed \u201cby a farmer or on a farm.\u201d The latter condition was, of course, not met \u2014 Kent was not a farmer.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-30\">Respondent calls attention to Section 13(a) (22) which he characterizes as a \u201csignificant amendment\u201d; however, that section of the Farm Labor Standards Act does not modify Section 3(f) as it applies to the Labor Management Relations Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
