Direct review of any such order may be had in this court, under a statutory admonition that \u201c[t]he finding of the [Commissioner] as to the facts, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(h) (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-16\">This is such a review proceeding. Petitioner is the manufacturer of a drug called Sere, which is sold in interstate commerce on the representation that it is useful in reducing the incidence of attacks of vertigo in the case of persons who suffer from Meniere\u2019s disease and who have a high frequency of vertiginous episodes. The statute gives as two of the reasons justifying withdrawal of a prior approval \u201ca lack of substantial evidence that the drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling thereof;\u201d and that \u201cthe application contains any untrue statement of a material fact.\u201d In this instance, the Commissioner found both such reasons to exist, although either, if supported by the requisite degree of evidence, would suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-17\">Neither in the administrative proceedings nor in this court has there been any suggestion that the use of Sere is dangerous to health.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The principal issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>in controversy is whether the Commissioner has adequate record support for his finding that there is a lack of substantial evidence for the claims made for the efficacy of Serv. This controversy has its roots in the statutory definition of \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d for this purpose as meaning</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-5\">evidence consisting of adequate and well controlled investigations, including clinical investigations, by experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug involved, on the basis of which it could fairly and responsibly be concluded by such experts that the drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling . . . thereof. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">Petitioner complains of the Commissioner\u2019s rejection of five studies submitted by petitioner as not being \u201cadequate and well controlled\u201d within the contemplation of the foregoing definition. The argument between the respective witnesses for petitioner and those presented by the Commissioner appears to center upon the question of whether vertiginous episodes have sufficient predictability to render significant historical studies which compare the frequency of attacks during the periods when Sere has been used and when it has not. If there is substantial evidence to support the Commissioner\u2019s finding that these studies are not helpful, then petitioner must fail, since its claims for Sere admittedly rest upon this foundation. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\"> We have examined the record of the administrative hearing on this point with care, particularly with a view to grasping as best we can the nature of the divergences between the differing expert witnesses. Although the matter seems to us one not entirely free from doubt, we remind ourselves that our role in the Congressional scheme is not to give an independent judgment of our own, but rather to determine whether the expert agency entrusted with regulatory responsibility has taken an irrational or arbitrary view of the evidence assembled before it. Illinois Central RR Co. v. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. Co., 385 U.S. 57, 87 S.Ct. 255, 17 L.Ed.2d 162 (1966). We are unable to say that it has; and, accordingly, the petition for review is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-13\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b846-12\">. It appears that, prior to 1962 when Congress amended the governing statute, an approval of a drug once given could be withdrawn only if the Commissioner found the drug to be unsafe. The regulatory authorities found this situation to be unsatisfactory, and sought from the Congress enlarged conditions under which approval could be withdrawn. <em>See </em>1961 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, p. 2892. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>At <em>that time 21 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 355(e) was cast in its present form which, in relevant part, is as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-9\">The Secretary <em>shall . </em>. . withdraw approval of an application ... if Lhe] finds ... (3) on the basis of new information before him with respect to such drug, evaluated together with tlie evidence available to him when the application was approved, that there is a lack of substantial evidence that the drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have . . . ; or (4) that the application contains any untrue statement of a material fact . . . (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
