He complains that the district court\u2019s reliance on hearsay contained in his presentence report deprived him of due process. The issue has been decided against him. (Williams v. New York (1949) 337 U.S. 241, 69 S.Ct. 1079, 93 L.Ed. 1337.)</p>\n<p id=\"b439-22\">In this case, wholly unlike United States v. Weston (9th Cir. 1971) 448 F.2d 626, 634, the information in the presentence report was not unreliable. To the extent that there was any dispute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>about the inferences to be drawn from the facts therein recited or the emphasis to be placed on those facts, the matters were fully explored in discussion among the court, Chewning, and Chewning\u2019s counsel. On this record there was no abuse of discretion in denying probation and committing Chewning to custody of the Attorney General pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5010(b) and 5017(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
