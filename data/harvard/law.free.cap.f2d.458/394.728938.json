Frederick, a federal prisoner incarcerated in a California state penal institution, appeals from an order denying his motion for correction of sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Appellant claims that he has been denied a timely parole hearing. The District Court, having been advised by the Federal Parole Board that appellant\u2019s parole application would be considered, denied appellant\u2019s motion. The court added, however, that it would not finally dispose of the matter until notified of the Board\u2019s decision. The order appealed from is thus not final and is not an appealable order under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-21\">The appeal is accordingly dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. The District Court should notify appellant when it finally disposes of his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-22\">Dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
