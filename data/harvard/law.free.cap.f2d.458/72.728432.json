Wood with directions to prepare and file his opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>on the issues of plaintiff\u2019s motion and defendant\u2019s cross-motion for summary-judgment under the order of reference and Rule 166(c). The commissioner has done so in an opinion and report filed on September 30, 1971, wherein such facts as are necessary to the opinion are set forth. Plaintiff has requested review by the court of the commissioner\u2019s opinion and recommended conclusion, defendant has urged that the commissioner\u2019s opinion be adopted by the court and the case has been submitted to the court on the briefs of the parties and oral argument of counsel. Since the court agrees with the opinion and recommended conclusion of the trial commissioner, as hereinafter set forth, it hereby adopts the same as the basis for its judgment in this case. Accordingly, it is concluded that plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Count II of the amended petition is granted, to the extent indicated in the opinion, but otherwise denied; that defendant\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment on Count II is granted to the extent indicated in the opinion, but otherwise denied; that defendant\u2019s motion for judgment in its favor on its counterclaim is denied; that defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss Count I of the amended petition is granted and Count I is dismissed; and, that further proceedings herein are stayed for a period of 6 months pursuant to (and subject to the terms of) Rule 167 to afford the parties an opportunity to obtain an administrative resolution of the amount of the equitable adjustment to which plaintiff is entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">OPINION OF COMMISSIONER</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">WOOD, Commissioner:</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">In Count I <em>of the </em>amended petition herein, plaintiff, trustee for Victory Electronics, Inc., a bankrupt, sues to recover from defendant damages for alleged breaches of contract in the approximate sum of $1,128,790. In Count II, which incorporates all of the factual allegations of Count I, and claims an identical amount, plaintiff seeks review, under familiar standards,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of a decision of the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals in the matter.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-16\">The litigation involves a contract between Victory and defendant, acting through the U.S. Army Electronics Material Agency, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for the manufacture and delivery of 2,017 units of a radio communication device called the \u201cRT-77\u201d,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> at a unit price of $464.99 and a total contract price of approximately $938,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-17\">The contract, awarded January 29, 1964, contained, among other things, standard \u201cChanges\u201d, \u201cDefault\u201d, and \u201cDisputes\u201d clauses,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and a \u201cProduction Drawing Changes\u201d clause excerpted below. By Modification No. 1, dated May 19, 1964, a standard \u201cProgress Payments\u201d clause was added.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-18\">In March 1966 Victory was adjudicated a bankrupt, and in April 1966 the contracting officer terminated the contract for default. The termination was not appealed, and its propriety was not, and is not, in dispute. At issue before the Board were, however, the amounts owed by defendant (1) in consequence of Victory\u2019s correction and revision of government-furnished drawings, and (2) for inventory taken from Victory\u2019s Plain-view, Long Island, plant, and from the plants of two of its subcontractors (Miles Industries and Taffet Electronics).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>The Board concluded that plaintiff was due a total of $304,697.08: <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> $46,058 for \u201cdrawing changes\u201d; $206,798.81 for the Plainview inventory; $41,323.43 for the Miles inventory;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and $10,516.84 for the Taffet inventory. In Count II, plaintiff claims an \u201cequitable adjustment\u201d of some $527,580 for drawings work and $951,-050 for \u201cinventory\u201d, minus progress payments to Victory, thus arriving at the total of appoximately $1,128,790 in suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Without \u201cwaiving its claim for breach of contract set forth in Count I of its Amended Petition\u201d,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> plaintiff has moved for summary judgment on Count II. By cross-motion, defendant asks the court (1) to sustain the administrative decision at issue in Count II, (2) to dismiss Count I as well, and (3) to enter judgment in defendant\u2019s favor on its counterclaim. For reasons which follow, it is concluded that plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Count II should be granted, to the extent indicated herein, but otherwise denied; that defendant\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment on Count II should be granted, to the extent indicated herein, but otherwise denied; that defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss Count I should be granted; that defendant\u2019s motion for judgment in its favor on its counterclaim should be denied; and that further proceedings herein should be stayed pursuant to (and subject to the terms of) Rule 167 for a period of 6 months, to afford the parties an opportunity to obtain an administrative resolution of the amount of the equitable adjustment to which plaintiff is entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b133-14\">\n<em>The Drawing Changes Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A-\">Defendant does not controvert plaintiff\u2019s right to be reimbursed for Victory\u2019s cost of correcting government-furnished drawings, a cost which plaintiff contends was at least $527,579.06. Defendant\u2019s position is, rather, that the equitable adjustment of $46,058 for drawing changes determined by the Board is, under Wunderlich Act criteria, final and conclusive. For reasons which follow, it is concluded that defendant\u2019s position on this claim must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-15\">The RT-77 was not, in 1964, a new device. Some 669 government-furnished drawings, supplied to Victory in early February 1964 for use in fabrication of the units, dated from 1949 to 1953.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Board found, and plaintiff stresses, that Victory made a total of 1,691 changes to 726 drawings, including 10 complete new drawings.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-16\">By the contract\u2019s \u201cProduction Drawing Changes\u201d clause, referred to above, Victory</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-17\">a. * * * agrees to thoroughly check the furnished Government drawings and utilize same in the manufacture of the item they cover and * * to revise the drawings as directed by the Contracting Officer. Inaccuracies, incompleteness, errors, etc. of the drawings will be resolved by consultation with [U.S. Army Electronics Materiel Support Agency, Fort Monmouth, New Jersey] BEFORE proceeding with production. The Government will not be responsible for damages or extra costs resulting from an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>inadequate check of the drawings or revisions to the drawings. If, because of the above action, there results a change in the contract requirements, the contractor and the Government will negotiate an equitable adjustment in contract price * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-4\">b. In the event changes in the contract specifications or drawings are ordered or approved by the Government, the contractor agrees upon request * * * to revise the production drawings * * *. The Government and the contractor will negotiate an equitable adjustment in price for such revisions to the production drawings in accordance with the procedure set forth in the Changes Clause * * *.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Victory\u2019s contract employed the technical action request (TAR) system for \u201cinterchange of technical information, approvals and recommendations between the Government and [Victory] * * *.\" In some eight TAR\u2019s (19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 26, 27, and 31)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Victory submitted to defendant for approval the 1,691 drawing changes alluded to above. Plaintiff\u2019s claim was, and here is, that for these changes $527,579.06 is due.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">According to the Board, Victory\u2019s president testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-9\">* * * that [after] he became aware of the drawing errors * * * in early March 1964 * * * the entire engineering staff and drafting department were detailed to find where .all the mistakes were on the drawings * * * [;] that * * * all engineering and drafting [hours] spent on the inaccuracies in the prints were kept separate and were not a part of any billing in a progress payment [;] and that this time was kept in a filing cabinet in the engineering department under the category \u2018Changes in Drawings and Updated Drawings.\u2019 * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-17\">The Board found that \u201cthese records were lost after [Victory] went into bankruptcy when, according to [Victory\u2019s] president, creditors dumped them out of filing cabinets and the owner of the building \u2018swept all the stuff up.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-18\">In any event, plaintiff did not introduce at the Board any contemporaneous record of the time devoted to revising the government-furnished drawings. Instead, plaintiff endeavored to establish the amount of time spent in the revision effort through the testimony of Victory\u2019s accountant and its former executive vice president.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-19\">Victory\u2019s former executive vice president did not join Victory until October 1964. Prior to the 1969 Board hearing, Victory\u2019s accountant obtained from him the names of those engineers, draftsmen, and technicians who, according to the executive vice president, had worked exclusively on the contract in suit. The accountant next examined Victory earning records (dating from July 1965) from which he extracted the number of hours worked each week by those employees whose names he had been furnished. He then examined Victory\u2019s progress payment requests, deleted from the hours shown on the earning records any time included in Victory\u2019s progress payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>requests,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and allocated all hours not so included to drawing problems.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">The accountant concluded that a total of 26,906 hours\u2019 time (20,040 hours by engineers and 6,866 hours by draftsmen) had been devoted to drawing corrections. Using overhead and G&amp;A figures derived from the use of income tax returns and financial statements he had prepared for Victory, his computation of the equitable adjustment due for drawing changes was $527,579.06.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Victory\u2019s former executive vice president testified at some length with respect to several drawings which, he said, were representative of all drawings and changes thereto. He described both the changes required on each of the several drawings and the type of employee \u201crequired to ferret out a particular change * * He also estimated the length of time required to determine the changes, write up a TAR, and make the changes.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> His estimate was that a total of 25,750 hours (20,750 engineering hours and 5,000 drafting hours) had been spent in determining drawing changes and in placing them on the drawings.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> As plaintiff emphasizes, he was not cross-examined with respect to his testimony concerning the nature and extent of drawing changes.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">Defendant did, however, offer testimony that the \u201crepresentative\u201d drawings described in the testimony of Victory\u2019s former executive vice president required dimensional changes of a more complicated nature than other contract drawings; that the dimensional changes required could have been ascertained from a normal check of the drawings; that in late September 1964 no changes had been made to any drawings; that at that time, during a 2-day visit to Victory\u2019s plant by a government draftsman, changes (largely dimensional) to about 50 drawings had been made by that draftsman and one Victory employee; that following TAR 19, in which those dimensional changes were reflected, the \u201cvast bulk\u201d of all changes were updating and revisions to finish and material specifications and that the majority of all the changes were the updating of specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-15\">On this aspect of plaintiff\u2019s claim, the Board found, <em>inter alia, </em>that the \u201cgreat majority\u201d of the 1,691 drawing changes required \u201cwere mere revisions to, and updating of specifications\u201d; that while it was evident that effort had been expended on drawing changes, \u201cthe evidence produced to establish that this effort represented more than 25,000 hours of engineering is wholly speculative\u201d; that plaintiff\u2019s evidence in this respect conflicted with the testimony of defendant\u2019s witnesses, whose credibility was unshaken on cross-examination; and that on the record as a whole, \u201ccontaining, as it does, contradictory evidence as to [Victory\u2019s] efforts to correct and revise the drawings,\u201d the preponderance of the evidence did not sustain plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>\u201cclaim of an expenditure of some 25,000 hours on this part of [Victory\u2019s] job\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">The Board further stated that the disparity between the estimates of the parties, and the conflicting nature of the evidence, precluded any degree of certainty in determining the number of hours devoted to drawing changes, but that, taking into account the nature and character of the majority of drawing changes, 2.5 hours per drawing change (a total of 4,228 hours, allocated 1,000 hours to supervision and cheeking and 3,228 hours to drafting) was \u201ca reasonable expenditure of effort for the drawings.\u201d Thus, the Board concluded, plaintiff was entitled to an equitable adjustment as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Supervision and checking (1,000 hrs. at $6.45)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>............................ $ 6,450</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Draftsmen (3,228 hrs. at $3.50) .......... 11,298</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">1st Subtotal .................. 17,748</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">100% Plant Overhead .................. 17,748</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">Material .............................. 600</p>\n<p id=\"b136-11\">2nd Subtotal .................. 36,096</p>\n<p id=\"b136-12\">G &amp; A at 16% of 2nd Subtotal ........... 5,775</p>\n<p id=\"b136-13\">$41,871</p>\n<p id=\"b136-14\">Profit at 10% ........................ 4,187</p>\n<p id=\"b136-15\">Total ........................ $46,058</p>\n<p id=\"b136-16\">Plaintiff asserts that the Board erred in concluding that the \u201cdrawing errors were not of such magnitude as to entitle Plaintiff to an equitable adjustment in the contract price to reflect the full cost, including engineering time, of the 1691 drawing changes which [Victory] made.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Plaintiff terms the Board\u2019s \u201cfinding\u201d that both Victory and defendant understood that the drawings, dating as they did from 1949 to 1953, were to be checked for errors and obsolescence and, where necessary, corrected, revised, and updated by Victory prior to going into production (subject, the Board also recognized, to an equitable adjustment in contract price) a conclusion of law based on the Board\u2019s interpretation of paragraph \u201ca\u201d of the Production Drawing Changes clause, and contends that the Board\u2019s \u201creliance upon this provision to relieve or reduce Defendant\u2019s responsibility for Victory\u2019s costs in correcting the Government-furnished drawings is contrary to law.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-20\">While defendant does not take serious issue with plaintiff\u2019s characterization of the Board \u201cfinding\u201d, it does contend, and correctly, that the Board committed no error in its conclusion that \u201cpart of the bargain struck * * * was the agreement to revise, change and update the drawings, subject to adjustment in contract price.\u201d The contract plainly so provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-21\">Even more significantly, a fair reading of the Board opinion convinces that the pivotal consideration on the drawing changes claim was the state of the evidence as to the nature of required changes and the engineering and drafting time devoted to making such changes. Plaintiff\u2019s implicit assumption that the Board\u2019s determination as to the equitable adjustment due therefor was tainted by reliance on erroneous factors is without apparent factual or legal support.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-22\">Whether the Board\u2019s findings as to the nature of drawing changes and as to the engineering and drafting time devoted to drawing corrections and revisions are entitled to finality must, of course, separately be considered. Plaintiff asserts that both findings should be rejected, while defendant predictably contends that they must be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-23\">One focus of plaintiff\u2019s attack is the finding that the great majority of the drawing changes were mere revisions to, or updating of, specifications. To plaintiff, this \u201cfinding is essentially a conclusion of law and as such is erroneous\u201d but, to the extent factual, it is in any event allegedly unsupported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Plaintiff points to the testimony of Victory\u2019s former executive vice president as reflecting the \u201cactual facts\u201d concerning the nature of drawing changes, and urges that the conflicting testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>mony of defendant\u2019s witnesses should have been given no weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">As plaintiff elsewhere tacitly concedes,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> the Board made a factual finding as to the nature of the drawing changes required. On review of such a finding, the Wunderlich Act does not permit this court to write on a clean slate. Northbridge Electronics, Inc. v. United States, 444 F.2d 1124, 195 Ct.Cl. 453 (1971); Donald M. Drake Co. v. United States, 439 F.2d 169, 194 Ct.Cl. 549 (1971). While the Board could have accepted the testimony of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses and thereby reached the factual view for which plaintiff contended, there is in the administrative record substantial, credible, and conflicting evidence as to the nature of the drawing changes. The Board credited defendant\u2019s, not plaintiff\u2019s, proof on this point.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In this circumstance, the Board\u2019s factual finding is entitled to finality. <em>Ibid. </em>See also Vann v. United States, 420 F.2d 968, 989, 190 Ct.Cl. 546, 584 (1970); Dittmore-Freimuth Corp. v. United States, 390 F.2d 664, 685, 182 Ct.Cl. 507, 540 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Plaintiff also challenges the Board\u2019s determination of the amount of the equitable adjustment due for drawing changes, contending that this \u201cholding was predicated upon conclusions of law which are erroneous and operative facts which are not supported by substantial evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> <em>Inter alia, </em>plaintiff claims that the Board erred (1) in its allusion to abandonment of drawings on a refuse pile; (2) in \u201cconsidering Plaintiff\u2019s- proof of the quantum to which it is entitled\u201d;<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and (3) in failing to utilize plaintiff\u2019s claimed G&amp;A rate in the computation of the equitable adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">The genesis of the first facet of the argument is a finding that, after Victory\u2019s adjudication in bankruptcy, \u201cdrawings containing the changes which are the subject of this appeal were found on a refuse heap.\u201d The Board then observed that it was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-12\">* * * difficult to understand why an auctioneer entering the plant upon authority of [plaintiff] would be permitted to take the drawings themselves \u2014the alleged product of more than 25,000 engineering hours \u2014 and abandon them on a refuse pile.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-13\">Plaintiff avers that this \u201cfinding foreshadowed and influenced\u201d the Board\u2019s evaluation of plaintiff\u2019s proof; that the abandoned drawings were in fact the original, defective, government-furnished drawings (with Victory\u2019s changes thereon) from which a revised set of drawings had been made; and that the abandonment of the original drawings was so irrelevant to the question of the equitable adjustment due that the Board\u2019s consideration of it was erroneous as a matter of law.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-14\">Defendant counters that plaintiff has \u201cblown up out of all proportion the affect [sic] of the wasted drawings on the Board\u2019s decision\u201d,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and that plaintiff\u2019s failure to protect them evidenced a complete lack of responsibility. While the latter segment of the rebuttal is unpersuasive, the former is. While the abandoned drawings undoubtedly were irrelevant to a determination of the equitable adjustment due, the Board\u2019s expression of passing puzzlement over their treatment \u2014 all that plaintiff has to rely upon for this argument \u2014 is an insufficient indicator that the fact of their abandonment had any impact on the Board\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-15\">Nor does the contention that the Board erred in considering plaintiff\u2019s \u201cproof of * * * quantum\u201d withstand scrutiny. The judgment that the preponderance of the evidence did not sus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>tain plaintiff\u2019s claim of more than 25,-000 hours drawing changes time involved issues of credibility and evaluation of the probative worth of the conflicting evidence proffered. Plaintiff has failed to show that this determination is either unsupported by substantial evidence or erroneous as a matter of law. Northbridge Electronics, Inc. v. United States, <em>supra; </em>Electronic &amp; Missile Facilities, Inc. v. United States, 416 F.2d 1345, 189 Ct.Cl. 237 (1969); Sternberger v. United States, 401 F.2d 1012, 185 Ct.Cl. 528 (1968); Dittmore-Freimuth Corp. v. United States, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Wunderlich Contracting Co. v. United States, 351 F.2d 956, 173 Ct.Cl. 180 (1965) fails to support the contention that the Board erred as a matter of law in declining to believe plaintiff\u2019s evidence as proffered. Under <em>Wunderlich, </em>a \u201creasonable basis for computation, even though the result is only approximate\u201d, is at the least a prerequisite, and it cannot be concluded that the Board committed legal or factual error in declining \u201cto accept plaintiff\u2019s evidence in toto * * *.\" Sternberger v. United States, <em>supra, </em>401 F.2d at 1017, 185 Ct.Cl. at 536, see also Electronic &amp; Missile Facilities, Inc. v. United States, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">The related argument that the \u201cBoard\u2019s determination that Victory\u2019s costs were unreasonable violates the precept that such costs must first be presumed to be reasonable\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> is specious. Bruce Constr. Co. v. United States, 324 F.2d 516, 163 Ct.Cl. 97 (1963), cited in support of the argument, is plainly inap-posite. Boyajian v. United States, 423 F.2d 1231, 1242-1244, 191 Ct.Cl. 233, 252-254 (1970). The Board\u2019s finding was that plaintiff\u2019s proof failed to substantiate the claim asserted. In this Wunderlich Act review, that finding can only be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">Plaintiff\u2019s briefs suggest that Maxwell Electronics Company encountered \u201csimilar problems * * * in revising the Government-furnished drawings while attempting to produce RT-77 sets under the Small Business set-aside portion of the same IFB\u201d; that Maxwell was paid a total of $263,000 for changes during the course of its RT-77 contract; that at least $252,000 was for costs incurred by Maxwell in producing a revised set of reproducible drawings; and that this is \u201cstrong support\u201d for the validity of plaintiff\u2019s claim of more than double that amount for drawing changes.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-11\">The administrative record reflects that the Maxwell contract paperwork was made available to plaintiff for inspection on or before May 1, 1969. The final day of the Board hearing, at which the Maxwell documents were offered and received into evidence, was July 24, 1969. There is, however, no testimonial illumination of the Maxwell documents, and they are certainly not self-explanatory. In the premises, the inference here sought cannot fairly be drawn. All else aside, no meaningful relationship between Victory\u2019s work in correcting govenment-furnished drawings and payments to Maxwell has been demonstrated.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-12\">Plaintiff\u2019s insistence upon the credibility of those witnesses who testified in support of the claim here made, and the concomitant denigration of the conflicting proof, do not serve to fault the Board decision respecting the time devoted to drawing changes. The administrative record undeniably established that \u201ceffort was expended on drawing changes\u201d. Lacking any precise measure<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>ment of defendant\u2019s responsibility therefor (and the Board did not err in declining to swallow the evidence of one party or the other), the Board properly resorted to a \u201cjury verdict\u201d approach. Electronic &amp; Missile Facilities, Inc. v. United States, <em>supra, </em>416 F.2d at 1355, 189 Ct.Cl. at 253 (1969); Phillips Constr. Co., Inc. v. United States, 394 F.2d 834, 842, 184 Ct.Cl. 249, 263 (1968). The result reached was well within the zone of reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">The issue is not whether, on an independent study of the administrative record, a like conclusion as to the equitable adjustment due plaintiff would here be reached, but whether, under the criteria contained in the Wunderlich Act, the Board\u2019s conclusion is deserving of finality. On a fair analysis, that conclusion \u201crepresented the best judgment of the fact trier on the record before it, and this \u2018is all that the parties have any right to expect.\u2019\u201d Phillips Constr. Co., Inc. v. United States, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">There remains the question whethei the Board erred in rejecting plaintiff\u2019s claimed G&amp;A rate of TO percent in computing the equitable adjustment due for drawing changes. Plaintiff relies upon the testimony of Victory\u2019s accountant based upon his copy of Victory\u2019s 1964 Federal income tax return and his own worksheets for 1965,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> and an April 1965 Army audit recommending a 70 percent G&amp;A rate for progress payments 1 through 11, as establishing error in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">By agreement between Victory and defendant, the G&amp;A rate in subsequent progress payments was substantially reduced to provide an overall G&amp;A rate of approximately 15 percent on the contract in suit. The Army audit cited by plaintiff itself so indicates. The testimony of Victory\u2019s accountant as to the propriety of a 70 percent G&amp;A rate was sharply disputed by government evidence, and the record discloses no error by the Board in failing to credit plaintiff\u2019s testimony or in utilizing the agreed G&amp;A rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-11\">Upon a careful consideration of all of plaintiff\u2019s arguments concerning the drawing changes claim, the Board decision, and the record, it is concluded that the administrative resolution of that claim cannot be overturned.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b139-13\">\n<em>The Inventory Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b139-14\">The contract required that two pre-production samples, assembled using parts, materials and processes to be employed in production and meeting all other contract requirements, be submitted 150 days after contract award (June 27, 1964). It further provided that delivery of production quantities would commence October 26,1964. Subsequently, however, by Modification No. 4, dated June 30, 1965, and reflecting a revised delivery date (July 22, 1964) for prepro-duction samples, the first production quantities were scheduled for delivery on September 30, 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-15\">In connection with the fabrication of the preproduction samples, Victory was to submit to defendant a TAR containing, among other things, test data pertaining to their performance. Defendant had 10 days to evaluate the test report and, if that report were satisfactory, to establish a date for the start of prepro-duction sample evaluation. Defendant\u2019s evaluation of the preproduction samples was, in any event, to be completed within 60 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-16\">The Board found that despite the age of the government-furnished drawings, Victory\u2019s understanding that they were to be checked for errors and inaccuracies, and its knowledge that changes in them were required, it released some of them to a supplier without doing more than counting them prior to release. The initial release of drawings (for the manufacture of the chassis customarily used to package the operating components) resulted in delivery to Victory, in March <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>1964, of chassis which could not be assembled because of incorrect dimensions and mounting holes which did not coincide. Victory then obtained tooling from a company which had previously made the RT-77 and used it to build the chassis for the preproduction samples. The samples were completed in June 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">By Action I to TAR 17, dated July 22, 1964, Victory made an initial submission of test data pertaining to the pre-production samples. Additional data omitted from the initial submission was submitted in Action IV, TAR 17, dated November 16, 1964, and still further test data pertaining, the Board found, \u201cto facets other than frequency drift,\u201d and in no way \u201cdependent upon the submission of data pertaining to drift\u201d was submitted by letter dated December 7, 1964. In the meantime, a government engineer was sent to Victory\u2019s plant on August 17, 1964, to begin preproduction sample evaluation. That evaluation was probably completed about the middle of September 1964; after the \u201cvisit\u201d of the government engineer, Victory released production drawings to vendors and mailed out vendor\u2019s \u201ccontracts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">In the Board\u2019s language, in Action VI to TAR 17, dated January 25, 1965, defendant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-6\">* * * conditionally approved all test data submitted, with the exception of the data pertaining to frequency stability or frequency drift. Consequently, the preproduction samples were approved with special conditions and [Victory] released for production. These conditions included, among others, a requirement that the permissible limits of frequency drift be established from a random sample of 10 each receiver/transmitter variable capacitors chosen from a cross-section of the first production lot.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">Victory was to perform the test mentioned in the foregoing quotation, and to \u201creport these test results to this directorate by subsequent action to this TAR.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-11\">No such report of test results was ever submitted. Victory, which had been beset with financial problems throughout the entire period of the contract in suit, was adjudicated a bankrupt in March 1966, and termination of the contract for default followed shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-12\">On May 10, 1966, pursuant to stipulation between counsel for plaintiff and counsel for defendant, defendant took possession of, and removed from Victory\u2019s Plainview plant, \u201ccontract inventory\u201d which had been identified, inventoried, and itemized in a schedule attached to the stipulation. The government \u201ccount\u201d of this property was controverted before, but accepted by, the Board. That \u201ccount\u201d is not presently in dispute, but the Board\u2019s treatment of the Plainview inventory is.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-13\">In 1967, defendant \u201cpicked up\u201d from Taffet Electronics, one of Victory\u2019s subcontractors, 573 unprocessed shell covers and 1,643 unprocessed shell cases. The Board found that Taffet had received 2,-035 shell cases and 2,035 shell covers \u201cfor processing and transshipment to * * * \u201d Victory, but accepted the government \u201ccount\u201d of the Taffet inventory. Plaintiff does not here question the 1967 \u201ccount\u201d <em>per se, </em>but does challenge the Board\u2019s treatment of the Taf-fet inventory.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-14\">A. The \u201cAll Costs\u201d Aspect of the Inventory Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b140-15\">Before the Board, plaintiff contended, among other things, that \u201ca Government-caused delay of five months pending approval of the preproduction models, specifications that imposed requirements impossible of attainment, and additional testing to determine what results were attainable are factors which enter into [Victory\u2019s] true cost in producing the inventory\u201d, and that these factors should result in a determination that plaintiff was due some $950,000 for the contract inventory.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>The Board denied a government motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction this aspect of plaintiff\u2019s claim <em>(inter alia), </em>but rejected plaintiff\u2019s contention on the merits, holding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-5\">The evidence does not support a finding that the specifications were impossible of attainment and, therefore, does not support a finding that [Victory] expended effort in attempting to meet unattainable requirements. Neither does the evidence demonstrate a delay attributable to the fault of the government.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-6\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-7\">The evidence does establish that an additional testing requirement was imposed upon [Victory]. * * * However, * * * the testing was incomplete at the time of default and no data with respect thereto were ever delivered. Therefore, [plaintiff] is not entitled to an equitable adjustment for this requirement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">In this court, plaintiff asserts that the Board erred in denying reimbursement \u201cfor all of [Victory\u2019s] costs in producing the inventory.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> It is asserted that this claim is a proper one \u201cfor application of the \u2018total cost\u2019 method for measurement of the equitable adjustment which should be included in valuing the inventory\u201d, and that the Board\u2019s \u201cfailure to apply this method was contrary to law.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Alternatively, however, plaintiff contends that the Board\u2019s valuation of the Plain-view and Taffet inventories as \u201chardware\u201d was unsupported by substantial evidence and legally erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">One of plaintiff\u2019s thrusts is that the Board erred in excusing the \u201cGovernment\u2019s six month delay until 25 January 1965 in approving the preproduction models on the ground that Victory did not complete its test data submission until 9 December 1964.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The import of this line of argument is that submission of complete test data was \u201cheld up [solely] because of Victory\u2019s continued efforts to meet * * * specifications impossible of attainment * * *.\"<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> As plaintiff advances the contention, it is unsound.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-18\">The Board found that Victory failed to submit data unrelated to frequency drift until December 1964. It also found no indication in the record that \u201csubmission of these data was in any way dependent upon the submission of data pertaining to drift.\u201d These findings are not shown to be unsupported by substantial evidence. Further, while the Board did not explicitly allude to \u201cRadio Interference Suppression\u201d problems<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> in this connection, plaintiff makes no showing that the data included in Victory\u2019s December 1964 submission was in any way dependent upon the submission of data pertaining to such problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-19\">In these circumstances, the Board\u2019s conclusion that conditional approval of the preproduction samples on January 25, 1965, was not untimely cannot be deemed to be unsupported by substantial evidence or legally erroneous. Electronic &amp; Missile Facilities, Inc. v. United States, <em>supra; </em>J. A. Jones Constr. Co. v. United States, 395 F.2d 783, 184 Ct.Cl. 1 (1968). It is, therefore, final and conclusive here.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-20\">Plaintiff\u2019s argument that all costs involved in the production of the inventory \u201cwere the direct result of the Government\u2019s failure to meet its contractual obligations\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> is sweeping, and insupportable. Without pause for reiteration of the circumstances in which the disfavored \u201ctotal cost\u201d approach may validly be utilized, it is in any event crystal . clear from a careful consideration of the administrative record and plaintiff\u2019s arguments that the Board did not err in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>refusing to countenance such an approach to the inventory problem in this case. <em>Cf. </em>Law v. United States, 195 Ct. Cl. 370 (1971); Boyajian v. United States, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Still to be assayed in the light of plaintiff\u2019s strenuous challenges to them are, however, other \u201cfindings\u201d of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The Board \u201cfound\u201d that the evidence did not establish that \u201cthe specifications were impossible of attainment,\u201d or that Victory had \u201cengaged in a fruitless attempt to meet a specification impossible of attainment\u201d; it saw no proof of expenditure of effort in attempting to meet unattainable requirements; and concluded that \u201cconsequently, no costs were incurred which would here authorize an increase in price.\u201d For reasons which follow, the Board thereby erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">The administrative decision concedes that \u201cIt is doubtful that the set as designed could meet the specification limits [as to frequency drift] on band 3.\u201d Defendant, with good reason, makes no effort to controvert the concession. Indeed, the administrative record abundantly shows that the quoted sentence is a gross understatement of the actual situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">Defendant\u2019s \u201cteam leader\u201d for Victory\u2019s RT-77 contract (and Maxwell\u2019s, too) admitted that the Band 3 frequency drift requirements were modified in the subsequent Maxwell contract because the RT-77, as designed, was having difficulty meeting specification requirements in this respect. He then testified that without those revisions to the specification requirements, the \u201cdrift problem * * just couldn\u2019t be met * * Not until Action VI to TAR 17, dated January 25, 1965, however, was the \u201cmatter of fixing permissible limits for frequency drift * * * deferred * * *.\"<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">Moreover, Action VI to TAR 17 also stated that Victory\u2019s preproduction sample</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-12\">* * * was subjected to the Radio Interference Suppression Test * *. The sample has failed to meet the requirements of this specification, however, <em>because of the extensive redesign </em>* * * <em>to enable the equipment to meet the requirements, </em>no redesign of the equipment is authorized on this contract. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-17\">The \u201cteam leader\u201d described this part of Action VI as a decision to drop the contractual requirement for the Radio Interference Suppression test because the set as designed could not meet the specification requirements. And, he testified that one of the basic reasons for holding up Victory\u2019s preproduction samples until January 25, 1965, was this same, then dropped, test.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-18\">Accordingly, the Board\u2019s \u201cfindings\u201d that the evidence failed to establish that the specifications were impossible of attainment, and \u201ctherefore\u201d did not show that effort had been expended in attempting to meet unattainable requirements, are \u201carbitrary and unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d United Contractors v. United States, 368 F.2d 585, 601-602, 177 Ct.Cl. 151, 172-173 (1966). Plaintiff is entitled to be paid \u201cthe increased costs and expenses which [Victory] incurred in attempting to comply with\u201d such requirements. Maxwell Dynamometer Co. v. United States, 386 F.2d 855, 872, 181 Ct.Cl. 607, 634 (1967); Hol-Gar Mfg. Co. v. United States, 360 F.2d 634, 175 Ct.Cl. 518 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-19\">Defendant\u2019s effort to distinguish <em>Hol-Gar, </em>and other cases applying that holding, fails. Its argument that the \u201cfindings\u201d of the Board are supported by substantial evidence overlooks the contents of the administrative record. Its implication that the absence of any written request to the contracting officer for an equitable adjustment based upon a constructive change somehow bars relief here is, in the circumstances of this case, manifestly untenable. <em>Cf. </em>Whittaker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>Corp. v. United States, 443 F.2d 1373, 195 Ct.Cl. 161 (1971). Finally, its observation that the Board considered and denied on the merits \u201cthis aspect of plaintiff\u2019s claim\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> is an accurate one, but that denial is, for reasons stated, of no avail to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">The Board\u2019s treatment of the additional testing requirement admittedly imposed upon Victory by Action VI to TAR 17 must also be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The Board noted that by Action VI to TAR 17, Victory was required to conduct a testing program to establish data to fix the permissible limits of frequency drift acceptable in production units to be delivered, and that this testing was \u201cincomplete at the time of default.\u201d It denied recovery for Victory\u2019s efforts toward compliance with the additional testing requirement, however, on the stated ground that \u201cthe testing was <em>incomplete </em>at the time of default and no data with respect thereto were ever delivered.\u201d (Emphasis supplied). This holding is erroneous as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">The Board\u2019s opinion is consistent only with the conclusion that defendant had imposed, and the finding that Victory had partially complied with, a new contractual requirement. An equitable adjustment for the \u201cactual change\u201d thus effected is not to be entirely denied simply because the new obligation had not been fully performed at contract termination.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">In sum, the stated bases for the Board\u2019s denial of an equitable adjustment for what it recognized as an allegation of \u201cimpossibility of performance amounting to a constructive change\u201d, and for \u201cadditional testing requirements\u201d, are defective under Wunderlich Act criteria, and are, therefore reversed. The question of the equitable adjustment due plaintiff for the \u201cconstructive\u201d and \u201cactual\u201d changes must, however, be deferred; futher administrative proceedings on that question are required. United States v. Anthony Grace &amp; Sons, 384 U.S. 424, 86 S.Ct. 1539, 16 L.Ed.2d 662 (1966); United States v. Utah Constr. &amp; Mining Co., 384 U.S. 394, 86 S.Ct. 1545, 16 L.Ed.2d 642 (1966); Maxwell Dynamometer Co. v. United States, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-14\">B. The \u201cHardware\u201d Aspect of the Inventory Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b143-15\">Having concluded that plaintiff was not entitled to an equitable adjustment because of governmental delays or changes, the Board determined that the value of Victory\u2019s contract inventory taken by defendant subsequent to default termination was $258,639.08. In reaching that composite sum for inventory at Victory\u2019s Plainview plant, at Miles, and at Taffet, the Board necessarily resolved a number of conflicts as to both \u201ccount\u201d and value. 1. The Plainview Inventory</p>\n<p id=\"b143-16\">The government evaluation of this inventory was $172,868. Plaintiff claimed administratively that, even computed on the basis of the government \u201ccount\u201d the fair and reasonable value of the Plain-view inventory was $258,497.26. The difference between the two claimed values, the Board said, was \u201cfound partly in costs associated with labor, G&amp;A and overhead applied to tasks of converting components into assemblies.\u201d The Board concluded that such costs should be considered in valuing the inventory taken, and stated that \u201cwe do so consider them here.\u201d The Board opinion then states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-17\">* * * Although [plaintiff] should be allowed a part of the difference between the Government valuation of the Plainview inventory and [plaintiff\u2019s valuation] * * * upon all the evidence [plaintiff] is not entitled to the' entire amount of that difference. We believe a reduction of 20% applied to [plaintiff\u2019s] figure to be appropriate and, accordingly, for the inventory taken at Plainview we allow the sum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>of $206,798.81. This sum includes $400 for each of nine sets [not assembled at the time the inventory was taken, and therefore not completed supplies to be valued at the contract unit price of $464.99]; the inclusion of some labor and overhead in the valuation of completed assemblies, and a reduction from the actual cost of purchased components when they are subsequently priced as miscellaneous manufacturing materials of undetermined condition, or as surplus hardware of undetermined market value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">Plaintiff contends that each of the grounds cited by the Board in support of the 20 percent reduction of the amount claimed for the Plainview inventory is \u201cwithout merit and the finding based thereon is contrary to law.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Specifically, plaintiff first' asserts that the disassembled state of the nine sets was attributable to the additional testing requirement imposed by Action VI to TAR 17, and that the Board\u2019s failure to allow the contract unit price is therefore legally erroneous. While the Board did find that this \u201ctesting was incomplete at the time of default\u201d, the precise reason for the state of the sets at time of inventory was not made the subject of a finding, and defendant alleges an absence of evidence that that state was attributable to compliance with Action VI to TAR 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">It seems neither necessary nor desirable presently to explore this treacherous area. <em>Cf. </em>Whittaker Corp. v. United States, <em>supra. </em>Further administrative proceedings relating to the testing requirement are in any event required; in such proceedings, the Board should make sufficient findings of fact from which to determine whether or not its allowance for the nine complete but not assembled sets needs revision. If so, the Board should also specify the extent of that revision.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">Plaintiff also forcefully (and with some plausibility) attacks the other factors which led to the Board\u2019s reduction; defendant as forcefully cries \u201cjury verdict.\u201d See Phillips Constr. Co., Inc. v. United States, <em>supra. </em>The fact of the matter is that in its present state the Board opinion on the reduction is so elusive as to render a review under applicable standards little more than a guess, if not an outright gamble.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Moreover, the result reached in Part II A, <em>supra, </em>conceivably could affect the Board\u2019s Plain-view hardware evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-11\">In these circumstances, and in view of the necessity for further administrative proceedings directed to other issues, the fairest and most reasonable course is to pretermit decision on the propriety of the Plainview inventory reduction in its entirety, in order that the Board may have an opportunity to spell out, if it chooses, the rationale of the Plainview inventory valuation, and, if it chooses, to revise it. If this does not lead to a satisfactory administrative disposition of the issue, it will then at least facilitate a reasoned decision respecting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-12\">2. The Taffet inventory</p>\n<p id=\"AsL\">The Board found that 2,035 shell covers, and 2,035 shell cases, had been shipped to Taffet, at Victory\u2019s instance, for processing and transshipment to Victory; that in 1967, at Taffet, defendant \u201ctook possession of 573 unprocessed shell covers and 1,643 unprocessed shell cases\u201d; that, in June 1966, when defendant\u2019s representatives \u201cfirst attempted to take possession of the inventory at Taffet * * * they saw what purported to be work in process belonging to [Victory] which was not seen or picked up in 1967 * * * \u201d; that neither the nature of the work in process, its extent, nor its disposition had been established; and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>Taffet was performing for Victory \u201cwork * * * in panels and sheet metal which was not related to the processing of the cases and covers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Noting the testimony of Taffet\u2019s president that the difference between the number of covers and cases shipped to Taffet and the number \u201cpicked up by the Government [in 1967] represents those cases and covers which were processed and shipped to [Victory]\u201d, the Board stated that \u201cWe accept the count of the Government * * It allowed therefor a total of $10,516.84.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Plaintiff, in substance reiterating the argument also made to the Board, asserts that by virtue of the contract Progress Payments clause, defendant \u201chad title to this material * * * when the bankruptcy occurred\u201d, and in June 1966 \u201caccepted and took delivery of such material\u201d.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Thus, plaintiff contends, defendant \u201cwas thereafter responsible for the fate of such inventory.\u201d <footnotemark>47</footnotemark> A January 1967 government memorandum which quotes Taffet\u2019s president as saying that Victory materials were then being shipped by Taffet to another government contractor producing the RT-77 is stressed. The import of all this, plaintiff urges, is that the fair value of \u201cpartially processed cases and covers\u201d at Taffet in June 1966 was considerably more than the Board allowed.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s contention that defendant took possession of the Taffet inventory in June 1966, and thereafter was responsible for any loss, need not be reached. While the Board opinion suggests an implicit rejection of plaintiff\u2019s position, it in any event suffices presently to hold that plaintiff has failed to establish that the Board\u2019s \u201ccount\u201d was in any way arbitrary, capricious, unsupported by substantial evidence, or legally erroneous.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Accordingly, the administrative determinations, both of quantities and values, of the Taffet inventory are here binding.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-14\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b145-15\">\n<em>Defendant\u2019s Motions (A) to Dismiss Count I and (B) for Judgment on its Counterclaim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AR5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b145-16\">Defendant observes that Count I of the amended petition, while purporting to assert a claim for breach of contract, \u201cis for the identical relief and is based upon the identical basic facts as those alleged in Count II.\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Relying upon La Crosse Garment Mfg. Co. v. United States, 432 F.2d 1377, 193 Ct.Cl. 168 (1970); Marley v. United States, 423 F.2d 324, 191 Ct.Cl. 205 (1970), and other decisions of this court, defendant contends that complete redress for the claims pleaded in Count I was available administratively, and that the claims may not, therefore, be converted by redescription into breach claims to be tried <em>de novo. </em>In consequence, defendant concludes, \u201cplaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>first cause of action no longer exists\u201d, and Count I must accordingly be dismissed.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s reply brief is not really responsive to this argument; it asserts only that since no motion is pending with respect to Count I, no purpose would be served by discussion of this contention. Plaintiff errs. Defendant\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment incorporates a plea that Count I be dismissed. That plea must be, and is, granted. Northbridge Electronics, Inc. v. United States, <em>supra; </em>Briscoe v. United States, 442 F.2d 953, 194 Ct.Cl. 866 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Despite an unappealed default termination, plaintiff sought and received \u201cfull [administrative] consideration of a subsequent dispute resulting from the inability of the parties to agree upon the payment due when the Government following * * * default, elected] to take possession of finished items and manufacturing materials.\u201d The Board, \u201cconsidering plaintiff\u2019s claims to be within its competence, entertained them all and made such awards as it deemed warranted by the evidence.\u201d Northbridge Electronics, Inc. v.

It is clear, and both parties recognize, that the validity of the counterclaim depends entirely on the resolution of plaintiff\u2019s claims. Since, as hereinabove held, further administrative proceedings are necessary to such a resolution, defendant\u2019s motion for judgment in its favor on its counterclaim is presently premature, and the said motion is accordingly denied without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b146-11\">For the foregoing reasons, it is concluded that plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Count II of the amended petition is granted, to the extent hereinabove indicated, but otherwise denied; that defendant\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment on Count II is granted, to the extent hereinabove indicated, but otherwise denied; that defendant\u2019s motion for judgment in its favor on its counterclaim is denied; that defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss Count I of the amended petition is granted and Count I is dismissed; and that further proceedings herein are stayed for a period of 6 months pursuant to (and subject to the terms of) Rule 167 to afford the parties an opportunity to obtain an administrative resolution of the amount of the equitable adjustment to which plaintiff is entitled.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b132-7\">.

This sum resulted from application, to defendant\u2019s \u201ccount\u201d, of the cost set forth in the purchase order under which the contract materials had been shipped to Taffet. The Board discounted evidence of some $29,000 in progress payments by Victory to Taffet, and Taffet\u2019s proof of claim in- bankruptcy (some $57,000), apparently on the ground that Taffet was performing for Victory work, of \u201cindiscernible extent and disposition\u201d, \u201cunrelated to the modification of shells and cases.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"46\">\n<p id=\"b145-9\">.

Plaintiff admits a failure to prove how many of the processed materials covered by Victory progress payments to Taffet had been delivered to Victory prior to bankruptcy and how many were still at Taffet in June 1966. Moreover, interestingly, if strangely, the January 1967 memorandum cited by plaintiff as showing a post-June 1966 diversion of Victory materials to another government contractor also shows that prior to Victory\u2019s bankruptcy Taffet had received from Victory 1,643 cases and 573 covers, the precise quantities \u201cpicked up\u201d later in 1967. There is evidence that the cases and covers \u201cpicked up\u201d were not those originally shipped to Taffet as Victory materials, but were \u201cexactly similar\u201d to them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"50\">\n<p id=\"b145-18\">.
