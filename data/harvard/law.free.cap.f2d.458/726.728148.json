Before the second injunction was entered, defendant was selling, or giving away, clips for use in mounting combination sash balance and weatherstrip units in window frames. After the injunction was entered, the district court appointed a special master to ascertain plaintiff\u2019s damages. He found that $17,500 represented a reasonable royalty. The district court ruled that plaintiff\u2019s recovery should have been measured by defendant\u2019s profits and increased the award to $34,950.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-10\">Defendant appeals, contending that the recovery should be measured by plaintiff\u2019s damages, which were nominal at best. Plaintiff cross-appeals, contending that he should recover (1) a reasonable royalty of $176,801 based on defendant\u2019s profits of $289,792 on its sale of the combination units, since the clips were used as a promotional item; (2) punitive damages, since the infringement was deliberate; and (3) costs. We think the master earned his fee of $6,250 and that the litigation should be terminated by the entry of judgment for $17,500 as he recommended.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-15\">We shall state briefly our reasons for rejecting the various alternative results which the parties discussed in their briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-16\">1. <em>Recovery of defendant\u2019s profits.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b785-17\">Relying on Zysset v. Popeil Brothers, Inc., 318 F.2d 701, 705-708 (7th Cir. 1963), cert. denied, 376 U.S. 913, 84 S.Ct. 658, 11 L.Ed.2d 610, the district court held that plaintiff\u2019s recovery should be measured by \u201cthe amount of profit realized by the infringer.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He therefore increased the amount of the award to $34,950 without disturbing any of the findings of fact which underlay the master\u2019s calculation of $17,500 as a reasonable royalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-18\"><em>Zysset </em>does support the district court\u2019s determination, but the import of that case is necessarily qualified by the Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent opinion in <em>Aro II:</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In Part IV of that opinion, Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>Justice Brennan plainly stated that the Act of August 1, 1946, 60 Stat. 778, changed the preexisting law which had allowed a patentee to recover the infringer\u2019s profits as well as his own damages.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He cited with approval our decision in Ric-Wil Co. v. E. B. Kaiser Co., 179 F.2d 401, 407 (7th Cir. 1950) as supporting his conclusion that the purpose of the 1946 change \u201cwas precisely to eliminate the recovery of profits as such and allow recovery of damages only. . . . [I]t is clear that under the present statute only damages are recoverable.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b786-16\">In some situations the infringer\u2019s profits may constitute evidence tending to prove the amount of plaintiff\u2019s damages, <em>cf. </em>Bigelow v. R.K.O. Radio Pictures, 327 U.S. 251, 257-258, 260, 66 S.Ct. 574, 90 L.Ed. 652,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> or be a relevant factor in the calculation of a reasonable royalty.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The portions of the <em>Zysset </em>opinion which recognized that profits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>may be admissible evidence on the damage issue are therefore consistent with the holding of <em>Aro II. </em>However, to the extent that <em>Zysset </em>holds or implies that the infringer\u2019s profits are themselves recoverable regardless of the extent of the patentee\u2019s actual damages, that case is inconsistent with the 1946 statute as construed in <em>Aro II </em>and is accordingly overruled.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">In this case the master found that the plaintiff had not proven the amount of profits lost by him as a result of defendant\u2019s infringement. The defendant\u2019s profits were not used as a yardstick to measure plaintiff\u2019s own damages on the theory that plaintiff would have enjoyed those earnings if there had been no infringement. Without findings of fact supporting such a theory, the master therefore properly refused to allow a recovery of defendant\u2019s profits, and the district court\u2019s modification of his award was error.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">2. <em>Nominal damages.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">Defendant argues that plaintiff may never recover a reasonable royalty without proving that he was in fact damaged by the infringement. Defendant contends that plaintiff could not, in any event, have sold the infringing clips because they embodied a feature of defendant\u2019s patent. Although the facts are disputed, we assume <em>arguendo </em>that plaintiff suffered no actual damages in the form of lost sales; we hold that he is nevertheless entitled to recover a reasonable royalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">Defendant\u2019s argument to the contrary is based on <em>Aro II. </em>In that case Mr. Justice Brennan expressly refuted the assumption that if Aro was an infringer, it would necessarily be liable for a reasonable royalty. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-10\">\u201cIt is presumably the language \u2018in no event less than a reasonable royalty\u2019 that has led to the assumption noted above. But that assumption ignores the fact \u2014 clear from the language, the legislative history, and the prior law \u2014that the statute allows the award of a reasonable royalty, or of any other recovery, only if such amount constitutes \u2018damages\u2019 for the infringement. It also ignores the important distinction between \u2018damages\u2019 and \u2018profits,\u2019 and the relevance of this distinction to the 1946 amendment of the statute.\u201d 377 U.S. at 504-505, 84 S.Ct. at 1542.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABcJ\">That statement must be read in context. Aro was a contributory infringer, not a direct infringer. The contributory infringement consisted of Aro\u2019s sales of unpatented convertible tops to the direct infringer\u2019s customers. The patentee could not lawfully have exacted a royalty from Aro on those sales, even if they had been made to licensees rather than to direct infringers. See 377 U.S. at 507-508, 84 S.Ct. 1526. Accordingly, that contributory infringement did not cause the patentee any damage in the form of lost royalties which it was entitled to receive from Aro.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-11\">The patentee was, however, entitled to full compensation for the direct infringement. As Mr. Justice Brennan interpreted the record, it appeared that a settlement payment of $73,000 by Ford on account of sales prior to July 21, 1955, and an agreement to pay royalties on account of subsequent sales, almost certainly provided the patentee with such full compensation. On those facts, apart from the remote possibility that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>the pre-1955 damages exceeded $73,000, there could be no basis for any recovery from Aro as a contributory infringer.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\"><em>Aro II </em>is therefore consistent with our view that deprivation of royalty income which a patentee is entitled to receive from one who practices his invention constitutes a form of damages compensable under \u00a7 284 of the Patent Code.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> If the patentee is a manufacturer, he may prove his damages by evidence of lost sales and profits. But if such proof is inadequate, or if he does not himself sell the product, he may nevertheless be injured by the unlicensed practice of his invention. The reasonable royalty which he might lawfully have collected from the infringer if he had been a licensee may then be the measure of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">In this case the special master\u2019s calculation of a reasonable royalty of $17,-500 was completely consistent with this analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">3. <em>Damages based on the sale of combination units.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">Plaintiff contended that a reasonable royalty should be at least 250% of the net sales price of defendant\u2019s infringing clips. He argued that the clips were used to promote the sale of combination weatherstrip and sash balance units. The master found, however, that the plaintiff had failed to prove that the decline in his sales of combination units was attributable to defendant\u2019s infringement,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and that the evidence relative to the sale of combination units was of no probative value in showing what a willing buyer would pay, or a willing seller would accept, for a license to make, use and sell the infringing clips.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The district court accepted the master\u2019s findings on this issue. Accordingly, we find no basis for disagreeing with the master\u2019s refusal to compute the royalty rate on the basis of defendant\u2019s profits on the sale of combination units.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-11\">4. <em>Punitive damages.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b788-12\">The master rejected plaintiff\u2019s request for treble damages. He found \u201cthat defendant was justified in challenging the validity of plaintiff\u2019s patent, as demonstrated by the Court of Appeals decision holding claims 1, 3 and 4 of the patent invalid. . . . \u201d (A. 211) The district court agreed. We are satisfied that this appraisal of the litigation was well within the district court\u2019s and the master\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-15\">5. <em>Costs.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b788-16\">The question of costs is squarely covered by the last paragraph of <em>Zysset, </em>which holds that the mandatory language of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 288 means exactly what it says. 318 F.2d at 708. We again reaffirm that holding. See Bishman Mfg. Co. v. Stewart-Warner Corp., 380 F.2d 336, 340 (7th Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-17\">The judgment of the district court is reversed and the case is remanded for the entry of judgment in the amount of $17,500 as recommended in the special master\u2019s report. Each party shall bear his own costs on this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b785-12\">. See Zegers, Inc. v. Zegers, 299 F.2d 769 (7th Cir. 1962), cert. denied, 369 U.S. 889, 82 S.Ct. 1163, 8 L.Ed.2d 289; Zegers v. Zegers, Inc., 365 F.2d 156 (7th Cir. 1966), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 948, 87 S.Ct. 320, 17 L.Ed.2d 226.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b785-13\">. A. 222. More precisely, the district court held that plaintiff should recover a rea-onable royalty measured by defendant\u2019s entire profits from its disposition of infringing clips. Under the facts as found by the master, however, the court\u2019s holding was the practical equivalent of allowing recovery of the profits themselves.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b785-19\">. Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co., 377 U.S. 476, 84 S.Ct. 1526, 12 L.Ed.2d 457. Part IV of that opinion, 377 U.S. at 502-513, 84 S.Ct. 1526, is most directly relevant to the issues presented here. Only four members of the Court, Justices Brennan, Stewart, White and Goldberg, expressly joined that part of the opinion. Mr. Justice Harlan having indicated that the damage issues were not yet ripe for decision. However, the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Black, with whom the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Douglas, and Mr. Justice Clark joined, would appear to accept the reasoning of Part IV of Mr. Justice Brennan\u2019s opinion. See 377 U.S. at 523, 84 S.Ct. 1526.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b786-4\">. \u201cProfits and damages have traditionally been all-inclusive as the two basic elements of recovery. Prior to 1946, the statutory precursor of the present \u00a7 284 allowed recovery of both amounts, reading as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-5\">\u2018[U]pon a decree being rendered in any such case for an infringement the complainant shall be entitled to recover, in addition to the profits to be accounted for by the defendant, the damages the complainant has sustained thereby. . . .\u2019 R.S. \u00a7 4921, as amended, 42 Stat. 392.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">By the 1946 amendment, Act of August 1, 1946, c. 726, \u00a7 1, 60 Stat. 778, 35 U.S.C. (1946 ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 67, 70, the statute was changed to approximately its present form, whereby only \u2018damages\u2019 are recoverable. The purpose of the change was precisely to eliminate the recovery of profits as such and allow recovery of damages only.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-8\">\u2018The object of the bill is to make the basis of recovery in patent-infringement suits general damages, that is, any damages the complainant can prove, not less than a reasonable royalty, together with interest from the time infringement occurred, rather than profits and damages.\u2019 H.R.Rep.No.1587, 79th Cong., 2d Sess. (1946), to accompany H.R. 5311, at 1-2; S.Rep.No.1503, 79th Cong., 2d Sess. (1946), to accompany H.R. 5311, at 2.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-9\">There can be no doubt that the amendment succeeded in effectuating this purpose; it is clear that under the present statute only damages are recoverable.\u201d 377 U.S. at 505-506, 84 S.Ct. at 1542.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b786-10\">. <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cPart IV of the majority decision in \u2018Aro II\u2019 should be regarded as the definitive case law on patent damages.\u201d Shur, Patent Enforcement, Misuse and Antitrust, p. 879.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b786-11\">. As this court said in Ric-Wil Co. v. E. B. Kaiser Co.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-13\">\u201cThe language [of the 1946 change] appears to make it plain that profits realized by an infringer are not recoverable as such. \u2018General damages\u2019 is a broad term, which no doubt may include numerous elements depending upon the circumstances of the case. And whether an infringer\u2019s profit is an element of such damages depends upon the facts of each individual ease.\u201d 179 F.2d 401, 407 (1950).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-18\">As Mr. Justice Brennan noted in Aro II, 377 U.S. at 506, 84 S.Ct. at 1542 before the 1946 change, it was \u201c \u2018immaterial that the profits made by the defendant would not have been made by the plaintiff.\u2019 3 Walker, Patents (Deller ed. 1937), \u00a7 845, at 2186.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b786-19\">. It would, of course, be most unlikely that a licensee would be willing to pay 100% of his profits to the patentee in exchange for a license. Thus, permitting evidence of profits to be admitted to show what a willing purchaser of a license might be expected to pay as a royalty is quite different from using profits as the measure of damages. In this case the district court purported to use the infringer\u2019s profits as the measure of a reasonable royalty; the practical effect of that holding was to allow the profits themselves to be recovered because the findings did not support the conclusion that a licensee would pay a patentee his entire profits from the disposition of infringing clips. See Georgia-Pacific Corp. v. U. S. Plywood-Champion Papers, Inc., 446 F.2d 295 (2d Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 870, 92 S.Ct. 105, 30 L.Ed.2d 114. In that case, after affirming by implication a district court decision that an infringer\u2019s profits did not constitute a proper measure of damages, 243 F.Supp. 500 (S.D.N.Y.1965), the court specifically held it was a basic error to fix a reasonable royalty which did not allow the infringer \u201ca reasonable profit after paying the suppositious royalty.\u201d 446 F.2d at 299.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b787-12\">. Since this opinion overrules Zysset v. Popeil Brothers, Inc., 318 F.2d 701 (7th Cir. 1963), we have circulated the opinion to the active members of the court not on the panel. A majority of the court has voted not to rehear <em>en lane </em>the matter of overruling <em>Zysset.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b787-13\">. Furthermore, the facts from which the infringer\u2019s \u201cprofits\u201d could be computed\u2014 and were computed by the district court \u2014 \u2022 were before the master and considered by him. Though he did not squarely discuss the issue in terms of \u201cprofits,\u201d in finding 21 he used the facts to compute a \u201cnet sales value\u201d to defendants of $33,309, which is only slightly less than the district court\u2019s determination of $34,950 profit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b788-8\">. This is certainly a fair reading of the statutory language. Section 284 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-9\">\u201cUpon a finding for the claimant the court shall award the claimant damages adequate to compensate for the infringement, but in no event less than a reasonable royalty for the use made of the invention by the infringer, together with interest and costs as fixed by the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b788-18\">. The master identified other factors, such as the injunction against plaintiff\u2019s infringement of defendant\u2019s patent, as explaining plaintiff\u2019s loss of business.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b788-19\">. The record indicated that neither of the parties would have granted a license to the other; the license from the plaintiff would have permitted a third party to sell clips embodying plaintiff\u2019s press-in feature but not the hooks covered by defendant\u2019s patent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
