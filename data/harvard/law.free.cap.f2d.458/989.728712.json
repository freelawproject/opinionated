In order to induce White to move the location of its business as a Ford dealer to more adequate facilities in a better neighborhood at 6600 North Broad Street, Philadelphia, Ford undertook to pay White $59,290.00 in a lump sum \u201cfor leasehold improvements and eligible premises assistance . as an incentive to complete this relocation in June 1965.\u201d White challenges the decision of the Tax Court that the payment of the above amount to it was taxable income under Section 61(a) of the 1954 Internal Revenue Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-10\">After careful consideration of the record, the briefs of counsel and oral argument, we have concluded that the decision of the Tax Court should be affirmed.
