The loan was guaranteed to the extent of 75% by the Small Business Administration (SBA) pursuant to the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(a)) and its implementing regulations (13 C.F.R. 122.10). In order to secure the loan the parties also entered into a security agreement set forth on a form provided by SBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">Section D of the security agreement bears the heading \u201cCOLLATERAL,\u201d and subsection D.l, thereunder, states: \u201cThe security interest is granted in the following collateral: Describe collateral.\u201d In the space provided for the description appears the typed statement: \u201cSee EQUIPMENT LIST attached hereto and made a part hereof, describing equipment, furniture and fixtures located at Moore and Edmond stores.\u201d A two-page list of equipment, furniture and fixtures, was attached to the security agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">Subsection D.2 of the section on \u201cCOLLATERAL\u201d directs the parties to \u201cClassify goods under (one or more of) the following Uniform Commercial Code categories,\u201d and contains five boxes labeled respectively \u201cConsumer Goods,\u201d \"Equipment (business use),\u201d \u201cInventory,\u201d \u201cAccounts Receivable,\u201d and \u201cContract Rights.\u201d All of these boxes except for the first one were checked.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-10\">Three days after entering into the security agreement, the Bank properly filed a financing statement which stated that it covered, \u201cThe following, now owned and hereafter acquired, located at Moore and Edmond stores: All machinery and equipment, furniture and fixtures, inventory and proceeds, accounts receivable and contract rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b760-11\">Approximately 18 months after the security agreement was executed and with a balance of $19,672.70 due on the loan, the debtors filed a voluntary bankruptcy petition. The Bank assigned its rights under the note and security agreement to SBA, and SBA filed its proof of a secured claim with the trustee in bankruptcy. The trustee objected to SBA\u2019s claim insofar as it asserted a security interest in any tangible or intangible property of the debtors other than the equipment listed on the pages attached to the security agreement, and the issue was heard by the bankruptcy referee. At this hearing the vice-president of the Bank who handled the loan was permitted to testify, over the trustee\u2019s objection, that it was the Bank\u2019s intention to take a security interest in inventory, accounts receivable, and contract rights, in addition to the items set forth in the equipment list. The referee found that SBA had an enforceable security interest in all of the items included in its claim. On review the District Court, 324 F.Supp. 1029, vacated the referee\u2019s order, concluding that the security agreement was unambiguous, that parol evidence to explain it was, thus, inadmissible, and that under the unambiguous terms SBA\u2019s security interest was limited to the items specifically enumerated in the list attached to the security agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-12\">On appeal SBA claims that a security interest in inventory, accounts receivable, and contract rights was granted to the Bank by virtue of the check marks appearing in boxes bearing those labels in subsection D.2 of the security agreement. The terms of the financing statement and the testimony of the Bank\u2019s vice-president are invoked as extrinsic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>evidence supporting SBA\u2019s construction of the security agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">While Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code has stripped the formal requirements for creation of a security interest to the bone, certain minimal requirements must still be observed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 12A Okl.St.Ann. \u00a7 9-203(1) (b) states that a non-possessory security interest is not enforceable against either the debtor or third parties unless, \u201cthe debtop has signed a security agreement which contains a description of the collateral . . ..\u201d 12A Okl.St.Ann. \u00a7 9-105(1) (h) supplies further explication by defining the term \u201csecurity agreement\u201d as \u201c. . .an agreement which creates or provides for a security interest.\u201d Cases and treatises construing these two sections have almost uniformly come to the conclusion that in order for a security agreement to be effective it must contain language which specifically creates or grants a security interest in the collateral described.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cWhile there are no magic words which create a security interest there must be language in the instrument which \u2018leads to the logical conclusion that it was the intention of the parties that a security interest be created.\u2019\u201d Evans v. Everett, 279 N.C. 352, 183 S.E.2d 109, 113 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">Section D.1 of the security agreement in this case contains language which explicitly grants or creates a security interest in the collateral to which it refers. An examination of the agreement, however, leads to the inevitable conclusion that these \u201cwords of grant\u201d refer only to the items alluded to in the space provided below section D.l, and specifically enumerated in the list attached to the agreement. The language appearing in section D.l does not refer or apply to the classifications of collateral listed in section D.2, and the latter section contains no language of its own which may be read as granting or creating a security interest. Section D.2 was clearly included only as a means of classifying collateral otherwise described for purposes such as determining the proper place for the filing of financing statements. See 12A Okl.St.Ann. \u00a7 9-109, and official comment 1. It cannot reasonably be interpreted as expressing the parties\u2019 intention to extend the description of collateral referred to by the words of grant appearing elsewhere in the agreement. \u201cA long and complex security agreement ... as herein should not have the purpose or effect of concealing a description of the collateral. . [A]nyone who examines the agreement should not be required to read and interpret all of the fine print at his peril. He would only be interested in the collateral, as clearly designated by the form itself.\u201d In re Radabaugh, 4 UCC Rep.Serv. 355, 357 (S.D.Ohio 1966) (Referee\u2019s opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-18\">The fact that the parties signed and filed a financing statement which covered inventory, accounts re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>ceivable, and contract rights, in addition to equipment, furniture, and fixtures, is of no consequence to our decision. The function of a financing statement is to put third parties on notice that the secured party who has filed it may have a perfected security interest in the collateral described. See 12A Okl.St.Ann. \u00a7 9-402 and official comment 2. Absent language which would constitute the debtor\u2019s grant of a security interest, a financing statement cannot serve as a security agreement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The financing statement in this case contained nothing more than was necessary to meet the minimum requirements of 12A Okl.St.Ann. \u00a7 9-402, and fulfill the purposes of notice filing; there is no contention to the contrary. Under these circumstances, it cannot have the effect of enlarging the security agreement so as to create a security interest in collateral not described therein. In re Mann, 318 F.Supp. 32, 36 (W.D.Va.1970); In re Burkhard, 6 UCC Rep.Serv. 244, 247 (S.D.Ohio 1969) (Referee\u2019s opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">The security agreement form was provided by SBA for use of the Bank to describe the collateral in which a security interest was granted. If the instrument be ambiguous the Bank and SBA made it so, and they should not now be permitted to explain what is implicit in that which they failed to make explicit in the critical terms of the security agreement. The Code\u2019s requirements for the creation of security interests are simple and clearly set forth. Where forms to facilitate compliance with these requirements have been provided, the secured party ought to be able to fill in the blanks so as to avoid ambiguity with regard to the security interest granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">We think that section D.1 of the security agreement unambiguously describes the collateral in which the security interest was granted, and that section D.2 was designed only to allow classification of that same collateral. In these circumstances we agree with the District Court that parol evidence as to the parties' intentions was inadmissible. In any event, accepted canons of construction compel us to construe this instrument strictly against its drafters, and to conclude, as did the District Court, that the security interest granted was limited to the items specifically enumerated in the equipment list attached to the security agreement. The order is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b761-9\">. It is asserted that the validity of SBA\u2019s claim should be governed by federal rather than state law since the security agreement is on an SBA form and was entered into as part of a uniform federal program. See Clearfield Trust Co. v. United States, 318 U.S. 363, 63 S.Ct. 573, 87 L.Ed. 838 (1943); Cassidy Commission Co. v. United States, 387 F.2d 875 (10th Cir. 1967). It is agreed, however, that the Uniform Commercial Code provides the appropriate source of federal law. See United States v. Hext, 444 F.2d 804 (5th Cir. 1971). We, thus, rely on Oklahoma\u2019s version of the UCC, 12A Okl.St.Ann. \u00a7 1-101 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b761-14\">. See, <em>e. g., </em>DuBay v.
