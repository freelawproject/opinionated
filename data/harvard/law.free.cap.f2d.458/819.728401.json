The individuals with appellant were, according to the officers, \u201cin a kind of daze,\u201d \u201cin a sleepy type mood,\u201d \u201ctwitchy and a little nervous.\u201d Tr. at 18, 60. Officer Gaston testified that some of them exhibited traits symptomatic of drug addiction such as the \u201ccommon nod\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and appeared to act as \u201cif the stuff [was] . . . coming down on them.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He concluded that some of them seemed \u201cto be under the influence of narcotics at that particular time\u201d (Tr. at 33) and \u201cfrom [his] past experience in watching these type of people, they were the stereotype of what we call \u2018junkie\u2019.\u201d Tr. at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-17\">Leaving this group, appellant proceeded to a vacant lot several feet away where he encountered a \u201cvery well dressed\u201d man. Tr. at 34. According to the officers, whose views were unobstructed, both men, after furtively gazing about in a nervous and suspicious manner, struck a bargain at close range. Tr. at 19, 36. Appellant \u201cslid\u201d (Tr. at 19) an undetermined amount of paper currency to the second man, receiving in exchange a small brown package.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The officers did not immediately apprehend the two men due to traffic congestion in the area, however, after circling the block, Officer Gaston alighted from the car, produced identification, and announced that he was a policeman. Gas-ton, motioning to appellant, requested that he accompany him to the car. Whereupon, according to the narration at trial, appellant took several steps in the opposite direction and appeared \u201cas if he was just about to run.\u201d Tr. at 12.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>However, appellant was soon boxed in by Officer Wingfield who had alighted from the other side of the car. Officer Gaston then inquired of appellant what he had in his back pocket, and appellant responded, \u201cMy change purse.\u201d Tr. at 13, 42, 66. A subsequent search disclosed the change purse and the presence of 73 heroin capsules therein.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">The Fourth Amendment protection against search and seizure has been construed to require probable cause for warrantless arrests and searches. Henry v. United States, 361 U.S. 98, 80 S.Ct. 168, 4 L.Ed.2d 134 (1959). The contours and salient principles of probable cause have been faithfully catalogued in a surfeit of decisional law. Probable cause exists when known facts and circumstances are sufficient to warrant a man of reasonable prudence in the belief that an offense has been or is being committed. Beck v. Ohio, 379 U.S. 89, 91, 85 S.Ct. 223, 13 L.Ed.2d 142 (1964); Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 479, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963); Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132, 162, 45 S.Ct. 280, 69 L.Ed. 543 (1925). A significantly lower <em>quanta </em>of proof is required to establish probable cause than guilt. Draper v. United States, 358 U.S. 307, 311-312, 79 S.Ct. 329, 3 L.Ed.2d 327 (1959). Probable cause does not emanate from an antiseptic courtroom, a sterile library or a sacrosanct adytum, nor is it a pristine \u201cphilosophical concept existing in a vacuum,\u201d Bell v. United States, 102 U.S.App.D.C. 383, 386, 254 F.2d 82, 85 (1958), but rather it requires a pragmatic analysis of \u201ceveryday life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal technicians, act.\u201d Brinegar v. United States, 338 U.S. 160, 175, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 1310, 93 L.Ed. 1879 (1949). It is to be viewed from the vantage point of a prudent, reasonable, cautious police officer on the scene at the time of the arrest guided by his experience and training. Jackson v. United States, 112 U.S.App.D.C. 260, 302 F.2d 194 (1962). It is \u201ca plastic concept whose existence depends on the facts and circumstances of the particular case.\u201d Bailey v. United States, 128 U.S.App.D.C. 354, 357, 389 F.2d 305, 308 (1967). <em>See </em>McCray v. Illinois, 386 U.S. 300, 304, 87 S.Ct. 1056, 18 L.Ed.2d 62 (1967); Beck v. Ohio, <em>supra, </em>379 U.S. at 91, 85 S.Ct. 223; Brinegar v. United States, <em>supra, </em>338 U.S. at 175-176, 69 S.Ct. 1302. Because of the kaleidoscopic myriad that goes into the probable cause mix \u201cseldom does a decision in one case handily dispose of the next.\u201d Hinton v. United States, 137 U.S.App.D.C. 388, 391, 424 F.2d 876, 879 (1969). It is however the totality of these facts and circumstances which is the relevant consideration. Davis v. United States, 133 U.S.App. D.C. 172, 173, 409 F.2d 458, 459 (1969); Dixon v. United States, 111 U.S.App.D.C. 305, 306, 296 F.2d 427, 428 (1961). Viewed singly these factors may not be dispositive, yet when viewed in unison the puzzle may fit.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-14\"> Having considered the case at bar, we conclude that, although the factors viewed individually may not be dis-positive of the probable cause issue, their sum total dictates an only conclusion. The testifying officers, experienced and learned in their professions,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>related a number of highly suspicious circumstances surrounding the arrest to the court. Their individual experience reinforces our finding of probable cause and is a legitimate factor for consideration by this court. <em>See </em>United States v. Wabnik, 444 F.2d 203 (2nd Cir. 1971); Bell v. United States, <em>supra, </em>102 U.S.App.D.C. at 386-387, 254 F.2d at 85-86. As we indicated in Davis v. United States, <em>supra, </em>133 U.S.App.D.C. at 174, 409 F.2d at 460, \u201cconduct innocent in the eyes of the untrained may carry entirely different \u2018messages\u2019 to the experienced or trained observer.\u201d <em>See also </em>Bell v. United States, <em>supra, </em>102 U.S.App.D.C. at 387, 254 F.2d at 86; Jackson v. United States, <em>supra, </em>112 U.S.App.D.C. at 262-263, 302 F.2d at 196-197.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">The officers testified that they observed appellant in the company of several \u201cshabilly [sic] dressed\u201d individuals who appeared to be under the influence of narcotics. Clearly, this fact alone does not end our inquiry for we \u201chave never countenanced arrest by association.\u201d Hinton v. United States, <em>supra, </em>137 U.S.App.D.C. at 391, 424 F.2d at 879. Continuing their narration, the officers stated that appellant, nervously approaching an equally nervous well dressed man, stealthily \u201cslid\u201d money to the-second man in exchange for a small brown package. Surreptitious passing of a package has been recognized as a possible element in establishing the probable cause mix. <em>See </em>Draper v. United States, <em>supra, </em>358 U.S. 323, 79 S.Ct. 329 (Douglas, J., dissenting). Furthermore, there is some indication, admittedly unclear, in the record that appellant was attempting to flee the scene of the crime.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Although flight has been a legitimate factor in a finding of probable cause, Green v. United States, 104 U.S.App.D.C. 23, 25, 259 F.2d 180, 182 (1958), it has not been considered a \u201creliable indicator of guilt without other circumstances to make its import less ambiguous.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Hinton v. United States, <em>supra, </em>137 U.S.App.D.C. at 391, 424 F.2d at 879. A final factor in the instant mix is the geographical area of the crime. Although no presumption of guilt arises from the activities of inhabitants of an area in which the police know that narcotics offenses frequently occur, the syndrome of criminality in those areas cannot realistically go unnoticed by the judiciary. It too is a valid consideration when coupled with other reliable indicia or suspicious circumstances. <em>See </em>Munn v. United States, 283 A.2d 28 (D.C.App.1971); Peterkin v. United States, 281 A.2d 567 (D.C.App.1971). We make this statement warily, for it is all too clear that few live in these areas by choice. A delicate balance must be struck between the right of the often-victimized innocent ghetto inhabitant to adequate, unhampered police protection and the rights guaranteed to him under the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-10\">Viewing the total circumstances, judged in light of the officers\u2019 experience, we are of the opinion that there was a reasonable basis for their belief that a crime was being committed. We therefore conclude that the arrest was founded upon probable cause, thereby rendering the evidence admissible. Accordingly, the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"aal-dedup-0\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b878-7\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4704(a) (1964); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b878-9\">. The exclusionary rule announced in Weeks v. United States, 232 U.S. 383, 393, 34 S.Ct. 341, 58 L.Ed. 652 (1914), and enveloping state criminal actions within its penumbra in Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 655, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961), has been the subject of recent criticism. <em>See </em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Eed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U.S. 388, 411, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971) (Burger, C. J., dissenting). <em>See also </em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 29 L.Ed.2d 564 (1971).

Officer Gaston testified that this \u201cis the highest crime area there is.\u201d Tr. at 7, 9, 38.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b878-13\">. Well, what I mean by that is that some of them were in what we call the \u201ccommon nod.\u201d When you are under the influence of narcotics you tend to be, that is, lackluster, pretty close to an immobilized and you see the head goes up and down [s\u00bbo].</p>\n<p id=\"AHp\">Tr. at 34.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b878-20\">.

This is the type picture you have. This is what the people were like. Tr. at 10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b878-22\">.

Officer Gaston, a member of+the police force for approximately twelve months, had attended a training seminar given by the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs.
