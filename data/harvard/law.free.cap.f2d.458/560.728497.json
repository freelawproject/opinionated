We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">The relevant facts are not in dispute. In 1962, Thomas W. Shipp borrowed $10,000 from the Bank, securing the loan by a pledge of certain insurance policies on his life. In February 1963, involuntary bankruptcy proceedings were instituted against Shipp. Under authority of an order of the Referee in Bankruptcy the bank cashed the policies, retaining $3,560.76 after satisfying Shipp\u2019s indebtedness to it. This sum represented the remaining proceeds from the cash surrender value of the insurance policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">Notice of a federal tax lien against Shipp in excess of $200,000 was filed in the Register\u2019s Office of Shelby County, Tennessee, on October 23,1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-11\">On December 9, 1963, Shipp executed the following document:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-12\">\u201cFirst National Bank of Memphis</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6J\">Memphis, Tennessee</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-13\">\u201cRE: Thomas W. Shipp loan</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ari-dedup-0\">\u201cGentlemen:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-14\">\u201cI am advised that you have on deposit to my credit, the approximate amount of $3,560.00, representing funds realized from the sale, disposition and transaction with certain policies of insurance which secured my loan from the First National Bank of Memphis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-15\">\u201cThis will authorize you to pay such funds directly to E. J. Phelan for my account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-16\">\u201cThis the 9th day of December, 1963.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"abc-dedup-0\">\u201cYours very truly,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYg\">s/Thomas W. Shipp</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAtq\">THOMAS W. SHIPP\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-17\">The purpose of this transaction was to secure payment to Phelan and another attorney for legal services rendered and to be rendered in the bankruptcy proceedings and in a criminal prosecution brought against Shipp by the United States. The document was delivered to the Bank either on the day it is dated or on the following business day.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-18\">The Treasury Department served a levy on the Bank on April 6, 1964, to enforce the lien on Shipp\u2019s funds. The Bank had possession of these funds at the time the levy was served. The funds were not paid to Phelan until September 1964, following approval of the trustee\u2019s report holding that the remaining proceeds of the insurance policies were exempt from claims of the creditors of Shipp under Tennessee law. <em>See </em>T.C.A. \u00a7 56-1110; Lunsford v. Nashville Savings &amp; Loan Corp., 162 Tenn. 179, 35 S.W.2d 395 (1931).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-19\">The United States filed this action to execute on the levy. The Bank defended on the ground that Phelan\u2019s interest in the fund was superior to the tax lien. District Judge Robert M. McRae, Jr. ruled that the tax lien had priority and entered judgment for the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-20\">Because of the unique character of the statutory tax lien, a review of the legislative history is set forth as an Appendix to this opinion. Stated briefly, protection given to the United States has expanded from simple priority in the distribution of the assets of an insolvent person or estate owing import duties to a comprehensive lien on all property owned by a delinquent taxpayer. Following ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment, limitations on the scope of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>the lien were enacted in the interest of furthering ordinary commercial transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">The United States acquires a lien on all property and property rights of any person having an outstanding tax liability. \u00a7 6321, Int.Rev.Code of 1954.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This lien arises at the time the tax assessment is made and continues until the tax is paid or becomes uncollectible by reason of lapse of time. \u00a7 6322. With certain exceptions, this lien takes priority over all subsequently perfected liens.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">This appeal involves the applicability of two such exceptions, in the class known as superpriorities. The Bank claims superpriority status under \u00a7 6323(b) (1) (A), (b) (8).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-16\">1) Security Superpriority</p>\n<p id=\"b620-17\">The statutory definitions of \u201csecurity\u201d and \u201cpurchaser\u201d provided in \u00a7 6323(h) are set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We hold that the Bank has failed to establish that Phelan was the \u201cpurchaser of [a] security,\u201d within the statutory definitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-18\">A distinction must be drawn between the funds held by the Bank and Phelan\u2019s interest in those funds. The Bank argues that following the cashing of the insurance policies, it held money belonging to Shipp and that the December 9 document divested Shipp of any interest in the funds. The net result, it is urged, is that after delivery of this document to the Bank, it held the money <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>for Phelan, the document being evidence of Phelan\u2019s property interest in the funds. Although this argument has some appeal, the unambiguous statutory language mandates its rejection.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">For purposes of this appeal, we assume that the December 9 document was an assignment to Phelan by Shipp of the funds held by the Bank.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Treating the instrument as an assignment, it is nothing more than a non-negotiable instrument evidencing money held by a third party for the holder of the instrument. Congress carefully has limited the definition of a security to negotiable instruments or money. We decline to ignore this limitation by ruling that the document in question was a \u201csecurity\u201d entitled to superpriority status. To define \u201cmoney\u201d as \u201cmoney or any evidence of a right to receive money\u201d would open the door \u201cbeyond any reasonable width that Congress could have had in mind.\u201d <em>See </em>Worley v. United States, 340 F.2d 500, 502 (9th Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Even if it be assumed that the document was a \u201csecurity,\u201d we note that it did not order the Bank to pay Phelan or explicitly assign the funds to Phelan; it merely \u201cauthorized\u201d the Bank to pay Phelan. Further, it does not appear that the document was ever in Phelan\u2019s possession or that its existence was known to Phelan prior to the levy. At best the evidence shows that Shipp promised to pay Phelan out of the insurance proceeds and took it upon himself to make arrangements with the Bank. It thus is clear that Phelan could not be the \u201cpurchaser\u201d of the money held by the Bank since he did not have \u201can interest (other than a lien or security interest) in [the money] which is valid under local law against subsequent purchasers without actual notice,\u201d as required by \u00a7 6323(h) (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">2) Attorney\u2019s Lien Superpriority</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">The Bank asserts that Phelan obtained an attorney\u2019s lien on the policy proceeds through his efforts in obtaining an exemption for them under state law. We hold that the Bank has failed to establish superpriority on this theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">The Bank argues that the policy proceeds were held by the trustee for the benefit of Shipp\u2019s creditors so that in securing their exemption, Phelan enhanced the value of Shipp\u2019s property, thereby giving Phelan an attorney\u2019s lien in the proceeds. The United States argues that Phelan merely defended Shipp\u2019s property and did not enhance it. Unfortunately the Bankruptcy Act is of little help in resolving this question. Section 70a of the Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 110(a), provides that title to the bankrupt\u2019s property vests in the trustee \u201cby operation of law . . . as of the date of filing of the petition.\u201d This language would appear to support the Bank\u2019s position. However, this automatic vesting does not apply \u201cto property which is held to be exempt.\u201d This exception supports the Government\u2019s position. While the trustee does not take title to exempt property, he has \u201cpossession and right to possession of . exempted property until such be set aside as exempt.\u201d Vought v. Kanne, 10 F.2d 747, 748 (8th Cir. 1926), app. dismissed, 275 U.S. 574, 48 S.Ct. 16, 72 L.Ed. 433 (1927); <em>see </em>4A Collier, Bankruptcy, \u00b6 70.08 (14th ed.). Arguably, removal of the possessory interest of the trustee enhanced the value of Shipp\u2019s property. We need not reach this issue, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-11\">The funds were withdrawn to satisfy attorneys\u2019 fees due Phelan and another attorney for legal services rendered in both the bankruptcy proceedings and a criminal prosecution. The \u00a7 6323(b) (8) superpriority is limited by its terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>to an attorney\u2019s \u201clien upon [a] judgment ... to the extent of his reasonable compensation for obtaining such judgment . . . .\u201d Manifestly, there can be no lien on a judgment in a criminal case. Further, apart from the exemption obtained for the insurance proceeds, there is nothing resulting from the bankruptcy proceedings which arguably can be called a judgment capable of supporting a lien. No proof was offered as to what part of the funds represented a reasonable compensation for securing the exemption as contrasted with that part of the funds representing compensation for the criminal case and the other aspects of the bankruptcy action. In the absence of such proof, the Bank has failed to show that it is entitled to attorney\u2019s lien superpriority.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">HISTORY OF THE FEDERAL TAX LIEN</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">Expansion of Government Protection From almost the inception of Government under the Constitution, Congress expressed solicitude for the protection of federal revenue. With respect to bonds securing import duties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-9\">\u201cin all cases of insolvency, or where any estate in the hands of executors or administrators shall be insufficient to pay all the debts due from the deceased, the debt due to the United States on any such bonds shall be first satisfied.\u201d Act of July 31, 1789, ch. 5, \u00a7 21,1 Stat. 29, 42.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">This protection promptly was extended to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-11\">\u201ccases in which a debtor, not having sufficient property to pay all his or her debts, shall have made a voluntary assignment thereof, for the benefit of his or her creditors, or in which the estate and effects of an absconding, concealed or absent debtor shall have been attached by process of law, as to cases, in which an act of legal bankruptcy shall have been committed.\u201d Act of May 2, 1792, ch. 27, \u00a7 18, 1 Stat. 259, 263.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-13\">The limitation of this statute to import bonds was removed and it was made applicable to any \u201cperson hereafter becoming indebted to the United States, by bond or otherwise.\u201d Act of March 3, 1797, ch. 20, \u00a7 5, 1 Stat. 512, 515. This priority has been carried without substantive change through present law and is now codified as 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-14\">This statutory scheme merely gave the Government priority with respect to an insolvent debtor. No lien in favor of the Government attached until suit was brought against an insolvent debtor. <em>See </em>Prince v. Bartlett, 12 U.S. (8 Cranch) 431, 3 L.Ed. 614 (1814).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-15\">In 1864 the office of Commissioner of Internal Revenue was established in the Treasury Department to collect all \u201cinternal duties, stamp duties, licenses, or taxes.\u201d Act of June 30, 1864, ch. 173, \u00a7 1, 13 Stat. 223. Distraint proceedings were authorized against persons failing to pay a tax when due and notice given. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 28, 13 Stat. 232-33. Auction sale of realty could be made if sale of the dis-trained personalty did not satisfy the tax liability. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 30, 13 Stat. 234.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-16\">The forerunner of the present statute was enacted in 1866, providing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-17\">\u201cif any person . . . liable to pay any tax, shall neglect or refuse to pay the same after demand, the amount shall be a lien in favor of the United States from the time it was due . upon all property and rights to property belonging to such person.\u201d Act of July 13, 1866, ch. 184, \u00a7 9, 14 Stat. 98, 107, <em>codified, </em>R.S. \u00a7 3186.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-19\">R.S. \u00a7 3186 was amended to provide that sessment-list was received by the collec-the lien ran \u201cfrom the time when the as-tor.\u201d Act of March 1, 1879, ch. 125, \u00a7 3, 20 Stat. 327, 331.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-20\">The lien of R.S. \u00a7 3186 defeated even a bona-fide purchaser of realty without notice or knowledge of an unfiled tax lien. See United States v. Snyder, 149 U.S. 210, 13 S.Ct. 846, 37 L.Ed. 705 (1893).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>Protection of Commercial Transactions</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">Within one month of the ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment, an amendment to R.S. \u00a7 3186 provided that the tax lien \u201cshall not be valid as against any mortgagee, purchaser, or judgment creditor until notice of such lien shall be filed by the collector [in the designated place for filing].\u201d Act of March 4, 1913, ch. 166, 37 Stat. 1016. This marked the beginning of a retreat from the pre-amendment harsh rule in order to protect specified interests from the operation of the lien. These provisions were substantively incorporated into the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, \u00a7\u00a7 3670-72, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-5\">\"\u00a7 <em>3670.

Rosen-field, 26 F.Supp. 433 (E.D.Mich.1938), Congress corrected the inequity of the notice by filing provision of the Code with respect to negotiable securities. It recognized the impossibility of checking the recorder\u2019s office of the residence of every prior holder of a security to determine whether a tax lien had been filed against the holder. To eliminate this heavy burden on ordinary commercial transactions and protect property interests in freely negotiable documents, \u00a7 3672 of the 1939 Code was amended to provide;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-14\">\u201c\u00a7 <em>3672.

Again, the motivation was the protection of ordinary commercial transactions where the purchaser could not reasonably be expected to cheek the recorder\u2019s office in each jurisdiction where a prior owner has resided. <em>See </em>S.Rep.No. 830, 88th Cong., 2d Sess.

No. 89-719, 80 Stat. 1125. The Act was \u201cthe first comprehensive revision and modernization of the provisions of the internal revenue laws concerned with the relationship of Federal tax liens to the interests of other creditors.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 1884, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. 1 (1966); S.Rep.No. 1708, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. 1 (1966). The superpriorities afforded securities and motor vehicles were unchanged. H.R.Rep.No. 1884, <em>supra </em>at 4, 36; S.Rep.No. 1708, <em>supra </em>at 4. Eight additional superpriorities were added\u2014 retail purchases, casual sales, possessory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>liens, real estate taxes, small mechanic\u2019s liens, attorney\u2019s liens, certain insurance contracts and passbook loans. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 6323(b) (3)-(b) (10). The Act further set forth definitions in \u00a7 6323(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The rationale for the attorney\u2019s lien superpriority was the enhancement of the taxpayer\u2019s property through the efforts of the attorney.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-6\"><em>\u201c(f) Attorneys\u2019 liens. </em>\u2014 A sixth new category of superpriority added by the bill relates to attorneys\u2019 fees. Federal tax liens cover all of a taxpayer\u2019s property, including causes of action and any amounts which may be owed to him under judgments or settlements of suits or other proceedings. It is believed that attorneys whose efforts result in obtaining or collecting judgments or settlements should be protected as to their reasonable fees to the extent that the fees are protected under local law. The attorney\u2019s fee in such a case can be thought of as similar in concept to the repairman\u2019s charge in that it can be expected to enhance the value of the taxpayer\u2019s property. Moreover, as in the case of a possessory lien, the efforts of the attorney may account for the realization of value by the taxpayer from the judgment or settlement. However, under the bill, in a proceeding against the Government, the Government retains its right to set off against any recoveries from it any amounts due it by the taxpayer on account of any tax or any other debt or claim. This set-off means that the attorney\u2019s lien \u2018superpriority\u2019 does not apply with respect to judgments he obtains for the taxpayer against the Government.\u201d H.R.Rep.No. 1884, <em>supra </em>at 6.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-7\"><em>\u201cAttorneys\u2019 liens. </em>\u2014 Paragraph (8) of section 6323(b) provides that even though a notice of tax lien has been filed, the lien shall not be valid with respect to a judgment or other amount in settlement of a claim or of a cause of action, as against an attorney who, under local law, holds a lien upon or a contract enforceable against such judgment or amount, to the extent of the attorney\u2019s reasonable compensation for obtaining the judgment or procuring the settlement. However, an attorney has no priority with respect to a judgment or amount in settlement of a claim or of a cause of action against the United States to the extent that the United States offsets such judgment or amount against any liability of the taxpayer to the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-9\">\u201cThe tax lien is, therefore, not valid with respect to an attorney\u2019s claim against a judgment or fund resulting from the settlement of an administrative claim (such as a workmen\u2019s compensation claim) or a cause of action, to the extent the attorney, under local law, has a lien or an enforceable contract against such judgment or fund. The priority granted to attorneys\u2019 liens is, however, limited to reasonable compensation for obtaining the judgment or settlement. Generally, reasonable compensation means the amount customarily allowed under local law for an attorney\u2019s services for litigating or settling a similar case or administrative claim. Nevertheless, reasonable compensation shall be determined on the basis of the facts and circumstances of each individual case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-10\">\u201cIn the case of claims or causes of action against the United States, the priority granted under paragraph (8) is not applicable to a judgment or other fund resulting from the successful litigation or settlement of an administrative claim or cause of action to the extent that the United States, under any legal or equitable right, off-sets its liability under the judgment or settlement against any liability of the taxpayer to the United States. For example, the priority granted under paragraph (8) would not be applicable in a case like United States v. Munsey Trust Co., 332 U.S. 234 [67 S.Ct. 1599, 91 L.Ed. 2022] (1947), which held that the United States may set off the amount due it for taxes against an amount owed by the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>States to the taxpayer under a contract. Similarly, the priority granted by paragraph (8) would not be applicable to any amount the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate credits against any liability of the taxpayer in accordance with section 6402 of the code (relating to authority to make credits or refunds).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 38-39.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AfY\">The definition of \u201csecurity\u201d was continued without substantive change. <em>Id. </em>at 49.

See United States v. Scovil, 348 U.S. 218, 221 [75 S.Ct. 244, 99 L.Ed. 271] (1955). A valuable consideration, as interpreted by the courts, may not be a nominal amount, but it may be so small an amount as to have little relation to the value of the property acquired. See, for example, Enochs v. Smith, 359 F.2d 924 (5th Cir. 1966). Paragraph (6) of section 6323(h) changes present law by adding to the code a definition of the term \u2018purchaser\u2019.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-5\">\u201cParagraph (6) provides that the term \u2018purchaser\u2019 means a person who, for adequate and full consideration in money or money\u2019s worth, acquires an interest (other than a lien or security interest) in property which is valid under local law against subsequent purchasers without actual notice. A purchaser must acquire his interest in property in a transaction having the indicia of a vendor-vendee relationship. Although paragraph (6), by requiring adequate and full consideration, changes the result reached in Enochs v. Smith, <em>supra, </em>it does not preclude a bona fide bargain purchaser from qualifying under this definition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 49-50.</blockquote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b620-6\">. <em>\u201c\u00a76321.
