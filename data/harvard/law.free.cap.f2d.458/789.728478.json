Atty., at the time the brief was filed, and Alan S. Rosenthal, Atty., Department of Justice, were on the brief, for appellee. Mr. David V. Seaman, Atty., Department of Justice, also entered an appearance for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b848-9\">Before BAZELON, Chief Judge, DANAHER, Senior Circuit Judge, and ROBINSON, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b848-10\">DANAHER, Senior Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"aug-dedup-0\">This appeal involves, under circumstances to be mentioned, the applicability of 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 211(a) (1958) which pertinently provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-11\">. [T]he decisions of the Administrator on any question of law or fact concerning a claim for benefits or payments under any law administered by the Veterans\u2019 Administration shall be final and conclusive and no other official or any court of the United States shall have power or jurisdiction to review any such decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b848-12\">In light of the \u201cfinality statute\u201d the District Court dismissed the appellant\u2019s action for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-13\">This appellant\u2019s late husband, a former serviceman, died from malaria on February 11, 1945. Thereafter, the appellant, a widow as defined in 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(3), claimed eligibility pursuant to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 321, to receive dependency and indemnity compensation as provided in 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(a) (1). Her claim, for benefits was disallowed by the Administrator as of August 31, 1951 on the ground that there had been a failure to establish that the cause of her husband\u2019s death was service-connected. Her further claim was again denied on the same ground as of October 3, 1960.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-15\">On October 11, 1966 the Administrator received her letter which besought reopening of her application for dependency and indemnity compensation benefits.' 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.105(b), Difference of Opinion, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-16\">Whenever an adjudicative agency is of the opinion that a revision or an amendment of a previous decision is warranted, a difference of opinion being involved rather than a clear and unmistakable error, the proposed revision will be recommended to Central Office.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>The Administrator decided on September 7, 1967 that the appellant was entitled to benefits effective as of that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">Not satisfied with the scope of retro-activity thus afforded, her action in the District Court sought benefits to be related back to August 29, 1957. She has argued here, confronted by the finality statute, that she does not seek review of the decision granting the award, but rather argues that arbitrarily and erroneously the Administrator had failed to comply with the provisions of 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3010(a) (1958). She insists that the effective date of the award should have been \u201cfixed in accordance with the facts found,\u201d but that is not enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">We can not fail to note that the section was amended by P.L. 87-825, approved October 15, 1962, 76 Stat. 948, and as here pertinent reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-7\">Section 3010, Effective dates of awards</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-8\">(a) . [T]he effective date of an award based on an original claim, <em>a claim reopened, after final adjudication </em>. . . of . . . dependency and indemnity compensation . shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, <em>but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor. </em>(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-18\">The appellant further has failed to take account of applicable regulations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Amended Section 3.400(h) (2) fixes the effective date of an award based upon a reopened claim as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-19\">As to decisions which have become final . . . prior to receipt of an application for reconsideration or to reopen, the date of receipt of such application or the date entitlement arose, <em>whichever is later. </em>(Emphasis added).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-21\">Here, based upon a \u201cDifference of Opinion,\u201d <em>supra, </em>\u201ccorrective action\u201d was taken respecting the appellant\u2019s claim, previously and finally disallowed. Necessarily the Administrator\u2019s decision allowing the reopened claim fixed<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the ef<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>fective date of the award to conform to the statute and the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">So it was that the decision of the Administrator became \u201cfinal and conclusive\u201d within the meaning of 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 211(a), and the District Court correctly ruled that it lacked jurisdiction to review that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b848-17\">. And see 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 19.2(b) re administrative action on an adjudicative determination -which has become final.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b849-10\">. It seems clear enough that the pertinent regulation tracks 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3010(a), 1962, as amended. Senate Report No. 2042 to accompany H.R. 7600 provided background for Public Law 87-825 which became 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3010 as amended, approved October 15, 1962, The Finance Committee\u2019s explanatory statement makes clear that Congress sought \u201cto provide uniformity by making [the effective date] applicable to reopened claims\u201d as well as to yet other claims not here involved. Subsection (i) explained further that where a disallowed claim is reopened and allowed, \u201cin no event . . . will an award of benefits be retroactive for more than 1 year' from the date the claim was reopened. The only change effected by this section relates to the retroactive period for which benefits may be paid.\u201d Section 3010(i) refers specifically to \u201ccorrective action by competent authority.\u201d The legislative history <em>in extenso </em>appears commencing at Page 3260, Vol. 2, U.S.Code Congressional and Administrative News, and see Page 3263, <em>Id., </em>re 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3010, subsection (a), and Page 3265 (i) as further explanatory of the Congressional purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b849-13\">. Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 210 (1958), the Administrator had been authorized to make all rules and regulations deemed necessary or appropriate to carry out the laws administered by the Veterans\u2019 Administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-23\">So it was that C.F.R. \u00a7 3.400(h) (2) effective as of December 1, 1962, was amended to conform to P.L. 87-825, amending Section 3010(a), text, <em>supra. </em>See F.R. Vol. 34, No. 105.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b849-25\">. Appellant\u2019s reliance upon Tracy v. Gleason, 126 U.S.App.D.C. 415, 379 F.2d 469 (1967) is definitely misplaced. The.Tracy facts are not even remotely comparable to those here involved. In Tracy, the Administrator as early as 1948 had awarded benefits for total and permanent disability to an incompetent veteran, adjudged insane in July 1936. In 1963, the Administrator purported to justify his discontinuance of the earlier award on the ground that the incompetent veteran had failed to answer a questionnaire concerning his income. Yet the answers to the questionnaire in the veteran\u2019s file disclosed that the incompetent had been hospitalized since 1936 and had no income. We had no difficulty in concluding that the action of the Administrator was arbitrary and capricious when the Veterans\u2019 Administration knew or was bound to know that the unfortunate veteran had been totally disabled by insanity and that the questionnaire had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>indeed been answered in behalf of the veteran by the superintendent of a mental hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-17\">Certainly there is no \u201cconstitutional limitation on the power of Congress to make substantive changes in the law of entitlement to public benefits,\u201d Richardson v. Belcher, 404 U.S. 78, 81, 92 S.Ct. 254, 257, 30 L.Ed.2d 231 (1971). See generally, Lynch v. United States, 292 U.S. 571, 587, 54 S.Ct. 840, 78 L.Ed. 1434 (1934) and compare 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 211 as amended by P.L. 91-376, August 12, 1970, 84 Stat. 790.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
