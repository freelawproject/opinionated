The plaintiff was injured and his vehicle was damaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>Route 30 North, a two-lane highway, crosses the railroad tracks at an angle of about 63 degrees, and there are three sets of tracks -at the crossing.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The sum of the plaintiffs testimony was that he approached the railroad crossing at a speed of about 5 miles per hour; he looked up and down the tracks \u2014\u201cboth ways\u201d; when he was 50 to 60 feet away from the tracks and \u201cdidn\u2019t see anything\u201d; he proceeded to the tracks at a speed of about 1 mile per hour; when he reached them, he \u201cdidn\u2019t stop\u201d but \u201ctook another look\u201d \u201cto the left and right\u201d and \u201cstill seen [sic] nothing.\u201d He then \u201cstarted to cross the tracks \u2014 as I was crossing the second set of tracks the train was right there \u2014 it seemed like it was on top of me \u2014 I knew he was going to hit me and I slowed, floored the truck.\u201d At another point in his testimony the plaintiff testified again that when he first saw the train \u201cit seemed like he was right on top of me \u2014 I was on the first track \u2014 by the time he hit me I would have been on the second track, I have no way of knowing.\u201d The plaintiff also testified that he was familiar with the crossing; he had traveled on it two or three times a week for \u201ca couple of years\u201d; when one reached the first tracks \u201cyou can probably see a thousand feet, I don\u2019t know.\u201d The plaintiff further testified that he did not stop at any time from when he first looked 50 to 60 feet before reaching the first track until he was struck by the engine, although he could have done so at any time. .</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Testimony was adduced by the plaintiff that the defendant\u2019s engine was exceeding the speed limit (which is negligence per <em>se </em>under Ohio law); warning flasher lights at the crossing were not functioning; and that the defendant\u2019s engineer and brakeman failed to take required action after discovering the plaintiff was in a perilous position.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">The case was submitted to the jury on eight Special Interrogatories, six of which were addressed to the issues of negligence and contributory negligence of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">The jury in answering these six interrogatories found that the plaintiff was negligent and that his negligence contributed to the occurrence of the accident, and that the defendant was negligent and its negligence contributed to the happening of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">The jury also answered \u201c[y]es\u201d in answer to Special Interrogatory No. 7 which reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">\u201cCould defendant have avoided the accident, notwithstanding plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-11\">Special Interrogatory No. 8 asked:</p>\n<p id=\"AP3\">\u201cWhat damage did plaintiff sustain?\u201d and the jury answered \u201c$46,500.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AbL\">It must be noted that on this appeal we are not concerned with the jury\u2019s findings in answer to the first six interrogatories since the plaintiff does not challenge the jury\u2019s finding that he was guilty of contributory negligence, nor does the defendant challenge the jury\u2019s findings that it was guilty of negligence which contributed to the accident. Defendant further has not challenged the jury\u2019s finding that the plaintiff sustained damages of $46,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-12\">The defendant\u2019s appeal challenges <em>only </em>the trial court\u2019s submission to the jury of Special Interrogatory No. 7 and the related portion of the court\u2019s charge to the jury that it could, under Ohio\u2019s Doctrine of the Last Clear Chance, award damages to the plaintiff even though it found him guilty of contributory negligence \u201c . . .if you also find that the railroad could have avoided the accident by the exercise of due care. . \u201d The defendant had taken timely exception to the submission of Special Interrogatory No. 7 and the trial court\u2019s instructions relating to Ohio\u2019s Last Clear Chance doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-15\">In instructing the jury that it was to consider and apply the Ohio Last Clear Chance doctrine the trial court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-16\">\u201cNow, there is also a doctrine of Ohio law which we call the Doctrine of the Last Clear Chance and that means that if a plaintiff by his own fault has caused himself to be placed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>in a perilous situation he may, nevertheless, recover notwithstanding his negligence if the defendant did not after becoming aware of the plaintiff's perilous situation, exercise ordinary care or due care to avoid injury-ing him. In other words, that means suppose somebody by his own fault gets up on the railroad track, suppose he is drunk and lies down to go to sleep on the railroad track and then a train comes along and if in the exercise of due care the engineer could and should have seen the drunk sleeping on the track in time to have brought the train to a stop without hitting him, then the railroad would still be liable in spite of the lack of due care, the contributory negligence of the drunk in getting on the track to sleep. In other words, the railroad would have had the last clear chance to prevent an accident. So that under Ohio law even if you find there is contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff, nevertheless, if you also find that the railroad could have avoided the accident by the exercise of due care then under the Doctrine of the Last Clear Chance you may nonetheless find in favor of the plaintiff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"At25\">On review of the record we are of the opinion that the trial judge erred in its quoted instruction and in submitting to the jury Special Interrogatory No. 7. Further, since the jury found that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence we are of the opinion that the defendant is entitled to judgment N.O. V., and that the District Court erred in ruling to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">The Ohio Last Clear Chance doctrine is not applicable where the contributory negligence of the plaintiff <em>concurs </em>with that of the defendant. In order for the doctrine to come into play the plaintiff\u2019s negligence must have ceased and a sufficient time must have elapsed to permit the defendant to avoid injury to the plaintiff. Lones v. Detroit, Toledo and Ironton Railroad Company, 398 F.2d 914, 920 (6 Cir. 1968), cert. den. 393 U.S. 1063, 89 S.Ct. 714, 21 L.Ed.2d 705 (1969); Baltimore &amp; O. R. Co. v. Joseph, 112 F.2d 518, 522 (6 Cir. 1940), cert. den. 312 U.S. 682, 61 S.Ct. 551, 85 L.Ed. 1121; Cleveland Ry. Co. v. Masterson, <em>126 </em>Ohio St. 42, 183 N.E. 873, 876 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">In <em>Lones, supra, </em>the Court said at page 920:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-7\">\u201cUnder Ohio law for the doctrine of last clear chance to apply, it must be shown that the defendant became aware of the plaintiff\u2019s situation in time to avoid the accident by the exercise of ordinary care. . . . <em>Also the evidence must show that the plaintiffs negligence did not continue and, concurrently with the defendant\u2019s negligence, contribute to the accident.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">In Baltimore &amp; O. R. Co. v. Joseph, <em>supra, </em>the Court said at page 522, with respect to the applicability of the Ohio Last Chance doctrine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-10\"><em>\u201cThat doctrine does not apply until the negligence of the injured party has ceased.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-11\">In Cleveland Ry. Co. v. Masterson, <em>supra, </em>the Court said at page 876.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-12\"><em>\u201cIt is only in those cases of prior negligence on plaintiff\u2019s part, not actively continuing to the time of injury, that the last chance rule applies.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-13\">In the instant case the accident occurred in broad daylight, the plaintiff was familiar with the crossing; he could have seen 1000 feet ahead in the direction from which the engine came; he was moving at a slow speed, from 5 miles down to 1 mile per hour; he could have stopped at any time but he didn\u2019t and he was still moving when he was struck by the engine. The jury rightly held that he was guilty of contributory negligence, and the evidence, his own evidence, disclosed that he was still moving when the accident happened, so that his negligence was <em>concurrent </em>with that of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-14\">Under these circumstances the Ohio Last Clear Chance doctrine was not applicable and the trial judge erred in in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>strueting the jury with respect to that doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">For the reasons stated, the judgment entered in favor of the plaintiff pursuant to the jury\u2019s verdict will be reversed and the cause remanded with directions to grant the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment N.O.V.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
