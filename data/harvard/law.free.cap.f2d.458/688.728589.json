When Crateo refused to make that purchase, Southern fore<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>closed on the security for the note, allegedly suffering $200,000 in liquidated damages, represented by the difference between the contract price of $600,000 and the $400,000 realized on foreclosure. Additionally, Southern purportedly incurred some $43,000 in attorneys\u2019 fees. Asserting diversity jurisdiction, Southern sued in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. The district judge, sitting without a jury, awarded Southern the entire $243,000 plus an appropriate amount of interest. From that decision, Crateo appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">In early 1964, Blakeway, Ward and Clark, none of whom are parties to this action, formed a limited partnership under Texas law (Blakeway-Ward Enterprises) whose purpose was to construct the Crest Hotel in Austin, Texas. The projected cost of the project was $3,300,-000. Interim financing was sought from Southern National Bank. It is a general practice for the interim financier, and one here followed by Southern, to negotiate a \u201ctake-out\u201d agreement with one or more long-term lenders. Such an agreement requires that, on completion of the building in accordance with the original specifications, the long-term lender purchase the borrower\u2019s note from the short-term lender.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Blakeway-Ward Enterprises obtained a commitment from one long-term lender, the Austin Group, in the amount of $2,700,000 and another from Crateo (defendant-appellee) in the amount of $600,-000. Southern and the Austin Group executed a contract effectuating the takeout arrangement between them, which agreement was pre-closed and entered into on August 4, 1964, and was performed on February 4, 1966 (exactly 18 months after closing). As part of the consideration, the Austin Group received, after purchasing the note, a first lien on the completed hotel.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Also on August 4, 1964, a similar agreement was purportedly pre-closed and entered into between Southern and Crateo, but with Crateo to receive a second lien on taking out Southern. When Southern demanded performance on February 4, 1966, Crateo refused. As a consequence, Southern foreclosed on the hotel, paid off the Austin Group\u2019s first lien, and netted $400,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">The issues raised on appeal are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-9\">I. Whether the district court erred in finding personal jurisdiction over Crateo under the Texas \u201clong-arm\u201d statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-10\">II. Whether the district court erred in finding that an enforceable contract existed between Southern and Crateo.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-11\">III. Whether the district court erred in denying relief to Crateo since Southern had failed timely to claim an interest in the estate of one of the borrowers (Mr. Clark) who had since died.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-12\">IV. Whether the district court erred in denying relief to Crateo since Southern had allegedly not complied with the contractual provisions relating to tender of performance as a condition precedent to Crateo\u2019s obligation thereunder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-13\">V. Whether the district court erred in awarding special damages for attorneys\u2019 fees on the facts here presented.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-14\">We find that the district court was correct in concluding that it had personal jurisdiction over Crateo. The reasoning in support of that conclusion is amply set out in the district court\u2019s opinion. Southern National Bank v. Tri Financial Corp., S.D.Tex.1970, 317 F.Supp. 1173, 1191.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-15\">\n<em>The Contract</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b748-16\">Mr. Ward, upon Southern\u2019s request that a commitment for permanent financing be had, sought out Mr. Moody, executive vice-president and treasurer of Crateo. On July 2, 1964, Moody sent letters and telegrams to the same effect to Ward and to Blakeway committing Crateo to lend $600,000 for 5 years on the security of a second lien on the completed hotel. Ward acknowledged receipt of the commitment that same day, in a letter transmitting a $12,-000 commitment fee to Crateo. A note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>representing those terms was executed by Blakeway-Ward Enterprises, as maker, payable to Southern.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">In customary course Southern would execute a construction loan agreement, advance the construction money as required, and assume responsibility for the proper construction of the hotel. Upon completion of the hotel, tender by Southern of specified documents evidencing proper construction would obligate Cra-teo to purchase the note for $600,000. A letter agreement (hereinafter \u201cnote-purchase agreement\u201d) was drafted by Southern\u2019s attorneys reciting that copies of such documents were attached thereto. The agreement was to be performed within 18 months. Said agreement was sent to Blakeway. Blakeway forwarded it to Ward who in turn delivered it to Moody. A few days prior to August 4, 1964, the date of closing, Moody signed the letter portion of the note-purchase agreement and returned it to Ward. At the actual closing in Austin, Texas, on August 4, no representative of Crateo appeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">On February 4, 1966, after negotiations for an extension of the note-purchase agreement fell through,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Southern attempted to tender the required documents to Crateo and demanded payment thereon. Counsel for Southern in Texas conferred with counsel for Crateo in California by phone in an effort to reach a conciliation whereby Crateo would perform. The parties could not reach an accord, and on that same day Southern stated its tender and demand of performance by phone. Such tender and demand were restated in telegrams to Crateo late that afternoon. Crateo refused to purchase the note, and after several subsequent demands Southern foreclosed on the hotel.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">Both at trial and in this appeal Crateo contended that there was no contract in the legal sense between itself and Southern owing, <em>inter alia, </em>to the following allegations:</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">(1) Southern\u2019s attorneys prepared the note-purchase agreement consisting of a letter portion which recited that it had six exhibits, marked \u201cA\u201d through \u201cF,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> attached and incorporated by reference;</p>\n<p id=\"b749-9\">(2) Southern\u2019s attorneys forwarded the letter portion minus the exhibits, except the note, Exhibit \u201cA,\u201d to Blake-way-Ward Enterprises in Austin, not to Crateo; and</p>\n<p id=\"b749-10\">(3) Mr. Kuhlman, an officer of Southern, admitted by letter that Moody had signed the agreement although one of the exhibits, the Construction Loan Agreement (Exhibit \u201cC\u201d), had not yet been prepared.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-11\">Despite the above enumerated allegations, the district judge concluded that an enforceable contract existed. Noting that a contract is unenforceable where any essential term is left open to future negotiations, he concluded that \u201cno essential term of the note-purchase agreement between them [had been left] open * * *.\" 317 F.Supp. at 1180. The district court reasoned that even assuming Moody never saw part of the agreement, he signed a document which included the following clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-12\">\u201c[Crateo] has heretofore examined, and hereby approves, the form of the instruments or documents attached hereto as exhibits and agrees that delivery to it of said instruments or documents in such form duly executed by the party or parties required by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>the form thereof to execute said instruments or documents shall satisfy any condition or conditions to its obligations hereunder which relate to the execution or delivery of such instruments or documents.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">On the authority of that clause, the district judge held that \u201ca party who signs a contract intending to be bound but [who] fails to read it is obligated according to its terms, <em>see, e. g., </em>Thigpen v. Locke, 363 S.W.2d 247 (Tex.1962); Shaw Equip. Co. v. Hoople Jordan Const. Co., 428 S.W.2d 835 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014Dallas 1968, no writ); 3 A. Corbin, Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 548, 607 (1960 ed), . . . .\u201d (Footnote omitted.) Id. at 1180-1181.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">On its face the letter agreement signed by Crateo, even without the attachments, purports to be a contract. In fact the letter portion of the agreement contains all the necessary elements of a valid, enforceable contract, and to the extent disclosed therein it should be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">In trying to avoid liability under the contract here at issue, Crateo is asserting the defense of mistake of fact. The Texas Supreme Court has defined the defense aptly: It is \u201c \u2018an unconscious ignorance or forgetfulness of the existence or nonexistence of a fact, past or present, material to the contract.\u2019\u201d Houston &amp; T. C. R. Co. v. McCarty, 1901, 94 Tex. 298, 302, 60 S.W. 429, 431, quoting Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence \u00a7 839. In attempting to bring itself within this definition, Crateo contends, for example, that had it known the hotel was being totally financed (that the borrowers were not investing any money whatsoever) it would not have entered into the \u201ctake-out\u201d agreement with Southern. The terms of the financing arrangements between Southern and the borrowers were disclosed in one of the attachments which Crateo did not see. Crateo avers that, because the documents were not affixed, it was ignorant or mistaken as to the nature of the borrowers\u2019 involvement and as to other material facts. Thus, says Crateo, the contract is without legal effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">However, the defense of mistake of fact has certain well-recognized exceptions. In determining whether the doctrine or its exceptions are applicable to the present case, this Court is bound by the principles enunciated in <em>Erie </em>to apply Texas law. As a general rule in Texas and in other jurisdictions, a mistake by one party to an agreement, where it is not induced by acts of the other party, will not constitute grounds for relief. Morris v. Millers Mutual Fire Insurance Co., Tex.Civ.App.1961, 343 S.W.2d 269; Keystone Pipe &amp; Supply Co. v. Kleeden, Tex.Civ.App.1927, 299 S.W. 671; Price v. Biggs, Tex.Civ.App.1919, 217 S.W. 236. The question thus becomes whether Crateo\u2019s mistake or ignorance as to the facts disclosed in the unseen attachments was \u201cinduced\u201d by Southern. Crateo\u2019s ignorance could be said to have been induced by Southern if the latter misrepresented the facts, if it acted in less than good faith, or if it had notice of Crateo\u2019s ignorance. <em>E. g., </em>17 Am.Jr. 2d, Contracts \u00a7 146. The record on appeal does not support a finding that Southern was guilty either of misrepresenting the facts or of acting in other than good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-10\">However, Southern did know that Cra-teo had not been apprised of all the attendant facts. Such notice can be inferred from Southern\u2019s failure to forward Crateo the attachments here at issue. Does that notice on the part of Southern render the contract unenforceable? We think not. Although there is much case support for the precept that the validity of the contract becomes doubtful where a mistake of fact by one party is known to the other, those cases are not here apposite. One cannot stop the inquiry with asking whether Southern had knowledge of Crateo\u2019s ignorance. Other legal principles come to bear.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-11\">Although the facts of which Crateo had no knowledge could be said to be \u201cmaterial\u201d insofar as most businessmen would be concerned, it cannot be said that such facts were material to the contract as a matter of law. Ordinarily, facts are material only when the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>consider them to be. Here, Crateo was aware of the existence of documents containing important information, but it made no effort to examine those documents. As one court noted, where parties enter into a contract despite their conscious ignorance of certain facts, it seems clear that they have concluded that the existence or nonexistence of these particular facts is of no consequence to them and would not influence or induce them to refrain from entering into the contract, whatever they may turn out to be. Harley v. Magnolia Petroleum Co., 1941, 378 Ill. 19, 37 N.E.2d 760. Hamilton Moody, in signing the contract on behalf of Crateo, exhibited that same attitude of indifference. He chose to rely on a promise from Mr. Ward that Crateo would not have to perform<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> rather than to investigate the substance of the contract for himself. The applicability of the doctrine of mistake is limited to situations in which the party asserting the defense is unconsciously ignorant or mistaken as to the questioned fact. Here, Crateo was conscious and purposeful in its ignorance. Crateo was on notice of the existence of important attachments, owing to the letter agreement\u2019s specific reference to the missing exhibits, and should have sought out their content. Accordingly, even if the unknown facts were material, Crateo cannot be allowed to assert the defense of mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Crateo\u2019s failure to investigate brings a third point to the fore. Texas law is clear to the point that, \u201cwhere a party enters into a contract, ignorant of a fact, but meaning to waive all inquiry into it, or waives an investigation after his attention has been called to it, he is not in mistake, in the legal sense.\u201d Houston &amp; T. C. R. Co. v. McCarty, <em>supra, </em>94 Tex. at 302, 60 S.W. at 431. Certainly, it can be said that, although ignorant of what would appear to be material facts (but which may not have been in light of the above discussion), Crateo waived all inquiry into them even though its attention had been called to the missing exhibits by language in the letter agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">Finally, in consonance with the general principle underlying <em>McCarty, </em>another Texas case stands for the proposition that the parties to a contract are chargeable with such knowledge that the exercise of ordinary diligence would have revealed, and that a contract may not be avoided on the ground of a mistake of fact where it appears that ignorance of the fact was the result of carelessness, indifference, or inattention. Ebberts v. Carpenter Production Co., Tex.Civ.App. 1953, 256 S.W.2d 601. Certainly, Crateo\u2019s lack of knowledge about what it now asserts to be material facts is attributable to its own lack of initiative and to its own indifference.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-10\">In sum, Crateo cannot now complain that it was ignorant of material facts going to the essence of its contract with Southern. Nor can it be excused for its failure to exercise ordinary diligence. Simply stated, the defense of \u201cmistake of fact\u201d is not available to one who conducts himself as did Crateo. We therefore conclude that the contract here at issue is valid and enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-11\">III. Release.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-12\">Wilbur Clark, one of the makers of the note, died on August 27, 1965. His <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>domicile was in Nevada. On December 17, 1965, the statutory period for the filing of claims against the Nevada estate ended, and according to Nevada law any claim not filed within that time is \u201cforever barred.\u201d Neither Southern nor Crateo filed a claim on the note against Clark\u2019s Nevada estate within the statutory period.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">Crateo here contends that Southern\u2019s failure to file a timely claim in Nevada \u201creleased\u201d Wilbur Clark in violation of the contractual provision forbidding release and thereby absolved Crateo of any duty to perform under the agreement. The applicable portion of the note-purchase agreement reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-5\">\u201c[Southern] further agrees that during the term of this agreement it will not release any of the makers of The Note nor release the lien of the Deed of Trust securing same, except to the extent that credits by [Southern] upon its loan evidenced by The Note and made as a result either of payments received thereon or ' of [Southern\u2019s] failure for any reason to advance the full sum of $600,000.00 upon The Note, may by operation of law constitute such a release or releases.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">The district court found against Cra-teo, holding that no release had transpired. The primary thrust of the district court\u2019s view was that Crateo had as much right to file a claim in Nevada as did Southern since both claims were contingent, the note not being in default at the time of Clark\u2019s demise;</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">On the record before us there is no reason to presume that Crateo was unaware of Wilbur Clark\u2019s death. Nor does Crateo make that point on appeal. Had Crateo filed a claim, Wilbur Clark\u2019s Nevada estate would have been liable to undertake Clark\u2019s obligations under the note. The district court appropriately noted that the contract between Crateo and Southern contained a provision to the effect that Southern was under no duty to pursue a defaulting maker. Why, then, would Southern be required to file a contingent claim? In finding that no release had occurred, the district court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-9\">\u201cIn view of these contractual provisions and the facts and circumstances surrounding execution of the contract, I am persuaded that the failure to file a claim in the Nevada proceedings did not constitute a \u2018release\u2019 as that term was used in the note-purchase agreement * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-10\">317 F.Supp. 1184.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-11\">We can find no fault in the lower court\u2019s conclusion. The key point is that Southern\u2019s failure to act in no way foreclosed Crateo from pursuing the estate of Wilbur Clark in Nevada. Since Crateo claims no lack of knowledge of the death, it was incumbent upon Crateo to protect its own interests by filing a contingent claim in Nevada. Crateo makes much of the fact that the note-purchase agreement did not entitle it to compel Southern to turn over the note. Nonetheless, Crateo was aware that Southern might make demand upon it to purchase the note and that, in such a circumstance, it would be forced to look to the makers of the note to satisfy the underlying obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-12\">In light of the above discussion, we reach the conclusion that Southern\u2019s failure to file a claim against Clark\u2019s Nevada estate did not operate as a \u201crelease\u201d so as to relieve Crateo of its responsibility to perform on the note-purchase agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-13\">IV. Tender.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-14\">The note-purchase agreement contained a clause stating that Crateo would be obligated to purchase the note at Southern\u2019s request, \u201csubject to fulfillment of the following conditions precedent on or prior to the Closing Date as hereinafter defined * * The \u201cconditions precedent\u201d were itemized as \u201ctender or delivery\u201d of various documents. The agreement further defined the \u201cClosing Date\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-16\">\u201cthat date specified by [Southern] in its request to [Crateo] to purchase The Note as the date which [Crateo] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>shall be obligated to purchase The Note from [Southern], and pay [Southern] therefor, provided the conditions precedent to [Crateo\u2019s] obligation shall have been theretofore, or <em>shall contemporaneously therewith be, </em>satisfied and performed * * *.\u201d (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">At Austin, Texas, on February 4, 1966, the actual closing date denominated by Southern, Crateo failed to appear. At trial Crateo contended that Southern\u2019s failure to seek it out and to produce the specified documents in its presence made Southern\u2019s \u201ctender\u201d ineffectual and permitted Crateo not to purchase the note. Southern countered, arguing that its tender by telephone and telegram sufficed.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Whether Southern\u2019s telephone and telegraphic messages satisfy the requirement of \u201ctender\u201d depends on the construction given the contractual provisions. If \u201ctender or delivery\u201d was a \u201ccondition precedent,\u201d the law requires an \u201cabsolute tender\u201d by Southern. Failing such tender, liability to perform never attached to Crateo. Professor Wil-liston defines an absolute tender as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-7\">\u201cThere must be an unconditional offer to perform, coupled with a manifested ability to carry out the offer, <em>and a production of the subject matter of the tender * </em>* *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">6 Williston, The Law of Contracts \u00a7 1810 (Rev. ed. 1938) (emphasis supplied, footnote omitted). Clearly, Southern\u2019s \u201ctender\u201d does not rise to that level since the documents to be delivered were not placed in Crateo\u2019s presence. Accordingly, Crateo\u2019s point would be well taken that its liability to perform never materialized.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">However, the district court, in construing the contract here at issue, determined that \u201ctender or delivery\u201d was not a condition precedent, but that Southern\u2019s duty to make tender or delivery and Crateo\u2019s duty to purchase the note were concurrent conditions. It is a well-settled principle that where concurrent conditions are concerned the strict rules of tender applicable to an ordinary condition precedent fall by the wayside. Where concurrent conditions are involved, \u201ctender [means] only a readiness and willingness to perform, * * * with present ability to do so, and [with] notice to the other party of such readiness.\u201d 6 Williston, The Law of Contracts \u00a7 833 (3d ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-12\">The seminal inquiry, then, is whether the contract contemplated concurrent or precedent conditions. We find the district court\u2019s determination of that question to be correct \u2014 that the contract encompassed concurrent conditions. Actually, a concurrent condition is a hybrid form of a condition precedent. As Professor Williston has said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-13\">\u201cThe concurrency indicated by the phrase \u2018concurrent condition or conditions\u2019 is concurrency in time of the proposed or agreed performances of two mutual promisors, or of a prom-isor and promisee, not a concurrency of the performance of one with the liability of the other. \u2022 If two persons are bound to give concurrently, one a book and the other the price, neither party will be liable until performance has either been made or tendered by the other. But though the tender may be absolute, it need be only conditional, that is, subject to receiving concurrent performance from the other side. The obligation of each party, therefore, is subject to the condition precedent to liability thereon of either performance, or absolute or conditional tender, by the other side. Concurrent conditions, then, do not differ from conditions precedent in the relation of time which the happening of the condition bears to the duty of immediate performance on the contract. They are, indeed, mutual conditions precedent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-14\">5 Williston, The Law of Contracts \u00a7 666A (3d ed.) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-15\">In Echols v. Miller, Tex.Civ.App. 1920, 218 S.W. 48, the Texas courts recognized the validity of \u201cmutual conditions precedent.\u201d By the terms of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>contract itself \u201ctender or delivery\u201d by Southern could be performed simultaneously with payment by Crateo. These duties were \u201cconcurrent in time,\u201d to borrow a phrase from Williston. Put simply, the language in the contract can be read as establishing only concurrent conditions precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">One should particularly note the language in the provision defining \u201cClosing Date.\u201d The district court found that the clause, \u201cprovided the conditions precedent * * * shall have been theretofore, or shall be contemporaneously therewith be, satisfied and performed\u201d modified the phrase, \u201c[Crateo] shall be obligated to purchase * * * and pay for\u201d the note. That appears to be a logical reading of the contract. Such an interpretation does in fact establish concurrent conditions. Since Southern evinced that it was ready, willing and able to make an absolute tender, the law would not require that it actually do so. Its conditional tender was sufficient to fix Crateo\u2019s liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">V. Attorney\u2019s Fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">Subsequent to the foreclosure of the hotel in Austin, Texas, several law suits and numerous legal expenses were incurred by Southern. As best can be determined from the record on appeal the law firm of Andrews, Kurth, Campbell &amp; Jones billed Southern for nine items of expense incurred in Texas as a result of the foreclosure. Furthermore, various other law firms charged Southern for prosecution of a suit against the Estate of Wilbur Clark in Nevada.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">Although the district judge\u2019s opinion is not wholly clear, attorneys\u2019 fees seem to have been awarded on the following basis: $36,875 for the fees charged Southern by Andrews, Kurth, Campbell &amp; Jones, plus $6,143.40 for the fees charged Southern by various other law firms for services rendered in connection with the Nevada suit against the Estate of Wilbur Clark.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-9\">As a general principle it may be said that where a breach of contract has forced one of the contracting parties to maintain or to defend an action against a third person, he is entitled to recover, from the party breaching the contract, attorneys\u2019 fees and other expenses incurred in such litigation. 5 Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 1037 (1964 ed.); 25 C.J.S. Damages \u00a7 50e; Vaughan v. Atkinson, 4 Cir. 1961, 291 F.2d 813, rev\u2019d on other grounds 369 U.S. 527, 82 S.Ct. 997, 8 L.Ed.2d 888; Chittim v. Texas Pacific Coal &amp; Oil Co., 10 Cir. 1963, 317 F.2d 81. In the case at bar, we are bound by the <em>Erie </em>doctrine to apply the substantive law of the State of Texas. Though no Texas court has yet faced the question of third party litigation expenses as an element of damages in a breach of contract case, the court below noted that \u201cthe parties do not dispute the recoverability of the amounts claimed by [Southern] if such are properly established as damages.\u201d 317 F.Supp. at 1189.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-11\">Thus, three issues are presented with respect to the award of attorneys\u2019 fees in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-12\">A. Whether a sufficient evidentia-ry basis existed to warrant the district judge\u2019s conclusion that both the attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in Texas and those incurred in Nevada were proximately caused by Crateo\u2019s breach;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-13\">B. Whether a sufficient eviden-tiary basis existed to warrant the district judge\u2019s conclusion that no allocation was necessary with respect to the incidents and suits giving rise to the fees charged Southern by Andrews, Kurth, Campbell &amp; Jones; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-14\">C. Assuming the district court could validly conclude that the suit against the Estate of Wilbur Clark in Nevada was proximately caused by Crateo\u2019s breach, whether a sufficient evidentiary basis existed to warrant the district judge's allocation of attorneys\u2019 fees where admittedly some of the monies billed to Southern were in connection with a suit arising out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>of facts wholly unrelated to the transaction here under scrutiny.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-5\"> Although the burden is on the plaintiff to prove its damages, <em>e. g., </em>Bildon Farms, Inc. v. Ward County Water Improvement District No. 2, Tex. 1967, 415 S.W.2d 890, a showing of proximate cause need not rise to the level of proving that the defendant\u2019s breach was the sole cause of damage. <em>E. g., </em>Houston &amp; T. C. R. Co. v. Maxwell, 1910, 61 Tex.Civ.App. 80, 128 S.W. 160. Yet, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>there was uncontroverted evidence which would carry even that weighty burden. Thus, on an examination of the record, we conclude that there was an adequate basis upon which the trial judge could award $36,-875. Being a question of fact, the determination of proximate cause by the district court should not be reversed absent a showing of clear error.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">To the contrary, with regard to the award of $6,143.40 in attorneys\u2019 fees incurred by Southern in connection with litigation against the Estate of Wilbur Clark in Nevada, we think that the allocation was not justified. An award of that amount requires a two-step analysis. First, it must be shown that the litigation with the Clark Estate was proximately caused by Crateo\u2019s breach. Following the same line of reasoning as above, we find that Southern satisfied this aspect of its burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">However, unlike the award with respect to the $36,875 in attorneys\u2019 fees discussed above, a second element is here involved. It was admitted that Southern was billed a total of $13,041.41 in connection with litigation against the Clark Estate in Nevada. Furthermore, it was admitted that some part of that litigation was attributable to a cause of action wholly unrelated to Southern\u2019s claim against Crateo. Specifically, the suit against Clark\u2019s Estate sought recovery on the deficiency which remained after the foreclosure on the Austin hotel ($285,000) and recovery on another and unrelated note left unpaid by Clark ($320,000). There was little if any testimony which would tend to show how to allocate the $13,041.41 in attorneys\u2019 fees there involved. Apparently the trial judge employed the following formula:</p>\n<p id=\"b755-10\">285,000 + 320,000 * $16,041.41</p>\n<p id=\"b755-11\">$6,143.40, the sum which was awarded as attorneys\u2019 fees in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-12\"> Granted, the one seeking attorneys\u2019 fees as an element of damage need introduce only the best evidence obtainable in order to prevail. Bildon Farms, Inc. v. Ward County Water Improvement District No. 2, Tex.1967, 415 S.W.2d 890, 896-897. Nonetheless, the record fails to support a finding that Southern introduced the best evidence it could with respect to the litigation in Nevada. In-his testimony concerning the $36,875 award, one of Southern\u2019s attorneys noted that the most accurate way of determining the percentage of that sum attributable to each cause of action involved would be to look at the time sheets of the attorneys involved. Similarly that would seem to be the most appropriate method of allocating with respect to the fees charged for litigation against Clark\u2019s Nevada Estate. If no time records are available or if the Nevada suit presented only one legal issue despite that it comprised factually unrelated claims, then perhaps the most accurate method would be to allocate on the basis of the sums of money involved in the two distinct aspects of the suits. But, no such testimony was introduced. For that reason, the question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>of attorneys\u2019 fees awarded for litigation against Clark\u2019s Nevada estate is remanded for further proceedings to determine the proper method of allocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">In light of the above discussion, we affirm that part of the district court\u2019s judgment awarding Southern National Bank $236,875 ($200,000 in liquidated damages and $36,875 for attorneys\u2019 fees) plus interest from the date of Crateo\u2019s breach. The award of $6,143.40 in attorneys\u2019 fees for Southern\u2019s litigation with Wilbur Clark\u2019s Nevada estate is vacated, and the question of the proper allocation of the $13,041.40 in attorneys\u2019 fees billed Southern in connection with that litigation is remanded for further consideration by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Affirmed in part and in part vacated and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b749-13\">. February 4, 1966, was the last day that Southern could exercise its option to compel Crateo to perform under the note-purchase agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b749-14\">. Exhibit \u201cA\u201d was to be a promissory note made by Blakeway-Ward Enterprises payable to Southern.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-17\">Exhibit \u201cB\u201d was to be a copy of the deed of trust.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay0q\">Exhibit \u201cC\u201d was to be a copy of the construction loan agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-W\">Exhibit \u201cD\u201d was to be a copy of the plans and specifications of the hotel to be built.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A46\">Exhibit \u201cE\u201d was to be the certificate of completion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AG8\">Exhibit \u201cF\u201d was to be the subordination agreement.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b751-6\">. In a letter elated July 2, 1964, Ward stated to Crateo,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-7\">\u201cIt is our intention by January 1, 1965, to present you with written evidence that we have accomplished our goal of obtaining a first mortgage of Three Million, Three Hundred Thousand Dollars ($3,300,000.00), or a second lien to substitute for your commitment. * * * * Furthermore, in any event we guarantee you will not have to perform in respect to your commitment.\u201d (App. 38).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-13\">On this basis Moody presumed that Cra-teo would not have to perform. However, the district court found that Moody\u2019s expectation of not having to perform did not amount to fraud. Though Crateo assumed that there was little probability of its having to purchase the note, it would nevertheless have been willing to do so if the note-purchase agreement were enforceable and if demand were made.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b755-13\">. With respect to the Nevada litigation, Southern was charged $13,041.41 in attorneys\u2019 fees for litigation with the Estate of Wilbur Clark. The suit against that Estate sought recovery not only for the deficiency on Wilbur Clark\u2019s note for sums borrowed in connection with the funding of the hotel in Austin, Texas (the note which Crateo had agreed to \u201ctake over\u201d), but also on another note for $320,-000 made by Wilbur Clark and payable to Southern. The $320,000 indebtedness had no relation to the suit here at bar, concerned an entirely separate and distinct financial transaction, and in no way involved Crateo.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b756-7\">RIVES, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AOb\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"AB-P\">Regretfully I find myself unable to concur. First, I am not persuaded that an enforceable contract existed between Southern and Crateo to the extent that Crateo was obligated to perform where the hotel was totally financed. Second, even if Crateo was obligated to perform in such circumstances, there has been no showing that Southern, though willing, was able to tender the required documents on February 4, 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">1. <em>The Contract.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">The majority follows the reasoning of the district court which it correctly states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-10\">\u201cThe district court reasoned that even assuming Moody never saw part of the agreement, he signed a document which included the following clause:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-11\">\u201c \u2018[Crateo] has heretofore examined, and hereby approves, the form of the instruments or documents attached hereto as exhibits and agrees that delivery to it of said instruments or doe-uments in such form duly executed by the party or parties required by the form thereof to execute said instruments or documents shall satisfy any condition or conditions to its obligations hereunder which relate to the execution or delivery of such instruments or documents.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-14\">\u201cOn the authority of that clause, the district judge held that \u2018a party who signs a contract intending to be bound but [who] fails to read it is obligated according to its terms * * *.'\"<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-16\">The rule binding one to an agreement which is presented to him but which he does not read has not been applied where the party against whom recovery is sought never saw part of the so-called agreement. It is a well-settled principle that a contract is unenforceable where material terms are omitted. The omissions here alleged cannot be cured, in my opinion, by reference to the general assurance which says merely that Crateo has \u201cexamined * * * the instruments or documents <em>attached hereto as exhibits </em>* * (Emphasis supplied.) In short, such a statement does not run to exhibits which were neither then nor in the future appropriately attached or made known to Crateo. Southern could not rely upon such a representation when it knew that Crateo had not seen the crucial attachments.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-18\">Nonetheless, the majority is willing to enforce the contract on a theory that Crateo waived the materiality of knowing that the hotel was totally financed. I agree that, by failing to inquire, Cra-teo to some extent waived the significance of the missing facts. <em>Cf. </em>Ebberts v. Carpenter Production Co., Tex.Civ. App.1953, 256 S.W.2d 601; Houston &amp; T. C. R. Co. v. McCarty, 1901, 94 Tex. 298, 60 S.W. 429. Crateo agreed to be bound by all the terms included in the letter portion of the note-purchase agreement, which Moody actually did see, and in effect to be bound by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>facts disclosed in the missing attachments to the extent that they did not vary from the letter portion of the agreement. In determining which facts Cra-teo waived knowledge of, it therefore becomes important carefully to peruse the language of the letter which Moody saw and signed. Each of the missing exhibits was cursorily described in the letter portion of the agreement by a caption. The exhibits here important were the \u201cDeed of Trust,\u201d certain \u201cPlans and Specifications\u201d for the proposed hotel, and a \u201cConstruction Loan Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">By failing to inquire as to the particulars of each of those documents Crateo waived knowledge of its contents, but only to a limited extent. In essence, Crateo became bound by any facts or terms disclosed in each document which a reasonable man in Crateo\u2019s position could anticipate as within the scope of the exhibit as described in the letter. For example, Crateo was bound to accept any building which reasonably purported to be a \u201chotel.\u201d Whether the completed hotel conformed with the \u201cPlans and Specifications\u201d set out in that exhibit was waived by Crateo. Similarly, Crateo waived knowledge of the precise terms of the \u201cDeed of Trust.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">However, the terms of the \u201cConstruction Loan Agreement\u201d are crucial and require, I think, a finding on the facts of this case that Moody\u2019s failure to inquire into its particulars did not bind Crateo to accept the terms of that exhibit. The letter portion of the note-purchase agreement which Moody signed did not in any manner disclose that, under the \u201cConstruction Loan Agreement,\u201d Southern would lend money not merely to pay the cost of building the hotel but also to cover the purchase price of the land and some $72,000 in commitment fees for both the interim and the permanent financing. To the contrary, at least one portion of the letter signed by Moody would indicate that land costs were not contemplated. In section (2) (e) of the letter, Southern particularized the nature of the construction expenses to be incurred. None of those expenses related to the cost of acquiring the land. In short, the letter agreement failed to disclose that the project was to be \u201ctotally financed\u201d \u2014 that the borrowers were investing no capital. A reasonable man reading the phrase, \u201cConstruction Loan Agreement,\u201d along with the other provisions of the letter would not suspect that part of the loan in issue was to cover the land expenses and the commitment fees. Crateo waived precise knowledge of the specifics of the \u201cConstruction Loan Agreement\u201d but not to such an extent that the agreement might transcend its description in the letter. Crateo\u2019s waiver did not establish silent acceptance of an agreement whereby the borrowers were to contribute nothing and the so-called construction loan was to cover not only the costs of construction but also the cost of the land and of some $72,000 in commitment fees ($33,-000 to Southern itself to secure the interim financing plus $39,000 to the permanent lenders to secure the take-out agreements).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">Crateo had every reason to believe that it would obtain a second lien both on a hotel, the construction costs of which amounted to $3,300,000, and on a piece of land of some value, although the actual value of the land was unknown to Crateo, and Crateo waived lack of such knowledge by its failure to make inquiry. In reality Crateo received a second lien on a building costing $2,628,000 and on a parcel of land costing $600,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">It was Southern\u2019s duty to inform Cra-teo that the \u201cConstruction Loan Agreement\u201d encompassed a loan for something other than that which would be implied by the plain meaning of its title construed in connection with all the terms of the letter contract. Admittedly, Southern did prepare a document which actually disclosed that the project was totally financed. However, Crateo never saw the document. Exhibit \u201cC,\u201d the \u201cConstruction Loan Agreement,\u201d was sent to Blakeway and, we assume, it was Southern\u2019s expectation that Blakeway would channel it through Ward to Crateo. Neither Blakeway nor Ward was an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>agent of Crateo such that delivery to either of them was tantamount to delivery to Crateo.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus Southern should bear the consequences of Crateo\u2019s failure actually to see the \u201cConstruction Loan Agreement.\u201d At trial two representatives of Crateo testified that at no time prior to the expiration of the note-purchase agreement had Crateo received a copy of the \u201cConstruction Loan Agreement.\u201d That testimony went unchallenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">In sum, though to some extent Crateo waived knowledge of the specific terms of the missing attachments, that waiver did not encompass the terms of the \u201cConstruction Loan Agreement\u201d actually drafted by Southern. Since Southern failed to apprise Crateo that the hotel was being totally funded and since this fact was obviously material to the risk assumed by Crateo in agreeing to accept a second mortgage as security, Cra-teo\u2019s contract did not obligate it to purchase the $600,000 note.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">2. <em>Tender.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">I agree with the reasoning of the majority that if the contract required Cra-teo\u2019s purchase of the $600,000 note, tender and delivery of the specified documents by Southern was not a condition precedent. Since the contract embodied concurrent conditions rather than a strict condition precedent, Southern was obligated to show only that it was ready, willing and able to make tender. Southern\u2019s telephone and telegraphic messages to Crateo on the last day of the contract\u2019s term, February 4, 1966, evinced its willingness to make the necessary tender, but there was not, in my opinion, sufficient proof of Southern\u2019s <em>ability </em>to make the actual tender before the end of that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">Thus, even if I could accept the majority\u2019s view that a valid, enforceable contract existed obligating Crateo to purchase the $600,000 note, I would vote to remand the case to the district court for a finding as to Southern\u2019s ability to make the necessary tender prior to the expiration of the contract. Only if such ability existed could the contract be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-12\">In summary, while some contract existed between Southern and Crateo, the terms of that contract, reasonably construed in accordance with all of the then existing circumstances, did not obligate Crateo to purchase the $600,000,, note. If that is correct, the judgment should be reversed with directions to enter judgment for Crateo. If the contract obligated Crateo to purchase the $600,000 note, then the case should be remanded for a finding as to Southern\u2019s ability to make the necessary tender before the contract expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-13\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b756-12\">. Note that under that rule Crateo is \u201cobligated according to its terms,\u201d that is the terms of the signed contract. I think that this case turns upon the true meaning of those terms.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b758-8\">. The district court stated that if Ward was the agent of either Southern or Cra-teo, lie was an agent of Crateo. It seems clear that Ward, and for that matter Blakeway, was not Crateo\u2019s agent. Rather, they were independent third parties\u2014 mere conduits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
