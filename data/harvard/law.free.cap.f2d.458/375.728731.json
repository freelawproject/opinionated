Wilson, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b434-7\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">We consider a direct appeal from a jury conviction of knowingly making a material false statement in connection with the acquisition of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a) (6), and of knowingly possessing a firearm after having been convicted of a felony, in violation of 18 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1202(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">The material false statement appears in a \u201cFirearms Transaction Record\u201d completed on February 3, 1971, when appellant purchased the firearm. On that date, appellant, who could neither read nor write, entered Gilbert\u2019s Gun Shop, in Knox County, Kentucky. Clayton Gilbert, the proprietor, testified at trial that he filled out the form for which he obtained information by making reference to appellant\u2019s driver\u2019s license and by asking him questions. Appellant, who admits that he had been convicted of a felony, asserts, as he did at trial, that he was unaware of Titles IV and VII of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act and contends that Gilbert did not read the form to him or otherwise inform him of its content. However, there is no question that the form contains material false information and bears appellant\u2019s signature. The government\u2019s case was clearly made out unless Gilbert was lying about the oral exchange between himself and Brown. In finding appellant guilty of both offenses, the jury must have credited Gilbert\u2019s testimony that he had asked Brown the required questions and that Brown had responded falsely. That determination of credibility was within the province of the jury. Accordingly, since there is substantial evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict, it will be sustained. Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-15\">Nevertheless, appellant\u2019s conviction of possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1202(a) cannot stand. We observe that the Government failed to charge in the indictment that the firearm was possessed in commerce or affecting commerce.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Since appellant\u2019s conviction, the statute has been construed to require the inclusion of a nexus with commerce in the indictment and proof thereof. United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 92 S.Ct. 515, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971); United States v. Wilson, 456 F.2d 1042 (6th Cir. 1972). Accordingly, on our own motion, we vacate the judgment of conviction and sentence for possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-16\">The conviction of making a material false statement in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a) (6) is affirmed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b434-11\">. Count 2 of the indictment charged: Title 18, App. Section 1202(a), U.S.C. The Grand Jury Further Charges:</p>\n<p id=\"b434-13\">That on or about the 3rd day of February, 1971, in Bell County, in the Eastern District of Kentucky, Douglas MacArthur Brown having been convicted of a felony as is fully set out in Count I of this indietment, wilfully and knowingly possessed a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. App. 1202(a) . . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b434-18\">. The Supreme Court, in United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336 (1971), 92 S.Ct. 515, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 found it unnecessary to discuss the constitutionality of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202(a). The constitutionality of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a) (6) was neither raised nor discussed by the parties in this case, and we do not pass upon it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
