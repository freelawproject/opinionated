This is a retention classification indicating an intention to retain the land in public ownership. On September 23, 1970, a \u201cNotice of Classification of Public Lands for Multiple Use Management, and for Disposal\u201d was published. This notice indicated some 10,000 acres were subject to disposal under 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1421 et seq., and was in excess of the notice contained in the Proposed Classification. On December 15, 1970, \u201cNotice of Modification of Classification\u201d was published to correct the erroneous classification by eliminating the 10,000 acres classified for disposal and reinstating the acreage to the original Multiple Use Management Classification. This classification became final under 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1418 on December 20, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-18\">Appellant filed suit on January 3,1971, contending the modification by appellees of the classification comprising the 10,-000 acres classified for disposal was ineffective for failure to comply with notice requirements, as an abuse of discretion, and in violation of an asserted prior agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-19\">The trial court, in its Memorandum Decision,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> clearly and correctly bottoms the Order of Dismissal of the action on plaintiff\u2019s lack of standing to sue and the absence of jurisdiction of the court to become involved in controversies committed to administrative discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-20\">We are in full accord with the reasoning and results of that Memorandum Decision, and affirm the case on the basis of that reported decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b573-21\">. 340 F.Supp. 1306 (D.C.Utah 1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
