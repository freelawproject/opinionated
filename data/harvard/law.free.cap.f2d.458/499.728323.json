The decisions by the Trial Examiner adopted by the Board, that the driver was discharged for engaging in concerted activities and that the reason given by the Cab Company to explain the discharge was a pretext, that the Cab Company was engaged in interstate commerce, and his further decision that the owner-driver was not an independent contractor, each represent credibility choices supported by substantial evidence. Our scope of review does not permit us to disturb these legitimate credibility choices.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-12\">The decision and order of the National Labor Relations Board is</p>\n<p id=\"b558-13\">Enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b558-9\">.
