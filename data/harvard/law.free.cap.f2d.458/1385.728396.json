A hair shampoo preparation consisting essentially of about 10% to about 30% by weight of a water-soluble organic detergent selected from the group consisting of water-soluble anionic and non-ionic synthetic detergents, the said concentration of said detergent being such as would normally impart substantial eye sting and irritation characteristics to said preparation ; and an agent for substantially reducing said eye sting and irritation characteristics exhibited by the preparation, said agent consisting of about 1% to 3%, by weight, of lanolin oil solubilized by from 1 to 4 parts, per part of the lanolin oil, of a polyoxy-ethylene ether of lanolin alcohol ethoxylated with 16 mols of ethylene oxide.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1444-16\">Dependent claim 13 adds that 2-3 parts of an alkanolamide of a higher fatty acid, per part of lanolin oil, are admixed with the polyoxyethylene ether. According to the specification, the alkanolam-ide contributes to the water solubilization function of the polyoxyethylene ether of lanolin alcohol, and the mixture of the two lanolin solubilizers also helps provide clear, transparent shampoo preparations not obtainable when lanolin oil is mulsified in the detergent solution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-17\">The board affirmed the examiner\u2019s rejection of claims 12 and 13 as obvious in view of Wei<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> considered with Wagner<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Siegel.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Wei discloses aqueous shampoo compositions which contain lanolin oil solubilized by alkanolamides of higher fatty acids. Another solubilizing agent may be combined with the alkanolamide in order that the alkanolamide itself may be sufficiently water-solubilized to form a clear solution, and also to aid in solubilizing the lanolin in the alkanolamide. Among such other solubilizing agents, a class of nonionic surfactants or detergents known as \u201cpolyoxyethylene ethers of higher aliphatic alcohols\u201d is mentioned. According to Wei, lanolin had been extensively used in suspended or emulsified form in vari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1387\">*1387</page-number>ous cosmetic preparations because of its emollient characteristics, prior to his discovery of a way of water-solubilizing it. Wei employs .05 to 5% by weight lanolin in his composition, together with 0.25 to 20% by weight alkanolamide and 10 to 30% by weight detergent. He further states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1445-4\">* * * A preferred embodiment is a clear transparent aqueous composition comprising about 0.05 to 5%, preferably up to 1%, of lanolin, about 0.25 to 20%, of said amide compound, the ratio of said amide to lanolin from about 2:1 to 100:1 and a minor proportion of a water-soluble organic surface active agent in an aqueous medium. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1445-6\">Wagner discusses lanolin and its various derivatives, including \u201clanolin alcohols\u201d and \u201cethoxylated lanolins.\u201d He discloses that lanolin alcohols are obtained by hydrolysis of the esters comprising lanolin itself. Under the heading \u201cEthoxylated Lanolins,\u201d Wagner states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1445-7\">Water-soluble forms of lanolin are obtained by reacting it with ethylene oxide, thus forming a polyoxyethylene chain. A side reaction takes place simultaneously causing hydrolysis of the lanolin esters and formation of po-lyoxyethylene glycol ethers of lanolin alcohols. The degree of water solubility of the adduct is determined by the molecular proportion of ethylene oxide absorbed by the lanolin.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1445-8\">Wagner further points out that \u201cethoxy-lated lanolins\u201d are non-ionic surfactants which are water soluble, function as so-lubilizers, \u201cimpart emollience in aqueous form and are particularly effective in shampoos.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-9\">Like the board, we find it unnecessary to discuss Siegel beyond noting that it describes the use in hairgrooming preparations of polyoxyethylene ethers of higher aliphatic alcohols which include the degree of ethoxylation recited in present claim 12. It also describes \u201clanolin alcohol\u201d as \u201can excellent emollient.\u201d Appellant does not now appear to rely on the claimed degree of ethoxylation for patentability, nor did he below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-12\">In light of the disclosures of the references previously outlined, the board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1445-13\">We can perceive nothing unobvious in the utilization of the \u201cethoxylated lanolins\u201d of Wagner as the non-ionic surfactant in the Wei composition, particularly since the \u201cethoxylated lanolins\u201d of Wagner fall within the category of polyoxyethylene ethers of higher aliphatic alcohols named by Wei and Wagner suggests the use of \u201cethoxylated lanolins\u201d in shampoos. The teachings of the two references fit together perfectly, and the suggestion in one complements perfectly the suggestion in the other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1445-14\">Recently, in In re Russell, 58 CCPA 1081, 439 F.2d 1228 (1971), this court had before it claims very similar to present claim 13, both in ingredients recited and amounts thereof, which were rejected on prior art including the Wei patent relied on here. All claims on appeal, including claim 1 reproduced in the <em>RusseU </em>opinion, additionally recited that the composition was initially clear and transparent as produced without requiring filtration. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1445-15\">* * * appellant contends that the prior art does not suggest the combining of two lanolin-solubilizing agents, viz., a polyoxyethylene ether of lanolin condensed with 16 mols of ethylene oxide <em>and </em>a higher fatty acid alkano-lamide. We disagree. Appellant admits that \u201cOne of the surface active lanolin derivatives referred to in the Conrad et al publication is polyoxy-ethylene ether of lanolin alcohol condensed with 16 mols of ethylene oxide.\u201d Since Wei teaches that the combining of a higher fatty acide alkylo-lamide and a surface active agent is desirable, that \u201cany suitable surface active agent may be employed,\u201d and that these include non-ionic agents including \u201cpolyoxyethylene ethers of higher aliphatic alcohols,\u201d it would appear that the mere combining of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1388\">*1388</page-number>particular higher fatty acid alkano-lamide and the surfactant shown in Conrad would have been obvious, in the absence of unexpectedly superior results or other evidence of non-obviousness. There is no evidence here that the mere selection of the ingredients was unobvious.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1446-4\">Appellant seeks to avoid the applicability of that holding to the present situation by arguing, in the first instance, that the \u201cethoxylated lanolins\u201d of Wagner \u2014 the reference the Patent Office has used here in place of Conrad in the previous <em>Russell </em>case \u2014 are not in fact po-lyoxyethylene ethers of lanolin alcohols or equitable therewith. It is appellant\u2019s position, stated variously throughout his briefs, that Wagner does not disclose, refer to, or otherwise suggest polyoxy-ethylene ethers of lanolin alcohols, or their use for any purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-5\">We cannot agree. Appellant\u2019s argument has skirted the pertinent disclosure of Wagner under the heading \u201cEthoxy-lated Lanolins,\u201d quoted above, and his failure to acknowledge that disclosure here is in marked contrast to the position he took below<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> when Wagner was first cited by the examiner. Manifestly, \u201cethoxylated lanolins\u201d include a large proportion of polyoxyethylene ethers of lanolin alcohols derived from the hydrolysis of the lanolin esters and concomitant reaction of the resultant lanolin alcohols with ethylene oxide. As in <em>Russell, </em>we think that the combining of two particluar lanolin-solubilizing agents \u2014 a polyoxyethylene ether of lanolin alcohol and a higher fatty acid alkanolamide\u2014 would have been obvious in view of the cited prior art, in the absence of other evidence of non-obviousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-6\">That brings us to appellant\u2019s second line of argument. In the earlier <em>Russell </em>case, this court reversed the rejection of the claimed subject matter based on appellant\u2019s rebuttal evidence of non-obviousness directed to the unexpected nature of the clarity \u201cwithout filtration\u201d feature recited in the claims. The present claims contain no limitation relating to clarity \u201cwithout filtration,\u201d the record is barren of evidence relating to such clarity, and appellant has not relied on that feature to impart patentability to his claims. What appellant does rely on here is another, allegedly unexpected, advantageous property alluded to in claim 12 \u2014 that the solubilized lanolin oil reduces eye sting and irritation normally associated with hair shampoo preparations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-10\">We do not understand the tribunals of the Patent Office to challenge appellant\u2019s assertion, supported by factual and opinion data in his specification, that his shampoos containing solubilized lanolin oils do produce a reduction in eye sting and irritation in comparison with conventional shampoos not containing those particular solubilized lanolin oils. The board was of the view, however, that shampoos containing ethoxylated lanolins would be <em>expected </em>to be less irritating in light of Wagner's disclosure that those materials \u201cimpart emollience in aqueous form.\u201d While appellant fails to see the pertinence or relevance of that disclosure of Wagner to reduced eye sting or irritation, we think that it is pertinent. As noted earlier in this opinion, appellant states that sting and irritation effects are produced on the cornea and conjunctiva areas of the eye. The \u201ccornea\u201d is defined as \u201cThe transparent part of the coat of the eyeball which covers the iris and pupil and admits light to the interior. The cornea is covered externally by the ectodermic conjunctival epithelium * * *.\" Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, 2nd Edition (1954). Similarly, the \u201cconjunctiva\u201d is defined by that authority as \u201cthe mucous membrane which lines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1389\">*1389</page-number>the inner surface of the eyelids and is reflected over the forepart of the eyeball, covering part of the sclerotic coat and forming an epithelium over the cornea.\u201d Finally, an emollient is a substance which is \u201csoothing to the skin or mucous membrane.\u201d In light of those definitions, and the known emollient effect of lanolin, lanolin alcohol and ethox-ylated lanolins comprising polyoxyethy-lene ethers of lanolin alcohol, we think the board\u2019s conclusion, that appellant\u2019s solubilized lanolin oil would be expected to reduce shampoo irritation and sting of the mucous membranes of the eye, is a reasonable one. Appellant\u2019s arguments, unsupported by evidence contrary to the position of the board, have not persuaded us of error in that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1447-5\">The decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1447-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1444-13\">.
