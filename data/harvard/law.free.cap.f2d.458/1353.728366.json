He was acquitted by a jury of the assault charge but was convicted on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1354\">*1354</page-number>remaining counts and sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-4\">Hopkins raises two points on appeal. He first contends that the failure of the trial court to administer the oath to the jury until after the government had presented its case was reversible error. No objection was made to the tardy swearing of the jury and the trial continued. Neither party has cited, nor has our research revealed any federal case in which a similar problem has arisen.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, our review of various state decisions reveals that other courts have held such claimed error to be harmless.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We are in full agreement. No prejudice has been shown by the delayed swearing of the jury, no objection was made, and the oath was administered before the jury retired to begin its deliberations. Given all of these circumstances, any error was clearly harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-5\">Hopkins second contention is that the evidence was insufficient to justify the conviction for possession of an unregistered still. However, Hopkins failed to move for acquittal at the close of all the evidence. In such a case our review of the sufficiency of the evidence is limited to a determination of whether there has occurred a \u201cmanifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We have held that such a miscarriage would exist only if it appears that the record is \u201cdevoid of evidence pointing to guilt.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Upon a careful review of the record, giving particular attention to the deficiencies in the evidence alleged by Hopkins, we are convinced that the evidence before the jury was not such as to render the guilty verdict a manifest miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1412-6\">. <em>See generally </em>Lowenstein v.
