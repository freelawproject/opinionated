Bowen, Inc. (Bowen), a freight forwarding agent, liable to plaintiff-appellee, Orient Mid-East Lines, an ocean carrier, for breach of an oral contract of affreightment.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-23\">Orient commenced the action against Bowen for breach of contract and Gener<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>al Motors Corporation for tortious interference with the contract, alleging damages suffered when a shipment of ten dump trucks from New York to Calcutta was withdrawn by the shipper, General Motors Company. Blackwood Hodge (India) Pvt., Ltd., the consignee and Bowen\u2019s principal, was added as a party defendant. Blackwood\u2019s motion to dismiss was denied, 297 F.Supp. 1149, it failed to answer, and a default judgment was entered. In the memorandum opinion holding Bowen liable the court dismissed the complaint against General Motors.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">\n<em>Factual Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">During the summer of 1963 Black-wood began negotiations with General Motors for the purchase of earth moving equipment and trucks. In November, 1963 General Motors received a purchase order from Blackwood for the trucks involved in this litigation. Blackwood was to arrange for the shipment of the trucks and selected Bowen as freight forwarder.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Eagle Ocean Transport, Inc. (Eagle) was Orient\u2019s agent in New York. The negotiations concerning the contract in question were conducted by James Mu-laradelis (known in the trade as Mu-lara), an employee of Eagle, on behalf of Orient, and Joseph A. Lobe on behalf of Bowen.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">The negotiations culminated in an oral agreement that Orient would provide a ship to carry the ten dump trucks to Calcutta at a lump sum freight rate of $4,234.00 apiece. Mulara testified that the date of the telephone conversation in which they arrived at this agreement was February 10, 1964. Lobe testified, and the court found, that the date of the oral agreement was January 30, 1964. The court found further that on February 10 Lobe told Mulara the shipment was ready, and Mulara \u201cgave Lobe the name of the vessel, \u2018Orient Mariner\u2019, with a date of March 23, 1964.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-12\">On or about February 10, 1964 Mu-lara made a handwritten memorandum (Ex. 3) and had his secretary type a written contract (Ex. 1) which was dated February 10, 1964. He sent the original and a copy to Lobe. Sometime between February 10 and February 14 Mulara was informed that Lobe had not received the contract. He then sent Lobe an identical contract (Ex. 2), except that the second contract was dated February 14, 1964. Lobe testified that he received and read the first contract. Both contracts named Bowen as the contracting party<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and contained a reference to \u201con deck\u201d shipment. There is a conflict in the testimony of Mulara and Lobe with respect to the inclusion of the \u201con deck\u201d provision, which will be discussed later herein. On or about February 18, 1964 Bowen learned that General Motors would not release the trucks for shipment on Orient\u2019s vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-13\">The court found that the next time Lobe and Mulara discussed the contract (after February 10) was on February 28, 1964 and with respect to this conversation said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-14\">\u201cLobe said he was trying to get the cargo to the pier, but that General Motors would not release it. This was the first time that Mularadelis knew that General Motors was the shipper. In the same conversation Mularadelis ascertained for the first time the name of the consignee, who was Bowen\u2019s principal. Efforts were then made to have the consignee put pressure on General Motors to send the trucks on plaintiff\u2019s vessel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-15\">These efforts were unsuccessful and Orient\u2019s ship sailed without the cargo. The trucks were later shipped via another carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-16\">Two issues are presented on this appeal: (1) whether there was a binding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>oral contract, and (2) whether Bowen is liable as agent of an undisclosed principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">\n<em>Was There a Binding Oral Contract?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">With respect to the first issue the district court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">\u201cThe question then is whether there was an enforceable contract entered into by Mularadelis and Lobe on behalf of their respective employers. The answer is simple since Lobe testified that an oral booking is the ordinary practice in this situation and it is binding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-7\">\u201cLobe\u2019s employer does not question his authority to make these bookings. * * * It questions whether there was an agreement to all the material elements of the contract. I find that there was such agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">Appellant contends that no contract was entered into because \u201cthere was no agreement on all of the proposed material terms.\u201d Specifically, it is argued that Lobe did not at any time agree that the trucks would be shipped \u201con deck\u201d and that Mulara\u2019s memorandum and proposed contracts containing the term \u201con deck\u201d must be considered as a counteroffer which was not accepted by Bowen.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">There is a sharp conflict in the testimony of Mulara and Lobe as to whether the \u201con deck\u201d provision was discussed in the conversation of January 30 (or February 10 according to Mulara\u2019s recollection), which was considered by both Mu-lara and Lobe as a firm booking. Mu-lara testified positively that the provision was discussed and that Lobe agreed to shipment of the trucks on deck on Orient\u2019s vessel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Lobe testified that there was no mention of the \u201con deck\u201d term in that conversation or in any prior negotiations and that he did not at any time agree that the trucks would be shipped on deck.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-21\">Mulara testified further that the written contract, Exhibit 1, encompassed all of the terms of his prior oral agreement with Lobe. It is undisputed that Lobe did not at any time discuss with Mulara the inclusion of the \u201con deck\u201d term in the written contract. Lobe testified that he did not take much note of the on deck provision in the contract because he was not sure he was going to get the shipment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-22\">The district court found that the parties reached an oral agreement on all the material terms of the contract and that they intended to be bound by that agreement. According due weight to the trial court\u2019s appraisal of the credibility of the witnesses, we are satisfied that these findings are not clearly erroneous. See Smith v. Onyx Oil &amp; Chemical Co., 218 F.2d 104, 108 (3 Cir.1955). With those two facts established, it is clear that a binding contract was created. 1 Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 30 at 98-99 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>\n<em>May Appellant be Held Liable as Agent for an Undisclosed Principal?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Orient concedes that Mulara \u201cknew Bowen was a freight forwarder and that as such acted as agent for someone.\u201d Mulara had heard of Blackwood Hodge and knew the nature of its business. He knew that Bowen\u2019s principal was in Calcutta. He was positive throughout his testimony, however, that he did not know that Blackwood was Bowen\u2019s principal. The written freight contract which Mulara prepared on February 10 (Ex. 1) did not contain the name of Blackwood but showed Bowen as the contracting party.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Lobe had a notation that he informed Mulara on February 28 that Blackwood Hodge was involved. He testified that he \u201ccould have\u201d mentioned Blackwood\u2019s name prior to January 30. He was \u201cnot sure.\u201d He did not recall when Mulara learned about the problems with General Motors; nor did he recall Mulara ever asking him who his principal was prior to February 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">There is ample evidence to support the finding of the district court that, \u201cAt the time that Mularadelis was negotiating with Lobe and up to February 28th he knew that Bowen was acting as an agent, but he did not know the name of the principal, nor did he have reason to know it.\u201d The court continued: \u201cIn such circumstances, an agent for an undisclosed principal is liable for breach of a contract just as though he was the principal. Restatement, Second, Agency \u00a7\u00a7 4, 321.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">Restatement of Agency, 2d, \u00a7 4 reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-11\">\u201c(2) If the other party has notice that the agent is or may be acting for a principal but has no notice of the principal\u2019s identity, the principal for whom the agent is acting is a partially disclosed principal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-12\">\u00a7 321 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-13\">\u201cUnless otherwise agreed, a person purporting to make a contract with another for a partially disclosed principal is a party to the contract.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUf\">This court has cited \u00a7 321 of the Restatement with approval in a number of cases (and followed the rule that the agent must disclose the name of his principal even prior to the First Restatement). The decisions in this circuit were summarized in Cleary Brothers v. Christie Scow Corporation, 215 F.2d 740, 743-744 (2 Cir.1954):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-14\">\u201cThe case of Horan v. Hughes, D.C., 129 F. 248, affirmed by us at 129 F. 1005, involved a suit in admiralty where the defense was the same as the one asserted in the instant ease. The trial court, in speaking of the agent, stated that, \u2018To maintain such a defense, he must prove that he disclosed the name of his principal. It is not sufficient that he was acting as agent, or that the other party to the contract supposed he was acting as agent, if he did not know who the principal was.\u2019 Judge Swan, in Dupont v. United States, 2 Cir., 83 F.2d 951, 953, affirmed 300 U.S. 150, 57 S.Ct. 391, 81 L.Ed. 570, declared the principle clearly as follows: \u2018Ordinarily, it is true, one who acts as an agent does not become personally bound on a contract which he makes for a disclosed principal; but if he fails to divulge the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>name of his principal; he does become a party to the contract. American Law Inst. Restatement of Agency, \u00a7\u00a7 320-322.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-4\">\u201cThe agent must disclose his principal at or before the time when the contractual agreement is made final. Judge Augustus N. Hand, in Propstra v. Dyer, 2 Cir., 189 F.2d 810, 812, remarked that, \u2018It appears settled that, in the absence of some custom or agreement of the parties to the contrary, <em>an agent is liable in a contract that is closed before the name of the principal is revealed to </em>the other contracting party for the latter is assumed to have relied on the agent\u2019s credit in making the agreement.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis in opinion.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">The New York Courts also have held in a long line of decisions that a person who enters into a contract as an agent without disclosing the name of his principal becomes liable thereon even though the agent is known to be acting for another. See e.g. Argersinger v. MacNaughton, 114 N.Y. 535, 21 N.E. 1022 (1889); McClure v. Central Trust Co., 165 N.Y. 108, 58 N.E. 777 (1900); Special Sections, Inc. v. Rappaport Company, 25 A.D.2d 896, 269 N.Y.S.2d 319 (3d Dept.1966). While it may be sufficient if the principal is sufficiently identified, rather than named, Unger v. Travel Arrangements, Inc., 25 A.D.2d 40, 266 N.Y.S.2d 715 (1st Dept.1966), \u201cKnowledge of the real principal is the test, and this means actual knowledge, not suspicion.\u201d Ell Dee Clothing Co. v. Marsh, 247 N.Y. 392, 160 N.E. 651, 653 (1928).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Appellant contends, however, that in view of the nature of the transaction Orient had \u201ca duty to inquire concerning the name of Bowen\u2019s principal\u201d and that while the district court recognized this issue during the trial his opinion \u201cdid not deal with it at all.\u201d Appellant argues that the duty to inquire applies with special force to freight forwarders, referring to the understanding \u201cby all that freight forwarders act exclusively, as agents for others\u201d and to the customs and usages of the shipping industry generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-12\">It is clear that the district court recognized this issue and in fact called counsel\u2019s attention to the necessity of proof to support his contention that the custom in the industry or the nature of the transaction required a variation from the normal rule and imposed upon the carrier the duty to ascertain the name of the freight forwarder\u2019s principal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Bowen failed to prove any custom or usage to establish such a duty. The mere fact that a freight forwarder acts \u201cexclusively for others\u201d is insufficient to impose this duty on the carrier.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-13\">Appellants\u2019 reliance on P. D. Marches-sini &amp; Co. (New York), Inc. v. H. W. Robinson &amp; Co. Inc., 287 F.Supp. 728 (S.D.N.Y.1967) aff\u2019d 394 F.2d 121 (2 Cir.1968), is misplaced. While that case was also an action by an ocean carrier against a freight forwarder for breach of a contract of affreightment, the court was concerned with the question of whether the employee of the freight forwarder had apparent authority to enter into the contract on behalf of his employer. The court found that there was no actual authority and held that to rely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>upon apparent authority a \u201cthird party must be justified in his belief that the agent was acting within the scope of his authority\u201d and that knowledge that he was simply acting as an agent \u201cwould cause a reasonable man in libelant\u2019s position to make further inquiry.\u201d 287 F.Supp. at 733, 734.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">It is well settled that a party may rely upon the \u201capparent authority\u201d of an agent only to the extent that it is \u201creasonable\u201d to believe that the agent is authorized. Restatement of Agency 2d, \u00a7 8, Comment e. It is necessary in such a ease to determine whether a reasonable man would inquire as to the purported agent\u2019s authority.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Here Lobe\u2019s actual authority to execute bookings on behalf of Bowen is conceded. Further, Albert E. Bowen, Jr. testified that while his employees were free to furnish the name of Bowen\u2019s principals upon request, they usually did not do so absent such request. Since the district court found that Mulara did not know, and did not have reason to know, the identity of Bowen\u2019s principal, the sole question becomes whether Mulara had a duty to request the principal\u2019s identity. This raises an entirely different issue from anything considered in <em>Marchessini.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In view of the lack of proof as to a custom or agreement to the contrary, the law does not impose a duty of inquiry upon a person dealing with an agent of an undisclosed or partially disclosed principal.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">It is probably true, as Bowen argues, that if Mulara had made inquiry, he could readily have learned the name of Bowen\u2019s principal. Conversely, we can see no good reason why Lobe should not have disclosed the name of Bowen\u2019s principal on or before the date of the oral agreement or made a prompt disclosure after receiving a proposed written contract in which Bowen was named as the contracting party. By so doing the \u201charsh application\u201d of the principles of law pertaining to undislosed principals of which appellant complains, could have been avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-12\">We find nothing in the record to justify an exception to the well recognized rule that the duty is on the agent to disclose his principal and not on the contracting party to ascertain the name of the principal, even though he knows the agent is acting for another.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b631-8\">. The memorandum and contracts were all on a \u201cFreight Contract\u201d form, with the heading \u201cOrient Mid-East Great Lakes Service\u201d and with an acceptance and signature for \u201cEagle Ocean Transport, Inc. as agents.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b632-10\">. Mulara testified on direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-11\">\u201cA. * * * Then we discussed the on-deck feature because those trucks were supposed to go on deck. We were to ship them on the deck of the vessel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-13\">\u201cQ. What was that discussion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-14\">\u201cA. That the only way we would take them would be to ship them on deck.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-15\">\u201cQ. Did Mr. Lobe agree to that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-16\">\u201cA. He did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-17\">\u201cQ. Did he agree to ship the trucks on the vessel of the owner, Orient Mid-East Lines?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-18\">\u201cA. Yes, ho.did.\u201d (.TA 12a)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-19\">Similar testimony was given on cross-examination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b632-24\">. On interrogation by the court, Lobe testified in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-25\">\u201cThe Court: Exhibit 1 that you have in front of you, that says \u2018on deck,\u2019 doesn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-26\">\u201cThe Witness: It does say \u2018on deck.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-27\">\u201cThe Court: You have read it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-28\">\u201cThe Witness: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-29\">\u201cThe Court: You didn\u2019t speak to Mr. Mulara about it when you saw him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-30\">\u201cThe Witness: No, because I did not exactly have the shipment yet. I still didn\u2019t have the shipment to deliver.\u201d (JA 35a)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b633-9\">. The effect of \u00a7 321 is explained in comment a:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-10\">\u201c(After referring to \u00a7 4) The fact that to the knowledge of the agent, the other party does not know the identity of the principal is of great weight in ascribing to the other party the intention to hold the agent liable either solely, or as a surety or co-promisor with the principal. The inference of an understanding that the agent is a party to the contract exists unless the agent gives such complete information concerning his principal\u2019s identity that he can be readily distinguished. If the other party has no reasonable means of ascertaining the principal, the inference is almost irresistible and prevails in the absence of an agreement to the contrary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Atz\">\u201cAs stated in Section 147, in the absence of a manifestation to the contrary there is an inference of an intention to make the partially disclosed principal, as well as the agent, a party.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b634-7\">. The court suggested that if there were merit in counsel\u2019s contention that under tire circumstances there was a duty to ascertain the identity of the principal prior to entering into the agreement, there should be expert testimony that this was the \u201ccustom in the industry.\u201d (T-112-114)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b634-8\">. Many of the cases involve agents who, like the freight forwarder here, act exclusively for others and draw no distinction between them and other agents. For example, Argersinger v. MacNaughton, <em>supra, </em>concerned a commission merchant, 21 N.E. at 1022, and McClure v. Central Trust Co. a stock transfer agent. 58 N.E. at 778. See also: Meriden Nat. Bank v.
