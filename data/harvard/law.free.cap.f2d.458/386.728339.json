We are pointed to eight separate areas of pre-trial and trial conduct, which are asserted individually and in their cumulative impact to demonstrate counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness. Applying the ad hoc rule of this Circuit, we cannot say that the conduct of appellant\u2019s trial counsel was shocking to the conscience of this court. United States v. Mancuso, 423 F.2d 23 (5th Cir. 1970). The Sixth Amendment does not guarantee an attorney who will secure subjectively satisfactory results for those accused of crime, nor does it guarantee errorless counsel or the best counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>available. Loper v. Beto, 440 F.2d 934 (5th Cir. 1971.) The performance of counsel is not to be judged by hindsight. Rather, an accused is entitled to such counsel as is reasonably likely to render and who does render reasonably effective assistance, MacKenna v. Ellis, 280 F.2d 592 (5th Cir. 1960). <em>Cf. </em>King v. Beto, 5th Cir., 429 F.2d 221 and Chalk v. Beto, 429 F.2d 225 (5th Cir. 1970). The performance of trial counsel furnished to the petitioner-appellant here passes these tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
