Peo. of Guam, 434 F.2d 837, 839 (9th Cir. 1970), \u201c[T]he proper test is not whether the evidence excludes every hypothesis except that of guilt, but rather, \u2018whether the [trier of fact] could reasonably arrive at [its] conclusion\u2019.\u201d See United States v. Nelson, 419 F.2d 1237, 1243 (9th Cir. 1969). Although appellant\u2019s testimony conflicted with that of prosecution witnesses, there was substantial evidence to support a finding of guilt. It was for the trial judge, as finder of fact, to assess the weight and credibility of the witnesses\u2019 testimony. Rule 23, F.R.Crim.P.; Fernandez-Delgado v. United States, 368 F.2d 34 (9th Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-15\">Nor did the trial court err in admitting into evidence testimony concerning a damaging admission made by appellant. The admission was made to a bank official, not a law enforcement officer, and the trial court specifically found, after hearing the parties, that the statement was voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-16\">Lastly, appellant argues that her admission was not corroborated. She is mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-17\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
