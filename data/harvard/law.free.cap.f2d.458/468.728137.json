Ahmad, et al., Cr. No. 14,950, M.D.Pa., after having been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>granted immunity from prosecution in accordance with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2514.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">In January of 1971 Mrs. Horn had been called to testify before a Federal Grand Jury which subsequently returned numerous indictments in United States v. Ahmad, <em>supra. </em>See <em>infra </em>n. 10. She testified at that time after having been granted immunity. On January 12, 1972, she was subpoenaed by the Government to testify in the trial of that case and pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(10) (<em>a)</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>moved to suppress on the ground that her subpoena and the resulting questioning represented the product of unlawful wiretapping or electronic surveillance. In response, Deputy Assistant Attorney General A. William Olson filed an affidavit (the \u201cOlson Affidavit\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>) dated January 6, 1972, de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>nying any surveillance activities against Mrs. Horn. Counsel for Mrs. Horn moved to strike the affidavit as legally insufficient. The District Court, however, after oral argument, but without holding an evidentiary hearing, denied counsel\u2019s various motions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> When subsequently called to testify on February 23, Mrs. Horn, after answering a number of preliminary questions, refused to testify on Fifth Amendment grounds. The Government applied for a \u00a7 2514 immunity order which was granted by the District Court after a hearing. On February 28 the Government called Mrs. Horn to testify on its behalf. She refused to answer any questions, citing conscience <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as well as her desire to obtain appellate review of the District Court\u2019s orders.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The District Court warned appellant that her refusal to testify in light of the \u00a7 2514 immunity order would constitute civil contempt and allowed her four days to reconsider her position. On March 3 appellant once again refused to testify and was committed to the custody of the Marshal \u201cuntil the end of the trial of United States v. Ahmad, et al., <em>supra, </em>or until such time as she purges herself of this contempt.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-13\">In urging remand, counsel for Mrs. Horn raises, <em>inter alia, </em>the following issues;</p>\n<p id=\"b528-14\">1) Whether the District Court erred in denying appellant\u2019s \u00a7 2518(10) (a) motion to suppress without an eviden-tiary hearing; and</p>\n<p id=\"b528-15\">2) Whether the Government\u2019s immunity application was legally sufficient and whether the District Court erred in granting that application without making a factual inquiry into its sufficiency under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2514.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-16\">When a witness files a petition to suppress pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(10) (a), the Government is obligated to \u201caffirm or deny the occurrence of the unlawful act.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3504(a) (1). It may do so by affidavit. In the Matter of Grumbles, 453 F.2d 119 (3d Cir. 1971). If the affidavit is sufficient on its face and the petitioner offers nothing to indicate that the affidavit is false or defective, the trial court has the pow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>er to deny the petition. <em>Grumbles, supra, </em>at 122. Although our decision in <em>Grumbles </em>certainly does not foreclose an evidentiary hearing where appropriate, we held in that case that since the petitioners had not presented \u201cany evidence demonstrating that these representations by the Government [were] false,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 122, a hearing was not warranted. In so holding we cited In re Idella Marx, 451 F.2d 466 (1st Cir. 1971) and Russo v. United States, 404 U.S. 1209, 92 S.Ct. 4, 30 L.Ed.2d 13 (Douglas, Circuit Justice, 1971). Appellant here claims that <em>Grumbles </em>does not apply to the instant case because the Government\u2019s affidavit denying surveillance, in addition to being based on hearsay, was identical to an affidavit concerning another witness which subsequently proved to be misleading and/or inaccurate. Appellant also contends that certain additional facts including the unavailability of her telephone records (indicating the possibility that they had been turned over to the FBI) and \u201cunusual clicking and hollow sounds from time to time\u201d over her telephone in Lewisburg are cumulatively sufficient indicia of illegal surveillance to warrant an evidentiary hearing. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">Although the Olson affidavit is far from a \u201cmodel\u201d either in terms of its scope or forthrightness, it is nevertheless substantially the same as the Government\u2019s affidavits denying electronic surveillance held sufficient in <em>Marx </em>and <em>Grumbles, supra. </em>The instant case, as well as <em>Marx </em>and <em>Grumbles, </em>however, makes clear that it would be desirable for the Government\u2019s affidavit to contain a more complete statement setting forth whether there had been <em>any </em>wiretapping or electronic surveillance including that which the Government considers to be legal under, inter alia, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(2) (c).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We believe also that the number of eases involving questions of electronic surveillance contemplated by our opinion in the <em>Egan </em>case, <em>supra </em>n. 7, 450 F.2d at 216, would be greatly reduced were the Government to indicate with some specificity which \u201cappropriate agencies\u201d were in fact contacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-11\">Finally, as to Mrs. Horn\u2019s allegations <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> concerning noises heard over her telephone lines, we do not consider such an assertion sufficiently substantial to war<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>rant a different result than in <em>Grumbles, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Given the particular circumstances of the case and the paucity of evidence presented by the petitioner, the District Court was correct in denyng a hearing. <em>See </em>Nardone v. United States, 308 U.S. 338, 312, 60 S.Ct. 266, 84 L.Ed. 307 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\"> Appellant\u2019s argument that the Government\u2019s immunity application was defective since it was not personally approved by the then Attorney General, John Mitchell, must also be rejected. Section 2514 requires that any application for immunity must have the \u201capproval of the Attorney General.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2514, <em>supra </em>n. 1. Mrs. Horn\u2019s immunity application was requested by S. John Cottone, the United States Attorney for the Middle District of Pennsylvania with the approval of the Attorney General. It is set out in full in the margin.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Counsel contends that the failure of Attorney General Mitchell personally to approve and sign the authorization letter voids the entire application procedure. We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Here the United States Attorney for the Middle District of Pennsylvania has affirmatively represented to the District Court that his immunity application had been approved by Attorney General Mitchell. In Re Zoia Horn, M.D.Pa., Misc. - p. 2 (Filed February 23, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>1972). This has not been contraverted and there is no reason to consider that the facts are otherwise. Even if this were not the case we believe that the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 510,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> allowing the Attorney General to delegate his authority in certain cases, are applicable to the Attorney General\u2019s power to approve applications for immunity under Section 2514. <em>See </em>December 1968 Grand Jury v. United States, 420 F.2d 1201 (7th Cir. 1970), cert. denied, Domenico v. United States, 397 U.S. 1021, 90 S.Ct. 1260, 25 L.Ed.2d 531 (1971), <em>cf. </em>United States v. Robinson, No. 71-1058 (5th Cir. Jan. 12, 1972). Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 510, the Attorney General has delegated the approval authority to various, specified Assistant Attorneys General \u2014 including the Head of the Internal Security Division \u2014 with the limiting proviso that the Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division must also approve each application. 28 C.F.R. 0.175 (December 23, 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">The record includes an undated letter to United States Attorney Cottone from Robert C. Mardian, the Assistant Attorney General for the Internal Security Division, granting approval for the application. The letter notes that \u201c[t]he Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division, Henry E. Peterson, concurs with me in this <em>matter.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">We have considered and reject appellant\u2019s other arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">The March 3, 1972, order committing appellant Zoia Horn to federal custody for the duration of the trial of United States v. Ahmad, <em>supra, </em>or until she purges herself of the contempt is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b527-9\">. \u00a7 2514.

This is apparently the \u201cstandard\u201d Government affidavit in \u00a7 2518(10) (a) cases and is identical to seven others also sworn out on that date. It has been used in proceedings in other circuits as well. See, for example, In re Marx, 451 F.2d 466, 467 n. 2 (1st Cir. 1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b528-7\">. Included were a Petition to Suppress, a Motion to Strike and alternatively a Motion for an Evidentiary Hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b528-8\">. Mrs. Horn stated in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-9\">\u201cI cannot in good conscience lend myself to this black charade. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-10\">\u201cAnd my conscience is quite another matter and I think that spying in libraries and homes and in universities is something that I protest and I cannot therefore testify.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-11\">The defense attorneys, as well as the Government attorney, made clear at the February 28, 1972 hearing that they wished Mrs. Horn to testify, using this language at pages 105-106:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-17\">\u201cMR. MEN AKER: Your Honor, I would like to put a statement on the record at this time. We learned during the lunch hour that Mrs. Horn had intended not to testify when called this afternoon. The Defendants and the Defense Attorneys unanimously requested that I inform Mr. Black that it was their preference that she testify, and I think Mr. Black will say I did communicate that to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-18\">\u201cMR. BLACK: Yes. In fact, on several occasions, at least on half a dozen occasions, the Defense has asked me to urge Mrs. Horn to testify and I have done so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-20\">\u201cMR. MENAKER: Her refusal is despite the wishes of the Defendants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AeE\">Subsequently the defense agreed to stipulate that the witness would testify to certain matters but the government declined to so stipulate since it wishes to question her on additional items. (Transcript of March 3, 1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b528-21\">. The District Court\u2019s denial of Mrs. Horn\u2019s earlier motions were not appealable. In Matter of Rom, 459 F.2d 15 (3d Cir., 1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b529-4\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(2) (c) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-5\">\u201cIt shall not be unlawful under this chapter for a person acting under color of law to intercept a wire or oral communication, where such person is a party to the communication or one of the parties to the communication has given prior consent to such interception.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">An identical \u201cOlson affidavit\u201d represented in the case of another witness\u2014 Mary Elizabeth Sandel \u2014 \u201cthat there has been no electronic surveillance of any conversations occurring on her premises.\u201d It was subsequently discovered, however, that a Government witness had received telephone calls over Miss Sandel\u2019s telephone, which were intercepted and recorded by the Government on December 3 and 10, 1970. The Government has acknowledged that the interceptions took place, but has taken the position that since the interceptions had been consented to by one of the parties to the telephone conversation, they were not within the term \u201celectronic surveillance\u201d as used in the Olson affidavit and as contemplated by our decision in In re Egan, 450 F.2d 199 (3d Cir. 1971), since they were permitted by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(2) (c). See United States v. White, 401 U.S. 745, 91 S.Ct. 1122, 28 L.Ed.2d 453 (1971). If this is the Government\u2019s position, we see no reason why it should not be so stated in its affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-13\">In any ease, it is unlikely that the omission from the Olson affidavit of the \u201cconsensual\u201d surveillance of December 3 and 10, 1970 was intended to prejudice Miss Sandel, since the information derived from those recorded conversations was furnished to the defense. The tapes were made available on August 31, 1971, and at the defendants\u2019 request more precise information was furnished on November 22, 1971. There was, therefore, no unawareness of the surveillance omitted from the Olson affidavit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b529-14\">. The allegations in support of the motion for an evidentiary hearing contained in The Matter of Grumbles (3d Cir. 72-1013, Memorandum Order of January 25, 1972), were subscribed to by sworn affidavit.
