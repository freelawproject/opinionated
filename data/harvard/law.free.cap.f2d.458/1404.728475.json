While appellant contends that the specimen submitted with its application shows that the mark is not in fact applied to \u201cscanning antennas,\u201d trademark cases must be decided on the basis of the identification of the goods as set forth in the application. In re Dirzius, 311 F.2d 825, 50 CCPA 836 (1963); Bristol-Myers Co. v. Pharmaco, Inc., 291 F.2d 756, 48 CCPA 1107 (1961); General Shoe Corp. v. Lerner Bros. Mfg. Co., 254 F.2d 154, 45 CCPA 872 (1958). Since the goods are described merely as \u201cantennas\u201d and that term is broad enough to encompass \u201cscanning antennas,\u201d the mark SCANNER as applied to the goods is merely descriptive within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(e) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-11\">The board\u2019s decision is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1463-7\">. Abstracted at 163 USPQ 293 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1463-8\">. Both the examiner and the board pointed out that \u201cSCANNING ANTENNA\u201d is defined in J. Markus, Electronics and Nucleonics Dictionary 575 (3d ed. 1966) as \u201cA directional antenna used in radar for scanning a region.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
