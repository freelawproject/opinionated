We hold that it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-13\">Respondent is a toy supplier. Its main office is in Detroit, Michigan. It maintains several branch offices, including one in North Hollywood where Cal-varesi was employed initially as a freelance salesman and later as a driver with responsibility for supplying toys and installing toy racks at retail stores. In early December 1969, Calvaresi collected company money in the sum of $220 from a \u201cswap meet\u201d and appropriated it to his own use. When respondent\u2019s branch manager Boigon discovered Calvaresi\u2019s defalcation in mid-December Calvaresi apologized for his action, pleaded not to be discharged, and promised to reimburse the company. Boigon agreed to Calvaresi\u2019s proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-15\">On December 29, 1969, Boigon announced that there were going to be some operational changes and called an employee\u2019s meeting for January 3, 1970. Calvaresi and two of his fellow drivers, Epstein and Diamond, were worried that the changes might adversely affect their employment or income. The trio arranged a meeting with a representative of the Teamsters Union at Calvaresi\u2019s home. On the evening of December 29 they met with the union representatives. All three signed cards authorizing the union to represent them, and each agreed to deny any knowledge of the union if he were questioned by the respondent. The drivers asked the union man to notify respondent of its representation status before January 3, to avert changes in their employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-16\">Boigon advanced the employment meeting to January 2. The three drivers attended. Boigon told the employees about some of the changes to be effective January 5, including Diamond\u2019s promotion to supervisor of warehouse and truck operations and Calvaresi\u2019s taking over Diamond\u2019s former route as a driver. Epstein\u2019s status was not changed. At the conclusion of the meeting, Boigon assured the employees that \u201cEverybody has got a job at Super Toys.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-17\">Boigon testified that on the evening of January 2, after the employees\u2019 meeting, the president of respondent telephoned him from Detroit and told him that he had received information from an employee of the company traveling in Michigan that Calvaresi had misappropriated company funds. The president instructed Boigon to discharge Calvaresi immediately. Early the next morning Boigon related both to Brown, assistant manager, and to Epstein the president\u2019s direction to discharge Calvaresi. The conversations took place before the morning mail arrived in which there was a letter to Boigon from the union <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>advising him that it had been designated as the three drivers' bargaining representatives. Boigon\u2019s testimony on these points was corroborated by Brown and Epstein. There was no contrary testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">After receiving the union letter, Boi-gon telephoned Diamond, told him about the letter, and asked him what he knew about it. Diamond said he would come to the office to talk. Next, Boigon called Calvaresi and asked him about his knowledge of the union. Calvaresi denied any affiliation with or knowledge of the union. Diamond went to Boigon\u2019s office and told him about signing the union cards. Calvaresi came to Boigon\u2019s office while Diamond was still talking to Boigon. Diamond indicated that he had told Boigon everything and left. Calva-resi said to Boigon, \u201cSince you\u2019ve heard Mr. Diamond\u2019s story, I might as well tell you my part of the story.\u201d Calvaresi testified that Boigon said, \u201c[I]f you want the union here, it makes no difference; it makes no difference about who started it, or what. ... I have got to let you go on account of Detroit. . . . And he said ... [I] had to let [you] go because [I] got a call Friday night from Detroit that they had to let [you] go on account of the swap meet money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">There were no reprisals or threats of reprisals for the union activity of Epstein and Diamond. Diamond received his promotion and Epstein remained in his job. Some of the other plants and warehouses of respondent are union organized.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">The hearing examiner decided that Calvaresi\u2019s discharge was pretextual despite the uncontradicted evidence that the company president ordered the discharge before either he or Boigon had been informed that Calvaresi had engaged in union activity. His theory was that it was \u201cillogical and unreasonable\u201d that the president should order Calvaresi to be \u201csuddenly\u201d fired, because the home office had previously condoned Calvare-si\u2019s misappropriation. There is no evidence in the record that the home office had ever condoned Calvaresi\u2019s misconduct. There is, at best, merely an inference that can be drawn from some of the evidence that the home office had some actual knowledge of Calvaresi\u2019s misconduct more than a day or two before the president\u2019s call.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">The record as a whole convincingly demonstrates that the president acted to discharge Calvaresi as soon as he learned of his dishonesty and that his act had nothing to do with Calvaresi\u2019s union activity of which the president was completely unaware. It follows that the hearing examiner\u2019s conclusions, adopted by the Board, cannot be sustained. (Cf. Santa Fe Drilling Co. v. N. L. R. B. (9th Cir. 1969) 416 F.2d 725, 732; N.L.R.B. v. Miller Redwood Co. (9th Cir. 1969) 407 F.2d 1366.)</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">The second issue is whether or not the respondent violated section 8(a) (1) of the Act by asking Calvaresi and Epstein about their union activities. Such interrogation is not unlawful per se. \u201cIf he [employer] does make an investigation, the Board\u2019s recent cases indicate that reasonable polling in this regard will not always be termed violative of \u00a7 8(a) (1) if conducted in accordance with the requirements set out in Struksnes Construction Co., 165 NLRB No. 102, 65 L.R.R.M. 1385 (1967).\u201d N.L.R.B. v. Gissel Packing Co. (1969) 395 U.S. 575, 609, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 1938, 23 L.Ed.2d 547.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">The criteria stated in <em>Struksnes, supra, </em>are these:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-12\">\u201cAbsent unusual circumstances, the polling of employees by an employer will be violative of Section 8(a) (1) of the Act unless the following safeguards are observed: (1) the purpose of the poll is to determine the truth of a union\u2019s claim of majority, (2) this purpose is communicated to the employees, (3) assurances against reprisal are given, (4) the employees are polled by secret ballot, and (5) the employer has not engaged in unfair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>labor practices or otherwise created a coercive atmosphere.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9y\">The Board upheld the examiner\u2019s conclusion that respondent\u2019s interrogation of its employees was inherently coercive because respondent did not comply with the requirement of <em>Struksnes. </em>We do too.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The record shows that respondent\u2019s interrogation of its employees was unaccompanied by'any threat of reprisal, but it also shows that the respondent\u2019s interrogation was unaccompanied by any express assurances against reprisal.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">That portion of the Board\u2019s order directing that respondent shall cease and desist from polling or otherwise coer-cively interrogating employees concerning their support of the union and ordering affirmative action to implement that part of the order will be enforced. We decline to enforce the remainder of the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b241-15\">. Among the circuits that have adopted the Struksnes criteria are the Seventh (N.L.R.B. v. C &amp; P Plaza Dept. Store, Div. of C &amp; P Shop. Ctr., Inc. (7th Cir. 1969) 414 F.2d 1244) and the Eighth (N.L.R.B. v. Harry F. Berggren &amp; Sons, Inc. (8th Cir. 1969) 406 F.2d 239).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
