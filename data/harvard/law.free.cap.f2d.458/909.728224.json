United States v. Marion, 404 U.S. 307, 92 S.Ct. 455, 30 L.Ed.2d 468 (1971). In <em>Marion </em>the Supreme Court discussed the Sixth Amendment in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-4\">\u201cInordinate delay between arrest, indictment and trial may impair a defendant\u2019s ability to present an effective defense. But the major evils protected against by the speedy trial guarantee exist quite apart from actual or possible prejudice to an accused\u2019s defense. To legally arrest and detain, the Government must assert probable cause to believe the arrestee has committed a crime. Arrest is a public act that may seriously interfere with the defendant\u2019s liberty, whether he is free on bail or not, and that may disrupt his employment, drain his financial resources, curtail his associations, subject him to public obloquy and create anxiety in him, his family and his friends. ... So viewed, it is readily understandable that it is either a formal indictment or information or else the actual restraints imposed by arrest and holding to answer a criminal charge that engage the particular protections of the speedy-trial provision of the Sixth Amendment.\u201d 404 U.S. at 320, 92 S.Ct. at 463.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b968-12\">Thus, it would appear that if a defendant is arrested for a federal crime for which he is subsequently indicted, such defendant would have become an \u201caccused\u201d within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment on the date of this arrest. See 404 U.S. at 318-19, 321-323, 325, 92 S.Ct. 455, 30 L.Ed.2d 468. However, the Court in Marion declared that there was not need to \u201cpress the Sixth Amendment into service\u201d with respect to a \u201cpre-accusation\u201d delay, since the interests of a defendant in these circumstances are adequately protected by statutes of limitation and the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See 404 U.S. at 323-325, 92 S.Ct. 455, 30 L.Ed.2d 468. In connection with the latter protection, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>the Court pointed out at 404 U.S. 324, 92 S.Ct. 455, 30 L.Ed.2d 468:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b969-4\">\u201cThus, the Government concedes that the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment would require dismissal of the indictment if it were shown at trial that the pre-indictment delay in this case caused substantial prejudice to appellees\u2019 rights to a fair trial and that the delay was a purposeful device to gain tactical advantage over the accused. <em>Cf. </em>Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 [83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215] (1963); Napue v. Illinois, 360 U.S. 264 [79 S.Ct. 1173, 3 L.Ed.2d 1217](1959). However, we need not, and could not now, determine when and in what circumstances actual prejudice resulting from pre-accusation delays requires the dismissal of the prosecution. Actual prejudice to the defense of a criminal case may result from the shortest and most necessary delay; and no one suggests that every delay-caused detriment to a defendant\u2019s case should abort a criminal prosecution. To accommodate the sound administration of justice to the rights of the defendant to a fair trial will necessarily involve a delicate judgment based on the circumstances of each case. It would be unwise at this juncture to attempt to forecast our decision in such cases.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">Since that decision, this court has handed down a decision considering a motion to dismiss for undue delay in a criminal, prosecution. See United States v. Du-kow, et al., 453 F.2d 1328 (3rd Cir.); <em>cf. </em>Hunt v. United States, 456 F.2d 582, (3rd Cir.); United States v. Varga, et al., 449 F.2d 1280 (3rd Cir.).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">In view of these recent decisions, we have concluded that the above-mentioned district court orders should be vacated and the case remanded for a hearing on the issues presented under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments and F.R.Crim.P. 48(b) by the delay in this criminal prosecution in light of such decisions and the authorities cited in them. See United States v. Feldman, 425 F.2d 688, 692 at note 10 (3rd Cir. 1970); United States v. Childs, 415 F.2d 535, 536-537 (3rd Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-8\">The district court orders of April 21, 1971, and May 11, 1971, will be vacated and the case remanded to the district court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b967-16\">. The May 11, 1971, order granted the Government\u2019s Motion for Leave to File Answer and for Reconsideration of an April 21, 1971, district court order, granting the defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss the indictment. The Answer filed by the Government contained a denial of the defendants\u2019 allegation of \u201cirreparable damage in that defendants\u2019 ability to present a defense and procure witnesses on their behalf has been substantially impaired.\u201d However, treating the Government\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration as a motion to vacate the order of April 21, 1971, the district court denied the motion. The April 21, 1971, order of the district court relied on the due process clause, in quoting from this court\u2019s opinion in United States v. Feld-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>man, 425 F.2d 688, 691 (1970), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-6\">\u201cWe agree with the recognition in Ross v. United States, . . . that, in treating a defendant\u2019s claim of prejudicial delay, his rights under the due process clause must be determined by a balance between the need of law enforcement officials to delay prosecution and the prejudice to the defendant caused by this delay</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b968-8\">We note that the primary concern of the <em>Boss </em>case, referred to by this court in <em>Feldman, supra, </em>and in the quotation from that ease by the district court, was the seven-month delay between the alleged crime and the filing of any complaint against him \u201calthough . . . appellant was continuously available for arrest,\u201d whereas in this case the defendants were warned of criminal prosecutions by the prompt arrest of July 31, 1968. The defendants were released on bail or their own recognizance apparently on or shortly after the date of such arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-10\">The district court\u2019s order was appealable under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731. See United States v. Marion, 404 U.S. 307, 311 n. 2, 92 S.Ct. 455, 30 L.Ed.2d 468 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b968-15\">.

The length of this time period is left to the sound discretion of the individual district courts on the assumption that each district court will prescribe, by local rule or otherwise, a method of insuring that eases are brought before the grand jury as promptly as is possible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b968-19\">Cf.
