If not, we hold that no inquiry should be made into the merits of the case. In <em>Schellhouse </em>v. <em>Ball </em>(29 Cal. 608), which is a leading case on the subject, Justice Sanderson, delivering the opinion of the .Court, uses this language: <em>\u201c </em>A party claiming to have been injured must show that the surprise has not resulted, in <em>any degree, </em>from his own fault or negligence, and must, <em>in addition, </em>claim his relief at the earliest opportunity. \u201d It is not <em>accident or surprise alone </em>which entitles a party to a new trial, but accident or surprise which ordinary prudence could not have guarded against. (Practice Act, Sec. 193, 3d Subd.; <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Ely, </em>19 Cal. <em>28; Brooks </em>v. <em>Lyon, </em>3 <em>Id. </em>113; <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Hine, </em>1 <em>Id. </em>429.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b457-13\">In <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Price </em>(11 Cal. 213), the decision is, that there must be a diligence, \u201cunmixed with any negligence,\u201d on the part of the party asking it. To the same effect is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number><em>Cook </em>v. <em>De la Guerra </em>(24 Cal. 237); <em>Casement </em>v. <em>Ringgold </em>(28 Id. 335); <em>Midholland </em>v. <em>Heyneman </em>(19 <em>Id..605.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b458-6\">In <em>Washer </em>v. <em>White </em>(16 Ind. 136), it is held .that a party is not diligent who neither attends Court himself nor procures the attendance of witnesses, nor ascertains that his attorney is informed of the grounds of his defense, and is not entitled to a new trial on the ground of surprise. <em>(Desnoyer </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>4 Minn. 515.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b458-7\"><em>Quint &amp; Hardy, </em>for Respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b458-8\">Motions for a new trial, on the ground of surprise, are addressed to the sound discretion of the <em>Court; </em>and if it satisfactorily appears that, to promote the ends of justice, an opportunity should be presented for the introduction of the testimony, the Court will furnish it by setting aside the judgment and granting a new trial. <em>(Tyler </em>v. <em>Hornbeck, </em>48 Barb. 197; <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Kay, 50 Id. 110; Clark </em>v. <em>Gridley, </em>35 Cal. 398.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b458-9\">Rhodes, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AyA\">delivered the opinion of the Court:</p>\n<p id=\"b458-10\">The defendant was notified by his attorney, that unless his fees were paid, he would not further conduct the defense to the action; and the fees not being paid, he gave no further attention to the case. The defendant neither retained another attorney nor appeared in the action in person. This was gross negligence on his part, and he was not entitled to a new trial, on the ground that he was surprised by the nonattendance of his attorney, when the cause was called for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-11\">Order reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
