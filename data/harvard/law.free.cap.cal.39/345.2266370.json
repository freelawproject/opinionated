It requires something more than this to entitle the holder to take it free of equities.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-16\">It must have been received for a valuable consideration, then paid for it. It was assigned in a gambling room and paid for chiefly in gambling checks.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-17\">The plaintiff was in the same house in the same evening, and received the certificates without any consideration whatever, and he is peremptorily charged with notice that it was a gambling transaction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-18\">Rotes not received in the usual course of trade, and for a <em>present </em>consideration, do not entitle the holder to recover against the equities, and the existence of a prior indebtedness will not help the holder. <em>(Coddington </em>v. <em>Ray, </em>20 J.

J., concurring :</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">This is an action by an assignee against the makers of a certificate of deposit, for the sum of $1,500 in United States gold coin, which is set out in the complaint, as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-11\">\u201c$750.

The answer substantially admits the execution of the certificate, as charged in the complaint; denies that the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>tiff is the <em>bona fide </em>or legal owner or holder thereof; avers want of consideration for its issuance, exceeding the sum of $750; and that the words \u201cfifteen hundred\u201d were inserted and written in the body of the certificate by mistake and inadvertence, in place of the words \u201cseven hundred and fifty, \u201d which were intended to be, and should have been, written thereon\u2014of which mistake plaintiff had notice when he received the same; and further avers, that the certificate was issued for and on deposit of $750; and that the payee thereof received the same for and as a certificate of deposit for $750 only-\u2014which sum defendants tendered to plaintiff on the presentation of the certificate; and further deny generally the allegations of the complaint. The case was tried by the Court without a jury; and, without making any finding of facts, the Court rendered judgment against defend\"\"'\"\"-ants for $750. Plaintiff, upon statement, moved for a new trial, which being denied, he appeals from the judgment and order denying a new trial. There is no conflict in the evidence as found in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">The certificate is to all intents and purposes a certificate for $1,500 in gold coin. The superscription on the upper left hand corner, in figures, is but a memorandum, and in no manner serves to vary, change, modify or control, the written words found in the body of the certificate, which distinctly specify the sum, for which the certificate is issued, to be $1,500. The most that can be claimed for this memorandum, in figures, is that its presence on the face of the certificate, serves to create a patent ambiguity; but this cannot be helped by averment, or evidence <em>aliv.nde. </em>The words written in the body of a certificate, bill or note, when plain, definite and certain, must control, without regard to the superscription in figures.

Nor would such defense be available to the makers in a suit, by a subsequent <em>bona fide </em>holder, after the certificate had been indorsed by the payee, in blank, and delivered to a <em>mala fide </em>indorsee before dishonor.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">A negotiable bill or note, indorsed and transferred to a <em>bona fide </em>holder for value, without notice by the payee thereof, before maturity or dishonor, actual or constructive, is relieved of all equities existing between the drawer or maker and the payee, and any subsequent assignee receives the same in like manner, relieved of all such equities. (Story on Bills of Ex. Secs. 187-188; Story on Prom. Notes, Sec. 178, and authorities there cited; 3 Kent Com. * 92, top page 113; <em>Chalmers </em>v. <em>Lanion, </em>1 Camp. 383.)</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">A note payable at a particular time, is presumed to be dishonored after maturity. A sight bill or note payable on demand, is presumed to be dishonored after a reasonable time shall have elapsed after its date, and if indorsed and transferred before such reasonable time has elapsed, the indorsee and holder <em>bona fide, </em>for value takes the same, relieved of all equities existing between the original parties thereto. What such reasonable time is, depends upon the circumstances of each case, and is a question of law to be determined by the Court. (Chitty on Bills, p. * 379 ; Story on Bills of Ex.

Skaggs, which plaintiff did, on the following morning, about eight o\u2019clock, October 19th, by crediting Ewing M. Skaggs in account, who was then indebted to him in the sum of $200, with $1,500, and thereafter, during the forenoon of the same day, presented the certificate to defendants for payment. At the time the certificate was indorsed and delivered to Eli M. Skaggs, on the 18th of October, no sufficient time had elapsed since its date, to authorize a presumption of dishonor; hence, the special defense set up in the answer could not avail, as in case of indorsement after maturity and dishonor.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">The question then arises, whether Eli M. Skaggs, the first indorsee, was a <em>bona fide </em>holder for value.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">On the cross-examination of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, by defendants, it appeared that the payee indorsed and delivered the certificate to Eli M. Skaggs, at the rooms of said Skaggs, in the City of Sacramento, which rooms were occupied by said Skaggs for gambling purposes; that his business was gambling, and that the assignment was made in a gambling transaction; that Skaggs paid for the certificate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>\u00a7100 in money, and \u00a71,400 in ivory checks; and that previous to such transfer of the certificate, by the payee, he had been playing. Upon this evidence it is claimed by the respondents, that the indorsement and transfer to Eli M. Skaggs was void under a statute of this State, entitled \u201cAn Act to prohibit gaming.\u201d (Stats. 1863, p. 723.) But the evidence entirely fails to establish that the consideration for such indorsement and transfer was money or anything of value, <em>lost </em>by the payee or <em>toon </em>by the indorsee, or any other person or persons, at any of the prohibited games or any banking game played with cards, dice or any other device; or, that the money or ivory checks, received by' the payee in consideration of such transfer, was by him afterwards lost, or in any manner hazarded at any prohibited game, or any other game of chance whatever; hence, the indorsement and transfer cannot be adjudged void, on the ground that the consideration therefor was money, or anything lost or won at a prohibited game. So far as the evidence discloses the consideration for the transfer, it ivas a valuable consideration, and the first indorsee received the certificate without notice, actual or constructive, of any infirmity or existing equity in favor of the makers; and, as between him and the makers, the special defenses set up in the answer, could not have been made available, and they cannot, therefore, be made available as against the present plaintiff, whatever the consideration may have been for the subsequent transfer to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">The evidence very clearly establishes, that the certificate was issued by the defendants, upon the deposit with them \u2022by George Bosenbaum, of $750 only, and that the sum stated in the body of the certificate as the amount deposited, was by defendants inadvertently and by mistake written $1,500, instead of $750; and this the payee of the certificate must have known, when he indorsed and transferred the same to the first assignee, on the afternoon of the day of its date; but the defendants, by their mistake and inadvertence,'furnished him the means by which he was enabled to perpetrate a fraud upon innocent parties, if the special defense set up in the answer should prevail against the well settled princi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>pie, that whenever one of two innocent parties must suffer hy the act of a third, he who enabled such third party to occasion the loss, must bear it.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">It follows from these views, that the evidence fails to sustain the judgment; and that the judgment and order denying a new trial, must be reversed and a new trial granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">So ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Crockett, J., delivered the following opinion, Wallace, J., concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">I concur in the judgment, on the ground that the proof fails to show that the certificate was lost by Bosenbaum at any of the games prohibited hy the Act of 1863, and that Eli M. Skaggs, when he received it, had notice of that fact. If it had appeared on the trial, that Bosenbaum was engaged in one of the prohibited games, and had lost the certificate in that manner, and that Skaggs had notice of this fact when he took it, he was not a purchaser in good faith, and the defendants could have made, as against the plaintiff, any defense they could have made as against Bosenbaum.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
