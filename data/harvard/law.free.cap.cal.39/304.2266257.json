Dohrs and his wife.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-14\">The complaint prays for a judgment decreeing that there is due him the full amount of the note, interest, attorney\u2019s fees, etc., and that the mortgaged property be sold, etc. The prayer does not ask for a personal judgment against defendants, or either of them\u2014but asks, that if the proceeds do not pay the debt, the judgment may be docketed, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-15\">The transcript does not show that the demurrer was overruled or sustained\u2014but it is presumed that it was overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-16\">The complaint was filed September 29th, 1869, and judgment rendered October 26th, 1869\u2014more than two months before the note fell due.

Even if the wife had signed, she could not bind herself by such a contract\u2014as it does not appear to concern her separate property. The judgment exceeds the relief asked for. (Practice Act, Sec. 147; 27 Cal. 655; 29 Cal. 165.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-8\">The judgment was rendered two months before the note fell due.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-9\">Section 246 of the Practice Act prohibits personal judgments in foreclosure cases.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aog\">delivered the opinion of the Court:</p>\n<p id=\"b315-14\">The judgment for the principal of the promissory note is erroneous\u2014because the complaint shows, that when the action was commenced, the note had not become due. The plaintiff might have taken a judgment for a sale of so much of the mortgaged premises, as might be necessary to satisfy the interest then <em>due; </em>but the order for the sale of all the premises was erroneous. The personal judgment against the defendant was erroneous. (See Practice Act, Sec. 246.)</p>\n<p id=\"b315-15\">Judgment reversed, and cause remanded,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
