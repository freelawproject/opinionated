Wilbur, deceased, in his lifetime, ever had any possession whatever of said cabin, or ever owned any interest therein, or that plaintiffs, either as executor or executrix, or personally, ever occupied or had any possession of the cabin, or were ever in any sense the occupants thereof.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b670-15\">Third\u2014The premises being public lands, and miles in diameter, were never sufficiently inclosed, either by E. Wilbur, deceased, in his lifetime, or by plaintiffs, as exeeu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>tor or executrix, or otherwise, to give that actual and exclusive possession necessary to maintain the. action of forcible entry and detainer.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b671-6\"><em>W.

Such evidence clearly establishes that the lands had never been inclosed by plaintiffs, or those under whom they claim, and at or within five days of the date of the alleged entry of defendant, plaintiffs had not such possession of the one hundred and sixty acres entered upon by defendant as would authorize them to maintain an action for forcible or unlawful entry and detainer.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">Furthermore, there is an entire absence of evidence tending to establish that defendant exercised or threatened force of any character in obtaining or continuing his possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">The judgment and order denying a new trial must, therefore, be reversed, and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-11\">So ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
