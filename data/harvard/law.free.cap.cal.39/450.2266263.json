Soon after finding them, he caused them to be served on .the defendants. The excuse for the delay in serving the papers is, that he mislaid and forgot them. The Court, on the defendant\u2019s motion, ordered the summons to be set aside and the complaint to be stricken from the files. There was no abuse of discretion in granting the motion, and, in our opinion, the order was fully justified by the facts presented in the affidavits. (See <em>Dupuy </em>v. <em>Shear, </em>29 Cal. <em>241; Reynolds </em>v. <em>Page, </em>35 Cal. 296; <em>Grigsby </em>v. <em>Napa County, </em>36 Cal. 585.)</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Wallace, J., being disqualified, did not participate in the decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
