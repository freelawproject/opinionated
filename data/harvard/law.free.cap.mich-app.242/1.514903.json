We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b59-11\">Plaintiff Robert Kerns brought an action in the Antrim Circuit Court against defendant Dura Mechanical Components, Inc., alleging defendant violated an employment contract, the Michigan Handicappers\u2019 Civil Rights Act (HCRA) (now known as the Persons with Disabilities Civil Rights Act), MCL 37.1101 <em>et seq.-, </em>MSA 3.550(101) <em>et seq., </em>and the Civil Rights Act, MCL 37.2101 <em>et seq.-, </em>MSA 3.548(101) <em>et seq., </em>when it terminated his employment. In our previous opinion in this matter, <em>Kerns v Dura Mechanical Compo</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number><em>nents, Inc, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam, issued December 5, 1997 (Docket No. 198393), we affirmed the trial court\u2019s order granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition with regard to plaintiff\u2019s wrongful discharge,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> handicapper discrimination, and age discrimination claims. In affirming dismissal of the latter two claims, we relied on the doctrine of judicial estoppel espoused in <em>Tranker v Figgie Int'l, Inc, </em>221 Mich App 7; 561 NW2d 397 (1997), nullified 456 Mich 931 (1998) <em>(Tranker I), </em>holding plaintiff\u2019s successful representations to the Social Security Administration that he was totally and permanently disabled precluded his claims in the present lawsuit under the HCRA and the Civil Rights Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">After our previous decision, our Supreme Court remanded <em>Tranker I </em>to this Court for reconsideration in light of several federal circuit court decisions that allowed claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> even though the plaintiffs therein had previously represented a total disability to the Social Security Administration. 456 Mich 934 (1998). On remand, <em>Tranker II, supra </em>at 121-123, our Court vacated its prior ruling that judicial estoppel automatically bars a subsequent handicap discrimination claim, holding in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-6\">In our previous opinion we . . . held that the doctrine of judicial estoppel barred plaintiff\u2019s handicap discrimination claim. However, upon further review, we now disavow that position. Like the ADA, the . . . HCRA . . . prohibits discrimination, including in hiring, firing, and advancement. MCL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>37.1202; MSA 3.550(202). After its 1990 amendments, it also requires that reasonable accommodations be made to assist the handicapped in performing duties of their employment. . . . [T]he receipt of social security disability benefits should not bar a subsequent claim under the hcra for the same reasons that it does not bar a subsequent claim under the ADA. The two acts are designed for different purposes and utilize different standards, and requiring a plaintiff to choose between the acts is unreasonable and illogical. Moreover, we agree that the social security definition of \u201cdisability\u201d does not require a finding that the individual cannot perform any job under any circumstance. . . . The SSA does not take into consideration that a disabled individual may be able to perform a job with reasonable accommodations. Therefore, it is not inconsistent that a plaintiff could be disabled under the SSA and still be qualified to perform the duties of his job or a job he is seeking with reasonable accommodation under the HCRA. For that reason, we also agree that judicial estoppel should not bar a subsequent handicapper claim. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-7\">We note that although we have determined that judicial estoppel does not operate to automatically bar a disability benefit recipient\u2019s handicap discrimination claim, statements made by the plaintiff in his prior application for disability benefits may weigh against him in his subsequent handicap discrimination claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-8\">\u201cThe conclusion we reach today does not mean that claimants\u2019 statements in support of disability claims are never relevant in ADA suits. For example, ADA plaintiffs who in support of claims for disability benefits tell the Social Security Administration they cannot perform the essential functions of a job even with accommodation could well be barred from asserting, for ADA purposes, that accommodation would have allowed them to perform that same job.\u201d <em>[Swanks (v Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, </em>325 US App DC 238; 116 F3d 582 [1997]), <em>supra </em>at 243.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">More recently, in <em>Cleveland v Policy Management Systems Corp, supra, </em>the United States Supreme Court held the pursuit and receipt of social security <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>disability insurance benefits neither automatically estops the recipient from pursuing an ADA claim nor erects a strong presumption against the recipient\u2019s success under the ADA. However, the <em>Cleveland </em>Court, <em>supra </em>at 806-807, further held that to survive a defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-5\">[a]n ADA plaintiff cannot simply ignore the apparent contradiction that arises out of the earlier ssdi total disability claim. Rather, she must proffer a sufficient explanation. . . . . . . When faced with a plaintiff\u2019s previous sworn statement asserting \u201ctotal disability\u201d or the like, the court should require an explanation of any apparent inconsistency with the necessary elements of an ada claim. To defeat summary judgment, that explanation must be sufficient to warrant a reasonable juror\u2019s concluding that, assuming the truth of, or the plaintiffs good faith belief in, the earlier statement, the plaintiff could nonetheless \u201cperform the essential functions\u201d of her job, with or without \u201creasonable accommodation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">The <em>Cleveland </em>Court, <em>supra </em>at 807, found that, under the particular circumstances of that case, the plaintiff had advanced a sufficient explanation for her contradictory representations to warrant remanding the case to the trial court for further proceedings on the issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-8\">In her brief to this Court, Cleveland explains the discrepancy between her SSDI statements that she was \u201ctotally disabled\u201d and her ADA claim that she could \u201cperform the essential functions\u201d of her job. The first statements, she says, \u201cwere made in a forum which does not consider the effect that reasonable workplace accommodations would have on the ability to work.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 43. Moreover, she claims the ssdi statements were \u201caccurate statements\u201d if examined \u201cin the time period in which they were made.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The parties should have the opportunity in the trial court to present, or to contest, these explanations, in sworn form where appropriate. Accordingly, we vacate the judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>ment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">Thus, pursuant to <em>Tranker II </em>and <em>Cleveland, </em>judicial estoppel no longer automatically precludes plaintiffs discrimination claims asserted in this case. Moreover, as this Court has already acknowledged in <em>Hall v McRea Corp, </em>238 Mich App 361, 369; 605 NW2d 354 (1999), \u201c[t]he <em>Cleveland </em>requirement of an explanation from the plaintiff is fully consistent with this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Tranker II.\u201d </em>In some cases, a remand to the trial court to afford plaintiff the opportunity to reconcile his representation of total disability (for social security purposes) with his hcra and Civil Rights Act discrimination claims would be the appropriate remedy. However, we conclude neither <em>Tranker II </em>nor <em>Cleveland </em>mandates a remand for further explanation in every instance in which inconsistent claims regarding disability have been alleged. As two <em>post-Cleveland </em>federal decisions have expressly recognized, summary disposition based on estoppel, without the necessity for remand, is warranted under certain circumstances. As explained in <em>Motley v New Jersey State Police, </em>196 F3d 160, 164, 167 (CA 3, 1999):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-7\">The Supreme Court [in Cleveland] acknowledged, as do we, that a statement of total disability when applying for disability benefits may be a \u201ccontext-related legal conclusion, namely, T am disabled for purposes of the [disability act].\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>[Cleveland] at [119 S Ct] 1601. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-8\">The Court also acknowledged that certain statements made during disability hearings may lead to generally applicable factual conclusions. Where factual inconsistencies between claims exist, as opposed to context-specific legal conclusions, the Court held that the law remains \u201cwhere [it] found it.\u201d See <em>Cleveland, </em>119 S Ct at 1601-02 ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>* -i= *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-5\">As the Supreme Court made clear in <em>Cleveland, </em>119 S Ct at 1603-04, the mere fact that the statutory standards differ in some aspects does not mean that a prior assertion of permanent and total disability can never preclude a party from bringing a claim under the ADA. Cleveland holds simply that where context-related legal conclusions are involved, courts must not apply presumptions automatically without first considering whether the ADA plaintiff can reconcile the two apparently inconsistent statutory claims. <em>There may be cases where, looking at the previous facts and statements by a party, the assertions are such that the party cannot prove that he was a qualified individual because his previous statements take the position that he could not perform the essential functions of the job, with or without accommodation. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">On the basis of the existing record before it, the <em>Motley </em>Court, <em>supra </em>at 166-167, concluded that the plaintiff would not be able to satisfactorily reconcile the factual inconsistencies between his pension disability and ADA claims and, therefore, a remand was not required pursuant to <em>Cleveland:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-7\">[S]imply averring that the statutory schemes differ is not enough to survive summary judgment in light of <em>Cleveland. </em>An ADA plaintiff must offer a more substantial explanation to explain the divergent positions taken, or else summary judgment could never be granted. Motley has failed to bring additional reasons for his conflicting answers to our attention. If anything, looking to the different statutory schemes in this particular case convinces us that Motley\u2019s claims are, in fact, unreconcilable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-10\">Motley, relying on several specific and severe physical injuries, asserted that he was \u201cpermanently and totally disabled.\u201d This was not a mere blanket statement of complete disability checked on a box in order to obtain pension ben<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>efits. Rather, the assertion was supported by Motley\u2019s additional statements concerning the type and extent of his injuries. Furthermore, the medical board diagnosis, uncontested by Motley, also concluded that Motley was permanently incapacitated for police officer duties. On their face, these assertions are patently inconsistent with his present claims that he was a \u201cqualified individual\u201d under the ADA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-6\">Motley asserted that he was totally disabled so that he could receive special retirement benefits. After his retirement, he brought this claim, which necessarily relies on the fact that he was not totally disabled. Examining all the facts, we cannot say that the District Court erred when it concluded that the ada case brought by Motley was inconsistent with his earlier statements regarding his disability. Thus, under <em>Cleveland, </em>the entry of summary judgment against Motley was proper.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Likewise, in <em>Mitchell v Washingtonville Central School Dist, </em>190 F3d 1 (CA 2, 1999), the United States Court of Appeals concluded that summary judgment was appropriate, and a remand for further proceedings was not warranted. The <em>Mitchell </em>Court held that the plaintiff custodian\u2019s previous assertions that he could no longer walk or stand<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (made as part of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>successful worker\u2019s compensation and social security disability compensation claims) were purely factual conclusions (not \u201ccontext-related legal conclusion[s],\u201d Cleveland, <em>supra </em>at 802) that prevented the plaintiff from asserting a contrary factual position in his ADA claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-5\">Mitchell [plaintiff] argues that ... in its application of judicial estoppel the district court effectively imposed a <em>per se </em>rule preventing an SSDI recipient who claims an inability to work from later asserting under the ada that he or she is able to work. We disagree. The district court did not hold that Mitchell was estopped from arguing that he was able to work with a reasonable accommodation once he asserted, for purposes of obtaining workers\u2019 compensation and social security benefits, that he was too disabled to work. On the contrary, the lower court specifically declined to apply any such categorical rule and held Mitchell was estopped from asserting, as a factual matter, that he was capable of performing work in other than a sedentary position. Such an application of judicial estoppel is consistent with <em>Cleveland. </em>The Supreme Court emphasized that the case before it did not \u201cinvolve directly conflicting statements about purely factual matters, such as ... T can/cannot raise my arm above my head[,]\u2019 \u201d and indeed that the decision \u201cleaves the law related to . . . purely factual. . conflict[s] where [the Court] found it.\u201d <em>Cleveland, </em>[526] US at [802]; 119 S Ct at 1601-02. Therefore, if the requirements for judicial estoppel are otherwise met, Mitchell may be prevented from claiming, as a factual matter, that he could stand and walk at work on the basis of prior factual assertions to the contrary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-6\">Turning to those requirements, we conclude that the district court correctly held that Mitchell was estopped from asserting in the present action that he was capable of performing work that required him to stand or walk. . . . Mitch<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>ell\u2019s prior statements, made in 1994, 1995 and 1996 to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board and the Social Security Administration, that he was incapable of standing for any length of time or of walking and that he required work he could perform seated, clearly contradict Mitchell\u2019s position in this litigation that as of late 1994 he was able to stand and walk for a substantial portion of the work day. . . . Since Mitchell\u2019s earlier assertions as to his inability to walk or stand were accepted by these prior administrative tribunals, resulting in a determination in his favor, judicial estoppel prevents Mitchell from advancing, for purposes of this litigation, the contrary position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-5\">* * :|:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-6\">We also agree with the district court that, once estopped from arguing he could walk and stand and therefore bound to the assertion that he could only do sedentary work, Mitchell could not show that he could perform the essential functions of Head Custodian with a reasonable accommodation. He therefore failed to make out a [prima facie] claim [of discrimination] under the ada. [Mitchell, <em>supra </em>at 7-8.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">The instant case bears a close resemblance to the facts of both <em>Motley </em>and <em>Mitchell. </em>Indeed, we conclude the present matter is one of those cases \u201cwhere, looking at the previous facts and statements by a party, the assertions are such that the party cannot prove that he was a qualified individual because his previous statements take the position that he could not perform the essential functions of the job, with or without accommodation.\u201d <em>Motley, supra </em>at 167. Thus, we reaffirm our prior conclusion that the trial court did not err in granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition with respect to plaintiff\u2019s handicapper and age discrimination claims. <em>Quinto v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number><em>Cross &amp; Peters Co, </em>451 Mich 358, 362; 547 NW2d 314 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">The prima facie case elements and burden-shifting analyses applicable to hcra and Civil Rights Act claims are similar. <em>Hall, supra </em>at 371. To establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the hcra, a plaintiff must establish (1) he has a \u201chandicap\u201d as defined by the HCRA, (2) the handicap is unrelated to his ability to perform the duties of a particular job, and (3) he was discriminated against in one of the ways described in the statute. <em>Rollert v Dep\u2019t of Civil Service, </em>228 Mich App 534, 538; 579 NW2d 118 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">In an employment discrimination case alleging discrimination based on older age, the plaintiff must present a prima facie case demonstrating (1) membership in a protected class, (2) discharge from employment, (3) that the plaintiff was qualified for the position, and (4) that he was replaced by a younger person. <em>Lytle v Malady (On Rehearing), </em>458 Mich 153, 172-173; 579 NW2d 906 (1998); <em>Hall, supra </em>at 370-371; <em>Featherly v Teledyne Industries, Inc, </em>194 Mich App 352, 358; 486 NW2d 361 (1992). The plaintiff must prove the elements by a preponderance of the evidence; once that has been accomplished, the burden then shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the discharge. <em>Hall, supra </em>at 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">In the instant case, plaintiffs first application for social security disability benefits described his injuries as being to his \u201cknees, shoulders, carpal tunnel, [and] back.\u201d After his initial claim for benefits was denied, plaintiff submitted a signed request for reconsideration, asserting that as of the date of his termination, he became unable to work because of a disabil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>ity. In the request for reconsideration, plaintiff specifically and unequivocally represented his physical condition had changed and in effect deteriorated because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-5\">medication is no longer effective due to my inability to use because of gastro-intestinal problems. Pain in knees and neck getting worse. <em>Unable to walk on hard surface at all.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-6\">\n<em>* * *</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-7\"><em>Very limited ability to walk </em>and sleep at night due to pain in neck and knees. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">Significantly, these representations were made in the context of plaintiffs own description, set forth in the request for reconsideration, of his job at Dura:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-9\">The job of industrial relations manager is not possible to perform unless the person doing the work can stand and walk for long periods of time, i.e. 5 to 9 horns each day. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-10\">On the basis of these assertions by plaintiff, the hearing referee found plaintiff to be totally disabled<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and entitled to social security disability benefits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-11\">The claimant was 62 years old on the date on which disability has been alleged. He has a master\u2019s degree in business administration. The claimant has not engaged in any substantial gainful activity since the alleged onset. He has the following impairments which are considered to be \u201csevere\u201d under the Social Security Act and Regulations: degenerative arthritis of the left knee, cervical radiculopathy, bilateral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>ankylosis of the shoulders, and bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. These impairments prevent the claimant from lifting more than ten pounds at a time, engaging in prolonged standing and walking, performing overhead work, and repetitively using the upper extremities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-5\">* * .1=</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-6\">The claimant\u2019s descriptions of his symptoms and limitations are consistent with the record when the record is considered in its entirety. Based upon the residual functional capacity findings of this decision, it is found the claimant cannot perform his past relevant light work as an industrial relations manager. The vocational expert at the hearing testified that although the claimant had acquired skills in his past relevant work, there would be significant vocational adjustment required in terms of work settings, people, and processes in transferring his skills to sedentary work. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">Pursuant to <em>Tranker II </em>and <em>Cleveland, supra, </em>plaintiff is certainly not automatically judicially estopped from asserting in the present case that he was able to work with or without reasonable accommodation once he represented, for social security purposes, that he was totally disabled. Indeed, in conjunction with the present lawsuit, plaintiff has stated that at the hearing on his application for social security disability benefits he specifically testified he \u201ccould still perform the duties of his job at Dura Mechanical Components, Inc., had I not been involuntarily terminated\u201d and he \u201cwas capable of performing the same work that he had performed at Dura before my involuntary termination of October 27, 1992.\u201d Plaintiff has also submitted the affidavit of Roy Welton, a vocational rehabilitation specialist. After reviewing the social security disability decision rendered in favor of plaintiff, Mr. Welton opined in pertinent part that although plaintiff was technically \u201cdisabled\u201d for social <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>security purposes, he could have continued working for defendant with his handicap because his receipt of benefits was premised in part on his advanced age rather than a total inability to work. Significantly, these averments are dependent on plaintiffs further contention that the \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d afforded by the hcra, see, generally, <em>Carr v General Motors Corp, </em>425 Mich 313; 389 NW2d 686 (1986), amended in part on rehearing 426 Mich 1231 (1986), was in fact necessary and required defendant to allow him a \u201cshort medical leave\u201d for knee surgery, postoperative convalescence, and physical rehabilitation; alternatively, plaintiff argues that defendant could have accommodated plaintiffs handicap by allowing him to limit the required walking.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">We conclude, however, that plaintiffs proffered evidence does not generate a factual dispute sufficient to warrant remand or withstand summary disposition. This case, unlike <em>Cleveland, </em>does not merely involve divergent context-related legal conclusions, but rather sets forth irreconcilable factual inconsistencies analogous to those in <em>Motley </em>and <em>Mitchell. </em>Given plaintiffs earlier successful assertions at the social security disability hearing that, he was \u201cunable to walk on a hard surface at all,\u201d and he had a \u201cvery limited ability to walk,\u201d plaintiff is estopped in the present litigation from asserting, as a purely factual matter, that he could stand and walk in a prolonged fashion at work. <em>Mitchell, supra; Motley, supra. </em>See also <em>Mitan v Neiman Marcus, </em>240 Mich App 679; 613 NW2d 415 (2000); <em>Palazzola v Karmazin Products Corp, </em>223 Mich App 141, 155; 565 NW2d 868 (1997); <em>Kaufman &amp; Payton, PC v Nikkila, </em>200 Mich App 250, 256-257, 257; 503 NW2d 728 (1993) (\u201cparties may not contrive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>factual issues merely by asserting the contrary in an affidavit after having given damaging testimony in a deposition\u201d). By plaintiffs own admission, the job of industrial relations manager \u201cis not possible to perform unless the person doing the work can stand and walk for long periods of time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Once estopped in the present action from representing that he could walk or stand for prolonged periods and thus conversely bound by the conclusion that he could only perform sedentary work, plaintiff remains unable to demonstrate (even drawing all factual inferences in his favor for purposes of summary disposition, <em>Quinto, </em>supra) that he could perform the essential functions of his job with a reasonable accommodation. An employer\u2019s duty to make \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d under the hcra does not extend to granting the plaintiff a medical leave until such time as he would be able to perform the requirements of his job. <em>Lamoria v Health Care &amp; Retirement Corp, </em>233 Mich App 560, 562; 593 NW2d 699 (1999); <em>Ashworth v Jefferson Screw Products, Inc, </em>176 Mich App 737, 745; 440 NW2d 101 (1989); <em>Wilson v Acacia Park Cemetery Ass\u2019n, </em>162 Mich App 638, 643-644; 413 NW2d 79 (1987). An employer likewise has no duty to accommodate the plaintiff by recreating the position, adjusting or modifying job duties otherwise required by the job description, or placing the plaintiff in another position. <em>Carr, supra </em>at 320-323; <em>Tranker II, supra </em>at 124; <em>Koester v Novi, </em>213 Mich App 653, 662-663; 540 NW2d 765 (1995), rev\u2019d in part on other grounds 458 Mich 1; 580 NW2d 835 (1998). Consequently, defendant was not required to accommodate plaintiff in the manner he has suggested.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>In light of these circumstances, plaintiff cannot successfully advance an explanation that is \u201csufficient to warrant a reasonable juror\u2019s concluding that, assuming the truth of, or the plaintiff\u2019s good faith belief in, the earlier statement, the plaintiff could nonetheless \u2018perform the essential functions\u2019 of [his] job, with or without \u2018reasonable accommodation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cleveland, supra </em>at 807. Because a successful claim under the HCRA requires a finding that plaintiff is physically limited in a way unrelated to his ability to work, <em>Tranker II, supra </em>at 125, and the facts unequivocally demonstrate plaintiff could not perform the acts required for the industrial relations manager position, plaintiff has failed to make out a prima facie case under the HCRA. Summary disposition in favor of defendant was therefore properly granted by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The rationale of <em>Tranker II </em>and <em>Cleveland </em>applies with equal force to plaintiff\u2019s age discrimination claim. As previously noted, plaintiff must present evidence that he was \u201cqualified\u201d for the position sought. <em>Lytle, supra; Featherly, supra. </em>On the basis of our reasoning set forth above, plaintiff is unable to offer such proofs and therefore cannot make out a prima facie case of age discrimination under the Civil Rights Act.

This disability enables me [sic] from any type of prolonged standing or ambulation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-10\">At a hearing on the matter in July 1995 ... in response to the question, \u201cWhy can\u2019t you work now?\u201d, Mitchell testified, \u201cI\u2019m not sure I can get anything where I could just sit for the entire time I\u2019d be working.\u201d Mitchell further testified that he could stand for only five minutes at a time and that he could not carry any weight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Finally, Mitchell stated that he was in constant pain when he wore his prosthesis.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b69-12\"> \u201cDisability\u201d is defined under the Social Security Act as the \u201c \u2018inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u2019 \u201d See <em>Tranker I, supra </em>at 12, quoting 42 USC 423(d)(1)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b73-9\">Smolenski, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWC\">(dissenting). I respectfully dissent. I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that plaintiff\u2019s handicap and age discrimination claims are barred because of representations plaintiff made when apply<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>ing for social security disability insurance (ssdi) benefits. Rather, I believe that this Court should reverse the trial court\u2019s decision granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition and remand for further proceedings, given the holdings of <em>Cleveland v Policy Management Systems Corp, </em>526 US 795; 119 S Ct 1597; 143 L Ed 2d 966 (1999), and <em>Tranker v Figgie Int'l, Inc (On Remand), </em>231 Mich App 115; 585 NW2d 337 (1998) <em>(Tranker II).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">It is clear that statements made in the context of an SSDI application may not be utilized to automatically bar a plaintiff\u2019s handicap discrimination claim under either the Persons with Disabilities Civil Rights Act (PWDCRA), MCL 37.1101 <em>et </em>seq.; MSA 3.550(101) <em>et seq., </em>or the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 USC 12101 <em>et seq. Cleveland, supra </em>at 797-798; <em>Tranker II, supra </em>at 121-122. Yet, the question remains whether courts will generally allow the jury to weigh the plaintiff\u2019s inconsistent statements or will generally grant summary disposition to the defendant on the grounds that the plaintiff\u2019s statements are too inconsistent for the plaintiff to prove a prima facie handicap discrimination claim. In <em>Tranker II, </em>this Court held that \u201cstatements made by the plaintiff in his prior application for disability benefits may weigh against him in his subsequent handicap discrimination claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 122-123. The <em>Cleveland </em>Court required ADA plaintiffs to offer a \u201csufficient explanation\u201d for statements made in an application for SSDI benefits that apparently contradict the essential elements of a handicap discrimination claim. 526 US 806. This Court accepted the <em>Cleveland </em>requirement of a \u201csufficient explanation\u201d in <em>Hall v McRea Corp, </em>238 Mich App 361, 369; 605 NW2d 354 (1999), stating that a handi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>cap discrimination plaintiff \u201cshould not be permitted to proceed without explaining how he could, in good faith, represent a total disability and be able to perform the job with reasonable accommodation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">The majority recognizes the above precedent, but relies on two federal decisions, <em>Motley v New Jersey State </em>Police, 196 F3d 160 (CA 3, 1999), and <em>Mitchell v Washingtonville Central School Dist, </em>190 F3d 1 (CA 2, 1999), which concluded that the plaintiffs were not entitled to remand to the trial court for an opportunity to reconcile their ssdi claims with their handicap discrimination claims. However, other federal decisions following <em>Cleveland </em>have concluded that facially inconsistent statements made by the plaintiff in the earlier proceeding did not merit summary disposition of the plaintiffs handicap discrimination claim. See <em>Parker v Columbia Pictures Industries, </em>204 F3d 326, 334-335 (CA 2, 2000) (the plaintiffs argument that he was capable of returning to his job on a gradual or part-time basis or with other accommodations constituted sufficient explanation and warranted remand); <em>Norris v Sysco Corp, </em>191 F3d 1043, 1049 (CA 9, 1999) (the plaintiffs inconsistent statements should be weighed by the jury); <em>Nodelman v Gruner &amp; Jahr USA Publishing, </em>2000 WL 502858, * 8 (SD NY, 2000) (the plaintiffs argument that he could perform his job with reasonable accommodations constituted sufficient explanation to defeat summary judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">In this case, plaintiff argued in his brief on remand that defendant could have reasonably accommodated his inability to stand or walk for prolonged periods. Plaintiff explained the apparent inconsistency between his ssdi application and his pwdcra claim by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>stating that \u201c[t]here is no concept of accommodation in the fact-findings regarding\u201d an SSDI claim. This is the very explanation envisioned in <em>Cleveland, </em>that the plaintiff\u2019s ssdi statements were \u201c \u2018made in a forum which does not consider the effect that reasonable workplace accommodations\u2019 \u201d would have on the plaintiff\u2019s ability to work. 526 US 807. Because plaintiff provided a \u201csufficient explanation\u201d in his brief on remand, I conclude that the \u201cparties should have the opportunity in the trial court to present, or to contest, these explanations, in sworn form where appropriate.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Reading plaintiff\u2019s SSDI statements in context, I believe that a reasonable jury could find that plaintiff was capable of satisfying the prima facie elements of both his handicap and age discrimination claims. I would therefore reverse the trial court\u2019s decision granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition with respect to those two claims and remand this case to the circuit court for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
