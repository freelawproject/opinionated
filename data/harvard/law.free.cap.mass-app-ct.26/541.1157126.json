L. c. 276, \u00a7 82A. The statute, inserted by St. 1965, c. 396, provides: \u201cA person who is released by court order or other lawful authority on bail or recognizance on condition that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>will appear personally at a specified time and place and who fails without sufficient excuse to so appear shall be punished \u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">At trial to a Middlesex jury, the Commonwealth established the following through Robert McDade, an assistant clerk at the Superior Court in Cambridge. The defendant on June 10, 1985, was awaiting trial on an indictment charging him with breaking and entering. That day he was released from detention upon depositing $500 as surety and entering into a \u201crecognizance\u201d in the usual form to appear at places and times that might be specified. The recognizance stated: \u201cA defendant who fails without sufficient excuse to appear in court after release on bail or recognizance may be punished [stating the penalty].\u201d The breaking-and-entering case came to trial on December 2, 1985, with the defendant in attendance. Trial was continued to the next day at 10:00 a.m. The defendant was on notice that he was required to appear at that time. He failed to appear. The judge consulted with the prosecutor and defendant\u2019s counsel. They had no information about the defendant\u2019s whereabouts. An officer in open court called the-defendant to the bar. There was no response. A default issued, a default capias went to the district attorney\u2019s office, and bail was revoked and ordered forfeited. Trial resumed on December 4 with the defendant still absent, and a conviction followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">When McDade completed his foregoing testimony, the Commonwealth called Lieutenant Donald Whalen of the Wellesley police. Whalen testified that on January 30, 1986, he had an interview with the defendant at the Wellesley police station where he was being detained after an arrest. Miranda warnings had been given. When the Commonwealth inquired whether Whalen had asked the defendant where he was on January 6, 1986,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> defense counsel interposed, raising the question whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>the defendant had given his response voluntarily. Upon voir dire, Whalen testified at some length. The judge ruled that the defendant\u2019s statement should be excluded.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thereupon, without offering further evidence, the Commonwealth rested.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">No motion for a required finding of not guilty was offered by the defense. The defendant took the stand. He said, in effect, that he believed the breaking-and-entering trial was unfair to him because his lawyer had declined to urge a defense of \u201cdiminished capacity\u201d and also because there were witnesses whom the defense had not reached in time for the trial. Under pressure of this feeling, he had decided to quit the trial (not knowing how the trial might proceed) and to try to raise money to get better legal representation. He went to Florida, then returned and lived at various addresses until apprehended on January 30, 1986.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On cross-examination the defendant was impeached by the record of his several criminal convictions. The defense rested, again without moving for a required finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">After closing speeches, the judge instructed that the Commonwealth had the burden to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant was released by court order on bail, that it was a condition of his release that he appear at places and times as specified, that he failed to appear at a place and time specified, and that his failure to appear was without sufficient excuse. With respect to the last element, the judge said in substance: he could not supply a pat definition, but he could give illustrative examples on either side of the line of \u201csufficient excuse,\u201d and he did so;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> he left it to the jury, applying then-judgment, to decide whether the defendant\u2019s explanation (if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>believed), which suggested a kind of duress;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> would be regarded by a reasonably prudent person as a sufficient excuse for failing to appear in court or would rather be thought an arbitrary act. There was no objection to the charge. The jury brought in a verdict of guilty on September 9, 1986, and judgment of conviction followed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">On November 13, 1987, represented by new counsel, the defendant moved for postconviction relief, claiming that trial counsel had provided him with \u201cineffective assistance\u201d under the rule of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974), on the following grounds: first, counsel failed to move to dismiss the bail-jumping indictment as being based on a statute void for \u201cvagueness\u201d through its use of the words \u201cwithout sufficient excuse\u201d; second, passing the question of vagueness, counsel failed to move at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case (or at the close of all the evidence) for a required finding of not guilty on the ground that the Commonwealth had not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant acted without sufficient excuse. The judge (who had also presided at the trial) denied the postconviction motion with a memorandum dated March 16, 1988, and the present appeal is from the denial.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">We agree with the judge that there was no merit in the constitutional claim and that a motion for a required finding would have been futile. Accordingly any question of the effectiveness of counsel becomes inconsequential.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">1. Moving under Mass.R.Crim.P. 30(a) and (b), 378 Mass. 900 (1979), the defendant claimed that his counsel erred in failing to apply before trial (see Mass.R.Crim.P. 13[a], 378 Mass. 871 [1979]) for dismissal of the indictment on the \u201cvagueness\u201d ground. This, presumably, would have been an attack on the statute \u201con its face,\u201d and such, indeed, is the line of argument pursued in the defendant\u2019s brief. By a settled rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>in the Commonwealth, however, so broad a contention, which asks the court to consider all situations to which the statute might be applied, and to void it if any of the applications would be unconstitutional, is reserved for cases where the statute appears to trench on First Amendment (or similar) rights. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>National Dairy Prod. Corp., </em>372 U.S. 29, 36 (1963); <em>Kolender </em>v. <em>Lawson, </em>461 U.S. 352, 359 n.8 (1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bohmer, </em>374 Mass. 368, 371 n.6 (1978).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The present statute is not of that type, so the question whether it could withstand \u201cfacial\u201d scrutiny is irrelevant. Rather the question is whether the statute, or, more closely, the particular words objected to, identify for citizens and law enforcement authorities a core of condemned conduct, and whether this case, as it shaped up, appears to be within the core: the inquiry is contextual. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>National Dairy Prod. Corp., </em>372 U.S. at 32-33; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>389 Mass. 265, 270-271 (1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>395 Mass. 302, 304 (1985); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jasmin, 396 </em>Mass. 653, 655 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">As the judge instructed, the expression \u201cwithout sufficient excuse\u201d conveys the meaning of deliberate conduct contrary to that which was required \u2014 this in distinction from conduct which the actor did not will, or was unable to control. Thus the statute resembles, if, indeed, it is not equivalent to, a common kind of bail-jumping statute that speaks, of \u201cwillful\u201d failure to appear as required.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> There is, no doubt, an ineradicable element of imprecision in either statutory formulation. But the vagueness doctrine \u201cis not a principle designed to convert into a constitutional dilemma the practical difficulties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>in drawing criminal statutes both general enough to take into account a variety of human conduct and sufficiently specific to provide fair warning that certain kinds of conduct are prohibited.\u201d <em>Colten </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>407 U.S. 104, 110 (1972). A statute is not vague in the outlawed constitutional sense \u201cif it requires a person to conform his conduct to an imprecise but comprehensible normative standard . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>395 Mass. at 304, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Orlando, </em>371 Mass. 732, 734 (1977). Such a standard is not impermissibly vague even though reasonable minds might differ whether particular conduct at the periphery of the \u201ccore\u201d comports with it: the jury decide the question under instructions, as they do in easier cases to which the standard speaks more clearly. See <em>Hygrade Provision Co. </em>v. <em>Sherman, 266 </em>U.S. 497, 502 (1925). Cf. <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>324 U.S. 282, 283, 285-286 (1945). The present defendant, in reason, could apprehend within rough bounds where his duty lay, and these would correspond with the scope of the statute as described by the judge.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Law enforcement officials would similarly understand what conduct was proscribed.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">We are fortified in our view that the present statute is valid by the fact that statutes in the same or a comparable sense have been long on the books and enforced without serious criticism on supposed vagueness grounds. Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>698 P.2d 801, 808 (Colo. 1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Vogel, </em>315 N.W.2d 324, 326-327 (S. Dak. 1982). The defendant points to a decision by the Washington Supreme Court, <em>State </em>v. <em>Hilt, </em>99 Wash.2d 452 (1983), invalidating a bail-jumping statute which used the expression \u201cknowingly fails without lawful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>excuse to appear as required.\u201d The court may have thought that \u201clawful excuse\u201d invoked some arcanum of lawyers\u2019 technicalities and thus might mislead defendants and law enforcers. See <em>id. </em>at 455. That apart, the Washington court in its opinion appeared (without assigning a reason) to consider the statute on its face rather than in context.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> And the court remarked on the possible unconstitutionality of the further provision of the statute: \u201cUnless otherwise established, the failure to appear when required shall be inferred to have been without lawful excuse.\u201d Some recent decisions of the Washington courts suggest that <em>Hilt </em>itself may be losing strength as a precedent.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It is noteworthy that the Model Penal Code\u2019s bail-jumping provision, \u00a7 242.8, uses the very expression \u201cwithout lawful excuse.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The commentary indicates that the provision \u201cobviously\u201d exempts cases where appearance was prevented by accident, illness, and the like, but that the full range of excuses valid in particular circumstances cannot be identified in advance and are left to case-by-case adjudication. Model Penal Code and Commentaries \u00a7 242.8 comment 3, at 284 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">2. The defendant sought to avail himself of an excuse \u2014 that he was overborne by his belief that the breaking-and-entering trial was unfair to him. This had some resemblance to a claim of \u201cduress,\u201d as the judge suggested, or, perhaps, of \u201cnecessity\u201d (related to the idea of \u201ccompeting harms\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>). If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>analogy to either of these justifications is followed, then the defendant herein would have the burden of producing some evidence of a \u201csufficient excuse\u201d before the Commonwealth would becofn\u00e9 obligated to shoulder the burden of negating that excuse by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. As to \u201cnecessity,\u201d the court said in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thurber, </em>383 Mass. 328, 331 (1981): \u201cThe question of necessity is fairly raised only if there is evidence that would warrant a reasonable doubt whether the escape was justified by necessity. . . . Once the question is fairly raised, the teaching of our cases on matters of justification, mitigation and excuse is that the burden is on the Commonwealth to prove absence of justification beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hood, </em>389 Mass. 581, 594 (1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brugmann, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 373, 379 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Malley, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 314, 319 (1982). The same holds for a justification of duress. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>382 Mass. 189, 198-209 (1981); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Melzer, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 174, 183 &amp; n.6 (1982); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>725 F.2d 832, 834-837 (2d Cir. 1983). Beyond the analogical force of these precedents in indicating how a proffered excuse under the bail-jumping statute should be treated at trial, we have the commonsense point that it is the defendant charged under the statute who in all likelihood knows the relevant facts, and there is no unfairness in requiring him to produce some evidence of them.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">To turn to the present case, the Commonwealth was not required to establish in its case-in-chief that the defendant acted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>without sufficient excuse.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Thus a defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding at that stage (or as later repeated) would properly have been denied; and the judge in his memorandum on the postconviction application said he would have denied it. The defendant on his side attempted to offer evidence of a sufficient excuse. It is very doubtful that his effort amounted even to a \u201cproduction\u201d in the sense of the <em>Thurber </em>case, 383 Mass. at 331, for it would be properly held under the present statute (correctly defined in the judge\u2019s instruction), as has been observed under other bail-jumping statutes, that fear of an unfair trial does not justify flight, see <em>Beasley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>618 S.W.2d 179, 180-181 (Ky. Ct. App. 1981), any more than fear of deportation, see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Odufowora, </em>814 F.2d 73, 74-75 (1st Cir. 1987), or fear of harm if incarcerated, see <em>People </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>57 Ill. App.3d 62, 66 (1978). Thus the trial judge might well have declined to instruct on sufficient excuse. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>391 Mass. 645, 651 (1984). The defendant got more than he deserved when the judge did charge on the matter and assigned the burden of persuasion to the Commonwealth. The verdict was just.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">\n<em>Order denying motion for post-conviction relief affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b568-9\"> The penalty prescribed is a fine of not more than $1,000 or imprisonment for not more than a year in a house of correction, or both, but the fine or imprisonment may not exceed the maximum sentence prescribed for any crime in connection with which the defendant\u2019s appearance was required.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b568-10\"> It appears that the defendant had on his person a document showing his presence in Florida under an assumed name on January 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b569-7\"> The judge evidently thought the defendant\u2019s \u201cvoluntariness\u201d had been compromised through conversation with Whalen about the defendant\u2019s getting a favorable recommendation from the police in exchange for furnishing information concerning crimes by others.
