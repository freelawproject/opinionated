The insurer of one of the defendants intervened and also brought an action seeking a declaration that its homeowner\u2019s policy did not provide coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-17\">The actions were consolidated for trial. In response to special questions, a jury found that the insured, Eric R. Krasnigor, had \u201cintended to start a fire or fires\u201d at the school. Because the jury also found that Krasnigor neither \u201cspecifically intended to cause the substantial damage which was ultimately sustained\u201d at the school nor \u201cwas substantially certain that his actions at the [school] would result in the substantial damage which was ultimately sustained,\u201d the trial judge, relying on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number><em>Quincy Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Abernathy, </em>393 Mass. 81, 86 (1984), declared that the activities of the insured were not excluded by the policy. The policy provided coverage for property damage \u201cfor which the insured is legally liable\u201d but excluded \u201cproperty damage . . . which is expected or intended by the insured.\u201d The insurer appeals from judgments entered against it in both actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The insurer urges us to decide that <em>Abernathy </em>does not require the insured to intend the precise injury which results for the exclusion to apply. Rather, the insurer asserts, the exclusion is also in effect when the insured intends to cause some damage (here property damage) but not necessarily the severity of damage that actually occurs. The city contends that <em>Abernathy </em>has answered this question against the insurer. While we consider the construction urged by the insurer correct and not barred by <em>Abernathy, </em>we affirm because the distinction now argued on appeal was not brought to the attention of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">In <em>Abernathy, </em>a teenager threw a piece of \u201cblacktop\u201d at a car driven by Ellen Abernathy. The rock shattered the car\u2019s side window, injuring Ellen and her daughter. <em>Id. </em>at 82. The insurer claimed that a clause providing that the policy \u201cdoes not apply ... to bodily injury or property damage which is either expected or intended from the standpoint of the Insured\u201d foreclosed coverage. In reversing a summary judgment in favor of the insurer and remanding for further proceedings, the court held that two critical issues remained for resolution: \u201cwhether [the teenager] intended, by his volitional act, to cause injury to the Abemathys or whether he knew to a substantial certainty that such injuries would ensue from his actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 87. Portions of the remainder of the court\u2019s discussion appear in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>The city relies on the following language of <em>Abernathy.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-5\">\u201cThis court consistently has stated that the resulting injury which ensues from the volitional act of an insured is still an \u2018accident\u2019 within the meaning of an insurance policy if the insured does not specifically intend to cause the resulting harm or is not substantially certain that such harm will occur. See <em>Sheehan </em>v. <em>Goriansky, </em>[321 Mass. 200, 204-205 (1947)]; <em>Sontag v. Galer, </em>279 Mass. 309, 312-313 (1932). Cf. <em>Bohaker </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>215 Mass. 32, 33-34 (1913).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 84.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Taken out of context, the city\u2019s reading is plausible. When, however, the focus of the opinion, the cases to which the court cites, and the authorities elsewhere are considered, we think the foregoing quotation does not require the city\u2019s construction and that <em>Abernathy </em>does not preclude the construction sought by the insurer: namely, that the exclusion may be invoked by a showing of a deliberate setting of a fire by the insured with the intent of causing some property damage.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Terrio </em>v. <em>McDonough, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 163, 169 (1983). The following cases, involving similar exclusions, support the insurer\u2019s position. See <em>United Servs. Auto. Assn. </em>v. <em>Elitzky, </em>358 Pa. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>Super. 362, 373-375 (1986) (\u201cclause excludes only injury and damage of the same general type which the insured intended to cause\u201d).

None of the following documents: the insurer\u2019s complaint,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> its requests for instructions,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> its motion for a directed verdict, its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>proposed special questions,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or its objections to the judge\u2019s charge, indicated to the judge its present contention that if its insured intended to cause <em>any </em>property damage by burning, the policy exclusion would apply. The insurer never informed the judge that it sought to direct the jury\u2019s attention to the question whether Krasnigor intended to cause any property damage at all to the school or its contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Only after the jury, in the midst of their deliberations, had submitted a question as to intent, did the insurer hint that the youth did not need to intend the extensive damage which had occurred. The entire colloquy of the judge and counsel for the insurer is reproduced in the margin.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We do not think the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>surer\u2019s argument was sufficiently precise or timely to change the basis on which the case had been presented to the jury. The focus was once again a plea for the use of the term \u201cresulting\u201d damage which counsel for the insurer had sought throughout the trial as opposed to the terms \u201csubstantial\u201d and \u201cultimate.\u201d See notes 4, 5 and 6, <em>supra. </em>See <em>Brighetti </em>v. <em>Consolidated Rail Corp., </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 192, 197-198, and notes 5 &amp; 7 (1985). See also <em>Huff v. Holyoke, </em>386 Mass. 582, 583 n.2 (1982); <em>MacCuish </em>v. <em>Volkswagenwerk A.G., </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 380, 397 (1986), <em>S.C., </em>400 Mass. 1003 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b229-7\"> \u201cFrom the agreed facts, we know only that [the teenager] admitted to performing the physical act of throwing the rock at the car [footnote omitted].

We know nothing about [his] mental faculties at the time of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">\u201cFurthermore, even if we assume that [the youth] was fully aware of the circumstances when he threw the rock, the judge could not infer merely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>from the undisputed facts that he expected or intended harm to the Abernathy s. . .
