L. c. 231A, seeking a declaration of the rights and duties of the parties under a so-called \u201call risk\u201d contract of insurance issued to the plaintiff (HRG) by the defendant (Graphic Arts). After a hearing on the plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the judge filed a \u201cmemorandum of decision\u201d and entered summary judgment against the plaintiff. From that judgment the plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-15\">HRG (formerly known as Goldstein &amp; Gurwitz, Inc.) purchased a multi-peril insurance policy on or before May 1, 1985, for the policy period of May 1, 1985, through May 1, 1986. The policy contained an endorsement covering HRG\u2019s heavy construction equipment against \u201call risks of physical loss or damage from any external cause . . . .\u201d That endorse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>ment also provided for thirteen specific categories of exclusion. In addition, the policy contained seven \u201cspecial conditions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aoy\">On or about April 8, 1986, the plaintiff was served with the complaint in the matter of H. Leverton &amp; Co., Ltd. <em>vs. </em>Gold-stein &amp; Gurwitz, Inc.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff (Leverton) in that action brought suit for \u201creplevin and damages to obtain relief for the wrongful acquisition\u201d of certain heavy equipment. Leverton alleged that it was the true owner of the equipment and that it had perfected its right to the equipment by registration. Leverton sought a return of the equipment in HRG\u2019s possession or control, an accounting of monies received for the sale of any equipment, damages and a declaration that any conveyance of the equipment by HRG is null and void. HRG subsequently requested that its insurer, Graphic Arts, defend the action and indemnify it against any and all claims for defects in title. The insurer refused to do so, claiming that the policy provided no coverage for this type of loss. This action ensued.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The only issue on appeal is whether the \u201call risks\u201d insurance policy covers defects in title. The relevant clause states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-6\">\u201cThis policy insures against <em>all risks of physical loss or damage from any external cause. </em>...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">The plaintiff argues that the plain and ordinary meaning of this language compels coverage under the policy not only for all risks of damage occurring from any external cause, but also for risks of loss without physical damage as well. The trial judge disagreed and ruled that the plain meaning of the language was that the policy \u201conly applies to physical losses\u201d and that it did not cover losses occasioned by a defect in title. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>HRG, in support of its contention that defective title is covered under the \u201call risk\u201d policy, cites <em>Sun Ins. Office, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Clay, </em>133 So.2d 735 (Fla. 1961). There, the court stated that an \u201call risk\u201d insurance policy was a \u201c \u2018type of contract . . . said to cover every conceivable loss or damage . . . except when occasioned by the willful or fraudulent act of the insured. \u2019 2 Richards on Insurance \u00a7 212 [5th ed. 1952].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 739. The plaintiff would thus have us conclude that since the insurer does not exclude from coverage loss or damage arising from defective title, it must come within the \u201call risks\u201d provision of the policy. We reject that argument for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">In construing \u201call risk\u201d policies of insurance \u201c[t]he \u2018risk\u2019 comprehended [in such a policy] has been characterized as: \u2018a fortuitous event \u2014 a casualty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Standard Elec. Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Norfolk &amp; Dedham Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 762, 764 (1974), quoting from <em>Mellon </em>v. <em>Federal Ins. Co., </em>14 F.2d 997, 1004 (S.D.N.Y. 1926).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Later this court stated that \u201c[a]n \u2018all risk\u2019 policy is designed to extend protection against the kind of \u2018fortuitous loss\u2019 which is not usually covered under other insurance.\u201d <em>Mellon </em>v. <em>Hingham Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 933, 935 n.1 (1984), quoting from <em>Standard Elec. Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Norfolk &amp; Dedham Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. at 763. See Gorman, All Risks of Loss v. All Loss, 34 Notre Dame Law. 346, 353 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">In the instant case, not only is it highly questionable whether an alleged defect in title is a \u201cfortuitous loss\u201d as that term has been defined; it is also evident that the loss or damage could have been covered by other insurance \u2014 i.e., title insurance. See G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 47, eleventh par. and \u00a7\u00a7 114 et seq. Indeed, if \u201call risk\u201d coverage were as broad as the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>argues, there would be little reason for one to purchase title insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">It also should be noted that the plaintiff here would not be able to show that the \u201crisk\u201d occurred within the period covered by the policy. Nor do we think the salient phrase (\u201cphysical loss or damage\u201d) fairly can be construed to mean physical loss in the absence of <em>physical </em>damage. In every listed exception, save one, the \u201closs[es] or damage[s]\u201d set forth are essentially of a physical nature.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In addition, two of the \u201cspecial conditions\u201d of the policy tend to reinforce our view that the policy was intended to cover <em>physical </em>losses and damages.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">There are no cases precisely on point in this Commonwealth. However, the Washington State Appeals Court has dealt with this identical issue in <em>Nevers </em>v. <em>Aetna Ins. Co., </em>14 Wash. App. 906 (1976). There, the plaintiff\u2019s newly purchased boat was covered by an \u201c \u2018all risks\u2019 yachtsman\u2019s hull [insurance] policy.\u201d The plaintiff subsequently discovered that his title to the boat was defective. The rightful owner demanded that the boat be returned. The plaintiff surrendered the boat and sought recovery for the loss under his \u201call risks\u201d policy. That court held that \u201call risks\u201d policies do not cover defects in title.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">The reasoning of the <em>Nevers </em>court that the plaintiff\u2019s loss preceded the effective date of the policy is also persuasive.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>The <em>Nevers </em>court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-5\">\u201c [I]t is axiomatic that insurance coverage of this kind customarily insures risks which occur in the policy period of coverage, and does not insure undisclosed events which take place prior to the effective date of coverage. The defect which resulted in plaintiff\u2019s loss of the boat clearly preceded the effective date of the policy. See <em>Greene </em>v. <em>Cheetham, </em>293 F.2d 933 (2d Cir. 1961).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 908.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">We think that the same alternative rationale should apply in the instant case. HRG\u2019s loss occurred before it had an insurable interest in the property. For this reason, as well as those previously discussed, the \u201call risk\u201d policy does not provide coverage for a defect in title.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b401-8\"> This action was brought in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b401-9\"> HRG specifically claimed that Graphic Arts \u201cis contractually bound to provide a defense for [it] and to indemnify [it] for any judgment or loss sustained in [the Leverton action].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b402-7\">\u201cIt covers a risk, not a certainty; it is something, which happens to the subject-matter from without, not the natural behaviour of that subject-matter, being what it is, in the circumstances under which it is carried. Nor is it a loss which the assured brings about by his own act, for then he has not merely exposed the goods to the chance of injury, he has injured them himself.\u201d <em>Standard Elec. Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Norfolk &amp; Dedham Mut. Fire. Ins. Co., </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. at 764 (footnote omitted). See Gorman, All Risks of Loss v. All Loss, 34 Notre Dame Law. 346, 351-352 (1959).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b403-8\"> Of the two exceptions cited by the plaintiff in support of its argument that coverage is not limited solely to losses of a physical nature, only the exception pertaining to \u201cinfidelity or dishonest acts\u201d would seem to provide any support.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b403-9\"> Condition #4 provides that \u201c[i]t is a condition of this insurance that all articles insured hereunder are in sound condition at the time of attachment of this insurance,\u201d and condition #3 states that \u201c[u]pon the Company\u2019s request, the named insured shall exhibit the damaged property to the Company. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b403-10\"> \u201cThe purpose of the insuring agreement is clearly to insure against damage <em>or </em>physical loss <em>to the boat </em>caused by fortuituous or external circumstances, rather than to warrant the quality of plaintiff\u2019s title\u201d (emphasis in original). 14 Wash. App. at 908 n.l.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b403-11\"> Before reaching this conclusion, the <em>Nevers </em>court stated that \u201cdefective title is clearly not a \u2018physical loss or damage . . . from any external cause . . .\u2019.\u201d14 Wash. App. at 907. Relying upon that assertion, the Court found that there was no coverage under the \u201call risks\u201d policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
