It appears that immediately upon graduating from the police academy, the identifying officer was assigned to an undercover narcotics investigation being conducted in four areas of Lynn, one of which was Mall Street. Within a short time span, the officer made about seventy-five drug purchases from some thirty different people, including the defendant. After his purchase from the defendant, the officer was unable to select the defendant\u2019s picture from a photographic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>array. Two months later, the officer saw the defendant, who commented to him about the quality of the earlier purchased cocaine. The officer returned to the police station and selected the defendant\u2019s picture from a second array. The sole issue on appeal is whether the defendant was deprived of a fair trial by reason of pretrial publicity. We conclude that the defendant laid a sufficient preliminary foundation to warrant at least one of the remedial measures that he requested. As the judge denied all those requests, we reverse the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">1. <em>The Publicity.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">On April 9, 1986, the grand jury returned the present indictment, and the matter was scheduled for trial on July 11, 1986. Three days prior to trial, the defendant sought a change of venue by motion in which it was alleged that \u201cpublicity in Essex County newspapers concerning the details of this case, details of his subsequent arrest on new charges, detailed articles concerning the defendant\u2019s family, its history and activities in Lynn\u201d would impair the fairness of his trial which was to be held in Newburyport. Copies of numerous newspaper articles were attached to the motion. The articles had appeared in newspapers which had been published or circulated, or both, in Essex County between June 16 and June 29, 1986. The captions were in dark, boldface print and were worded, as would be expected, to catch the reader\u2019s eye. Although a hint of humor might be found in the captions, the articles themselves paint a damaging picture of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">a. <em>\u201cDog doesn\u2019t bite, but suspect </em>does.\u201d On June 16, a Lynn newspaper, the Daily Evening Item (Lynn Item), reported that ten police officers went to the 23 Mall Street apartment of the defendant (identified by name) to arrest him for armed robbery. When the police tried to arrest the defendant in his kitchen, a struggle ensued. Two of the officers and the defendant were on the floor scuffling When someone sent a pit bulldog into the kitchen to assist the defendant. When the dog declined to get involved in the melee, the defendant bit the two officers, who thereafter sought medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">b. <em>\u201cSuspect bit\u2019em, claim two cops. Pit bull stands by during affray.\u201d </em>This article appeared in the Lynn Item the next day. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>It again described the fight in the kitchen and went on to describe the defendant\u2019s conduct at his arraignment on the armed robbery charges, to which charges of assaulting a police officer had been added. The reader of this article was informed that the defendant, while restrained in the prisoners\u2019 dock, became disruptive and destructive. He disputed his record of defaults, insisting that he was being confused with his brother. As reported in this article, \u201ccourt sources\u201d stated that the \u201cKendricks [sic] brothers frequently manage to upset court proceedings by concealing their true identities and posing as one another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">It was further noted in the article that the defendant\u2019s Mall Street address was \u201chome to an estimated 10 pit bulls,\u201d some of which \u201cbelong to the Kendrick family.\u201d Earlier that month, one of the ten dogs had been \u201cseized ... for allegedly mauling a Lynn mailman,\u201d and a second \u201cwas confiscated ... a few days later.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">c. <em>\u201cPit bull owner accused of biting two Lynn </em>policemen.\u201d On June 18, the Peabody Times picked up the account of the defendant\u2019s fight with the police and the pit bull\u2019s failure to render assistance. This article explained that \u201c[p]it bulls historically have been bred as killers and animal experts say a person never knows when the dog will attack.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">d. <em>\u201cEvidence of pit bull fighting found. Mall Street families </em>evicted.\u201d On June 28, the Lynn Item reported that four families were evicted from 23 Mall Street for. failure to pay rent. Although the defendant\u2019s name did not appear in this article a reader of the previous articles reasonably could suspect a connection between the article and the defendant. As related in this account, those responsible for the eviction process were accompanied to the premises by a \u201cspecial tactical weapons team clad in black fatigues.\u201d Once on the premises, the team <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>discovered a pit bull fighting arena, dog stalls, and a number of sick and bruised pit bulls.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">If there is any notion that the defendant\u2019s unfavorable public image would fade prior to his trial in the instant case, we come forward to June 29 and that week\u2019s edition of the North Shore Sunday, a paper having a circulation of 110,000. A photograph of the Kendrick family (not in its entirety) appears on the front page under the following caption:</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">e. \u201c <em>\u2018The Worst Family in </em>Lynn.\u2019 \u201d To the immediate right of the caption and in smaller print, appears: \u201cThat\u2019s what city officials call the Kendricks. T don\u2019t know what\u2019s worse, them or the pit bulls,\u2019 says one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">Directly beneath the photograph, the family\u2019s four-page saga opens with: \u201cThe veteran Lynn cop mulled over many years of experience with the notorious Kendrick family, then concluded, \u2018They\u2019re not a family, they\u2019re a crime wave.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">As the article spreads over the pages, there are other captions (such as \u201cThe family that nobody wants\u201d) and photographs. The defendant appears in one entitled \u201cHanging Out On Mall Street. \u201d Under this picture, the article reports that \u201c[b]oth neighbors and police blame the Kendricks for most of the problems \u2014 from noise to drug dealing \u2014 in the neighborhood.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">There are about twenty-seven family members, and most of them live in Lynn. The article describes a wide range of social services and assistance given to the various family members. There is an inset captioned \u201cThe people who tried to help.\u201d It appears that a Lynn Redevelopment Authority employee and a member of the Council of Churches, and perhaps others, were interviewed for the article. In any event, we learn from the inset that housing placements for the Kendrick family met with neighborhood resistance. In one instance, a house designated for the family burned down before they could move into it. As reported in the article, a \u201cwidely accepted story is that neighbors torched it to keep the Kendricks away.\u201d Another placement met with similar consequences. After the Kendrick family moved into their appointed house, it too burned down. The family dog was \u201cshot dead in the middle of the street and the doors had been nailed shut from the outside.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>Twelve family members, including the defendant, were the subjects of individual biographical sketches, short paragraphs detailing criminal records, divorces, number of children receiving assistance, arrest records, etc. The defendant\u2019s biographical sketch is not as impressive as some of the others. However, prior to the individual histories and near the picture of the defendant \u201changing out on Mall Street,\u201d it is stated that the defendant has a record of twenty-six arrests, that the Mall Street area near the defendant\u2019s residence \u201cwas like a McDonald\u2019s drive-thru for drug buyers last summer [1985],\u201d and that \u201c[s]everal Kendricks . . . were arrested on drug charges after a raid at 23 Mall St. late in the summer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">2. <em>Requests for Relief from Prejudicial Publicity.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">The indictment charging the defendant with the unlawful distribution of cocaine was returned, as previously mentioned, on April 9, 1986. Throughout April, May, and June, 1986, various motions were filed, heard, and ruled upon. Trial was set for July 14. On July 8, defense counsel filed a motion for change of venue and attached the articles to the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">At the hearing on the motion on July 10, defense counsel pointed to the content and extent of the publicity, noting that the defendant\u2019s first name was one which \u201ccould very definitely stick out in a person\u2019s mind,\u201d that the jury pool consisted of people \u201cfrom the entire county,\u201d and that the defendant even had merited mention on Paul Harvey\u2019s national radio broadcast news show. Viewing the articles as focused more on pit bulls than on the defendant, and being skeptical that the publicity \u201cgot to Newburyport,\u201d where the trial was to be held, the judge denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">When the case was called for trial the next day (July 11), defense counsel filed a motion to exclude from the jury pool \u201call persons living in the greater Lynn area.\u201d That motion was also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">Next came a motion to propound questions individually to prospective jurors. Of the nine requested questions, only one is here pertinent. It reads: \u201cDo you read any, or all of the following newspapers on a regular basis: North Shore Sunday; The Lynn Item; The Peabody Times; The Newburyport News; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>The Boston Herald. Have you seen articles or columns regarding the defendant and or his family?\u201d The judge announced that he would make inquiry of the jurors, collectively, \u201cin some of these matters\u201d but that he would not use the \u201cprecise language\u201d requested by the defendant. Two questions which reasonably could be viewed as related to the publicity problem, albeit in an oblique and limited manner, were put to the prospective jurors: (1) \u201c[Wjhether or not, from any source whatsoever, be it a newspaper, at work, over the radio, at some social gathering, from any source whatsoever, do any one of you have any prior knowledge of <em>this particular matter </em>[emphasis supplied]\u201d? (2) \u201c[H]ave any one of you ever formed any opinion with respect to the innocence or with respect to the guilt of this particular defendant?\u201d None of the jurors responded to either of the questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">In response to the defendant\u2019s objection to his refusal to tie the first question directly to any knowledge from \u201cpapers or any other media,\u201d the judge explained that, in his view, to do so would only focus attention upon the articles. Defense counsel argued that her formulation of the question presented a fair way to begin delving into the issue. The judge stood by his ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">A jury was empanelled and sworn, and the indictment read to them. The prosecutor made her opening statement, setting the scene of the cocaine sale at 23 Mall Street, Lynn. She described that area as a \u201chot spot, so to speak.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">On the next day, just as trial was to resume, the jury forelady asked to speak with the judge. She told the judge that when she \u201cheard more closely the defendant\u2019s name Lugene Kendrick,\u201d she remembered having read the name in an article about the \u201cworst family in Lynn.\u201d In response to the judge\u2019s questions, the forelady stated that she had said nothing to the other jurors and that the matter had not come up among them. Because she believed that the article would interfere with her duty to decide the case solely on the basis of the evidence presented, the judge excused her from the jury. The defendant requested a mistrial, and the judge denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>3. <em>Discussion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">It is the defendant\u2019s burden to establish that he was denied a fair trial by reason of pretrial publicity. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nolin, </em>373 Mass. 45, 49 (1977), and cases therein cited. We see no need to discuss the established principles of law concerning such publicity. See generally <em>Irvin </em>v. <em>Dowd, </em>366 U.S. 717, 722-723 (1961); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Estremera, </em>383 Mass. 382, 391 (1981); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sielicki, </em>391 Mass. 377, 379-381 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>391 Mass. 749, 755-757 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burden, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 666, 671-672 (1983). Nor do we think it necessary to analyze whether the articles were adverse, damaging, or otherwise prejudicial to the defendant. The timing (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Geagan, </em>339 Mass. 487, 501 [1959]; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>360 Mass. 695, 696-697 [1971]; <em>Delle Chiaie </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 367 </em>Mass. 527, 532 [1975]; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sielecki, </em>391 Mass. at 379-380) and the content <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Balakin, </em>356 Mass. 547, 554 [1969]; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cameron, </em>385 Mass. 660, 668 [1982]; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sielecki, </em>391 Mass. at 379) of the articles provided an ample basis to alert the judge that there was a substantial risk that the case might be decided on extraneous grounds.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crehan, </em>345 Mass. 609, 612-613 (1963). Further, the defendant did all that could be expected and required of him to raise the issue, to ameliorate the potential harm, and to save his rights. See <em>ibid.; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burden, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. at 671-672. See also Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7\u00a7 2359, 2360, 2363, 2364, 2367, &amp; 2368 (2d ed. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Even if in viewing each of the judge\u2019s rulings in isolation it cannot be concluded that he abused his discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a change of venue (see <em>Common</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number><em>wealth </em>v. <em>Bianco, </em>388 Mass. 358, 367-368 [1983]; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burden, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. at 672), or in refusing to question the jurors more directly and specifically about the publicity (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carita, </em>356 Mass. 132, 143 [1969]; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>376 Mass. 790, 798 [1978]), or in refusing to make inquiry of the jurors under G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 28, second par., either prior to their being sworn or after his conversation with the forelady (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gilday, </em>367 Mass. 474, 491-492 [1975]; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>376 Mass. at 800 &amp; n.5), it was error to deny all the defendant\u2019s motions. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 103, 112-116 (1980); <em>S.C. </em>382 Mass. 387 (1981); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hennessey, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 160, 165-167 (1983), where there was no showing of any substantial risk that extraneous issues would influence the jury. Some form of action was required here to assure that the defendant\u2019s guilt or lack of it would be determined by a fair trial. As none was taken, the conviction cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">\n<em>Verdict set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b76-8\"> The Boston Herald published this same story on June 17 under the caption \u201c \u2018Man bites police\u2019 and pit bull stays out of it.\u201d Although the article carried the defendant\u2019s name and address, the story devoted most of its space to the \u201cvicious\u201d nature of pit bulldogs, the problem with pit bulls in Lynn, and the mauling of the mailman.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b76-9\"> This article also appeared in the Newburyport Daily News on June 18.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b79-8\"> We suggest no impropriety in these statements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b80-7\"> As the confidential juror questionnaires have been destroyed (see G.
