L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B. The victim, four and a half years old when the alleged offense occurred on May 27, 1987, was the only percipient witness. On August 4, 1987, when the victim was four years and nine months old, a District Court judge conducted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>a competency hearing. He asked the child numerous questions about her age, family members, friends, nursery school, and play and other activities, virtually all of which she answered with understanding and awareness. She was then asked a series of questions about the difference between truth and falsity and her obligation to tell the truth. Some of her answers indicated an ability to distinguish between truth and falsehoods; others indicated some confusion. Excerpts from the competency hearing relevant to the duty of truth-telling are reproduced in the appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">On September 10, 1987, the judge found the child incompetent to testify on the basis of several findings, the most significant one of which was that she did \u201cnot have an appreciation and a consciousness of the duty to tell the truth nor ... a sense of the repercussions ... of telling a lie.\u201d On October 26, 1987, the judge denied a request made by the Commonwealth on October 7, 1987, for reconsideration of the competency ruling. The request, supported by the report of an expert, asked the judge to consider testimony from the expert and review the transcript of the competency hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Commonwealth then requested a continuance for six months, a period during which, according to the prosecutor, the witness might become competent. The defendant objected, however, and the judge continued the case for trial only to November 5, 1987. On that date, the Commonwealth reported that, due to the adjudication of the victim as incompetent, the Commonwealth would not be prepared to try the case. Without amplification, the judge \u201callowed\u201d a motion filed by the defendant seeking dismissal \u201cwith prejudice for want of prosecution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">On appeal taken pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 28E, the Commonwealth contends that the judge erred, first, in finding the child victim incompetent to testify and, second, in dismissing the case with prejudice if the witness was properly found incompetent. A judge\u2019s conclusion that a criminal case should be dismissed with prejudice, thereby barring a subsequent trial on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>same charges, is subject to appellate review. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brusgulis, </em>398 Mass. 325, 332 (1986). We do not view this case as one of those rare ones in which we would overturn a judge\u2019s ruling on the competency of a child witness after a hearing in the course of which the judge has had the opportunity to observe at firsthand the child\u2019s demeanor. We do agree with the Commonwealth, however, that the dismissal should not have been with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">1. <em>The finding of incompetency.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">According to G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20, as appearing in St. 1983, c. 145, any person of \u201csufficient understanding\u201d is qualified to testify as a witness.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judge indicated his familiarity with the applicable two-pronged test for determining whether a particular child of tender years has the requisite understanding to qualify as a witness. Competency, according to that test, depends upon \u201c(1) whether the witness has the general ability or capacity to \u2018observe, remember, and give expression to that which she ha[s] seen, heard, or experienced\u2019; and (2) whether she has \u2018understanding sufficient to comprehend the difference between truth and falsehood, the wickedness of the latter and the obligation and duty to tell the truth, and, in a general way, belief that failure to perform the obligation will result in punishment.\u2019\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brusgulis, </em>398 Mass. at 329, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tatisos, </em>238 Mass. 322, 325 (1921).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">Satisfying the first prong of the test presented no problem for this particular witness. The Commonwealth contends that the witness\u2019s answers to questions concerning her obligation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>to tell the truth satisfied the second prong as well. The judge reached a contrary result because, according to the Commonwealth, he used an incorrect legal standard in appraising the child\u2019s answers to his questions about the consequences of not telling the truth. It is true that, to qualify as a witness, a child need not be able to understand and explain such abstract concepts as punishment or the likelihood that punishment would follow the giving of false testimony. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tatisos, </em>238 Mass. at 325-326; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welcome, </em>348 Mass. 68, 70 (1964); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brusgulis, </em>398 Mass. at 330. The Commonwealth also correctly points out that \u201c[t]he tendency . . ., except in quite clear cases of incompetency, is to let the witness testify and have the triers make any proper discount for the quality of her \u2018understanding\u2019. . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whitehead, </em>379 Mass. 640, 656 (1980).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">We think there was a sufficient basis here under the correct legal standard for the judge to exercise his discretion to find, as he did, that the witness was not competent. In answer to several questions the witness indicated that she was aware of the difference between a truthful statement and a lie. At other times, however, she indicated some confusion. For example, at one point during the interrogation by the judge, when asked if she would get in trouble if she told a lie, she answered, \u201cNo.\u201d At another point the judge asked, \u201cIf you don\u2019t tell the truth what will happen to you?,\u201d and she answered, \u201cNothing. No one can\u2019t get punished for nothing.\u201d He then asked, \u201cSo nothing would happen to you if you don\u2019t tell the truth,\u201d and she answered, \u201cNo.\u201d These answers might indicate something <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>other than mere inability to explain abstract concepts or the meaning of punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">As the Commonwealth suggests, the witness may well have thought the questions to which she gave inappropriate answers related to the facts of the alleged assault and not to truth-telling generally. For example, when she stated that if she didn\u2019t tell the truth no one would be punished, she could have meant that if she didn\u2019t testify about what happened to her during the alleged incident, the defendant would not be convicted and punished. So construed, her answers could be viewed as consistent and generally indicative of an awareness of some obligation to be truthful. Perhaps, by suggesting questions for the judge to ask, the prosecutor could have cleared up any confusion in the child\u2019s understanding of the meaning of the questions. Although the judge asked the attorneys if they had any questions they wanted him to ask, the prosecutor suggested none. Instead, she responded that she would leave the matter to the judge\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">It may well be that, on the record before us, a judge reasonably could have found the witness competent. The answers are sufficiently inconsistent, however, to persuade us that we should defer to the conclusions reached by the judge who had the opportunity, which we lack, to observe the manner and appearance of the witness on the stand. Because of the importance of such observations, a judge\u2019s discretion in ruling on a child witness\u2019s competency is very broad and only rarely faulted on appeal. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tatisos, </em>238 Mass. at 326; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whitehead, </em>379 Mass. at 656; <em>Commonwealth v. Widrick, </em>392 Mass. 884, 888 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brusgulis, </em>398 Mass. at 330; <em>Commonwealth v. Reid, </em>400 Mass. 534, 542 (1987); <em>Commonwealth v. Jimenez, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 441, 443 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">2. <em>Dismissal with prejudice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">Given the youthful witness\u2019s intelligence and ability to articulate clearly, there was good reason to believe that, if not competent at the time of the competency hearing, she would become competent relatively soon. In these circumstances, a short continuance would have been in order during which she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>could have been instructed by some appropriate person on her obligation to tell the truth. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tatisos, </em>238 Mass. at 324, 326; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brusgulis, </em>398 Mass. at 330. The Commonwealth made no request that she be so instructed. Instead, the Commonwealth suggested a continuance of about six months to allow the witness to mature. On its face, that request was not unreasonable. The temporary incompetence of a crucial child witness is a compelling justification for a delay in a criminal case. Compare <em>People </em>v. <em>Price, </em>165 Cal. App.3d 536, 544 (1985); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 935, 935-936 (1983). Continuance of a criminal case by a District Court judge for a period of more than ten days over a defendant\u2019s objection, however, raises a question of a possible violation of G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 35.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If a defendant does not agree to have his case continued for more than ten days, a District Court judge may dismiss the case to avoid a violation of the statute. Consequently, the judge was warranted in dismissing the case. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ludwig, </em>370 Mass. 31, 33-34 &amp; n.1 (1976); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boyer, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 938, 939 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conant, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 287, 289-290 (1981) (acontinuance exceeding ten days does not entitle the defendant to dismissal as of right, but, in considering question of denial of right to speedy trial, must be weighed against the length of delay, reason for delay, and prejudice caused to the defendant). The Commonwealth may not claim the dismissal caused prejudice to it merely because it would have to seek a fresh complaint when ready to proceed anew with the prosecution. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>402 Mass. 576, 579 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">The judge went beyond a mere dismissal, however, and ordered the case dismissed with prejudice. Dismissal with prejudice, viewed as a \u201cdraconian action,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zannino, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 73, 77 (1983), is proper only in cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>involving double jeopardy, prosecutorial misconduct, and denial of speedy trial. See <em>id. </em>at 76 n.3 &amp; 77-81. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 1019, 1019 (1982). There is no basis here for a claim of double jeopardy or prosecutorial misconduct. The stated reason in the defendant\u2019s motion for the request for dismissal is \u201cwant of prosecution.\u201d In the absence of misconduct by the prosecutor or a showing that the defendant could not receive a fair trial, dismissal of a complaint on a basis such as want of prosecution should not be with prejudice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amaral, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 230, 231 (1983). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>402 Mass. at 579.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">On appeal, for the first time, the defendant contends that the judge implicitly allowed the motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds. Neither the defendant\u2019s motion, nor the judge\u2019s notation on it, however, mentioned speedy trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Less than four months having elapsed between the time the complaint was brought and the motion to dismiss allowed, and the defendant having shown no actual prejudice and no lack of diligence on the part of the prosecutor, there was no basis in rule, statute, or constitutional principle for a claim of violation of the defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pomerleau, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 530, 535-536 (1982). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Balliro, </em>385 Mass. 618, 621-623 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 784, 789 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Plantier, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 314, 317-318 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">The defendant\u2019s contention that the judge had the defendant\u2019s speedy trial rights in mind when he acted on the motion to dismiss relates to the defendant\u2019s concern about having the case hanging over his head for some undefined period while waiting for the witness to achieve maturity. The delay with which the speedy trial rules are concerned, however, relates to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>the period postcomplaint or postindictment, not precomplaint or preindictment. See <em>Unites States </em>v. <em>Lovasco, </em>431 U.S. 783, 788-789 (1977); <em>United States </em>v. <em>MacDonald, </em>456 U.S. 1, 7 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Gove, 366 Mass. 351, 358-361 (1974). Should new charges be brought against the defendant at some future time, he will have the opportunity to seek protection then against any undue delay under both the applicable statute of limitations and due process guarantees. The crime the defendant was charged with, indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen years, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B, has a six-year statute of limitations. General Laws c. 277, \u00a7 63, as amended through St. 1985, c. 123, provides that the limitations period begins to run when the victim turns sixteen or when the violation is reported to a law enforcement agency, whichever occurs first.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">Delay before charges are brought may require dismissal on due process grounds \u201cwhere the accused is able to carry the burden of showing that his defense was substantially prejudiced and that the \u2018delay has been intentionally undertaken to gain a tactical advantage over the accused or has been incurred in reckless disregard of known risks to the putative defendant\u2019s ability to mount a defense.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Imbruglia, </em>377 Mass. 682, 688, 691 (1979). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Marion, </em>404 U.S. 307, 324 (1971).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Best, </em>381 Mass. 472, 484 (1980). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 37, 42-43 (1982). Any anxiety an individual may experience about possible future criminal charges is usually considered too speculative to constitute actual prejudice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 750, 757 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conant, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 287, 291 (1981). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Balliro, </em>385 Mass. at 621, 623. Even a claim of a weakened memory due to the passage of time before a criminal charge is brought may not be enough to trigger due process protections. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Imbruglia, </em>377 Mass. at 690.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">Countenancing dismissals with prejudice in these circumstances would have the unfortunate tendency to encourage prosecutors to delay bringing charges in child abuse cases until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>such time as there is no longer a risk of having the child witness found incompetent. Persons accused of these crimes, as a result, would be disadvantaged in preparing their defenses. With that in mind, we do not think the Commonwealth in this case should be penalized for acting expeditiously in bringing the charges against the defendant. Should the Commonwealth renew the prosecution in a reasonably timely fashion, the defendant will at least have the advantage in preparing his defense of having received early notice of the charges against him. The question to be decided then will be whether, given the delay, he can still have a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the order dismissing the complaint but direct that the words \u201cwith prejudice\u201d be struck from the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">Excerpts from the competency hearing on August 4, 1987, \u00e1re set forth as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-9\">Q. \u201cDo you know what it means . . . when someone says you have to say the truth?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-10\">A. \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-11\">Q. \u201cDid your mother tell you you have to say the truth?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-12\">A. \u201cYes, you have to tell the truth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-13\">Q. \u201cWhen did your mother tell you that?

See Christiansen, The Testimony of Child Witnesses: Fact, Fantasy, and the Influence of Pretrial Interviews, 62 Wash. L. Rev. 705 (1987); Myers, The Testimonial Competence of Children, 25 J. Fam.

See, e.g., Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 13-90-106 (1987) (child sexual abuse victims under age ten deemed competent to testify); Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 54-86h (1987) (eliminates competency requirements for child sexual abuse victims); 33 Mo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 491.060(2) (1986) (eliminating competency requirements for child victims of various crimes); Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-5-410 (Supp. 1988) (eliminating competency requirements for sexual abuse victims under age ten). Given the trend in favor of enabling young children to testify, subject to impeachment of their credibility, it is not surprising that no support has been found for the defendant\u2019s suggestion that the reasonable doubt standard applies to the finding of competency.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b804-6\"> General Laws c. 276, \u00a7 35, provides in relevant part that in criminal proceedings, other than those dealing with desertion, non-support, and illegitimacy, \u201cthe court or justice may adjourn an examination or trial from time to time, not exceeding ten days at any one time against the objection of the defendant</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b805-7\"> Other than by marking \u201callowed\u201d on the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss with prejudice, there is no indication that the judge intended that the dismissal preclude further prosecution of the defendant on the same charges. At one point, during arguments by counsel on the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for a continuance following the finding of incompetency, the judge had said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t I just dismiss it and then you can do whatever you want from there. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
