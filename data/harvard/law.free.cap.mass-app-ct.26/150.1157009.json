Trial was to be joint. Just before jury impanelment, the trial judge accepted Haynes\u2019s <em>Alford </em>plea of guilty to the lesser crime of manslaughter. See <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 38 n.11 (1970). Trial proceeded in the defendant Marple\u2019s case, and at the end the judge left to the jury whether to convict of either of the degrees of murder or to acquit. (The defendant preferred not to leave to the jury any question of a manslaughter verdict.) The jury brought in a verdict of murder in the second degree, and from the judgment of conviction the defendant takes his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">We give a condensed account of the case, which will provide background for the defendant\u2019s points of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">Just before 7:05 p.m. on April 13, 1984, the body of John Blais was found sprawled on the steps leading upward from a landing between the second and third tiers of a rear stairway in the Bristol 1 cell block at Cedar Junction. A \u201ccode 99\u201d alarm sounded at 7:05 which ordered all inmates back to their cells and brought a paramedical team promptly to the scene. We have the observations of Timothy Gagnon, one of the team, and Dr. George Katsas, a forensic pathologist, who later performed an autopsy. In short, the victim had been severely beaten and strangled to death with a garrotte of some cloth fabric. There was considerable letting of blood; smears and traces appeared on the landing and on the upward steps and the adjacent walls.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">Correction Officer Samuel Wigfall, upon hearing the alarm, dashed to the rear stairwell of Bristol 1 and ran up the stairs, past Blais\u2019s body (the medics had not yet arrived), to the third-tier landing. He saw the defendant Marple entering his cell 60, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>near the stairwell. The defendant said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that guy? Is he all right?\u201d And, \u201cHey, I know that guy. Is he all right? Can I see him?\u201d At 7:55 Wigfall was assigned to shake down cell 60. Also at the alarm, Correction Officer Anthony Williams, from another direction, reached the front stairwell of Bristol 1 and ran up the stairs to the third tier. He saw Haynes washing himself in the shower room opposite the stairwell. Despite the alarm and an order by Williams to leave, Haynes remained there for some forty-five to sixty seconds. Williams escorted Haynes to his cell 58 nearby. Williams was assigned to shake down cell 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Combining the testimony of Wigfall, Williams, and Robert Sullivan, the latter a forensic chemist who started his work in Bristol 1 in the late evening of April 13, we have evidence that a number of items in cell 60 and also in cell 58 carried stains testing positive for human blood, grouping \u201cAB\u201d (a sample stain from the stairs was also AB). This is a rare blood grouping (four percent of the population) to which the victim belonged: both the defendant Marple and Haynes fell in the common \u201cO\u201d grouping. Thus, for cell 60, stains on a bedpost and a towel (wet when Wigfall found it) tested AB; other items carried human blood, the sink and toilet occult blood, which could not be grouped. For cell 58, a white pillowcase and blue shirt, taken from a large cardboard box beneath the bed, tested AB; there was occult blood, not grouped, on the window handle, sink, and toilet.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A trooper, Robert Murphy, arriving about 8:30 p.m. , April 13, to investigate the homicide, reconnoitered the ground adjacent to Bristol 1. To the rear of the building, below cell 60, he found a bed sheet, sneakers, and a part of a tom towel, all with blood (on Sullivan\u2019s examination) testing AB; and below cell 58, a sponge, a full towel, and the other part of the tom towel, all testing AB.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Robert Akers had begun to serve a sentence at Cedar Junction a few days before the homicide. Some three days after the event he came forward and spoke to the orientation teacher, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>Diane Watson, and subsequently to Lieutenant McCrosson and others. As a new inmate, he was housed in the \u201cday room\u201d (a recreational room) in Bristol 1. Having left the room on April 13 at a time not clearly fixed \u2014 he mentioned the time around 5:30 as well as a period shortly before 7:00 \u2014he was proceeding up the rear stairway intending to go to the cell of an inmate known to him only as \u201cCurt\u201d or \u201cCurtis\u201d to claim four packs of cigarettes for a dungaree jacket he had previously traded to \u201cCurt.\u201d From a position on the stairs below, he said he saw two men on the landing between the second and third tiers assaulting a thickly bearded man, the victim Blais. The larger of the two men, whom he identified as the defendant Marple, was holding Blais by the throat and beating him on the side of the head with a stick or pipe. The defendant was saying, \u201cWhere\u2019s the ludes\u201d [quaaludes]? As the victim was thrown to the ground, Akers turned and went down the stairs. Akers said he resolved to go to the authorities after being terrified by threats \u2014 that something might happen to him because of what he had seen on the stairs \u2014 uttered by an inmate (whom he later identified from photographs).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">It remains to mention the defendant\u2019s statement. Trooper Murphy, after inspecting the grounds, had a talk with the defendant (first telling him that blood had appeared in his cell and informing him of his Miranda rights). The defendant said he and Blais had been in cell 60 smoking joints. Haynes was also there. Blais asked the defendant whether he wanted to play chess. The defendant told Blais to get a \u201chot pot\u201d and cigarettes. Blais left, Haynes went to the cell of one Sarge Lee, and he, the defendant, went to the shower. Twenty minutes later (evidently near the time of the alarm) the defendant returned and saw Blais lying on the stairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">So much for the evidence when the Commonwealth rested. On his part, the defendant presented as witnesses four inmates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>testifying to the whereabouts of the defendant. Like the defendant, Haynes, and Blais, the witnesses Kurt Brown and Patrick O\u2019Shea were Bristol 1 \u201crunners,\u201d that is, inmates who did cleaning chores in the block outside their cells during the period when the general population were locked in for a \u201ccount.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We may take it that a count began about 5:30 p.m. on April 13, and ended about 6:30 p.m. Cleaning duties took about fifteen minutes, then Brown (who denied being the \u201cCurt\u201d who allegedly had a transaction with Akers) went to the day room with the defendant and O\u2019Shea. Brown and O\u2019Shea remained in that room through the alarm. The defendant, said Brown, left the room at some point, returned in ten to fifteen minutes, and left again five minutes or less before the alarm. According to O\u2019Shea, the defendant was in the day room \u201calmost the whole time\u201d; indeed, \u201cI don\u2019t recall him leaving.\u201d John MacNeill, locked in his Bristol 1 cell during the count, stayed on there for some minutes, then used the telephone, and entered the day room a few minutes before the alarm. He saw Brown, O\u2019Shea, and the defendant and presumed, though he could not be sure, that the defendant was still in the room at the alarm. Joseph Messere said he remained in his third-tier cell for fifteen minutes after the lockup for the count, encountered the body of Blais as he descended the rear stairway but went on without pause to the cell of David Williams, spoke with Williams, went to Darrell Hall\u2019s cell but missed him, went to the day room where he saw Hall and the defendant, then returned to Williams\u2019 cell, and shortly afterward was locked in at the alarm.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">It will be seen that the testimony of the inmates was at odds with the defendant\u2019s own statement or at best in questionable or indifferent consistency with it. On the whole case a jury could well find that the defendant, in complicity with Haynes, accomplished the death of Blais by beating him, starting probably in cell 60, then along the stairway and landing, and at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>some point choking him with the ligature.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Counsel does not quarrel with the verdict in its substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">1. Defense counsel moved in limine for advance rulings by the judge as to the putative use by the Commonwealth of prior convictions to impeach the inmate witnesses who would be called by the defense (counsel, however, did not indicate, when he made the motion, who specifically would be called). The judge declined to give advance rulings and indicated that he would rule as the individual witnesses were called and occasion arose. It is worth noting that this was not a question of using prior convictions to impeach a defendant testifying in his own behalf; it seems counsel had no design to call the defendant Marple. Even with regard to a defendant-witness, it has been held that a judge has a discretion whether to make an anticipatory decision or to abide the event, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>391 Mass. 691, 695 (1984), although the possible advantages of early assurance have been set forth, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>383 Mass. 73, 81 (1981), and situations where that procedure would be highly desirable can readily be pictured. In the case of an ordinary witness, the advantages will typically be less evident, if indeed present at all. Where the witness is an inmate of a prison and his status as such is bound to be known to the jury, the whole question whether to deal ahead of time with the use of convictions becomes little short of trivial. See <em>King, </em>391 Mass. at 695 n.2. Counsel\u2019s contention, that the defendant in such an instance suffers deprivation of a constitutional right when decision is postponed, appears quite untenable. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fano, </em>400 Mass. 296, 301 (1987).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the present case the defendant did not challenge the propriety of the prosecution\u2019s impeachment of the inmate witnesses by their criminal records <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>when this occurred in cross-examination and chose to decline to have the judge instruct the jury about the limited inferences that could be legitimately drawn from such impeachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">2. By a second threshold motion, counsel asked to be furnished by way of discovery with the statements of inmates concerning the homicide: the IPS (a police service acting within the prison) had interviewed the inmates and taken statements from those willing to give them.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Bristol 1 cell block had seventy-two single cells on the three tiers, to which must be added perhaps nine places for new inmates in the day room; we do not know how many statements were recorded. The Commonwealth objected to wholesale discovery on the ground that there might be unnecessary disclosure of material that could create tension in the institution. Denying the broad discovery, the judge, after himself examining the statements in camera, assured counsel that these had the inmates denying knowledge of the incident and saying nothing of an exculpatory nature. Counsel, however, said the statements might have a content that could be used by the Commonwealth to impeach inmates who might be offered by the defense as witnesses. No particular inmates were named.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">After Kurt Brown testified on direct examination for the defense, the Commonwealth referred to a statement given by Brown that apparently was inconsistent with his account of remaining in the day room.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Counsel pointed to the discrepancy as showing that the judge had committed error in denying the threshold motion and leaving the defense in ignorance of Brown\u2019s statement. The prosecutor told the judge he in fact had supplied counsel with Brown\u2019s statement when Brown was called; counsel said he received the statement only after the cross-examination. This difference was not resolved. The weakness in counsel\u2019s position, however, is that, when he decided to call Brown, he failed to make a specific request for any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>statement by Brown held by the Commonwealth. That the judge would have been amenable to a specific request is shown by his direction to the prosecutor to furnish any statements of the other inmates to be called (Messere had given a statement).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">At all events, there is little to suggest that the contretemps about Brown was material error if it was error at all. The defense called Messere although his statement was disclosed and he was impeached by it; probably the defense would have been similarly uninhibited in the case of Brown. Brown in fact when confronted with his statement (see n.7) denied he had said what it recorded and asserted the statement was false.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">3. The defense offered two inmates in Bristol 1, Albert J. Blake and Anthony P. Puckett, who were to follow Messere on the witness stand and testify about alleged statements by Haynes incriminating himself and exonerating the defendant. As the statements were hearsay, they were inadmissible unless the defense could qualify them affirmatively as declarations \u201cagainst penal interest\u201d within Rule 804(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Evidence,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> adopted in substance as the law of the Commonwealth. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carr, 373 </em>Mass. 617, 623-624 (1977). The judge duly conducted a voir dire, with the two witnesses being taken in direct and cross-examination. Blake would testify that in June, 1985, when he, Haynes, and Marple resided in cell block 10, he encountered Haynes in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>exercise yard. He asked Haynes, whom he knew back in 1979 or 1980, how things looked. Haynes said things didn\u2019t look good, the only thing he could look forward to was a manslaughter reduction; he felt bad for Marple, Marple had nothing to do with it. Blake did not tell Marple of his conversation with Haynes at the time. He, Puckett, and Marple were now in cell block 9, and he told Marple three weeks before the date of his present testimony at voir dire. Puckett, who had known Haynes, would testify that in the second or third week of September, 1985, he, Haynes, and Marple resided in block 9. He met Haynes in the exercise yard. He inquired about the case and what Marple had to do with it. Haynes said it was a personal \u201cbeef\u201d between John Blais and himself, Marple had nothing to do with it, he just got caught in the middle. Puckett did not inform Marple about the conversation until three weeks before the date of the voir dire when Haynes, said Puckett, pleaded to manslaughter. Until then, he said, to tell about the conversation would have been to \u201crat\u201d on Haynes.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The judge discussed the law and held that the defense had not brought the Blake or Puckett hearsay testimony within the exception. The judge was right. The prosecution does not dispute that Haynes could be regarded as \u201cunavailable.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However, it is at least doubtful whether Haynes\u2019s statement (to track the words of the rule) \u201cso far tended to subject [him] to . . . criminal liability . . . that a reasonable person in [his] position would not have made the statement unless believing it to be true\u201d; and it is rather plain that the defense failed to bring forward \u201ccorroborating circumstances\u201d which \u201cclearly indicate[d] the trustworthiness of the statement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">On the former point, since Haynes is reported as thinking that his case was lost and he could hope for no more than a sentence for manslaughter, he could lie about Marple\u2019s participation, which involved his admitting his own guilt, without doing himself any particular harm. But it is the knowing accept<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>anee by a declarant of likely harm to himself through making a statement that tends to make the statement worthy of belief. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>373 Mass. at 623.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">As to corroborating circumstances, a rundown of factors mentioned in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drew, </em>397 Mass. 65, 76 (1986), and other authority shows a distinct deficit. The character and reliability of the declarant were suspect.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The alleged statements were not contemporaneous with the homicide or the defendant\u2019s indictment; they came more than a year after the incident and were reported to the defendant nearly two years later.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The statements were not spontaneous but were elicited by questions.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> They were confided to friendly or sympathetic associates, not to any indifferent audience,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and, although there was repetition, the two hearers can be seen as belonging to the same coterie.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The statements themselves provided no detail toward exculpating the defendant, and the evidence in the case apart from the proposed hearsay indicated strongly that the blanket exonerating assertions were false:<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> in light of the evidence one could hardly credit that the defendant had \u201cnothing to do with it.\u201d The <em>Drew </em>case reminds us that corroboration must \u201cclearly indicate\u201d trustworthiness, but, where it is a close question whether the standard has been met, the statement should be admitted. 397 Mass. at 75 n.10. Here there was no close approach to satisfaction of the standard.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>4. The judge instructed the jury with regard to the defendant\u2019s responsibility not only as an individual offender, but also as a putative coventurer in a joint enterprise to commit murder. Although the defendant did not object at the time, on the appeal he seeks to claim error in the judge\u2019s omission to charge that an accessory must share with the principal the state of mind intrinsic to the crime. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>363 Mass. 299, 307-308 (1973). The judge, after speaking of other required elements, indicated quite plainly that the defendant, to be held guilty on a joint enterprise basis, must, if the charge be murder in the first degree, have himself premeditated with malice aforethought. (On a charge of second degree murder, the required mental state would of course differ.) Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dyer </em>389 Mass. 677, 683-684 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The defendant now complains, although he did not make the objection below, that the judge should have charged, also in connection with joint enterprise, that to be found guilty the defendant must have apprehended, if he did not himself possess the ligature, that the other person had it. This specific finding can be required where use of a given instrument is a necessary element of a particular crime, e.g., a weapon in armed robbery. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>388 Mass. 536, 544 (1983). Where the crime charged is simply murder, the requisite shared state of mind of the malice can be proved in any suitable way, not limited to proof of knowledge of a particular weapon. Thus, the jury here, from all the circumstances, could infer the defendant\u2019s malice, without reference to a ligature, from, among other things, the defendant\u2019s participation in the severe beating of the victim Blais. Compare, on significantly different facts, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hennessey, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 160, 165 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The defendant objected that the effect of the judge\u2019s charge was to urge upon the jury that they find a culpable joint enterprise. On the contrary, the judge repeatedly stated that fact-finding was for the jury and on the facts he, as judge, stood indifferent. At counsel\u2019s request he said, in an additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>charge, that this applied to the question whether there was a joint enterprise.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">5. As noted, the defendant chose not to put to the jury the possibility of a manslaughter verdict. He complained that the instructions nevertheless dealt at length with manslaughter. The jury would understand that what was said on that subject was intended to provide a contrast with, and setting for, the discussion of murder, which was the question for their verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">6. Commencing his instructions, .the judge spoke of the history of the institution of the jury and then mentioned an essay by G. K. Chesterton describing the author\u2019s experience as a juror. Chesterton wrote that as the jury received the case and entered the jury room \u201cit seemed as if the Holy Ghost descended upon us.\u201d The defendant objected and invokes the separation of church and state but we think the jury would take the remark as a literary flourish and nothing more.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b178-7\"> The record at one point suggests that the occult blood in both cells did test AB, but this may be passed over.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b179-7\"> Akers\u2019 testimony was attacked on cross-examination.

See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drew, </em>397 Mass. at 76 n.11. Still, we may speculate on how the jury would size up credibility if the witnesses had in fact testified. The jury would likely have thought the testimony to be a fabrication. A telltale point is that Puckett would say he told the defendant about the conversation with Haynes when, three weeks before the date of the voir dire, he learned Haynes had pleaded. Blake also mentioned three weeks. In fact Haynes had not pleaded until a week before voir dire. This would bespeak a collaborative invention based on faulty communication. The similarity of the stories of Puckett and Blake in other respects would also be suggestive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b187-8\"> A slip of the tongue in the additional charge, where the judge said of the fact-finding, \u201cThat\u2019s my function and please don\u2019t think it is,\u201d would surely be corrected by the hearer to supply the word \u201cnot.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
