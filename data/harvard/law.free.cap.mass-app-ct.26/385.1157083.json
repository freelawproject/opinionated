Robert Carvelli Trustee/ Title: Tmstee. The question put is whether, thus subscribed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>the purchase order imposed personal liability on Carvelli. There is a subsidiary issue involving the computation of interest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">1. Prior to January 1, 1978, which was the effective date of G. L. c. 203, \u00a7 14A, inserted by St. 1976, c. 515, \u00a7 28, amended by St. 1977, c. 76, \u00a7 2, it was the rule that \u201cin the absence of a stipulation to the contrary a trustee is personally liable in an action on a contract made by him for the benefit of the trust estate.\u201d <em>Dolben </em>v. <em>Gleason, </em>292 Mass. 511, 513 (1935). <em>See Hull </em>v. <em>Tong, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 710, 712 (1982). With a bow to <em>Dolben </em>v. <em>Gleason, supra, </em>a Superior Court judge allowed a motion for summary judgment against Carvelli and Michael P. Ellis. The latter, as far as appears of record, did not sign the purchase order, but was a cotrustee of Bel-High Realty Trust. Ellis and Carvelli were involved in renovating an apartment building at 206 Highland Avenue, Somerville.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">By April 10, 1980, the date on which Carvelli signed the purchase order, G. L. c. 203, \u00a7 14A, had come into effect and had clipped the wings of <em>Dolben </em>v. <em>Gleason. </em>Contrast <em>Hull </em>v. <em>Tong, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. at 712 n.4; <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>D\u2019Arnolfo, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 413, 424 n.14 (1983); <em>Seronick </em>v. <em>Levy, ante </em>367, 370 n.3 (1988). The portion of \u00a7 14A on which the defendants (Carvelli and Ellis) especially rely is its first paragraph which says: \u201cUnless otherwise provided in the contract, a trustee shall not be personally liable on contracts properly entered into in his fiduciary capacity in the course of administration of the trust estate unless he failed to reveal his representative capacity and identify the trust estate in the contract.\u201d The sweep of the first paragraph of the statute is, however, cast in doubt by the immediately following paragraph which reads: \u201cA trustee shall be personally liable for obligations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>arising from ownership or control of property of the trust estate \u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">The burden is on the defendants, as appellants, to demonstrate error. In support of its motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff furnished to the motion judge an affidavit of its vice president that the defendants, individually as well as in their capacity as trustees, had contracted for work on the defendants\u2019 building. The plaintiff also furnished a deposition of Carvelli indicating ownership and control by him of the building project to which the plaintiff furnished labor and materials. Although the materials which the plaintiff furnished in support of its motion for summary judgment are less informative than one might wish, they provided an acceptable basis for the judge to conclude that Carvelli and Ellis owned and controlled the property of the trust estate, viz., the premises in Somerville, thus putting in play the limiting factor set out in the second paragraph of \u00a7 14A. For their part, the defendants filed nothing \u2014 and the record contains nothing \u2014 setting forth facts which unsettled that conclusion. Consequently there was no genuine issue as to the material fact of the relation of the defendants,</p>\n<p id=\"AYz\">as individuals, to the business enterprise. <em>See Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. </em>v. <em>Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 585-587 (1986); <em>Norwood </em>v. <em>Adams-Russell Co., </em>401 Mass. 677, 683 (1988). See also and compare <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 </em>U.S. 242, 247-251 (1986); <em>Celotex Corp. </em>v. <em>Catrett, 477 </em>U.S. 317, 322-326 (1986); <em>King </em>v. <em>Globe Newspaper Co., </em>400 Mass. 705, 719 (1987), cert, denied, 485 U.S. 940 &amp; 962 (1988); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Taibbi, </em>400 Mass. 786, 805 n.3 (1987) (Abrams, J., concurring); <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>400 Mass. 826, 832-833 (1987); <em>Kaitz </em>v. <em>Foreign Motors, Inc., </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 198, 200 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>When there is a parallel identity of trusteeship and ownership in connection with the holding of title to real estate by trustees, it may be inferred that the trust vehicle is a \u201cnominee trust,\u201d a common device for holding title to real estate in Massachusetts and one which affords certain tax advantages. See <em>Penta </em>v. <em>Concord Auto Auction, Inc., </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 635, 639 (1987). Bimbaum &amp; Monahan, The Nominee Trust in Massachusetts Real Estate Practice, 60 Mass. L. Q. 364, 364, 366-368 (1976). In that form of organization, trustees are frequently seen as agents for the principals\u2019 convenience rather than as trustees in the more familiar fiduciary sense. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Milton, </em>215 Mass. 1, 6 (1913). Bimbaum &amp; Monahan, loc. cit. at 367-368.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">From the language of the second paragraph of \u00a7 14A, its legislative history, and its context, it appears that the insulation with which the statute covers a trustee applies to a trustee acting under a trust of the donative type associated with probate practice, rather than a trustee of an organization conducting a business which the trustee as an individual controls. Statute 1976, c. 515, \u00a7 28, by which G. L. c. 203, \u00a7 14A, was inserted, was entitled, \u201cAn Act making certain changes in the probate laws of the commonwealth.\u201d That act made a variety of changes relating to wills, estates, estate taxes, guardians, conservators, executors, administrators, and trustees. A later act, St. 1977, c. 76, \u00a7 2, altering the date on which \u00a7 14A was to become effective, bore the title: \u201cAn Act making corrective changes in the law relative to the effective dates of certain changes in the tax and probate laws.\u201d The title to a statute may be considered in its construction. <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>363 Mass. 339, 352-353 (1973). <em>Trustees of Boston Univ. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Brookline, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 325, 329 n.6 (1981). We may conclude from the probate and tax contexts that the scope of \u00a7 14A does not encompass the case of trustees who are trustees for themselves in the conduct of business affairs or are trastees of a nominee trust.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>We are handicapped \u2014 and so far as appears from the record appendix, so was the motion judge \u2014 by not having been furnished with the instrument establishing the trust, but that is a deficiency which cuts against the defendants. As we have observed, once the moving party\u2019s materials in support of summary judgment developed a picture disclosing no genuine issue of material fact, it became the task of the defendants, here the nonmoving parties, to contradict the picture so formed. See <em>Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. </em>v. <em>Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. at 585-587, and related cases cited <em>supra. </em>The allowance of the motion for summary judgment as to liability is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">2. Although the fire which destroyed the defendants\u2019 premises excused both parties from performance of the contract, the supplier of services and materials was entitled to be compensated at the contract rate, including the interest on past due accounts established by the contract. See <em>Cleary </em>v. <em>Sohier, </em>120 Mass. 210, 211 (1876); <em>Butterfield </em>v. <em>Byron, </em>153 Mass. 517, 521 (1891); <em>Perkins Sch. for the Blind </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Commn., </em>383 Mass. 825, 834-837 (1981). Although it is less than obvious from the record that the interest rate set forth in the plaintiff\u2019s invoices effected a contract rate, the defendants did not dispute either in the Superior Court or on appeal that eighteen percent per year was the contract rate. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 354 comment c (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b412-7\"> We are not detained by an argument of the plaintiff that the appeal should be dismissed because the notice of appeal was filed before disposition of certain postjudgment motions. The notice of appeal was filed before January 1,1985, the effective date of an amendment to the second paragraph of Mass.R.A.P. 4(a), as amended through 395 Mass. 1110 (1985). The appellant has the benefit of the rule prior to the 1984 amendment. <em>Anthony </em>v. <em>Anthony, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 299, 302-303 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b413-8\"> The entire second paragraph reads as follows: \u201cA trustee shall be personally liable for obligations arising from ownership or control of property of the trust estate or for torts committed in the course of administration of the trust estate only if he was personally at fault.\u201d We read the \u201cat fault\u201d clause, coming after a disjunctive \u201cor,\u201d as not modifying the first clause relating to \u201cobligations,\u201d especially as the words \u201cat fault\u201d are not ordinarily associated with the word \u201cobligations,\u201d while the idea of \u201cat fault\u201d is linked to torts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b414-6\"> If the Legislature had a broader purpose in enacting St. 1976, c. 515, \u00a7 28, it is, of course, open to it to amend G. L. c. 203, \u00a7 14A.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
