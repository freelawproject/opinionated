X. Stokes began serving a State prison sentence in 1979. Between that time and August 13, 1982, when he filed the complaint in this case against the Commissioner of Correction and the Superintendent of M.C.I., Cedar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>Junction, he accumulated a large number of disciplinary reports, many resulting in the imposition of sanctions against him. In his complaint, Stokes alleges that, with respect to sixty-eight disciplinary reports, the defendants acted in violation of prison regulations governing discipline, 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 430.17 (1978), and in violation of his right to due process under the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Stokes filed a motion for partial summary judgment. All of the disciplinary reports in issue were before the court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After hearing, Stokes\u2019s motion was denied, and summary judgment was ordered for the defendants on the entire complaint. The defendants did not comply with due process requirements or the Department of Correction\u2019s own regulations in a relatively small number of the disciplinary reports. As to these cases material issues of fact remain for trial. The matter must be remanded to the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Regulations of the Department of Correction (department), adopted pursuant to G. L. c. 124, \u00a7 1(g), provide, as far as material here, that a record of disciplinary proceedings shall include a written decision containing \u201c[a] description of the evidence relied upon [by the disciplinary board] in reaching the guilty finding [and a] statement of the reasons for the sanctions imposed\u201d (\u00a7 430.17[1]) and, further, that \u201c[t]he evidence relied upon for the guilty findings and the reasons for the sanction shall be set out in specific terms unless the hearing has involved use of informant information\u201d (\u00a7 430.17 [2]). In each instance referred to in the complaint, a correction officer signed a disciplinary report describing an offense, a hearing was held before a prison disciplinary board, and a decision was reached and recorded on a standard one-page department form. On each such form, there was space for the board to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>insert \u201ca summary of the credible evidence,\u201d the \u201cfinding,\u201d the \u201csanction\u201d imposed, and the \u201creasons for sanction and recommendation. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">With respect to one category of cases (the first category), comprised of twenty-three disciplinary reports, the records of the disciplinary board\u2019s decisions did not bear any clear indication of the board\u2019s acceptance of the credibility of the officers\u2019 incident reports, nor did the board refer to other evidence supporting the charges.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These records fall short of what the department\u2019s regulations require. Compare <em>Wightman </em>v. <em>Superintendent, M.C.I., Walpole, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 442, 446-447 (1985). It is true that in all cases copies of the correction officers\u2019 incident reports were attached to the records of the decisions. While it may be implicit in the board\u2019s disposition, it is impossible to tell from the face of the decision in any particular instance whether the board believed all, some, or none the contents of the officer\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>The department\u2019s regulations have the force of law, and the defendants are required to comply with their terms. See <em>Royce </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>390 Mass. 425, 427 (1983); <em>Kenney </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>393 Mass. 28, 33 (1984). Moreover, the United States Supreme Court held in <em>Wolff </em>v. <em>McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 563-564 (1974), that an inmate facing State prison disciplinary proceedings, which could result in a deprivation of his or her liberty interests, has a right under the due process clause of the United States Constitution to be provided with a \u201cwritten statement of the factfinders as to the evidence relied upon and the reasons for the disciplinary action taken.\u201d As we assume also was true of the department\u2019s regulations, the minimum standards required by the <em>Wolff </em>case were designed to ensure fair administrative decision making and to enable a reviewing court or agency to determine whether a prison disciplinary board\u2019s finding was \u201cbased on substantial evidence or whether it was sufficiently arbitrary so as to be a denial of the inmate\u2019s due process rights.\u201d <em>Chavis </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>643 F.2d 1281, 1287 (7th Cir. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Applying <em>Wolff, </em>courts routinely have held that records of decisions in disciplinary cases that merely state conclusions about guilt or use rote phrases do not satisfy the requirement that a disciplinary board state the rationale and evidentiary basis of a decision. See, e.g., <em>Redding </em>v. <em>Fairman, </em>717 F.2d 1105, 1114-1115 (7th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1025 (1984); <em>Scarpa </em>v. <em>Ponte, </em>638 F. Supp. 1019, 1024-1026 (D. Mass. 1986). The <em>Wolff </em>requirements apply, even apart from the department\u2019s regulations, in at least the one case in the first category in which the disciplinary sanction imposed against Stokes included loss of statutory good time credits. As the loss of good time credits affected his liberty interests, he was entitled to the protection of the due process guarantees of the United States Constitution. See <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>390 Mass. 379, 389. (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">The prison board\u2019s disciplinary records in the remaining cases do not fall short of the minimum requirements of either the department\u2019s regulations or due process. Stokes claims as to these remaining cases that there is insufficient specificity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>in the written decision as to the evidence the board relied on.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In each instance, other than cases in the first category, however, the board refers in its decision to the officer\u2019s incident report, and a copy of the full report is appended to the decision. All of the officers\u2019 reports appear to be self-validating. Contrast <em>Wightman </em>v. <em>Superintendent, M.C.I., Walpole, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. at 447. Thus, although more explanation might have been preferable, in each such decision the board\u2019s rationale is revealed, and there is at least a basis for a reviewing court or agency administrator to understand how the prison board reached the decision. See <em>Jensen </em>v. <em>Satran, </em>688 F.2d 76, 78 (8th Cir. 1982); <em>Saenz </em>v. <em>Young, </em>811 F.2d 1172, 1174 (7th Cir. 1987); <em>Culbert </em>v. <em>Young, </em>834 F.2d 624, 631 (7th Cir. 1987). Contrast <em>Wightman </em>v. <em>Superintendent, Walpole, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. at 446-447; <em>Redding </em>v. <em>Fairman, 717 </em>F.2d at 1114-1115.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">There is no merit in the complaints Stokes makes that in some cases the stated reason for the particular sanction imposed by the board is inadequate.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In those cases, the prison board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>stated reasons such as \u201cbehavior cannot be tolerated,\u201d \u201creport and testimony,\u201d or \u201cseriousness of offense, officer\u2019s report.\u201d In each such instance, it is implicit in the decision that the penalty was based on the board\u2019s view of the seriousness of the particular offense. So construed and viewed in its entirety, each record adequately justified the sanction. Thus, apart from the cases in the first category discussed, none of the defendant\u2019s disciplinary reports violated either the regulations or the requirements set out in <em>Wolff.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The contention that the defendants failed to satisfy the applicable requirements as to the first category of cases discussed does not necessarily entitle Stokes to relief. There remain issues of fact to be tried. First, Stokes contests disciplinary reports and sanctions that date back to 1979. He first filed his complaint on August 13, 1982. It may well be that the delay in some of the cases would have made it impossible, even when the complaint was filed, for the defendants to retry Stokes on the disciplinary charges. If, as to any of the particular disciplinary reports, the defendants are able to show substantial prejudice resulting from the delay, they are entitled to have the complaint dismissed, as to those particular disciplinary reports, on grounds of laches. <em>See Kenney v. Commissioner of Correction, </em>399 Mass. 137, 139-140 (1987).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Secondly, it should be determined at trial whether Stokes waived his right to relief by failing to exhaust his administrative remedies. Under 103 Code Mass. Reg. \u00a7 430.18 (1978), he had an administrative appeal so long as he exercised this right within five days of receiving the board\u2019s written decision. In any case in which Stokes either did not take an appeal or took an appeal and failed to raise the issue of the required specificity of the written decision, he waived the right to have a reviewing court consider that contention. See <em>Langlitz </em>v. <em>Board of Registration of Chiropractors, </em>396 Mass. 374, 382 (1985); <em>MediCab of Mass. Bay, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Commn., </em>401 Mass. 357, 364 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>Whether or not Stokes is found ultimately to be entitled to relief on any of his claims, it should be clear to the defendants that the department has a serious problem of poor record-keeping of its decision making in disciplinary matters. Various appellate decisions have referred in the past, as we do now, to these shortcomings. See, e.g., <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>390 Mass. at 396; <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Superintendent, M.C.I., Walpole, </em>392 Mass. 198, 201-202 (1984), revd. on other grounds, 472 U.S. 445 (1985). We are aware of the burdens on correction staff members and the fact that they are not likely to be trained as lawyers. The individuals charged with the important responsibility of enforcing prison discipline must, however, prepare written decisions which at least reflect, however briefly, the thinking processes that led the prison board to believe the inmate committed the charged offense and to determine that a particular sanction was appropriate. To require compliance with the applicable procedural rules will serve not only to make the process of imposing discipline on prison inmates more fair, but to assure the inmates and the public of the integrity of the process. Improvements in the recording forms could be of assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Summary judgment is affirmed as to all the disciplinary reports which are not in the first category. Summary judgment is vacated as to all the disciplinary reports in the first category. The case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion relating to the remaining disciplinary reports in the first category.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b612-6\"> The defendant was seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and damages. We treat this as an action in the nature of certiorari, pursuant to G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4. See <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Superintendent, Walpole, </em>392 Mass. 198, 199 nn.2 &amp; 3 (1984) rev\u2019d on other grounds, 472 U.S. 445 (1985); <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Superintendent, M.C.I., Cedar Junction, </em>396 Mass. 830, 833 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b612-9\"> Some of the reports as they appear in the record appendix are illegible. That fact does not affect our ability to decide the case on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b613-7\"> Stokes refers in his brief to this group of cases as \u201cCategory 1. \u201d Examples are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">(1) #80-2284: The correction officer\u2019s incident report stated, \u201cOn the above date at 12:40 pm I, Officer Kilnapp, while assisting in the locking-in procedures for B-2 returning from lunch, I was approached by Inmate Ronald Stokes #W37128 who said to me, \u2018Hey Kilnapp, as long as your mama is in my cell I\u2019ll stay in room 32! You know your mama don\u2019t you! She\u2019s that bitch who eats maggots!\u2019 This was witnessed C.O. Donnelly, C.O. Mazzalini and C.O. Huff. This is the second ticket of this nature and this inmates\u2019 verbal behavior is worsening each day. His verbal assaults are damaging to an officers\u2019 integrity, reputation and character.\u201d The disciplinary board decision states for the summary of credible evidence presented: \u201cPlea/Inmate became abusive toward the board He was asked to leave the hearing.\u201d Stokes was found guilty of the charge and sentenced to ten days\u2019 isolation time.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">(2) #81-1792: Stokes was accused of \u201cthreatening another person (Staff member)\u201d and \u201cUse of obscene threatening language to a staff member.\u201d The incident report states: \u201cAt approx 12:20 PM this date while I was pouring beverage for Inmate Stokes he did state T will get you and maybe before you leave the tier. I will kick your ass before you leave.\u2019 Stokes also accused C/O Ayala of using dirty cups for the beverage.\u201d The decision relates the \u201csummary of the credible evidence\u201d as follows: \u201cPlea/not guilty. Denies threatening anyone. States this is a figment of the officer\u2019s imagination.\u201d The board sentenced Stokes to five days\u2019 detention.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b615-8\"> Stokes refers in his brief to this group of cases as \u201cCategories 2 and 3.\u201d An example is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\"># 80-356: The correction officer\u2019s report stated, \u201cOn Monday 3/17/80 at approximately 10:15 AM while working in B-2, inmate Ronald Stokes said to me that I wanted him to sexually please me in order for me to make a telephone call for him. He said this to me because I 'wouldn\u2019t call the law library for him since I had already called for him once.\u201d The prison disciplinary board decision states as to the summary of credible evidence presented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-10\">\u201cInmate requesting all members disqualify themselves from the board.
