He appealed from a decision entered on the insurer\u2019s application for discontinuance, the decision finding him to be partially (rather than totally) incapacitated, with an earning capacity of $100 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">The employee\u2019s occupation had been as a truck driver and mover, and the injury occurred when a cart of books he was moving from a truck into the Suffolk University Law School library dislodged the ramp leading from the truck to the sidewalk, causing him to fall four feet or more, with the cart of books landing on top of him. He suffered a backstrain and a crushing injury to his right ankle, but there was no disc herniation, nor were there any broken bones. The physician engaged by the insurer could find no objective reason why the employee could not return to his former work as a truck driver and mover, although he conceded that there was a residual five percent loss of function in the ankle. The employee\u2019s physician credited the pain and stiffness complained of by the employee, but his ultimate opinion on the employee\u2019s working capacity went no further than attesting to his inability to return to his former work as a truck driver and mover. The employee acknowledged some range of normal activities, such as driving, housecleaning, helping his wife shop, all, however, in limited doses. He conceded that he had not sought lines of work less demanding than his earlier occupation. On this state of the evidence the single member and, after him, the reviewing board were not obliged to find the employee totally rather than partially disabled. Compare <em>McCann\u2019s Case, </em>286 Mass. 541 (1934); <em>Davis\u2019s Case, </em>304 Mass. 530, 534-535 (1939); <em>Cierri\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number><em>Case, </em>379 Mass. 914 (1979). Contrast <em>Frennier\u2019s Case, </em>318 Mass. 635, 639 (1945), where the employee\u2019s inability to use his hands without severe pain \u201cprevented] him from performing remunerative work of a substantial and not merely trifling character.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">The employee\u2019s principal contention is that the board erred in finding him to have a $ 100 per week earning capacity without identifying particular jobs which were within his limited ability to perform and which were in fact available. <em>Ballard\u2019s Case, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 1068 (1982), should not be read as so holding, at least in cases where, as here, a limited evidentiary record would not enable the board to make findings with respect to alternative lines of work. The burden of proving incapacity rests with the employee, see <em>Davis\u2019s Case, supra, </em>even where compensation has been awarded and the insurer is applying for discontinuance, see <em>Ginley\u2019s Case, </em>244 Mass. 346, 348 (1923). The absence of evidence with respect to specific job alternatives is not unusual. Neither the insurer, trying to prove that the employee is able to return to his usual line of work, nor the employee, trying to prove his total incapacity, is likely to proffer evidence that, if persuasive, would tend to compromise its or his position. Thus, once the board has determined that the employee has shown only partial incapacity, \u201cin the absence of testimony as to the earning capacity of the employee, the members of the board are entitled to use their own judgment and knowledge in determining that question.\u201d <em>O\u2019Reilly\u2019s Case, </em>265 Mass. 456, 458 (1929). <em>Percival's Case, </em>268 Mass. 50, 54 (1929). See also <em>Royal\u2019s Case, </em>286 Mass. 374, 377 (1934); <em>Nowack\u2019s Case, 2 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 498, 500 (1974). Because the burden of proving incapacity, whether total or partial, is on the employee <em>(Ballard\u2019s Case, </em>at 1068), the single member\u2019s finding that the employee has an earning capacity of $100 per week is tantamount to a statement that the evidence leaves the single member unpersuaded that the employee is precluded by his condition from doing any types of work at the lower end of the wage scale. Compare <em>Lovasco\u2019s Case, 4 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 854 (1976); <em>Trefrey\u2019s Case, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 773 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>Examination of appellate records indicates that <em>Ballard\u2019s Case </em>was in fact an instance of inadequate findings of fact by the board. The board\u2019s decision consisted primarily of recitations of testimony, and a critical ultimate finding of fact purported to be based on the board\u2019s adoption of both of two conflicting medical opinions. As the court pointed out, the board\u2019s decision lacked subsidiary findings \u201csufficiently specific to enable a reviewing court to determine whether the denial of the award of total disability was proper or \u2018whether the board applied correct principles of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ballard\u2019s Case, </em>at 1068, quoting from <em>Johnson\u2019s Case, </em>355 Mass. 782, 783 (1968). <em>Ballard\u2019s Case </em>falls within the principles represented by such cases as <em>Messersmith\u2019s Case, </em>340 Mass. 117, 120 (1959), and <em>Camaioni\u2019s Case, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 927 (1979), regarding the inadequacy of a mere recitation of testimony in place of proper fact-finding, and such cases as <em>Whitaker\u2019s Case, </em>354 Mass. 4, 5 (1968), and <em>Wajda\u2019s Case, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 865 (1978), regarding the defectiveness of an ultimate finding which conflicts with testimony specifically found credible or with uncontradicted testimony not discredited by the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">On the other point argued, we think that the single member\u2019s characterization of Dr. Grady\u2019s opinion on partial disability was a reasonable interpretation of his entire testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
