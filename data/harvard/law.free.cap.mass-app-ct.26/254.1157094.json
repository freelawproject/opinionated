The wife appeals from the denial of her motions for (1) a continuance of trial (Mass.R.Dom.Rel.P. 40[b] [1975]), (2) a new trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>(Mass.R.Dom.Rel.P. 59[a] [1975]), (3) recusal of the judge, and (4) relief from the judgments (Mass.R.Dom.Rel.P. 60[b] [1975]).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">1. <em>The motion to continue. </em>The husband\u2019s complaint was filed on February 25, 1985, and the wife\u2019s on April 18, 1985. The docket entries in the cases show unremarkable activity \u2014 temporary orders and discovery requests \u2014 until a pretrial notice and order was issued on April 11, 1986. To the apparently standard directions of that document there had been added: \u201cThe case may be ordered to immediate trial on the date of the pretrial if the court determines . . . that (a) the parties to the action will be the only witnesses; or (b) one party, through a failure to appear at the pretrial or otherwise, will not present a case; or (c) such commencement of trial is necessary in the judge\u2019s discretion to accomplish justice.\u201d See <em>Beninati </em>v. <em>Beninati, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 529, 530 (1984); <em>Griffith </em>v. <em>Griffith, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 943, 944 (1987).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">On June 13, 1986, new counsel appeared for the wife and filed a motion for a continuance of trial for sixty days in the event that the parties should be unable to reach settlement; the ground was the wife\u2019s illness. Attached to the motion was a detailed report of an evaluation of the wife on June 10, 1986, by her personal physician. The report gave a diagnosis of the following: eosinophilic fasciitis (a rare inflammatory disease which affects the membranes which hold bones and muscles together and which causes pain and fever), diabetes mellitus, chronic pulmonary disease, chronic liver dysfunction, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>peripheral neuropathy with painful manifestations and recent closure of tracheostomy. The report stated that the stabilization of these conditions had not been favorable and that the wife needed a \u201cmedical leave of absence\u201d from the divorce proceedings in order to undertake psychiatric and medical treatment. In a supplemental report, dated June 16, 1986, the doctor said that the wife was \u201ccurrently in the midst of a severe emotional and physical crisis, complicated by an extraordinarily complex disorder termed \u2018eosinophilic fasciitis,\u2019 and has as a consequence of this, innumerable physical problems as well as a severe situational psychological reaction. [The wife] is incapable, at this time, of pursuing the rigors of legal proceedings and is bordering upon hospitalization as a necessity to control her symptoms . . . .\u201d The doctor reported that in his opinion the wife\u2019s problems would be under control in sixty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The motion for continuance was presented to the judge at the call of the pretrial conference. The husband presented no opposing documentary evidence, and we do not have a transcript of argument made on the motion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judge denied the motion and presented the alternative of attempting to negotiate a settlement or of commencing an immediate contested trial; the parties proceeded to negotiate.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">We review the judge\u2019s denial of the motion for continuance to see whether there has been abuse of discretion. <em>Ackroyd\u2019s Case, </em>340 Mass. 214, 218 (1960), and cases cited. <em>Hunnewell </em>v. <em>Hunnewell, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 358, 363 (1983). \u201cContinuances <em>shall </em>be granted only for good cause ...\u201d (emphasis supplied). Mass.R.Dom.Rel.P. 40(b) (1975). \u201cThe legitimate illness of a litigant is generally \u2018good cause\u2019 for granting a continuance.\u201d <em>Monahan </em>v. <em>Washburn, </em>400 Mass. 126, 129 (1987). On ruling on a motion for continuance based on illness, the judge is, of course, entitled to look at what has gone before and to consider the quality of supporting documentation. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number><em>Hunnewell </em>v. <em>Hunnewell, supra </em>at 363-364. Here, according to the record we have before us: (1) there was no previous request for continuance (see <em>Ackroyd\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 220; <em>Monahan </em>v. <em>Washburn, supra </em>at 127-128); (2) the proceedings had not been protracted or particularly contentious (contrast <em>Hunnewell </em>v. <em>Hunnewell, supra </em>at 363; see also <em>Gaspar </em>v. <em>Kassm, </em>493 F.2d 964, 969 [3d Cir. 1974]); (3) the medical documentation of the wife\u2019s disabling condition was complete and convincing; (4) the husband offered no contrary documentation; (5) the record does not show that the husband would have been prejudiced by the continuance sought (see <em>Monahan </em>v. <em>Washburn, supra </em>at 128); and (6) the wife made a specific time request which was not unreasonable (contrast <em>Hunnewell </em>v. <em>Hunnewell, supra </em>at 363),. We cannot say that the wife\u2019s \u201ccourse of action ha[d] been unreasonable.\u201d <em>Monahan </em>v. <em>Washburn, supra </em>at 130 (Hennessey, C.J., concurring). We recognize the importance of the judge\u2019s opportunity to observe the wife in the courtroom. See <em>Hunnewell </em>v. <em>Hunnewell, supra </em>at 363. Here, however, the judge\u2019s exposure to the wife was brief<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and, indeed, he later recalled that he was sensitive to her condition at the time because she was using a portable oxygen tank. If the judge doubted the medical reports, he could have requested further documentation or testimony. He could reasonably have conditioned the grant of a continuance. See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Operation Amigo, Inc., </em>378 F.2d 101, 103 (10th Cir. 1967); <em>Latham </em>v. <em>Crofters, Inc., </em>492 F.2d 913, 915 (4th Cir. 1974). We are not assisted by any contemporaneous finding by the judge as to the reasons for his denial of the motion. Compare <em>Hunnewell </em>v. <em>Hunnewell, supra </em>at 363.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>cumstances, we unhesitatingly conclude that, on the information before the judge at the time of his ruling and as shown in the record before us, it was error, without more, to deny the wife\u2019s motion for continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">2. <em>The subsequent proceedings. </em>Faced with the prospect of an immediate contested trial which her physician unqualifiedly said she could not reasonably undergo, the wife proceeded to negotiations. The effort consumed the entire court day until the parties reported settlement shortly after 4:00 p.m.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> After hearing, judgments of divorce nisi were entered which incorporated the written settlement agreement. We hold that those portions of the divorce judgments which incorporate the separation agreement must be vacated and new proceedings held on the questions of property division, alimony, insurance, and other financial considerations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We do so because we think that the error in the denial of the motion to continue constituted an unfair administration of justice. The wife had a right to trial and, as we have held, she had shown \u201cgood cause\u201d for continuance of that trial. That right was effectively taken from her. The judge\u2019s later conclusory findings (in action on motions for a new trial and for relief from judgment) that the settlement agreement was fair and reasonable and that, based on his observations and those of a court officer, on the day of settlement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>negotiations the wife was \u201calert,\u201d \u201ccompetent,\u201d and \u201call right\u201d have, in what we hope are the unique circumstances of this case, no significance, and we need not deal with the propriety of those conclusions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Nowhere in the record is there any challenge to the wife\u2019s allegation that she could not then participate in a trial on the merits or to the medical evidence submitted to support that contention. Even if the judge was correct in his later determination that the settlement agreement is objectively fair and reasonable,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that result would not cure the practical deprivation of the fundamental right to a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>3. <em>The motion to recuse. </em>About two months prior to the pretrial proceedings the judge had been a panel member at a program entitled \u201cGoing to Trial \u2014 What if You Don\u2019t Settle.\u201d The wife was a member of the audience. Following the presentation there was a confrontation between the wife and the judge. An attorney who was also a panel member intervened and the judge left the building. On the date of the pretrial proceedings, the judge remembered the wife and the incident. The wife then made no motion to recuse the judge. Almost two months after entry of the judgments, the wife filed such a motion, alleging the judge\u2019s partiality because of their prior encounter and a statement made by him during the program that he looked unfavorably upon litigants who retained successive attorneys during divorce actions. (The wife was at pretrial represented by her fourth attorney.)</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">We need not rehearse the familiar standards by which a judge\u2019s obligation to disqualify himself are measured. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dane Entertainment Servs., Inc., </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 446, 448-449 (1984), and authorities cited. Suffice it to say that, at the time of the pretrial proceedings, the judge apparently satisfied himself that \u201che passed the internal test of freedom from disabling prejudice.\u201d <em>Lena </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>369 Mass. 571, 575 (1976). We also assume that the judge concluded that this was not \u201ca proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d S.J.C. Rule 3:09, Canon 3(C)(1)(a), as \u00e1ppearing in 382 Mass. 811 (1980). See <em>Lena </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra. </em>The wife\u2019s failure then to register an objection, \u201calthough possibly explicable as merely a tactical abstention by counsel,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>would tend to bolster that conclusion. Nevertheless, in view of the prior incident with the wife, the judge might well have disqualified himself on his own motion. On this record, we do not say that his failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>to do so was error. We think, however, in the circumstances, any further proceedings should be held before a different judge.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>Those parts of the judgments of divorce nisi which incorporate the settlement agreement of the parties are vacated. In all other respects the judgments are affirmed. The cases are remanded to the Probate Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b281-7\"> The pretrial notice and order was issued pursuant to Mass.R.Dom.Rel.P. 16 (1975). The purposes of a pretrial conference are to pare and hone the legal and factual issues for subsequent trial and to explore the possibilities of settlement. The last sentence of the standard Probate and Family Court notice and order used in this case announces that if the case is settled, the pretrial conference time assigned may be used for hearing on the merits on an <em>uncontested </em>basis. The added caveat that <em>contested </em>cases may be subject to immediate trial may in some respects, at least as to a first pretrial conference, be incongruous with the purposes underlying rule 16 and with those expressed in the standard notice and order. See <em>Slaughter </em>v. <em>McVey, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 768, 769-770 (1985); Freedman et al., Massachusetts Family Law Manual 8-1 to 8-7 (1986); Rotenberg, Domestic Relations: The Substantive Law 57-61 (1984 &amp; Supp. 1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b282-7\"> The husband makes a passing argument that the motion was procedurally deficient. The parties agree that the judge held a hearing on the motion and denied it. \u201cIn the absence of a . . . specific finding that [the judge treated] the motion [as] procedurally defective, we will not assume [that he did so].\u201d <em>Monahan </em>v. <em>Washburn, </em>400 Mass. 126, 130 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b283-5\"> The docket entries show no prior involvement with the case by the judge. He had, however, encountered the wife about two months earlier at a divorce seminar. That episode is described later in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b283-6\"> We pause briefly to comment on the possibility that the denial of the motion may have been motivated by the judge\u2019s desire to dispose of cases. Pressure in this respect may be felt acutely by judges in sessions to which cases are specially assigned. It cannot be gainsaid that there is need efficiently to dispatch litigation. <em>See Hunnewell </em>v. <em>Hunnewell, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. at 364; <em>Beninati </em>v. <em>Beninati, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. at 535. Cf. <em>Beit </em>v. <em>Probate &amp; Family Court Dept., </em>385 Mass. 854, 858-860 (1982). The effort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>to resolve cases finally must, however, be tempered by the need to convey a real and perceived sense of the fair administration of justice. <em>Monahan </em>v. <em>Washburn, </em>400 Mass. at 129. A delicate balance must be struck. A probate judge, perhaps uniquely, has both the opportunity and the burden to impart, within reasonable limits, sensitivity for the plight of those whose marital difficulties have led them to the court for the resolution of wrenching problems with untold ramifications. The patient and careful exercise of that function has effects which should be of concern to every probate judge. See <em>Slaughter </em>v. <em>McVey, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. at 769-770.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b284-11\"> In their briefs to this court counsel take liberties, the husband\u2019s counsel more egregiously, in making statements about particular events during the course of the negotiations which are not supported by the record. We do not, of course, consider those allegations. The parties agree, however, that the wife was assisted by oxygen from a portable tank throughout the day.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b284-12\"> The remaining portions of the judgments are affirmed. See <em>Yanolis </em>v. <em>Yanolis, </em>402 Mass. 470, 473-474 (1988). Cf. <em>Mailer </em>v. <em>Mailer, </em>387 Mass. 401, 405 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b285-5\"> The hearing on the merits of the actions for divorce (irretrievable breakdown under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 IB), and on the settlement was perfunctory. It is reported in a four-page transcript and began with a recital by the wife\u2019s counsel of the essential elements of provisions of the settlement respecting financial matters. We set out in full the colloquy of the judge and the parties with respect to the agreement.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-6\">The court: \u201cDo you understand the terms of the agreement?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-7\">Mrs. Botsaris: \u201cI don\u2019t know what I will do for Blue Cross, Blue Shield. I am a hundred percent nondeductible, with continuing illness because of . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-8\">The court: \u201cNo, no, ma\u2019am.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-9\">Mrs. Botsaris: \u201cThey changed that?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-10\">The court: \u201cDo you understand the terms of the agreement?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-11\">Mrs. Botsaris: \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-12\">The court: \u201cHave you gone over them with your counsel?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-13\">Mrs. Botsaris: \u201cUm hum.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-14\">The court: \u201cAnd you accept the terms?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-15\">Mrs. Botsaris: \u201cI have to.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-16\">The court: \u201cNo, you don\u2019t have to, ma\u2019 am. Do you accept them?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-17\">Mrs. Botsaris: \u201cYes, I do.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-18\">The court: \u201cAll right. Have you gone over them with your counsel:?\u201d Mrs. Botsaris: \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-19\">The court: \u201cAnd you accept them?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-20\">Mrs. Botsaris: \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-21\">The judge made no attempt to probe the wife\u2019s expressed concern and reluctance. Such an effort surely would not have taken long and might well have made this appeal and its consequences unnecessary. The judge then made no explicit finding that the agreement was fair and reasonable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b285-22\"> The record is insufficient to allow us to make an independent determination in this regard. We note, however, that the wife might well obtain less favorable results after new proceedings. We also observe that under the agreement and the judgments the provisions with respect to alimony, medical insurance and expenses, and life insurance (the only provisions about which the wife made specific objection at the hearing on the motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>for relief from judgment) are merged in the judgments and do not survive. Those provisions thus are subject to modification upon a showing of a material change in circumstances. See <em>DeCristofaro </em>v. <em>DeCristofaro, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 231, 235 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b287-7\"> In view of our disposition, it is unnecessary to consider the wife\u2019s appeal insofar as she claims error in the denial of her motion for a new trial and for relief from judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
