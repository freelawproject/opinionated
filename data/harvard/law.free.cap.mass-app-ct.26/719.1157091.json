L\u2018. c. 152, \u00a7 12(1), as appearing in St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 26, of an administrative judge of the Industrial Accident Board. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-16\">The background of the case is as follows. On March 9, 1977, the employee suffered an occurrence of contact dermatitis during his employment as a grinder by George W. Moore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>Inc. That company\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurance is provided by Employers Insurance of Wausau. In February, 1985, while employed as a grinder by another company, the employee suffered a more severe recurrence of the dermatological condition initially caused by his work at the Moore company. Wausau, which had been voluntarily paying the employee\u2019s medical bills until the employee began working for the second employer, stopped the payments in February, 1985, alleging that the subsequent employment had aggravated the employee\u2019s dermatological condition, thereby relieving it of any further liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">The employee filed a claim against Wausau and the second employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurer to determine which insurer was responsible under G. L. c. 152. After a conference pursuant to the former G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 7, as in effect prior to St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 18, a single member of the Industrial Accident Board entered orders which (a) directed Wausau to pay the employee temporary total incapacity benefits, and (b) determined that no payments were due from the insurer of the second employer. These orders were appealed by Wausau. A different single member heard evidence pursuant to former G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 8, as in effect prior to St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 21. On July 13, 1987, the single member, now called an administrative judge, see G. L. c. 23E, \u00a7 4, as appearing in St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 4, rendered a decision which ordered Wausau to pay temporary partial incapacity compensation, expert witness expenses, and attorney\u2019s fees to the employee\u2019s counsel. The administrative judge denied the claim against the insurer of the second employer. Both the employee and Wausau filed appeals to the reviewing board pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11C, as appearing in St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">On September 11, 1987, the employee filed a certified copy of the administrative judge\u2019s decision with the Superior Court pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12(1), requesting enforcement of the administrative judge\u2019s orders. A judge of the Superior Court entered the \u201cjudgment\u201d in issue ordering that \u201cthe complaint be dismissed. \u201d By the time the appeal was argued Wausau had complied with all the orders of the administrative judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>except the order directing the payment of attorney\u2019s fees to the employee\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">1. The action of the Superior Court judge refusing enforcement of the administrative judge\u2019s decision and orders was immediately appealable. <em>Biagini\u2019s Case, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 103, 104 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">2. Section 12(1) of the current G. L. c. 152 provides that the Superior Court, when presented with a decision of an administrative judge or of the reviewing board \u201cshall enforce the order or decision, notwithstanding whether the matters at issue have been appealed and a decision on the merits of the appeal is pending.\u201d As has been noted by a commentator on G. L. c. 152: \u201c[t]he language of subsection (1) [of \u00a7 12] is stronger than that of prior Section 11\u201d of c. 152 (as in effect prior to St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 25), which spoke of the Superior Court\u2019s enforcement duty in terms of the duty to \u201crender a decree in accordance\u201d with the board\u2019s or member\u2019s decision. Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 7.21 (1987 Supp. to 2d ed.). Even under the language of the prior \u00a711, enforcement of a single member\u2019s decision after an evidentiary hearing pursuant to the prior \u00a7 8, was considered to be mandatory, <em>Biagini\u2019s Case, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. at 104, and cases cited, in order to \u201cmaintain a status in favor of the employee, pending the final resolution of the proceedings before the board.\u201d Ibid., quoting from <em>Assuncao\u2019s Case, </em>372 Mass. 6, 10 (1977). The orders of the administrative judge in this case, including the order for payment of attorney\u2019s fees, should have been enforced, leaving Wausau to pursue its appeal to the reviewing board on the employee\u2019s entitlement to compensation and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">3. Our conclusion that the orders should have been enforced decides the appeal. We choose, however, to pass on Wausau\u2019s argument that the employee is not, as matter of law, entitled to attorney\u2019s fees because the issue has been argued and appears to be occurring with some frequency before the reviewing board. See <em>Wellesley College </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>313 Mass. 722, 731 (1943); <em>Blood </em>v. <em>Lea, </em>403 Mass. 430, 435 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>Wausau points out that the former \u00a7 12A of G. L. c. 152, which provided for payment of attorney\u2019s fees to an employee\u2019s counsel in connection with a successful \u00a7 8 proceeding was effective until November 1, 1986, when the section was repealed by St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 27. In the new \u00a7 13A(3) of c. 152, as appearing in St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 28A, provision is again made for attorney\u2019s fees in a successful hearing. By means of St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 65, however, \u00a7 13A was expressly deemed substantive for the purposes of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 2A,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and was therefore only applicable to injuries occurring on and after November 1, 1986. Relying on <em>Rival\u2019s Case, </em>383 Mass. 172, 176 (1981), which states that the decision to award attorney\u2019s fees in a proceeding under G. L. c. 152 is solely a legislative one, Wausau concludes that there was no statutory authority for the award of attorney\u2019s fees here because, on the date of the administrative judge\u2019s decision (July 13, 1987), the old \u00a7 12A had been repealed and the new \u00a7 13A(3), while in effect, was not applicable to any claim which arose prior to November 1, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">The situation described by Wausau is a classic example of an oversight occurring in the course of a large legislative enterprise, in this case the Legislature\u2019s overhaul of G. L. c. 152 in 1985. Obviously, the Legislature did not intend to deprive employees of the long established benefit of attorney\u2019s fees in the case of a successful result after an insurer\u2019s appeal of a conference order. In fact, the imperfection was brought to the Legislature\u2019s attention, and cured, by St. 1987, c. 691, \u00a7 8. That statute struck out \u00a7 13 A and inserted a new \u00a7 13 A in its place. Subsection (7) of the new \u00a7 13A provides that a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee shall be paid to an employee who prevails in the insurer\u2019s appeal of a conference order. This curative legislation was expressly made applicable to \u201can order . . . with respect to an injury occurring prior to November first, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>nineteen hundred and eighty-six\u201d and, by St. 1987, c. 691, \u00a7 18, the curative legislation was deemed to be procedural in nature. The legislation, therefore, was fully retroactive, in accordance with the \u201cotherwise expressly provided\u201d language of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 2A. See note 1, <em>supra. </em>The Legislature\u2019s action falls within that body\u2019s power to correct an unintended defect in legislation by means of a curative act which does not invade any substantive interest. See Sutherland, Statutory Construction \u00a7 41.11 (1986 revision of 4th ed.). Cf. <em>Canton </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>361 Mass. 598, 606-609 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">The judgment is vacated. The case is remanded to the Superior Court for the entry of a judgment enforcing all of the orders of the administrative judge in her decision of July 13, 1987, pending any further proceedings before the board. The employee\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees and costs in connection with the appeal can be taken up with the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b748-6\"> Section 2A, inserted by St. 1946, c. 386, \u00a7 3, provides that legislative acts making certain amendments therein described to G. L. c. 152 shall \u201cbe deemed to be substantive in character and shall apply only to personal injuries occurring on and after the effective date of such act[s], unless otherwise expressly provided.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
