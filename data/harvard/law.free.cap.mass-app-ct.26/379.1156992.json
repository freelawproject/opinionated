From its intersection with Upper Road in Deerfield, it runs north and west into the neighboring town of Shelburne. The 1.62 mile segment of Hawks Road involved in this action is unpaved road through woods and wetlands which does not, so far as the record indicates, have any residences or structures. It is used primarily by loggers and farmers, although several persons, at least, use it as a shortcut between Deerfield and Shelburne. The plaintiffs, as trustees of the Allyn W. Coombs, Inc. Profit-Sharing Retirement Plan, own a ninety-seven acre parcel bordering on this segment which they intend to subdivide. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>Several other persons own parcels similarly situated on which they intend to build houses. The selectmen of Deerfield are concerned that development will ultimately necessitate major expenditure to pave the road for the use of cars, school buses (see G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 68), fire trucks, and the like. Deerfield\u2019s conservation commission is concerned about the effect of road widening, paving, and maintenance on the adjacent wetlands. Some residents are concerned to protect the unspoiled woodland character of the area. These concerns led, on August 22, 1984, to a vote by the selectmen, after a public hearing pursuant to G. L. c. 82, \u00a7 32A, purporting to discontinue maintenance of Hawks Road in the described stretch. The plaintiffs in this action challenge the authority of the selectmen under that section to discontinue maintenance of a county highway. A Superior Court judge allowed the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment and entered a judgment quashing the decision of the board of selectmen to discontinue the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Section 32A, as rewritten in 1983 (by c. 136 of the acts of that year), authorizes \u201c[t]he board or officers of a city or town having charge of a public way . . . , upon finding that a city or town way or public way has become abandoned and unused for ordinary travel and that the common convenience and necessity no longer requires said town way or public way to be maintained in a condition reasonably safe for travel, [to] declare that the city or town shall no longer be bound to keep such way or public way in repair . . . .\u201d The plaintiffs\u2019 contention is that the authority conferred by this section extends only to city or town ways, not to county ways, and that cities and towns, despite their statutory obligation to keep up the county ways within their boundaries (G. L. c. 84, \u00a7 1), cannot properly be said to be in \u201ccharge of\u201d such ways in view of the pervasive authority of the county commissioners over the original layout, construction, and any subsequent alteration or relocation of such ways and their continuing authority to require cities and towns to repair or alter county highways. See G.L.c. 82, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 5, 6, 8, 10-12, 14, &amp; 15. The town focuses on the fact that \u00a7 32A, by its terms, applies not only to city and town ways but also to \u201cpublic ways\u201d in general and urges that it does have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>\u201ccharge of\u201d Hawks Road in the sense that it is charged by law with the duty of maintaining Hawks Road and effecting any repairs or alterations ordered by the county commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Prior to the 1983 amendment, G. L. c. 82, \u00a7 32A, authorized county commissioners, \u201c[u]pon petition in writing of the board or officers of a town having charge of a public way, . . . whenever common convenience and necessity no longer require such way to be maintained in a condition reasonably safe and convenient for travel, [to] adjudicate that said way shall thereafter be a private way and that the town shall no longer be bound to keep the same in repair . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cPublic way,\u201d as there used, doubtless included public ways of any type, whether county or town, so long as the board or officers of the town had \u201ccharge of\u201d the way. It is improbable that the draftsmen would have used the general term public way if they intended the statute to apply only to one type of public way \u2014 a town way \u2014 and, as the county commissioners held the reins, rather than the town officials, the anomaly that gives rise to the present litigation \u2014 permitting town officials to determine the future of county roads \u2014 did not exist. By a natural reading of the pre-1983 statute, therefore, the selectmen or road commissioners of a town, charged by the law with the day-to-day upkeep of town ways and county highways (but not State highways \u2014 see G. L. c. 81, \u00a7\u00a7 13, 15, 18), could petition the county commissioners for reduction in the status of either type of way from public to private, thus eliminating the expense of the town\u2019s burden of maintenance, while leaving unimpaired the public\u2019s right of access over the road. As to the status of \u201cstatutory private ways\u201d generally, see <em>United States </em>v. <em>125.07 Acres of Land, More or Less, </em>707 F.2d 11, 14 (1st Cir. 1983), and cases and statutes cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">The 1983 revision had its origin in House No. 3611 of that year, a bill that would have eliminated the petition procedure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>and vested in the selectmen or road commissioners directly the authority to discontinue maintenance on ways found to be \u201cabandoned and unused for ordinary travel.\u201d This bill was entitled, \u201cAn Act establishing procedures by which town officials can find that a highway or public way is unused for ordinary travel, and to free the town from all further responsibility for such highway or public way\u201d. As filed it applied unmistakably to county highways as well as to town ways \u2014 \u201chighway\u201d being the term used both traditionally and in c. 82 to denote ways laid out by the county. Compare G. L. c. 82, \u00a7 1, with \u00a7 21. See <em>Newburyport Redev. Authy. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 206, 223 (1980). The text of the bill is set out in the margin.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">The bill was reported out favorably by the committee on transportation (1983 House No. 6019), but not without several significant amendments. The one which concerns us is the substitution, for the words \u201chighway or public way\u201d (in H. 3611), of the words \u201ctown way or public way\u201d (inH. 6019). \u201cPublic way,\u201d standing by itself, has a broad connotation; \u201ctown way or public way\u201d is enigmatic, because all town ways, even those denominated \u201cprivate,\u201d are public in the sense that the public has an unlimited right of access. <em>Denham </em>v. <em>County Commissioners of Bristol, </em>108 Mass. 202, 204-205 (1871). The uncertainty created by the phrase \u201ctown way or public way\u201d justifies looking at the legislative history, and the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>mittee\u2019s deliberate striking of the word \u201chighway\u201d and substituting therefor the words \u201ctown way\u201d strongly suggests an intention to narrow the scope of the bill to exclude its application to highways laid out by the county. Looked at another way, if \u201cpublic way\u201d in the transportation committee redraft is read to include county highways, what was accomplished by the amendment? An intention to exclude county highways is confirmed persuasively by subsequent legislative action: the House committee on bills in the third reading, on broadening the bill to include ways in cities as well as towns, amended the title of the bill to \u201cAn Act further regulating the procedures for abandoning certain municipal ways.\u201d Where the text is uncertain, the title that was appended to the legislation when it passed may be relied on as indicative of the legislative intent. See <em>Charles I. Hosmer, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>302 Mass. 495, 501 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">We recognize that this construction of \u00a7 32A leaves the words \u201cpublic way\u201d (in the phrase finally adopted, \u201ccity or town way or public way\u201d) without obvious application. Possibly the draftsmen were concerned that \u201ccity or town way\u201d might be read to refer only to ways laid out or accepted by the city or town, as opposed to local ways made public by prescription. See <em>Fenn </em>v. <em>Middleborough, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 80, 83-87 (1979). Perhaps they simply failed to consider that the change from \u201chighway\u201d to \u201ccity or town way\u201d might require correlative changes to avoid uncertainty. In any event, we could not avoid the problem by giving \u201cpublic way\u201d its usual broad connotation: \u201ccity or town way\u201d would then be quite superfluous.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Forced to conclude that no reasonable construction can avoid surplusage, we opt for that which is in consonance with what seems to us to have been the Legislature\u2019s likely purpose in striking \u201chighway\u201d throughout the bill and amending the title to refer only to \u201c[c]ertain [m]uncipal [w]ays.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>This construction, we realize, leaves cities and towns with no direct way of discontinuing maintenance of little used segments of ancient county highways within their borders \u2014 a result that could be achieved under the earlier \u00a7 32A through the procedure of petitioning the county commissioners.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If the purpose of the 1983 amendment was to enable cities and towns more easily to rid themselves of the upkeep obligation on little-used roads, that purpose may have been undermined in another way: by the requirement, not present in the statute before the 1983 amendment, of a finding that the way at issue \u201chas become abandoned and unused for ordinary travel.\u201d It is at least doubtful that a finding to that effect was properly made on the evidence in this case (we need not decide the point) or could properly be made in any case where a little-used road is still travelled by one or more persons on a regular basis or is used for access to even a single residence. If the 1983 amendment was intended to liberalize use of \u00a7 32A, as the town asserts, legislative amendments should be considered as the most satisfactory way of dealing with the less than expansive language that was finally adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b407-7\"> This version of the statute was inserted by St. 1924, c. 289, and remained unamended until 1983. Provisions not reproduced in the text (1) required the town to post notices to warn the public of the status of the way at points where it joined to public ways and (2) specified that it applied only to towns, not to cities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b408-6\"> \u201cNotwithstanding the provisions in Section[s] 1 and 22 of Chapter 84 of the General Laws, the selectmen or road commissioners of a town may, after holding a public hearing, notice of which shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the town once in each of two successive weeks, the first publication to be not less than fourteen days before the day of the hearing and by posting in a conspicuous place in the town hall for a period of not less than fourteen days before the day of the hearing, upon finding that a Highway or Public Way has become abandoned and unused for ordinary travel and that the common convenience and necessity no longer require said highway or public way to be maintained in a condition reasonably safe and convenient for travel, . . . declare that the town shall no longer be bound to keep such highway or public way in repair and upon filing of such declaration with the Town Clerk such declaration shall take effect, provided that sufficient notice to warn the public against entering thereon is posted at both ends of such highway or public way, or positions .[portions?] thereof.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b409-6\"> It cannot be contended that \u201ccity or town way\u201d was intended to pick up statutory <em>private </em>ways, because a city or town has no obligation to maintain such ways. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>125.07 Acres of Land, More or Less, </em>707 F.2d at 14, and authorities cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b410-6\"> The result may still be achieved indirectly by the more cumbersome procedure of petitioning the county commissioners for discontinuance of the highway (or portion thereof) as a public way (G. L. c. 82, \u00a7\u00a7 2-5) and then, if successful, laying out the discontinued portion as a municipal private way (G. L. c. 82, \u00a7\u00a7 21-23). See also G. L. c. 82, \u00a7 29, authorizing county commissioners to lay out town private ways \u201cfor the use of one or more persons who are not inhabitants thereof.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
