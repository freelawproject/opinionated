The plaintiff was authorized, however, at any time to sell the property, in which event \u201cthere shall be paid to my said husband from the proceeds of sale an amount representing the then current value of his life interest therein, and the balance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>of the net proceeds shall be distributed, in equal shares, to my sons . . . .\u201d The plaintiff sold the property in 1986; the parties are in dispute as to the value of his life estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">The parties agree that the \u201cthen current value\u201d of the life estate is to be determined by reference to the life interest valuation tables promulgated by the United States Treasury Department under \u00a7 2031 of thel.R.C. (see Treas. Reg. \u00a7\u00a7 20. 2031-1 et seq.). See <em>Harris </em>v. <em>United States, </em>764 F.2d 1126, 1130-1131 (5th Cir. 1985). They disagree whether to use the table in effect in 1980, at the time of the testatrix\u2019s death (Table A[l] of Treas. Reg. \u00a7 20.2031-10[Q), or the one in effect at the time of the sale in 1986 (Table A of Treas. Reg. \u00a7 20.203l-7[f]). The difference is considerable. The 1980 table, which differentiated by gender, was predicated on a six percent interest factor and would value the plaintiff\u2019s life estate (based on his life expectancy at the time of sale) at 49.585% of $580,000 (the sale price). The 1986 table, which is gender-blind, was predicated on a ten percent interest factor and would value the plaintiff\u2019s life estate at 69.352% of the sale price.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The basic contention underlying the defendant\u2019s advocacy of the 1980 table is that the testatrix naturally would have contemplated that the plaintiff\u2019s life estate would diminish in value as of the years passed, that the use of the table in effect at her death would be consistent with her presumed expectation, and that this approach is consonant with the usual rule that a will speaks as of the time of the testator\u2019s death and refers to the state of things then existing. <em>Cape Cod Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Cape Cod Hosp., </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 279, 281 (1975), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">The argument is not persuasive. The testatrix did not mention life estate valuation tables. When she spoke of the \u201cthen current value of [the plaintiff\u2019s] life interest,\u201d she must be taken to have meant the actual market value of so much of the life estate as remained at the time of the sale. The actual market value of such an interest would necessarily be affected not only by the diminishing expected duration of the life estate but also by market forces reflected both in fluctuating real estate values and in fluctuating interest rates. The actual market <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>value of the life estate at the time of sale will be approximated by the actuarial tables in use at the time of sale, reflecting current market conditions and actuarial assumptions, rather than those in effect at an earlier time when conditions were different. Compare <em>United Food and Commercial Workers Union </em>v. <em>Progressive Supermarkets, </em>644 F. Supp. 633, 640 n.6 (D.N.J. 1986); <em>Estate of Simmie </em>v. <em>Commr. of Internal Revenue, </em>69 T.C. 890, 892-94 (1978). It could be argued that the 1986 table marginally overvalued the plaintiff\u2019s share, either because the interest factor was higher than market conditions in 1986 actually warranted, or because of the gender-blinding; but the parties foreclosed consideration of such questions by stipulating to the use of one or the other of the two treasury tables as reflective of market conditions at the two pertinent dates.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The \u201cjudgment\u201d appealed from, ostensibly a final disposition, was entered on cross-motions for partial summary judgment which were addressed only to the valuation issue. The parties had indicated that they thought they would be able to settle amicably the other issues raised in the pleadings. A judgment, however, should not be entered until the record reflects that those issues have been resolved by settlement or otherwise. See Mass.R.Civ.P. 54(a) and (b), 365 Mass. 820-821 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">The judgment and the order allowing the defendant\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment are reversed. The order denying the plaintiff\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment is reversed and a new order is to be entered allowing that motion. The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
