This appeal concerns the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion \u201cto withdraw guilty pleas or in the alternative ... for new trial.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The question presented is whether the testimony of the defendant\u2019s \u201cplea attorney\u201d at the motion hearing concerning private communications with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>the defendant was beyond the scope of the defendant\u2019s waiver of the attorney-client privilege. We conclude that the testimony given here by the plea attorney in defending against the challenge to his professional conduct was within the scope of the waiver of the attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">The purpose of the attorney-client privilege is to preclude an attorney from divulging confidential communications with the client. S.J.C. Rule 3:07, DR 4-101(C), 382 Mass. 778 (1981).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The privilege, however, is not absolute and may be waived by the client either expressly or implicitly. The defendant concedes that if a client assails his attorney\u2019s conduct the privilege as to confidential communications is waived because the lawyer has a right to defend himself. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brito, </em>390 Mass. 112, 119 (1983). See also <em>Tasby </em>v. <em>United States, </em>504 F.2d 332, 336 (8th Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 1125 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Although it is true that an attorney may, in an effort to defend himself against allegations of misconduct, disclose confidential communications, the scope of that disclosure is not unlimited. The Supreme Judicial Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-7\">\u201cOnce such a charge is made, the attorney-client privilege may be treated as waived at least in part, but trial counsel\u2019s obligation may continue to preserve confidences whose disclosure is not <em>relevant </em>to the defense of the charge of his ineffectiveness as counsel\u201d (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-8\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brito, </em>390 Mass. at 119, citing <em>Tasby </em>v. <em>United States, </em>504 F.2d at 336. That language suggests that the scope of counsel\u2019s obligation to preserve confidences when a charge of misconduct is made turns on whether the disclosure is relevant, material, or necessary to defend against the charge. <em>See Commonwealth v. Brito, </em>390 Mass. at 119. See also S.J.C. Rule 3:07, DR 4-101(C), 382 Mass. 778 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>In the instant case, the defendant contends that the motion judge erred in permitting the prosecutor to elicit testimony covering the entire range of the discussion between the attorney and the client, none of which was directly relevant to the attorney\u2019s defense of the specific charge against him.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We do not agree. The record provides ample support for the judge\u2019s determination that the waiver of the privilege was appropriate and the revelation of those matters, now challenged, was relevant to counsel\u2019s defense to the charge of misconduct. Defense counsel\u2019s testimony went principally and primarily to the reasons why he (counsel) thought, and so advised, that a plea of guilty was in the over-all best interests of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">The defendant would like us to construe the scope of the waiver very narrowly. The widely accepted principle, however, is that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-6\">\u201c[A] client is not free to make various allegations of misconduct and incompetence while the attorney\u2019s lips are sealed by invocation of the attorney-client privilege. Such an incongruous result would be inconsistent with the object and purpose of the attorney-client privilege and a patent perversion of the rule. When a client calls into public question the competence of his attorney, the privilege is waived\u201d (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-7\"><em>Tasby </em>v. <em>United States, </em>504 F.2d at 336. See also 8 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 2327(6), at 638 (McNaughton rev. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">It is fair to say that the defendant first waived his privilege when he filed his pro se \u201cMotion to Withdraw Guilty Plea[s] and for a New Trial.\u201d The scope of the waiver of the attorney-client privilege may be discerned from the content of the supporting affidavit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>\u201cBefore I stepped into the court room on [M]ay 6, 1985, I was told to plead guilty by my counsel who was not acting in my best interest [and] coerced me into pleading guilty and stated [that] if I didn\u2019t the judge would give me life on and after . . ..\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">In his testimony at the hearing on the motion to withdraw guilty pleas and for a new trial, the defendant testified that his counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-6\">\u201cnever went into the charges\u2019 but he just went into \u2014 Everytime I seen him we talked about what I was supposed to say, how I was supposed to address the court and say yes, you know, and talk proper, sit straight. You know what I\u2019m saying. That\u2019s what we talked about. We never went into the case. We just went into what I was supposed to do.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">These allegations unmistakably placed in question the credibility of both the attorney and the client as well as the substance of their communications. The resulting testimony by counsel was both relevant and material to the truth or falsity of the defendant\u2019s testimony and the quality of counsel\u2019s representation with respect to the over-all rationale for the defendant\u2019s guilty pleas. Consequently, the first four of the six matters, identified by the defendant as beyond the scope of the waiver (note 3, <em>supra), </em>are within the scope of the waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">The final two matters alleged to be beyond the scope of the waiver are directly relevant to the defendant\u2019s charge that his plea was coerced and that the motivation for his plea was an offer of a recommendation of a sentence of six to twelve years. By giving testimony concerning privileged communication about his plea decision the defendant waived his privilege and permitted counsel to introduce testimony \u201cas to all consultations relating to the same subject.\u201d McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 93, at 224-225 (3d ed. 1984). Thus, the plea attorney\u2019s testimony on these matters was within the scope of the waiver, as it was offered not only to prove that the defendant was not coerced, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>but also was motivated by such other considerations as the evidence against him and his desire to avoid his codefendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Deciding as we do, we have no need to discuss whether the motion judge properly could deny the defendant\u2019s motion based on the reasoning of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>394 Mass. 25, 28 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">\n<em>Order denying motion to withdraw guilty pleas or for a new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b662-15\"> At the hearing the motion judge found the defendant\u2019s testimony incredible and unworthy of belief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b663-9\"> The disciplinary rule provides in relevant part: \u201cA lawyer may reveal: ...
