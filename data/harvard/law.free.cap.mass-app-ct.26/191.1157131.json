Arlene P. DeLuca (Arlene) sought a divorce from Albert R. DeLuca (Albert) claiming cruel and abusive treatment by Albert. Albert brought a separate action on grounds of irretrievable breakdown of their marriage. The actions were consolidated and tried before a Probate Court judge. He ruled that each party was entitled to a divorce for the reasons each had asserted. In a memorandum of decision he addressed the factors set out in G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34, as amended by St. 1983, c. 233, \u00a7 77. We summarize those findings that are relevant to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>Albert has been in the automobile business since 1955. He owns two corporations, an automobile sales business and an automobile rental company. Both corporations are located in Haverhill on property owned by him. Albert also owned, as investment property, a five-unit apartment house in Lawrence. The building was in need of extensive repairs before the units could be rented out to produce income. The property was valued at $175,000 and was subject to a mortgage of $25,350. In addition, Albert had a $350,000 line of credit from a bank, secured by the Haverhill and Lawrence properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The judge found that Arlene had no marketable job skills and no foreseeable opportunity to acquire assets because of her lack of those skills. He stated that \u201c[a] woman, untrained in all respects to obtain employment in today\u2019s job market, who was a housewife for twenty-four years and successfully raised three boys, should not now be required to serve hamburgers or accept comparable employment at minimum wages unless the situation absolutely requires it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Judgments of divorce nisi were entered on February 21, 1986.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The judge ordered, among other things, that Albert convey to Arlene all of his interest in the apartment building in Lawrence, \u201csubject to all outstanding mortgages, liens, real estate taxes and any other encumbrances.\u201d Neither party appealed from the judgments, and they became absolute ninety days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">On March 3, 1987, Arlene filed a motion captioned \u201cMotion For Relief From Judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In it Arlene stated that the portions of the judgments that ordered Albert to convey to her the Lawrence property \u201csubject to outstanding mortgages, liens, real estate taxes and any other encumbrances\u201d was unclear because \u201cit relies on the differing interpretations of the parties and is unduly burdensome to [her].\u201d She requested \u201cthat the judgments] be clarified with respect to a Three Hundred Fifty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>Thousand ($350,000) dollar floating line of credit for contingent liability (which is secured by the aforementioned real estate of [Arlene] used to purchase automobiles for defendant\u2019s business) so that the credit line, of unknown active amount of encumbrance and indeterminate length, no longer be secured by said real estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">After a hearing the judge ruled that Albert\u2019s conveyance of the Lawrence property to Arlene was subject only to the $25,350 mortgage, and not to the $350,000 line of credit. Therefore, Albert must make an arrangement with the bank whereby the Lawrence property is not subject to the line of credit. In a memorandum that accompanied his decision, the judge stated that it had been his intention in framing the judgments of divorce to award to Arlene the Lawrence property \u201csubject <em>only </em>to the mortgage of $25,350 and thus give her the balance as equity in the property and to enable her to derive net rental income. ... It was <em>not </em>my intention to award her that real estate subject to an encumbrance greater than the equity in the real estate. To do so would have been a Pyrrhic award\u201d (emphasis original). The judge then added that it was his own <em>\u201cinadvertence in drafting </em>... the [[judgments <em>that </em>resulted in the instant motion being filed\u201d (emphasis supplied). The judge specifically stated that he allowed the motion pursuant to Mass.R.Dom.Rel.P. 60(b)(6) (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Albert seizes on the word \u201cinadvertence\u201d used by the judge and argues that the motion should properly have been decided under rule 60(b)(1)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and not 60(b)(6). According to him, the distinction is critical because, although motions under both subsections must be brought within a reasonable time, a rule 60(b)(1) motion must be filed within one year following the entry of judgment. <em>Chavoor </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>383 Mass. 801, 803 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>(1981). Because Arlene\u2019s motion was filed one year and ten days after entry of the judgments nisi, Albert argues that it was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Arlene contends that the motion was timely filed, and that the judge did not abuse his discretion in deciding the motion in her favor. We agree with Arlene but hold that the judge should have decided the motion under rule 60(a) and not pursuant to rule 60(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">By its terms,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> rule 60(a) permits the correction not only of clerical mistakes but also of errors arising from oversight or omission. 11 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil \u00a7 2854 at 148-149 (1973). The \u201cerror\u201d involved in this case clearly is an inadvertence \u201carising from oversight or omission\u201d as these terms are used in rule 60(a). According to the judge, he amended the judgments to conform them to his contemporaneous intention at the time he framed the original judgments. It has been held in similar circumstances that such a correction is permitted by rule 60(a). See <em>Mark Rich &amp; Co. A.G. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>739 F.2d 834, 837 (2d Cir. 1984); <em>Panama Processes, S.A. </em>v. <em>Cities Service Co., </em>789 F.2d 991, 993 (2d Cir. 1986).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Also see <em>Sanborn </em>v. <em>Johns, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 721, 725 n.4 (1985), where in dictum the court said, \u201cIf, as the evidence suggests, the judge hearing the divorce intended to include paragraphs 3 and 4 in the divorce decree, but neglected to do so, Mass.R.Dom.Rel.P. 60(a) (1975) authorizes correction of the judgment at any time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>\u201cClerical mistakes and errors of oversight or omission may be corrected at any time.\u201d 11 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil \u00a7 2855, at 155. Therefore, there is no time limit on such motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Albert claims that if the original judgments had contained the provision that Albert\u2019s conveyance of the Lawrence property to Arlene was subject only to the $25,350 mortgage, he would have appealed on the ground that the division of the marital property was unfair. He argues that if we sustain the judge\u2019s action, he should have, in justice, the right to appeal to this court the division of the marital property as reflected in the amended judgments. Rule 14(b) of the Massachusetts Rules of Appellate Procedure, 378 Mass. 939 (1979), forbids an appellate court from enlarging \u201cthe time for filing a notice of appeal beyond one year from the date of entry of the judgment or order sought to be reviewed.\u201d Over one year has passed from the entry of the amended judgments and orders in this case. Therefore, we have no power to grant Albert the right to appeal from the amended judgments. In any event, we believe that a reading of the judge\u2019s memorandum of decision that accompanied his original judgments should have alerted Albert to the likelihood that the judge intended that the Lawrence property be conveyed to Arlene subject only to the $25,350 mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The amended judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b218-8\"> We assume that a judgment was entered in each action; that appears to have been the judge\u2019s intent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b218-9\"> Arlene never specified whether she was bringing her motion under Mass.R.Dom.Rel.P. 60(a) or (b) (1975).
