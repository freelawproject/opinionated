Consequently, RTC urges, the award was in excess of the arbitrator\u2019s authority and was erroneously confirmed by a Superior Court judge. See G. L. c. 251, \u00a7\u00a711 and 12. We conclude that the contract language is susceptible to the interpretation placed upon it by the arbitrator and affirm the judgment of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>This, in outline, is the commercial setting of the dispute. Sometime in 1984, Grobet File Company of America, Inc., a manufacturer of precision hand tools and something of a pioneer in the use of computer technology,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> decided to replace its outdated computer system. Grobet adopted a plan of buying new IBM hardware which would run standard \u201cvanilla\u201d programs devised and marketed by RTC. There would be twelve programs which RTC would furnish under a license agreement, covering functions such as general ledger and strategic planning, accounts payable, accounts receivable, purchasing, order processing, sales analysis, payroll, human resources, and so forth. For Grobet\u2019s purposes, the vanilla programs required tailor-made modifications (\u201ctoppings\u201d and \u201cmix-ins\u201d). The price tag negotiated for the installation was $660,476.60, of which $441,776.60 was allocable to new hardware, $150,000 for the vanilla software, and $68,700 for the software modifications. Terms to this effect were incorporated in an agreement which the parties signed on November 30, 1984. That agreement also provided that RTC was to complete the project \u201cno later than May 31, 1985.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">It is not necessary to chronicle in detail the history of missed goals and failed performance which followed. By the end of March, 1986, the modifications were still substantially incomplete. RTC had much reduced its own work force and it had placed the module modifications \u201ctemporarily on hold.\u201d Grobet demanded arbitration in which it asked, among other things, for \u201crescission\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and compensatory damages. The parties proceeded to arbitration before a single arbitrator who awarded Grobet $87,588.17.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Under the agreement of November 30, 1984, the parties agreed to refer to arbitration \u201c[a]ny controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this contract, or the breach thereof.\u201d In making his award, the arbitrator listed four components of dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>ages: the cost of hiring another computer software engineer who successfully designed the modifications to the vanilla software, $30,522; costs incurred in running Grobet\u2019s old computer system, $56,589; depreciation of Grobet\u2019s old IBM 4331 system, which the parties intended to sell at the completion of the contract, during the period the new system was not up and running, $10,000; and late charge penalty per a February 24, 1986, amendment of the basic agreement, $10,000.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">RTC pitches its argument that the damage award exceeded the scope of the arbitrator\u2019s authority on the following language in the contract:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">\u201cExcept as provided under the Copyright/Patent section, RTC shall not be liable for any loss, cost, damage, or expense arising directly or indirectly in connection with this Agreement, in excess of the amount of the License Fee paid by Customer to RTC. In no event shall RTC be liable for any special or consequential damages or for any indirect damages such as punitive damages even if RTC has been notified of the possibility of such damages.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">Apart from the penalty (a $10,000 amount) provided for by the superseding amendment of February 24, 1986, the remaining elements of damage were \u2014 at least the parties have put the case on that assumption \u2014 consequential in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">As to the underlying principle of law, RTC is on firm ground, i.e., an arbitrator may not award relief which goes beyond the clearly marked boundaries of the contract. <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Falzarano, </em>380 Mass. 18, 28 (1980). Had the contract, for example, limited damages payable for any combination of defaults to $50,000, then the arbitrator could not award $100,000, even though the aggrieved party may have suffered damages in that amount. Otherwise formulated, the arbitrator may not ignore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>the plain words of the contract. <em>United Paperworkers Intl. Union </em>v. <em>Misco, Inc., </em>484 U.S. 29, 40-41 (1987). We think the limiting boundaries, however, must be set forth with clarity, and the limiting words must be plain. If there is room for doubt or interpretation on the question, then the issue properly lies within the broad authority conferred upon arbitrators of civil disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Once in the arena of arbitration, the powers of the arbitrator concerning the issue are wide and the scope of judicial review of the arbitration proceedings is narrow. Short of fraud, arbitrary conduct, or significant procedural irregularity, the arbitrator\u2019s resolution of matters of fact or law is binding. <em>Greene </em>v. <em>Mari &amp; Sons Flooring Co., </em>362 Mass. 560, 563 (1972). <em>Trustees of Boston &amp; Me. Corp. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Authy., </em>363 Mass. 386, 390-391 (1973). Courts will not disturb the arbitrator\u2019s findings and conclusions even if (in the court\u2019s view) they are grossly erroneous. <em>Ibid. Lawrence </em>v. <em>Falzarano, </em>380 Mass. at 28-29. <em>Bernard </em>v. <em>Hemisphere Hotel Mgmt., Inc., </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 261, 263-264 (1983). See also other statutory grounds for vacating an arbitration award contained in G. L. c. 251, \u00a7 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">. In the instant case the boundaries established by the language upon which RTC relies are not distinct; the words, in the context of the entire agreement, are not plain. It was, therefore, altogether within the arbitrator\u2019s authority to construe the agreement. What is wrong with RTC\u2019s position is that it rips the purportedly limiting language from context. The agreement consists of a form of license agreement devised by RTC for leasing basic vanilla software. Appended to the form pages are eleven specially drafted pages which deal mostly with the software modifications RTC was to design, although the addenda touch on ancillary subjects, such as trade-in of Grobet\u2019s existing computer equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">The limiting language which RTC embraces appears in the canned portion of the agreement under a caption \u201cWarranty of Right to Grant License.\u201d That language is imprecisely drafted. It may relate solely to damages arising out of a breach by RTC of its warranty of a right to grant the various software <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>licenses. Although the clause in question purports to limit \u201cdamage . . . arising ... in connection with this Agreement,\u201d the placement of the language under a particular subject heading admits of the interpretation that a shorter reach was intended than all damages under the entire agreement. Ambiguities tilt against the author. <em>Merrimack Valley Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Baird, </em>372 Mass. 721, 724 (1977). <em>Republic Pipe &amp; Supply Corp. </em>v. <em>Marnell Constr. Corp., </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 848 (1977). Even if the limiting language were thought to go beyond the warranty against encumbrances, it is highly doubtful that the limiting language had anything to do with the provisions concerning program modifications, which were separate from the standard licensing provisions. The damages awarded all relate to RTC\u2019s failures (as found by the arbitrator) to provide working modifications to the vanilla software.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">In view of the absence of much more certain limitations on damages, the arbitrator acted within his powers in arriving at his decision. The award was rightly confirmed by the Superior Court judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b159-7\"> Grobet\u2019s existing system recorded and computed accounts payable and receivable, inventory control, payroll, and floor planning.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b159-8\"> Use of the term \u201crescission\u201d seems a misnomer as there does not appear to have been any intent on Grobet\u2019s part to give back the hardware or the vanilla software.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b160-9\"> We have rounded .off the amounts to the whole dollar. The total is $107,111. From that figure the arbitrator deducted $19,523 which, he had decided, Grobet owed RTC for hardware, basic software, and some implementation support; thus he arrived at the net award of $87,588.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
