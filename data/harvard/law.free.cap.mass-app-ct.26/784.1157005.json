Bruno </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b811-7\"><em>Nijole Makaitis Slezas, </em>Assistant District Attorney, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b811-8\">Greaney, C.J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3M\">A jury in the Superior Court convicted the defendant on two indictments charging him with rape of a child under sixteen. One indictment (no. 067907) charged rape by natural sexual intercourse; the other (no. 067908) rape by unnatural (i.e. anal) sexual intercourse. He was sentenced to serve forty-five to sixty years on each conviction with the sentences to be served concurrently. The defendant has argued six issues on appeal, the most important of which concern the sufficiency of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence to establish the rapes and the judge\u2019s instructions concerning the element of penetration. We affirm the conviction on indictment no. 067907. We reverse the conviction on the other indictment and order further proceedings in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-9\">The victim, who was five years o\u00edd \u00e1t the time of the incidents, testified that on one occasion the defendant got her to play a \u201cgame\u201d with him in the bedroom. The defendant took off the victim\u2019s jeans and underpants, leaving her naked from the waist down. The defendant took off his pants and underpants. He got on top of her while she was on the bed and \u201cmoved around a little.\u201d While moving around, the defendant\u2019s \u201cprivate spot\u201d was touching her \u201cbum\u201d. After he was finished, the defendant wiped the victim\u2019s \u201cbum\u201d with a towel. The defendant\u2019s actions were demonstrated to the jury by the victim\u2019s use of two anatomically correct dolls and \u201cmoving the dolls in a rocking motion.\u201d The victim indicated that the defendant\u2019s \u201cprivate spot\u201d was the penis on the male doll.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-10\">On a second occasion, the child was lying on her back on a couch. The defendant pulled her underpants \u201chalfway down\u201d and took his clothes \u201chalfway down.\u201d He then touched her \u201cprivate spot\u201d with his \u201cprivate spot.\u201d The victim indicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>that the genital opening on the female doll was her \u201cprivate spot\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">In addition to the victim\u2019s testimony and the demonstrations with the dolls, a nurse practitioner testified that the victim had been diagnosed as having gonorrhea and had been treated for the disease. The prosecutor also called a physician (an internist) who testified that the defendant had been diagnosed as having gonorrhea. This doctor indicated that gonorrhea \u201chas to be acquired through intimate contact.\u201d By intimate contact, the doctor meant either genital-to-genital contact or oral-anal contact, at least in a manner that brings the \u201csurface of ... an infected person [into contact] with the recipient. \u201d In the doctor\u2019s opinion, casual contact would not be sufficient to transmit the disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">1. The Commonwealth presented sufficient evidence to permit the jury to infer that the defendant had penetrated the victim while performing acts of natural and unnatural sexual intercourse. The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence is similar to the evidence given by the child victim in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>400 Mass. 534, 540-541 (1987), who testified in terms of sexual touching of her \u201cprivate parts\u201d by the defendant\u2019s penis. The victim in this case clearly identified what she called \u201cprivate spots\u201d as her genital opening and the defendant\u2019s penis, and she indicated that her \u201cbum\u201d was her buttocks. By her testimony and the use of anatomically correct dolls, the victim demonstrated to the jury the position of her body and the defendant\u2019s body during the various incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">It reasonably could be inferred from the victim\u2019s testimony and her demonstrations with the dolls that the defendant had applied pressure on her and engaged in movements in an effort to ejaculate. In this fashion, the testimony and use of the dolls indicated that the defendant had penetrated the victim. Additionally, the medical evidence pointed to penetration by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>defendant as the cause of the victim\u2019s gonorrhea.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We agree with the defendant that evidence of penetration was necessary to prove the acts of rape charged in both indictments in order to differentiate those acts from other prohibited sexual touchings or conduct such as assault on a child under sixteen with intent to commit rape, see G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 24B, indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen, see G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B, or unnatural and lascivious acts on a child under sixteen, see G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 35A. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cobb, ante </em>283, 284-286 (1988). However, the evidence in this case, together with the reasonable inferences that could be drawn therefrom, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Albano, </em>373 Mass. 132, 134 (1977), was adequate to warrant a finding by the jury of penetration on both indictments. Based on the evidence, the judge correctly denied the defendant\u2019s motions for required findings of not guilty.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">2. (a) We reject the defendant\u2019s argument that the judge\u2019s instmctions to the jury on the indictment charging rape by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>natural sexual intercourse erroneously defined the element of penetration and permitted the jury to convict the defendant on their finding of an act which constituted an assault with intent to commit rape or an indecent assault and battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">With respect to this indictment, the judge instructed the jury that they had to find actual penetration to establish a rape. He indicated that penetration permissibly could be found \u201cif the Commonwealth prove[d] beyond a reasonable doubt direct contact of the . . . head of the defendant\u2019s penis with the vulva or labia of the alleged victim . . . .\u201d This instruction is essentially a restatement of the language used in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 200, 204-205 (1987), to describe the minimum degree of penetration necessary to establish the traditional common law notion of rape. As was said in <em>Baldwin: </em>\u201cIntrusion into the vagina itself is not required to make out the wrongful penetration. Touching by the [penis] of the vulva or labia ... is intrusion enough.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The jury instructions on this offense were correct and complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">(b) We agree with the defendant\u2019s argument that the jury instructions on the indictment charging rape by unnatural sexual intercourse were impermissibly vague, and, as a result, we conclude that the defendant should be subject to further proceedings in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">With respect to this indictment, the judge instructed the jury that a conviction could be returned if the Commonwealth \u201cprove[d] beyond a reasonable doubt some penetration of the defendant\u2019s penis into that area between the alleged victim\u2019s buttocks, no matter how slight that penetration might be.\u201d \u201cUnnatural sexual intercourse\u201d under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 23, the revised statute punishing rape of a child, has been defined as including \u201canal intercourse . . . and other intrusions of a part of a person\u2019s body or other object into the . . . anal opening of another person\u2019s body.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallant, </em>373 Mass. 577, 584 (1977). While the term \u201canus\u201d is often used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>colloquially to describe a person\u2019s buttocks, or the groove between the buttocks, it is the name of a bodily part which has a precise medical definition. Medically speaking, the term refers to \u201c[t]he very end \u2014 the last inch or so \u2014 of the digestive canal, more specifically of the rectum ... In practice, the term <em>anus </em>is often applied to the orifice or opening of the structure, rather than to the structure itself.\u201d 1 Schmidt\u2019s Attorneys\u2019 Dictionary of Medicine A-273 (1986). The term \u201canal opening\u201d has never been defined as including the buttocks or the groove between the buttocks.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">We think the references to \u201canal intercourse\u201d and \u201cintrusions into the anal opening\u201d in the definition of unnatural sexual intercourse provided by the <em>Gallant </em>decision have to be taken as using the word \u201canus\u201d in its technic\u00e1l sense to describe intercourse which involves penetration of the anus by the penis or an intrusion into that opening by some other bodily part (such as a finger) or another object. We reach this conclusion for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">First, the definition of \u201cunnatural sexual intercourse\u201d fashioned by the <em>Gallant </em>decision also includes \u201cintrusions . . . into the genital . . . opening of another person\u2019s body.\u201d 373 Mass. at 584. A woman\u2019s \u201cgenital opening\u201d has a precise meaning and includes, in addition to the vagina, the anterior parts of the female sexual organ, known as the vulva and the labia. The use of the term \u201cgenital opening\u201d in <em>Gallant </em>permitted the court in the <em>Baldwin </em>case, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 200, 204-205, to conclude that penetration of the anterior parts of the female sex organ was enough to prove forcible rape.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is unlikely that the <em>Gallant </em>decision would have used a technical term such as \u201cgenital opening\u201d in defining one type of unnatural sexual intercourse, while intending, at the same time, that the term \u201canus\u201d (which is used in defining another type of unnatural sexual intercourse) not be construed in its technical sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>Second, the <em>Gallant </em>decision points out that the Model Penal Code \u201chas been the source of much of the recent [Massachusetts] legislation on rape . . . . \u201d 373 Mass. at 588. That Code defines \u201cdeviate sexual intercourse\u201d (its term for \u201cunnatural sexual intercourse\u201d) as \u201csexual intercourse per os or per anum between human beings who are not husband and wife, and any form of sexual intercourse with an animal.\u201d Model Penal Code \u00a7 213.2(1)(1962). See 373 Mass. at 589. It appears that the term \u201cper anum\u201d is used by the Code in the technical sense described above.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">Many States have also defined rape to include penetration of the \u201canus\u201d or \u201canal opening,\u201d as well as contact with the \u201canus,\u201d or \u201canal intercourse.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> There are no decisions in any of these States suggesting that the crime should be defined for the jury in words different from the words used in the governing statute. The one reported case that has considered the issue has adhered to the literal words of the statute of its State to define, and, consequently, to instruct a jury about the crime. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>319 N.C. 429, 433 (1987) (a \u201csexual act\u201d for conviction of first-degree sexual assault \u201crequires penetration of the anal opening by the penis\u201d). The statute in Texas, which punishes \u201c[d]eviate sexual intercourse,\u201d namely \u201cany contact between any part of the genitals of one person and the mouth or anus of another person,\u201d states in the commentary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>the statute that \u201c \u2018anus\u2019 ... is intended in its strict anatomical sense \u2014 the posterior opening of the alimentary canal \u2014 thus excluding the buttocks.\u201d Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 21.01 (Vernon 1974 &amp; Supp. 1988). See <em>Villanueva </em>v. <em>State, </em>703 S.W. 2d 244 (Tex. App. Ct. 1985). The Commonwealth has not brought to our attention any decision in which a jury were instructed that anal rape could be committed by bodily contact that did not involve penetration of the anus.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Third, adherence to the technical meanings of the terms \u201canus\u201d and \u201canal opening\u201d to define penetration is consistent with the principle that penal laws are to be strictly construed to avoid a conviction on evidence that only proves a less serious crime than the one with which the defendant is charged. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rhodes, </em>389 Mass. 641, 646-647 (1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>391 Mass. 808, 813 (1984). Penetration (or intrusion into) the genital or anal opening is required to prove rape. That element sharply differentiates rape from other crimes such as assault with intent to commit rape, indecent assault and battery, and unnatural and lascivious conduct \u2014 crimes which may, in a given case, constitute lesser included offenses under a charge of rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">Defining the penetration element of unnatural sexual intercourse of the sort in issue here as involving something less than an intrusion into the anus obscures the distinction between rape and these other crimes. That imprecision renders it entirely possible that a jury could convict someone of rape after finding that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence only established a lesser offense. For example, an instruction to the jury advising them that they could find penetration sufficient for a conviction of rape in the traditional common law sense if they found that a defendant had placed his penis into the area between the woman\u2019s thighs would not be considered correct. Such an instruction would permit conviction of rape on proof of a lesser form of assault. Similarly, an instruction that penetration sufficient to convict of rape by unnatural sexual intercourse is shown by a defendant putting his penis into the area between the victim\u2019s buttocks creates a likelihood of misapprehension and is not precise enough. This result is to be avoided. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brattman, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 579, 582-586 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">We conclude that, while the evidence on this indictment was sufficient to prove penetration, the instructions were impermissibly vague and could have resulted in the defendant\u2019s conviction of rape by unnatural sexual intercourse upon a finding by the jury of the commission of a lesser type of assault or of some lesser criminal conduct.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">3. The remaining issues argued by the defendant are insufficient to warrant a new trial on the rape by natural intercourse indictment. We deal with them summarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">(a) The judge carefully handled the question of the competency of the victim\u2019s mother to testify. His conclusion that she was a competent, although somewhat reluctant, witness represents a discretionary determination that we will not upset, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sires, </em>370 Mass. 541, 546 (1976), particularly because the judge \u201chad the person under his eye while she was actually in the process of testifying.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whitehead, </em>379 Mass. 640, 656 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">(b) The judge properly admitted in evidence the hospital records of one \u201cBunting Nylander,\u201d who had been diagnosed as suffering from, and had been treated for, gonorrhea. There were sufficient facts to identify \u201cBunting\u201d as the defendant. These facts included a clinic card in the records with the name \u201cIsaac B. Nylander,\u201d a treatment record of \u201cIsaac Nylander,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>and a listing of the defendant\u2019s wife as the person to be notified in case of an emergency. Other facts in the record that were not consistent with the defendant\u2019s personal history went to the weight to be given to the records by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">(c) The assertion that the judge was biased against the defendant in the conduct of the trial is groundless. The letter sent by the judge to the judges on the Appellate Division of the Superior Court concerning the reasons for his sentences was proper and contains nothing which indicates or establishes a bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">4. The judgment on indictment no. 067907 is affirmed. The judgment on indictment no. 067908 is reversed, and the defendant is to stand for further proceedings in the trial court on that indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b812-8\"> The victim also testified that on another occasion the defendant removed her pajama bottoms, pulled down his pants and then, while she was lying on her stomach, he \u201crolled around a little\u201d with his \u201cprivate spot\u201d touching her \u201cbum.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b813-6\"> The fact that the physician at one point in her direct testimony referred to \u201csurface\u201d contact between the infected person and. the recipient as sufficient to transmit gonorrhea did not render her testimony of no evidentiary value on the issue of. penetration. The jury were entitled to view the medical evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mandile, </em>403 Mass. 93, 94 (1988). When viewed in this light, the medical evidence permitted the jury to find that the disease had been given to the victim by the defendant\u2019s penetration of her sexual organ or anus. See cases collected in 3 C. Torc\u00eda, Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law \u00a7 285 n.49 (14th ed. 1980). Also, the Commonwealth did not have to eliminate the victim\u2019s uncle, who also may have abused her, as the source of the disease before the jury could draw tire inference.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b813-7\"> We pause here to deal with another issue argued by the defendant concerning the denial of his motion to dismiss the indictments on the basis that the prosecutor had withheld exculpatory information from the grand jury. The issue lacks substance. The fact that the victim may have been sexually assaulted by her uncle would not have tended to undermine substantially the evidence against the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bobilin, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 410, 412-413 (1988). There was also no need to present evidence to the grand jury about the credibility of the victim\u2019s mother. The information obtained from the mother constituted a minor part of the testimony given by the investigating police officer before the grand jury. The mother, therefore, was not an \u201cimportant witness\u201d whose credibility was crucial to the grand jury\u2019s decision. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Petras, ante </em>483, 487-489 (1988). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Champagne, </em>399 Mass. 80 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b814-8\"> The definition explains the term \u201cunnatural sexual intercourse,\u201d which was not defined by the Legislature, and it becomes part of the statute\u2019s meaning until such time as it is changed either by the Legislature or by further judicial construction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b815-7\"> The proposition that entry of the anterior parts of the female sexual organ is sufficient to prove rape and that it is not necessary for the vagina itself to be penetrated is the rule in the majority of jurisdictions that have considered the issue.
