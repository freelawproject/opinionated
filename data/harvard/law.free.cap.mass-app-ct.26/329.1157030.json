During the pendency of the underlying action against the Tennis Club, the primary insurer, Northeastern Fire Insurance Company of Pennsylvania became insolvent, thus provoking a new chapter in the discussion of the subject considered <em>in Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., </em>399 Mass. 598 (1987), and <em>Gulezian </em>v. <em>Lincoln Ins. Co., </em>399 Mass. 606 (1987). That subject is: shall the excess insurance carriers \u201cdrop down,\u201d i.e., provide coverage for the insured beginning with the first dollar of the insured\u2019s liability?</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The Tennis Club has brought a declaratory judgment action (G. L. c. 231 A) to establish the liability of, respectively, the first excess carrier, Jefferson Insurance Company of New York (Jefferson), and the second excess carrier, Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company (Fireman\u2019s). A judge of the Superior Court determined that both policies drop down. Specifically, Jefferson is bound to indemnify the Tennis Club for the first $200,000 of liability which it incurs; and Fireman\u2019s is bound for the next $500,000. The Tennis Club, on that construction of the policies, has $700,000 in coverage as to any judgment against it in favor of the party who brought the dram shop liability action, the administrator of the estate of Deborah L. McPhail. We conclude that the Jefferson policy drops down but that the Fireman\u2019s policy does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">From the <em>Continental Casualty </em>and <em>Lincoln Insurance </em>decisions several guidelines emerge for grappling with the question whether an excess coverage policy in effect insures against the insolvency of the primary carrier: there is no overriding principle or policy involved; the reasonable expectations of the buyer of the insurance policy can be taken into account in construing the insurance contract, but they are not decisive; in the final analysis the language of the particular insurance policy is determinative; ambiguities in the policy on the drop-down issue will be resolved against the insurer; policies which contain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>references to \u201ccollectible\u201d primary insurance will be construed to cover the event of insolvency; and a policy that says without limitation that it drops down when the primary coverage is reduced provides first dollar coverage should the primary insurer become insolvent. <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., </em>399 Mass. at 600-601. <em>Gulezian </em>v. <em>Lincoln Ins. Co., </em>399 Mass. at 608-612. We do not read these opinions as expressing the broad proposition that the Tennis Club and McPhail find in them, viz., that in the absence of language expressly negating such liability, excess carriers drop down to the next lowest level of liability created by reason of the insolvency of a lower-level insurer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">In screening the policy in each case for ambiguity and resolving the ambiguity against the company, the <em>Continental </em>and <em>Lincoln </em>cases fall in line with several State jurisdictions which have taken a similar approach, particularly when the policies in question contained language which limited the excess carrier\u2019s liability to that in excess of other \u201ccollectible\u201d or \u201crecoverable\u201d insurance. See <em>Reserve Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Pisciotta, </em>30 Cal. 3d 800, 814-815 (1982); <em>Donald B. MacNeal, Inc. </em>v. <em>Interstate Fire &amp; Casualty Co., </em>132 Ill. App. 3d 564, 567-568 (1985); <em>Werner Indus., Inc. </em>v. <em>First State Ins. Co., </em>217 N.J. Super. 436, 444-445 (1987), further app. rev. granted, 108 N.J. 585 (1988); <em>Gladstone </em>v. <em>D.W. Ritter Co., </em>133 Misc.2d 922, 927-928 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Among the considerably greater number of cases from other jurisdictions which have held that the excess carrier did <em>not </em>slip into the shoes of insolvent primary insurers, some have focused on language in the excess policies which provided that reduction or exhaustion of the limits of the primary policy could occur solely by reason of \u201closses paid thereunder.\u201d Insol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>vency was, thus, impliedly excluded as a permissible ground for reduction in the primary insurance. See <em>Molina </em>v. <em>United States Fire Ins. Co, </em>574 F.2d 1176, 1178 (4th Cir. 1978); <em>Continental Marble &amp; Granite </em>v. <em>Canal Ins. Co., </em>785 F.2d 1258, 1259 (5th Cir. 1986); <em>Mission Natl. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Duke Transp. Co., </em>792 F.2d 550, 552-554 (5th Cir. 1986); <em>Steve D. Thompson Trucking, Inc. </em>v. <em>Twin City Fire Ins. Co., </em>832 F.2d 309, 310 (5th Cir. 1987); <em>Zurich Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>The Heil Co., </em>815 F.2d 1122, 1124-1126 (7th Cir. 1987); <em>Guaranty Natl. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Bayside Resort, Inc., </em>635 F. Supp. 1456, 1459 (D.V.I. 1986); <em>Prince Carpentry, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cosmopolitan Mut. Ins. Co., </em>124 Misc.2d 919, 930-931 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1984); <em>Value City, Inc. </em>v. <em>Integrity Ins. Co., </em>30 Ohio App. 3d 274, 277-278 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Other courts have considered as dispositive or weighty the premise that companies which write excess or umbrella insurance ought not be required to analyze the financial stability of primary insurers and that requiring the excess carriers to assume the burdens of insolvent primary coverage adds a risk not considered or assumed in the insurance marketplace. <em>Continental Marble &amp; Granite </em>v. <em>Canal Ins. Co., </em>785 F.2d at 1259; <em>Steve D. Thompson Trucking, Inc. </em>v. <em>Twin City Fire Ins. Co., </em>832 F.2d at 311; <em>Zurich Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>The Heil Co., </em>815 F.2d at 1126; <em>Wurth </em>v. <em>Ideal Mut. Ins. Co., </em>34 Ohio App. 3d 325, 328 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">1. <em>The Jefferson policy. </em>After stating that the insurance company agrees to indemnify the Tennis Club for liability incurred by reason of accidents which occur during the policy period, the Jefferson policy provides that Jefferson\u2019s liability shall attach only after the primary insurers \u201chave paid or have been held liable to pay the full amount of their respective ultimate net loss.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The phrase \u201cheld liable to pay,\u201d if not regarded as surplusage (there is no reason to do so, see <em>National Shawmut Bank </em>v. <em>Joy, </em>315 Mass. 457, 466 [1944]), posits an eventuality in which the insured, and hence the primary insurer, are liable but the insurer for some reason has not paid. The case of insol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>vency would be such an eventuality. At least the policy is susceptible of that interpretation. Applying the principle of the <em>Continental </em>and <em>Lincoln </em>cases (399 Mass. at 600-601 &amp; 608-612) that the ambiguity, if not fanciful, shall be resolved against the insurance company, we conclude that Jefferson is liable to the limits of its policy, beginning with the first dollar of the Tennis Club\u2019s liability, if any. It has not escaped our notice that the Jefferson policy presupposes primary insurance in force. See the last paragraph of Appendix A to this opinion. The same was true, however, of the policies in the <em>Continental </em>and <em>Lincoln </em>cases, and that language alone did not avail the insurance companies which issued them.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The insurance Jefferson sold was $200,000 of excess coverage above the scheduled primary insurance of $300,000. We do not think this translates, as the Tennis Club has argued, into responsibility for the aggregate of $500,000 in coverage. The limit of Jefferson\u2019s exposure is the $200,000 worth of insurance it sold. Moreover, the Tennis Club has not appealed from the judgment below and cannot secure a better judgment on appeal. <em>Goldman </em>v. <em>Kane, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 336, 342 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">2. <em>The Fireman\u2019s policy. </em>Fireman\u2019s policy provides that the company shall be liable for the excess over primary insurance or, as to \u201cany claim ... to which no primary policy applies,\u201d the excess over the greater of \u201cany other insurance available to the insured\u201d or the \u201cretained limits\u201d (i.e., the amount represented by the insured as its primary insurance) which \u201cshall be considered self insurance within the meaning of\u201d the policy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As appears to be the mode of insurance contracts, the language is at a high level of abstraction. There can be no plausible reading of the language just described, however, other than that Fireman\u2019s means to insure over the underlying insurance and, if for some reason that underlying insurance is not there, that is to be the responsibility of the policyholder, not the insurance company.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>In a subsequent provision, the Fireman\u2019s policy contemplates the possibility of \u201creduction or exhaustion of the applicable aggregate limit or limits of liability under said primary policy or policies solely by reason of losses paid thereunder on account of occurrences during this policy period . . . .\u2019\u2019In that event, the company agrees to pay the excess over the reduced limit, as if it were the primary insurer. The \u201coccurrences\u201d which may give rise to reduction or exhaustion of the underlying policies are defined in the Fireman\u2019s policy as an \u201caccident . . . which results in personal injury or property damage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Under <em>\u00a7 11 of </em>the conditions <em>set </em>forth in the Fireman\u2019s policy, the insured is required to maintain the primary policies in amounts not less than those stated at the inception of the Fireman\u2019s policy. If there is a change in the scope of the underlying policies, \u00a7 11 provides that the Fireman\u2019s policy shall apply \u201cin the same manner as though such primary policies and limits of liability . . . had been in effect, so maintained and unchanged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">In a variety of ways, therefore, the Fireman\u2019s policy states that it presupposes primary insurance being in force and that if it is not in force, the insured is responsible for the lower levels of damage, as if it were a self-insurer. The policy is unambiguous in that it insures against the reduction of the underlying policies only by reason of out-of-pocket payments for losses by lower level insurers. Our construction of the policy language is consistent with the interpretation of similar language in the policies considered in: <em>Molina </em>v. <em>United States Fire Ins. Co., </em>574 F.2d at 1178; <em>Steve D. Thompson Trucking, Inc. </em>v. <em>Twin City Fire Ins. Co., </em>832 F.2d at 310-311; <em>Mission Natl. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Duke Transp. Co., </em>792 F.2d at 551-553; <em>Zurich Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>The Heil Co., </em>815 F.2d at 1124-1125; <em>Guaranty Natl. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Bayside Resort, Inc., </em>635 F. Supp. at 1458-1459.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">The judgment shall be amended to declare that Jefferson Insurance Company of New Y ork is liable for the first $200,000 payable by Northmeadow Tennis Club, Inc., on account of claims arising out of the death of Deborah L.
