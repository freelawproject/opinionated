Typically, as in this case, the dispute concerns whether the railroad company acquired only an easement in the land over which its tracks once ran or a fee simple interest it can rightfully convey to others for nonrailroad uses. Determining the nature of its tenure requires, in the first instance, careful examination of the language in the original conveyance. If the intent of the parties is clear, that will control. If not, extrinsic evidence may be considered to the extent it informs that intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Here, the terms of the deed in question are too ambiguous to conclude with certainty whether the grantor and grantee, predecessors in interest of those now before this court, intended the railroad company take the property in fee simple or acquire only an easement. Resorting to extrinsic evidence of the grantor\u2019s conduct subsequent to the conveyance, we find sufficient indicia that in deeding the property it meant to dispose of its entire interest. Accordingly, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company had full legal title to convey to the City of Manhattan Beach, which thus has no obligation to compensate the real parties in interest through eminent domain proceedings, condemnation, or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">This action seeking to quiet title, and for inverse condemnation, ejectment, and damages, commenced almost a decade ago. The predicate facts, however, date back more than a century to 1887 when the Redondo Land Company (the RLC) acquired from Charles Silent approximately 4,500 acres of southern California property situated primarily in what is now the City of Manhattan Beach (the City). To finance the sale, Silent took back a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>substantial note secured by a mortgage. Shortly thereafter, in 1888, the RLC, predecessor in interest to all but two real parties in interest (the heirs),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> conveyed a portion of the property to the Redondo Beach Railway Company (the railway), predecessor in interest to the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company (Santa Fe). The current controversy concerns the nature of the interest passed by that conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">The deed memorializing the transaction between the parties provided in part that the RLC and Charles Silent \u201cfor and in consideration of the sum of one dollar\u201d \u201cremise[d], release[d] and quit-claim [ed]\u201d to the railway \u201cthe right of way for the construction, maintenance and operation of a Steam Railroad, upon[,] over and along the following tract and parcel of land, . . . and described as follows, to wit, Being a strip of land of the uniform width of 100 feet, 50 feet thereof being on each side of and parallel to the center line of location of The Redondo Division of the California Central Railway, over and through the lands of grantors . . . .\u201d The document then set forth a detailed metes and bounds description of a several-mile course meandering through what would become Manhattan Beach and portions of Hermosa Beach. The total acreage constituted \u201can area of 32.46 acres of land, more or less.\u201d The grantors reserved and excepted \u201ca space of 200 feet in length lying next adjacent to and midway between the ends of the side track now constructed upon said right of way and extending to the next adjacent boundary line of said right of way for the full length of said 200 feet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Certain conditions attached to \u201cthis grant\u201d: \u201cthat the side track now constructed upon said right of way shall be maintained and shall be used as a station to receive and discharge freight; that such convenient crossings, not less than four shall be made and maintained with sufficient cattle guards at such point on said right of way as may be necessary for the full use and enjoyment of the lands adjoining said right of way, and so as to give access to and from the lands on either side thereof; that such culverts shall be constructed and maintained as may be necessary for the free passage of water across the same, and so located that the lands adjacent to said right of way will not be flooded on account of the roadbed of said railroad forming an embankment. . . .\u201d Noncompliance with any of these conditions would result in a reversion to the grantors and their successors in interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">The deed concluded with a habendum clause: \u201cTo have and to hold all and singular the rights aforesaid unto [the railway] and its assigns and successors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>forever, subject however to and upon the terms and conditions aforesaid.\u201d Both the president of the RLC and Charles Silent signed as grantors.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">During the course of its existence over the next 15 years, the RLC entered into various transactions for the sale, option for sale, or partition of its remaining property, which will be discussed in greater detail as they become relevant. In 1897, the RLC, the railway, and one Parvin Wright, who held an option on 463 acres, signed an unrecorded indenture abrogating the reversionary conditions in the original deed as long as the railway maintained a station at Potencia, between Los Angeles and Redondo Beach. Unlike the earlier conditions, maintenance of the station did not include a reverter provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">In 1896, the stockholders initiated partition and distribution of property and other interests of the corporation. To effectuate the process, the RLC conveyed the remainder of its holdings to a trustee, who in turn distributed the land to the stockholders through deeds identifying each parcel by lot number. In 1901, the RLC also instituted a quiet title action to resolve issues of title concerning Parvin Wright\u2019s option and claims by heirs of former Spanish and Mexican grantees. By 1903, the RLC had concluded its business and formalized its corporate dissolution through judicial proceedings. The resulting order reflected a finding that \u201call of the property of said corporation has been disposed of.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The railway and its successors, the last of which was Santa Fe, continued operations until 1982, when all rail activity ceased. Santa Fe leased the property to the City in that year and eventually sold it in 1986. The strip now functions as a transportation corridor through the City with a median park and jogging path lying between two major north-south thoroughfares.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">In 1987, the heirs instituted this action against the City and Santa Fe by which they sought to exercise powers of termination allegedly created by the 1888 deed due to abandonment of rail services, to quiet title to the property, and to claim damages for inverse condemnation. The trial court trifurcated the proceedings, first determining the nature of the estate granted by the RLC in the original deed and reserving questions of heirship and damages. In the first phase, the court concluded the RLC had not conveyed a fee simple interest but only an easement, which terminated when Santa Fe discontinued railroad operations. It further found Santa Fe as well as the City liable to the heirs for inverse condemnation.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>The Court of Appeal summarily denied writ review. On petition for review by the City and Santa Fe, this court transferred the matter with directions to issue an alternative writ. The Court of Appeal upheld the trial court\u2019s findings as to both title and liability. With respect to title, the court agreed the terms of the deed itself adequately established the intent of the original parties to convey an easement only; it found relevant extrinsic evidence also supported that conclusion. On the question of Santa Fe\u2019s liability, the court reasoned it could be held responsible in damages under a park acquisition agreement entered into in 1986 by which it quitclaimed its interest to the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">We begin our analysis of the parties\u2019 legal claims with some of the basic principles of law governing review in these cases:</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">With deeds as any other contracts, \u201c[t]he primary object of all interpretation is to ascertain and carry out the intention of the parties. [Citations.] All the rules of interpretation must be considered and each given its proper weight, where necessary, in order to arrive at the true effect of the instrument. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Burnett </em>v. <em>Piercy </em>(1906) 149 Cal. 178, 189 [86 P. 603]; Civ. Code, \u00a7 1066; see Civ. Code, \u00a7 1635 et seq.; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1856 et seq.) \u201cExtrinsic evidence is \u2018admissible to interpret the instrument, but not to give it a meaning to which it is not susceptible\u2019 [citations], and it is the instrument itself that must be given effect. [Citations.] It is therefore solely a judicial function to interpret a written instrument unless the interpretation turns upon the credibility of extrinsic evidence. Accordingly, \u2018An appellate court is not bound by a construction of the contract based solely upon the terms of the written instrument without the aid of evidence [citations], where there is no conflict in the evidence [citations], or a determination has been made upon incompetent evidence [citation].\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Parsons </em>v. <em>Bristol Development Co. </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 861, 865-866 [44 Cal.Rptr. 767, 402 P.2d 839], fn. omitted.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We shall discuss other rules of construction as they become pertinent.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Beginning with an examination of the terms of the deed, the granting clause states the RLC and Charles Silent \u201cremise, release and quit-claim\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>the railway the property in question.  \u201cThe operative words used, \u2018release, remise and quitclaim\u2019 are the words commonly used in simple quitclaim deeds. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Estate of Rose </em>(1937) 23 Cal.App.2d 686, 688 [73 P.2d 1232].) \u201cA quitclaim deed transfers whatever present right or interest the grantor has in the property. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Westlake </em>v. <em>Silva </em>(1942) 49 Cal.App.2d 476, 478 [121 P.2d 872]; <em>Rosenthal </em>v. <em>Landau </em>(1949) 90 Cal.App.2d 310, 313 [202 P.2d 810]; see also 2 Miller &amp; Starr, Current Law of Cal. Real Estate (2d ed. 1989) \u00a7 6:12, pp. 503-505; Black\u2019s Law Dict. (4th ed. 1968) p. 1417, col. 1 [quitclaim \u201cintended to pass any title, interest, or claim which the grantor may have in the premises\u2019\u2019].) More specifically, \u201cit has been often decided by this court that a quitclaim deed conveys the absolute fee-simple title if the party executing it had such title [citations]; and therefore such deed does not imply any precedent interest or easement in the releasee, or any admission of the releasor to that effect.\u201d <em>(Spaulding </em>v. <em>Bradley </em>(1889) 79 Cal. 449, 456 [22 P. 47].) \u201cIn this State, from the earliest times, quitclaim deeds have been in every-day use for the purpose of transferring title to land, and have been considered as effectual for that purpose as deeds of bargain and sale.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>(Graff </em>v. <em>Middleton </em>(1872) 43 Cal. 341, 344.) Indeed, as early as 1854, this court recognized and held a quitclaim deed to effect a transfer of \u201call the right and title of the grantor.\u201d <em>(Sullivan </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(1854) 4 Cal. 291, 292; see <em>Wholey </em>v. <em>Cavanaugh </em>(1891) 88 Cal. 132, 135 [25 P. 1112]; <em>Rego </em>v. <em>Van Pelt </em>(1884) 65 Cal. 254, 256 [3 P. 867]; <em>Graff </em>v. <em>Middleton, supra, </em>43 Cal. at p. 344; see also <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Ballou </em>(1869) 37 Cal. 518, 521.)</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">The phrase \u201cremise, release and quit-claim\u201d in the granting clause is thus not consistent with an intent to convey to the railway only an easement: The RLC held the property in fee simple; and the choice of the quitclaim deed form, with its established legal import, substantially reflects an intention to convey title in its entirety.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (See <em>Estate of Rose, supra, </em>23 Cal.App.2d at p. 688; <em>MacFarland </em>v. <em>Walker </em>(1919) 40 Cal.App. 508, 511-512 [181 P. 248].) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>Resolution of the heirs\u2019 claims cannot rest on this factor alone, however. As noted above, \u201c[d]eeds are to be construed like any other contract and the intent of parties arrived at by a consideration of the whole instrument and not of detached clauses. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Whitcomb </em>v. <em>Worthing </em>(1916) 30 Cal.App. 629, 631 [159 P. 613]; <em>Parks </em>v. <em>Gates </em>(1921) 186 Cal. 151, 154 [199 P. 40].) Examining the remainder of the conveyance, we find other provisions support the opposite conclusion: the grantor intended to limit the conveyance to an easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">The most significant counterpoint is the deed\u2019s multiple references to \u201cright of way.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (See Civ. Code, \u00a7 801.) In <em>Highland Realty Co. </em>v. <em>City of San Rafael </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 669, 678 [298 P.2d 15], this court noted \u201cthe general rule . . . that \u2018in construing contracts and deeds for railroad rights of way such deeds are usually construed as giving a mere right of way, although the terms of the deed would be otherwise apt to convey a fee. [Citations.]\u201d\u2019<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (See also <em>Parks </em>v. <em>Gates, supra, </em>186 Cal. at p. 154.) This observation reflects the broad view of many jurisdictions \u201cthat when the granting clause of a deed declares the purpose of the grant to be a right of way for a railroad the deed passes an easement only, and not a fee with a restricted use, even though the deed is in the usual form to convey a fee title.\u201d <em>(Swan </em>v. <em>O\u2019Leary </em>(1950) 37 Wn.2d 533, 537 [225 P.2d 199, 201]; see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>generally, Annot., Deed to Railroad Company as Conveying Fee or Easement (1966) 6 A.L.R.3d 973, 1013-1024.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The parties thus appear to have drawn the terms of their deed to include two material but conflicting provisions, with \u201cremise, release and quit-claim\u201d reflecting an intent to convey a fee simple interest and references to \u201cright of way\u201d indicating an easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">Compounding the ambiguity, courts have also concluded \u201cthe term \u2018right of way,\u2019 when applied to railroads, canals, and similar instrumentalities, has no exact, well-defined meaning, but often is susceptible of a twofold signification. It is used indiscriminately to describe, not only the easement, or special and limited right to use another person\u2019s land, but as well the strip of land itself that is occupied for such use. This, at any rate, is the case when the term is used with respect to railroads. [Citations.]\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number><em>(Anderson </em>v. <em>Willson </em>(1920) 48 Cal.App. 289, 295 [191 P. 1016]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Thompson, supra, </em>43 Cal.2d at pp. 19-20; <em>Parks </em>v. <em>Gates, supra, </em>186 Cal. at p. 155; <em>Machado </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Transportation Co., supra, </em>233 Cal.App.3d at p. 354; <em>Concord &amp; Bay Point Land Co. </em>v. <em>City of Concord </em>(1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 289, 295 [280 Cal.Rptr. 623]; <em>City of Glendora </em>v. <em>Faus </em>(1957) 148 Cal.App.2d 920, 926 [307 P.2d 976]; <em>Ocean Shore Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Doelger </em>(1954) 127 Cal.App.2d 392, 399 [274 P.2d 23]; see generally, 5 Miller &amp; Starr, Current Law of Cal.

Code, \u00a7 1105; <em>City of Long Beach </em>v. <em>Marshall </em>(1938) 11 Cal.2d 609, 613 [82 P.2d 362].) This precept applies without distinction to quitclaim deeds (see <em>Carlson </em>v. <em>Lindauer </em>(1953) 119 Cal.App.2d 292, 306 [259 P.2d 925]; <em>MacFarland </em>v. <em>Walker, supra, </em>40 Cal.App. at p. 512) and supports the finding of a fee conveyance. Civil Code section 801 tends to favor a contrary finding: \u201cThe following land burdens, or servitudes upon land, may be attached to other land as incidents or appurtenances, and are then called easements: [H . . . [U . . . The right-of-way . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Other provisions generally sustain a fee interest. \u201cIf several parts of a grant are absolutely irreconcilable, the former part prevails.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1070.) The quitclaim deed form itself would seemingly constitute \u201cthe former part\u201d and thus assume primacy over subsequent inconsistent references to \u201cright of way.\u201d (See <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Tennent </em>(1872) 44 Cal. 253, 258.) With its dual meaning, \u201cright of way\u201d is also less definite than \u201cremise, release and quit-claim.\u201d (See Civ. Code, \u00a7 1067.) \u201cWhere there is an asserted modifying or limiting clause in a deed, if such clause be of doubtful import, the fee contemplated by the granting clause of the deed will not be cut down. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Litten </em>v. <em>Warren </em>(1936) 11 Cal.App.2d 635, 637 [54 P.2d 39]; <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Tennent, supra, </em>44 Cal. at p. 258.) The general rule also provides \u201c[t]hat doubtful clauses in the deed are to be construed most strongly against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>the grantor, and as favorably to the grantee as the language, construed in the light of the surrounding facts, will justify.\u201d <em>(Castro </em>v. <em>Tennent, supra, </em>44 Cal. at pp. 257-258; Civ.

(See <em>Machado </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Transportation Co., supra, </em>233 Cal.App.3d at pp. 353-354.)  In this effort, we bear in mind that \u201csince the language of each instrument is sui generis, no bright-line rules of construction are available to us to aid in this endeavor. \u2018Analysis of cases on this subject makes it abundantly clear that it is impossible to lay down an invariable and universal rule of construction.

This language in the nature of an appurtenance appears to limit the railway to a right of passage and exclude title to the land beneath. (See <em>Highland Realty Co. </em>v. <em>City of San Rafael, supra, </em>46 Cal.2d at p. 678.) Subsequently, however, the deed refers to \u201ca strip of <em>land' </em>100 feet in width and sets forth a detailed legal description in metes and bounds, which \u201ccontain[s] an area of 32.46 acres of <em>land, </em>more or less,\u201d according to its terms. (Italics added.) References to \u201cland,\u201d particularly in conjunction with precise and technical designation of the location, generally indicate an intention to transfer the entire estate not just a limited right to pass over the property.

(See <em>Machado </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Transportation Co., supra, </em>233 Cal.App.3d at pp. 359-360; <em>Concord &amp; Bay Point Land Co. </em>v. <em>City of Concord, supra, </em>229 Cal.App.3d at pp. 296-297; see also, <em>post, </em>at p. 248.)</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">The document in question does not refer to an easement. \u201cIn construing the instrument we cannot overlook the fact that if the grantors really intended to convey only an easement, they could have easily so expressed that purpose. [Citations.] [*]D Their failure to do so must be considered together with the presumption that a fee simple title passed (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1105) and the rule that a grant is to be interpreted in favor of the grantee. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1069).\u201d <em>(Basin Oil Co. </em>v. <em>City of Inglewood, supra, </em>125 Cal.App.2d at p. 666.) Nonetheless, the omission does not factor substantially in our equation since the parties possibly used \u201cright of way\u201d as an equivalent. By the same token, the deed does not contain any reference to a fee (cf. <em>ibid.); </em>but use of the quitclaim deed form may account for that.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Neither does the habendum clause shed particular light on our inquiry. Its terms are not inconsistent with the grant of a fee. (See <em>Concord &amp; Bay Point Land Co. </em>v. <em>City of Concord, supra, </em>229 Cal.App.3d at pp. 295-296; <em>Parks </em>v. <em>Gates, supra, </em>186 Cal. at p. 155.) But that conclusion somewhat begs the question in light of the qualification \u201csubject however to and upon the terms and conditions aforesaid.\u201d As we have discussed, the \u201cterms and conditions aforesaid\u201d can variously be construed as evidence of either a fee or an easement; none are dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Finally, we note Charles Silent, the mortgage holder, as well as the president and secretary of the RLC signed the deed. Although there are other possibilities, this fact suggests the parties attempted to effectuate a complete and unqualified transfer of all rights and title to the railway. (See, <em>ante, </em>flu 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Having canvassed the four comers of the deed, we end our search frustratingly little more informed of the parties\u2019 intention than when we began. Judging by the terms \u201cremise, release and quit-claim\u201d and \u201cright of way,\u201d the grantor appears to have intended at one and the same time to convey to the railway the entire fee estate and a limited interest confined to an easement for railroad purposes. The remainder of the language is equally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>ambiguous, both supporting and contradicting one or the other conclusion. We thus turn to extrinsic evidence in the hope of enlightenment.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">\u201cIt is well settled that a deed indefinite in its terms may be made certain by the conduct of the parties acting under it.

In this regard, \u201c[t]he test of admissibility of extrinsic evidence to explain the meaning of a written instrument is not whether it appears to the court to be plain and unambiguous on its face, but whether the offered evidence is relevant to prove a meaning to which the language of the instrument is reasonably susceptible. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Pacific Gas &amp; E. Co. </em>v. <em>G. W.

Unlike the terms of the 1888 conveyance itself, these references to the railway\u2019s interest are virtually without qualification consistent with an intention to transfer the property in fee simple.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">To begin, in 1897 the grantor and the grantee\u2019s successor along with Parvin Wright entered into an unrecorded indenture modifying the reversionary conditions of railroad operations. In reference to the 1888 conveyance, the indenture states the earlier \u201cdeed shall remain a <em>grant </em>as therein expressed.\u201d (Italics added.) This language suggests and comports with the conclusion the RLC considered full title had passed by \u201cgrant.\u201d (Cf. <em>Schlageter </em>v. <em>Cutting, supra, </em>116 Cal.App. at p. 498.)</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">Commencing in 1896, the RLC initiated various transactions eventually to divest itself of its holdings by partition. These included corporate resolutions in 1896 and 1897, an 1897 shareholder agreement, and an 1897 trust deed. Significantly, among those involved in executing, and presumably preparing, these documents was Hugh W. Vail, who as secretary of the RLC had signed the 1888 conveyance and would have been knowledgeable as to the grantor\u2019s intent at that time. In all instances, the description \u201cexcepted\u201d \u201cthat certain right of way . . . granted\u201d to the railway as well as parcels of land deeded to Blanton Duncan and the option given Parvin Wright, i.e., all property subject to claim by others. Had the RLC conveyed only an easement to the railway, that interest would simply have passed as an appurtenance with any subsequent transfer. (See <em>Moylan </em>v. <em>Dykes </em>(1986) 181 Cal.App.3d 561, 568 [226 Cal.Rptr. 673].)</p>\n<p id=\"b281-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>The partition also necessitated a quiet title action in 1901 from which the RLC expressly excepted the railway\u2019s property. This proceeding is significant in two respects: First, the exception of the railway\u2019s property lying within the area at issue in the quiet title action indicates the RLC no longer considered it held any interest therein. If it had conveyed only an easement to the railway, it would most likely have needed and wanted to settle ownership of the underlying fee at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">Second, the typewritten complaint \u201cexcept[s] from the lands\u201d subject to the action \u201cthe strip of land\u201d conveyed to the railway in 1888 with the metes and bounds description taken from the earlier deed. Beneath that description, the RLC\u2019s president, who verified the pleading, interlineated in his own hand \u201cand being the lands conveyed to the [railway] by [the 1888 deed].\u201d Moreover, not only does the complaint contain these specific references to \u201cland,\u201d at no point does it identify the railway\u2019s holding as a \u201cright of way.\u201d These representations were made by the RLC in a legal proceeding instigated to resolve title to relevant portions of its holdings; and the judgment incorporates them verbatim. As such, they stand as virtually incontrovertible evidence the grantor intended the 1888 deed to convey the property to the railway in fee simple. (Cf. <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Willson, supra, </em>48 Cal.App. at p. 295.)</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Of equal significance, when the RLC dissolved as a corporation in 1903, the decree of dissolution reflected \u201cthat all of the property of said corporation has been disposed of.\u201d Taking this language at face value, we must perforce find the railway acquired a fee, not merely an easement. The strip of land at issue had been \u201cexcepted\u201d from the distribution to shareholders under the terms of the partition and hence had not passed to them in any form. The RLC had not otherwise divested itself of the interest but by deed to the railway in 1888. Therefore, it could not have concluded its corporate business with this representation unless it believed it had originally conveyed full title to the property by that transaction. Elsewise, we would have to conclude the RLC intended, contrary to the terms of the decree and after it ceased to exist as a corporate entity, to retain a fee estate in a narrow strip of land subject to an easement the duration of which no one could predict.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">If not unreasonable, such a conclusion is at least implausible. (Cf. <em>Merchant v. Grant </em>(1915) 26 Cal.App. 485, 490 [147 P. 484] [\u201cunreasonable\u201d to hold grantors intended to retain ownership of land \u201cwhich could have been of no possible use to them\u201d].) The record contains no evidence the RLC, as a land development company, intended to maintain a continuing ownership <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>interest it could reassert in the event railroad operations ceased.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (Cf. <em>Tamalpais etc. Co. </em>v. <em>N. W. Pac. R. R. Co., supra, </em>73 Cal.App.2d 917.) Indeed, the purpose of the enterprise appears quite to the contrary since partition and distribution activities began within a decade after it purchased the 4,500-acre tract, and the corporation dissolved within less than 2 decades.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">Construing the conveyance as a fee also best effectuates the likely intent of the parties considering the broader context in which the transaction took place: \u201cThis was before automobiles were in common use and Manhattan Beach, strange as this now seems, was quite inaccessible to Los Angeles, which had barely started its phenomenal growth. Until 1904, when the Pacific Electric Railroad was completed, the only means of transportation to Manhattan Beach was by the Santa Fe Railroad. Excursion parties were organized for prospective purchasers, and they were taken to the property by train.\u201d <em>(Manhattan Beach </em>v. <em>Cortelyou </em>(1938) 10 Cal.2d 653, 664 [76 P.2d 483].) The RLC\u2019s business was to sell property in this \u201cquite inaccessible\u201d location; only the presence of the railway could make such a venture economically feasible much less viable. Granting the railway full title rather than a limited interest would have been at least as consistent, if not more so, with achieving this goal. (Cf. <em>United Inv. Co. </em>v. <em>Los Angeles etc. Ry. Co. </em>(1909) 10 Cal.App. 175,184 [101 P. 543] [\u201cenhancement of [land] values in the vicinity\u201d due to railroad\u2019s agreed construction of road sufficient consideration for conveyance of fee interest to right-of-way].)</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">We are unpersuaded the extrinsic evidence cited by the heirs supports their position. In an 1896 deed between the RLC and Duncan Blanton, the description of the property conveyed includes a portion of the strip previously deeded to the railway. On this basis, the heirs argue the RLC considered it still retained the fee to the right-of-way. Neither the record nor logic sustains this conclusion. It would be unreasonable to find the RLC intended to retain full title to a narrow strip of land, which it then bisected by conveying a small portion in fee to Duncan Blanton but none to any others, not even the RLC shareholders in partition. More significantly, the Blanton deed itself expressly \u201creserv[es] therefrom 100 feet in width right of way of [the railway].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>The heirs also rely on expert testimony that the partition map did not include acreage or an appraisal value for the right-of-way in parcels transferred to the shareholders. This omission is hardly conclusive of the RLC\u2019s interest. At best, it indicates the property was not part of the distribution proceedings because some other party owned it; but that fact does not assist in identifying the other owner. To the extent this consideration has any relevance to our inquiry, it suggests a contrary conclusion to that drawn by the heirs. Since the RLC was in the process of partitioning and distributing its remaining holdings to the shareholders, it would be illogical to retain any interest, much less the fee to a narrow strip of meandering property subject to an easement not likely to be abandoned by the railway in the foreseeable future. This evidence is also consistent with the exception of the railway\u2019s right-of-way in other partition documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">Finally, the heirs contend Santa Fe should be bound by representations during property tax assessment litigation in 1954 and Interstate Commerce Commission abandonment hearings in 1982 that it only owned an easement. As the Court of Appeal in <em>Concord &amp; Bay Point Land Co. </em>v. <em>City of Concord, supra, </em>229 Cal.App.3d at page 296, observed, however, \u201ca legal conclusion drawn [decades later] is not compelling evidence of what was intended by a grant made [at the turn of the century]\u201d particularly since the original grantor took no part in the subsequent proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">\u201cI, John of Gaunt Do give and do grant To Sir John Burgoyne And the heirs of his loin Both Sutton and Potton Till the world goes rotten.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">The document before us lacks not only such brevity but more importantly such clarity of intent. Fortunately, the grantor\u2019s actions speak to us more loudly over the decades than its words. The extrinsic evidence of subsequent transactions unambiguously reflects the RLC considered it had already conveyed to the railway full title to the right-of-way strip of land in 1888 and had not intended to transfer a lesser estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">As should be clear from the discussion, we do not find the instant deed a paradigm conveyance but rather to the contrary, requiring us to ferret out the parties\u2019 intentions by less direct and less preferable considerations. In reaching our conclusion, we emphasize that the peculiar facts of this case dictate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>the narrow, perhaps unique, basis of our holding. (Cf. <em>Machado </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Transportation Co., supra, </em>233 Cal.App.3d at p. 353 [\u201cthe language of each instrument is sui generis\u201d].) Further, we reaffirm the importance of careful drafting to insure property transactions consistent with the parties intended and desired result. The court\u2019s only function and concern should be to effectuate their manifest intent; for, as we have reiterated, that must control.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The judgment of the Court of Appeal is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Lucas, C.

Apparently, Farquhar and Johnson instigated the litigation on behalf of the heirs claiming the cessation of railroad operations terminated any further interest in the property because the railway had acquired only an easement limited to that use and purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b271-8\">Apparently, none of the parties to the present litigation were aware of this dissolution proceeding until shortly before oral argument in the Court of Appeal.

In this case, \u201cthere is no conflict in the. . . evidence\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 866); therefore, the trial court did not resolve any disputed facts or have occasion to draw inferences therefrom.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b273-5\">As with the use of \u201cquitclaim,\u201d reference to \u201cremise\u201d and \u201crelease\u201d generally signifies a relinquishment of all interest held by the grantor.

(See Civ. Code, \u00a7 1113.) However, on this point a different explanation appears equally plausible: At the time of the transaction, Civil Code section 1624 did not yet require a written recitation, in the deed or otherwise, by which the purchaser of real property agreed to assume an indebtedness secured by a mortgage. (See Civ. Code, \u00a7 1624, subd. (f), added by Stats. 1937, ch. 316, \u00a7 2, p. 695.) Instead, assumption of such an obligation \u201cmay [then] be made orally or in a separate instrument; it may be implied from the transaction of the parties, or it may be shown by the circumstances under which the purchase was made, as well as the language used in the agreement.\u201d <em>(Hopkins </em>v. <em>Warner </em>(1895) 109 Cal. 133, 138 [41 P. 868]; <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Robertson </em>(1918) 177 Cal. 434, 438-439 [170 P. 1129]; <em>Hibernia Sav. etc. Soc. </em>v. <em>Dickinson </em>(1914) 167 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>Cal. 616, 621-624 [140 P. 265].) In this case, \u201cthe transaction of the parties\u201d and \u201cthe circumstance under which the purchase was made\u201d included having Charles Silent sign as a grantor, thereby reflecting his implicit agreement to forbear further enforcement of his mortgagee interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b274-9\">The heirs emphasize this language and cite cases from other jurisdictions for the proposition the quitclaim of a \u201cright of way\u201d conveys only an easement. These out-of-state authorities bear little, if any, relevance to our inquiry, which must parse every provision in search of intent including the quitclaim deed form itself. Moreover, one may readily note opinions from jurisdictions holding a quitclaim conveyed a fee interest under similar language. (See, e.g., <em>Arkansas Improvement Co. </em>v. <em>Kansas City So. Ry. Co. </em>(1938) 189 La. 921 [181 So. 445]; see also, <em>post, </em>fn. 8.) In the final analysis, we must remain focused upon this particular conveyance, considering all the terms chosen by these parties, as evidence of their intent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b274-10\"><em>Highland Realty Co. </em>v. <em>City of San Rafael, supra, </em>is distinguishable principally because in that case the deed was given to settle a pending condemnation action in which the railroad could have acquired an easement only. The deed mirrored the language of the eminent domain complaint as well as a court order authorizing the railroad to take possession of the right of way. Not surprisingly under the circumstances, this court concluded the conveyance transferred a limited interest, i.e., \u201cexactly that which the railroad sought\u201d in condemnation. (46 Cal.2d at p. 676.) In the context of this case, it is thus unnecessary to assess whether it remains the \u201cgeneral rule\u201d that the grant of a railroad right-of-way conveys only an easement. (But see <em>Machado </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Transportation Co. </em>(1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 347, 355-356 [284 Cal.Rptr. 560].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b275-5\">In his dissent, Justice Mosk cites Annotation, Deed to Railroad Company as Conveying Fee or Easement (1941) 132 A.L.R. 142 as well as numerous decisions from other jurisdictions in support of various points of his argument that the deed conveyed an easement only. In their specifics, most out-of-state cases are of marginal relevance to this grantor\u2019s intent because each arises from a particular matrix of facts, which generates its own individual rationale. Some also depend upon policy or other considerations not pertinent to our evaluation. For example, some states expressly regulate property holdings by railroads. (See, e.g., <em>City of Oakland </em>v. <em>Schenck </em>(1925) 197 Cal. 456, 466 [241 P. 545] [by statute railroads in Illinois may not hold land as ordinary owner]; <em>East Alabama Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Doe </em>(1885) 114 U.S. 340, 352 [29 L.Ed. 136, 140, 5 S.Ct. 869] [policy derived from Alabama Constitution requiring \u201cjust compensation\u201d limits railroads to \u201conly a right to use for its purposes\u201d and not absolute title]; <em>Ross, Inc. </em>v. <em>Legler </em>(1964) 245 Ind. 655 [199 N.E.2d 346, 348] [policy considerations do not favor permitting railroads to acquire rights of way in fee simple]; <em>Abercrombie </em>v. <em>Simmons </em>(1905) 71 Kan. 538 [81 Pac. 208, 210] [legislative restrictions on scope of property interests acquired by railroads]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Union Electric Co. of Missouri </em>(1941) 347 Mo. 690, 696-697 [148 S.W.2d 503, 505-506] [statute permitting street railway company to acquire right-of-way by grant did not include power to acquire fee].) By contrast in California, although the law contains some statutes expressly governing certain railroad activities (see Pub. Util. Code, \u00a7 7503 et seq.), it has never circumscribed the nature of the property interests they may acquire. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 7526; see <em>Midstate Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Ocean Shore R. R. Co. </em>(1928) 93 Cal.App. 704, 707 [270 P. 216]; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Thompson </em>(1954) 43 Cal.2d 13, 19 [271 P.2d 507].)</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">More to the point, other out-of-state opinions, in their own particulars, support the determination the railway obtained a fee estate. However, their citation would simply provoke an endless and ultimately inconclusive volley of decisional \u201cauthority\u201d purportedly vindicating each conclusion. We thus agree with the response of the Washington Supreme Court in <em>Swan </em>v. <em>O\u2019Leary, supra, </em>37 Wn.2d at page 535 [225 P.2d at page 200]: \u201cThe parties have cited and analyzed many cases, and have referred us to the annotation in 132 A.L.R. 142.

About the only common ground that can be found is that the intention of the parties to the conveyance is of paramount importance and must ultimately prevail in a given case.\u201d (See, e.g., <em>Parks </em>v. <em>Gates, supra, </em>186 Cal. at pp. 154-155.)

Their fourth amended complaint alleged causes of action to quiet title, for inverse condemnation and ejectment and damages. Both the City and Santa Fe answered. [&lt;]D The superior court trifurcated the issues of liability, heir-ship and damages. On December 23, 1992, the court issued its statement of decision on liability. It found that the right-of-way acquired by Santa Fe\u2019s predecessor via the 1888 deed was an easement; that Santa Fe\u2019s interest in the easement ceased upon its abandonment of the railway line; that the City\u2019s and Santa Fe\u2019s conduct with respect to [an agreement to sell the right of way] constituted a taking by inverse condemnation for which they were jointly liable; and real parties had no interest in that portion of the right of way extending into Hermosa Beach, such property having been conveyed in fee to Blanton Duncan by the [Redondo Land Company].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">The Court of Appeal further stated, \u201c[b]oth the City and Santa Fe filed petitions for writ challenging the trial court\u2019s decision. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">Interpretation of a deed ordinarily is a question of law that we undertake de novo. <em>(Faus </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 350, 360 [62 Cal.Rptr. 193, 431 P.2d 849].)</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">The trial court found that \u201c[t]he \u2018right of way\u2019 conveyed to the Redondo Beach Railway Company in the 1888 deed constituted an easement.\u201d It was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-11\">\u201cWhen a contract is reduced to writing, the intention of the parties is to be ascertained <em>from the writing alone, </em>if possible . . . .\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1639, italics added.) <em>\u201cThe language of a contract is to govern its interpretation, </em>if the language is clear and explicit, and does not involve an absurdity.\u201d <em>{Id.., </em>\u00a7 1638, italics added.) \u201cThe cardinal requirement in the construction of deeds and other contracts is that the intention of the parties <em>as gathered from the four corners of the instrument </em>must govern.\u201d <em>(Machado </em>v. <em>Southern </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number><em>Pacific Transportation Co. </em>(1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 347, 352 [284 Cal.Rptr. 560], italics added.) The foregoing rules are crucially important in the case of a recorded deed, for it provides public notice that successors in interest and innocent third parties may need to rely on for centuries. For that reason, whatever the parties may have intended, it is the language used in the resulting conveyance that must govern \u201cif possible . . . .\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1639.)</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">Hence, if the language of a conveyance unambiguously states the nature of the interest conveyed, there is no need to turn to extrinsic evidence bearing on that question. <em>(Baker </em>v. <em>Ramirez </em>(1987) 190 Cal.App.3d 1123, 1132 [235 Cal.Rptr. 857]; cf. <em>Pacific Gas &amp; E. Co. </em>v. <em>G. W. Thomas Drayage etc. Co. </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 33 [69 Cal.Rptr. 561, 442 P.2d 641, 40 A.L.R.3d 1373].) In fact it is highly undesirable to do so, because considering extrinsic evidence undermines the public\u2019s ability to rely on recorded notice of interests in land. Considering such evidence must be reserved for those instances in which \u201capplication of <em>pertinent rules of interpretation </em>to the face of the instrument leaves it <em>genuinely uncertain </em>which of two or more meanings is the proper meaning.\u201d <em>(Siegel </em>v. <em>Hackler </em>(1957) 181 Kan. 316, 319 [310 P.2d 914, 917], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">It has been said that \u201c[w]ords ... do not have absolute and constant referents\u201d <em>(Pacific Gas &amp; E. Co. </em>v. <em>G. W. Thomas Drayage etc. Co., supra, </em>69 Cal.2d at p. 38), but that is probably least true of the venerable terms of art describing interests in land. So although we must read the deed with an understanding of what its terms meant to drafters of railroad conveyances in 1888 (see <em>Smiley </em>v. <em>Citibank </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 138, 150, 151-153 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 441, 900 P.2d 690] [definition of term must be inferred from context of statute\u2019s enactment in 1864]), we do so aware of the ancient pedigree of such terms as \u201cright of way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">When we adhere to the foregoing principles, it becomes plain on independent review that the 1888 deed conveyed an easement and that there is no need to consider extrinsic evidence to divine the meaning of the words therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">The granting clause conveys an interest in land consisting of a \u201cright of way\u201d to build a railroad. For $1 the grantors did \u201cremise, release and quit-claim ... the right of way for the construction, maintenance and operation of a Steam Railroad, upon over and along [a] tract and parcel of land . . . over and through the lands of grantors . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">The foregoing language gave the railroad a servitude on land (Civ. Code, \u00a7 801) rather than an estate in it <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 761). It was universally understood at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>the time that such language conveyed only a right of way\u2014i.e., an easement <em>{id., </em>\u00a7 801, subd. 4). Indeed, a railroad law treatise relied on similar uses of language in advising practitioners on how to write a deed conveying an easement as opposed to fee simple title. When drafting an \u201cOrdinary Deed to Railroad Company, passing a Fee Simple\u201d (Baldwin, American Railroad Law (1904) p. 609), the text should \u201cgrant, bargain, sell and confirm unto the . . . Railroad ... a certain parcel of land . . . described as follows . . . .\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 610.) To instead convey \u201conly a Right of Way\u201d <em>{ibid.), </em>the drafter is instructed to \u201c[i]nsert in [the previously quoted text] in the granting clause, just before the description of the land conveyed, \u2018a right of way for railroad purposes over and upon,\u2019 and add to the <em>habendum </em>clause, \u2018for use only for railroad purposes.\u2019 \u201d <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">As the majority\u2019s analysis may fairly be read to acknowledge, a conveyance of a \u201cright of way\u201d \u201cover\u201d the grantor\u2019s land is a conveyance of an easement. This must be so, because the language shows that the land company conveyed an appurtenant use to the railroad. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 801 [\u201cright[s]-of-way\u201d \u201cmay be attached to other land as incidents or appurtenances, and are then called easements\u201d]; see <em>Corea </em>v. <em>Higuera </em>(1908) 153 Cal. 451, 454-456 [95 P. 882].) After all, \u201cland cannot be appurtenant to land\u201d; only a \u201cthing incorporeal\u201d can be. <em>(Harris </em>v. <em>Elliott </em>(1836) 35 U.S. (10 Pet.) 25, 54 [9 L.Ed. 333, 344].) Hence the undeviating body of California law explaining that language of this type conveys an easement. <em>(Highland Realty Co. </em>v. <em>City of San Rafael </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 669, 676 [298 P.2d 15] <em>(Highland) </em>[grant of \u201c \u2018right of way for the construction and use of said Railroad upon, over, and along a strip of land . . . described as follows . . .\u2019\u201d \u201cconveyed ... an easement, and nothing more\u201d]; <em>Ocean Shore Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Doelger </em>(1954) 127 Cal.App.2d 392, 394, 399-400 [274 P.2d 23] [\u201cplaintiff was granted \u2018a surface right of way, for railroad purposes only, over\u2019 [a] 60-foot strip . . . upon certain conditions therein expressed\u201d; easement conveyed]; <em>Moakley </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Pacific Ry.

(1944) 205 La. 164 [17 So.2d 21] [holding easement conveyed].)</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">Finally, the provision of the 1888 deed that the right-of-way was to be used for \u201ca Steam Railroad\u201d supports the conclusion that it transferred an easement. <em>(Highland, supra, </em>46 Cal.2d 669, 676 [ \u201c \u2018for the construction and use of said Railroad\u2019 \u201d]; <em>Keokuk County </em>v. <em>Reinier </em>(1939) 227 Iowa 499 [288 N.W. 676, 677, 678] [grant \u201c \u2018for all purposes incident and necessary to the construction and operation of a railroad\u2019 \u201d conveyed right-of-way rather than fee]; <em>Right of Way Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Gladys City Oil, Gas &amp; Mfg. Co., supra, </em>157 S.W. 737, 738 [\u201c \u2018 \u201cfor the purpose of constructing, operating and maintaining its railroad\u2019\u201d\u201d]; <em>Fitchburg R. Co. </em>v. <em>Frost </em>(1888) 147 Mass. 118 [16 N.E. 773, 775] [\u201c \u2018for railroad purposes only\u2019 \u201d; easement conveyed]; see also Baldwin, American Railroad Law, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>p. 610 [drafter should \u201cadd to the <em>habendum </em>clause, \u2018for use only for railroad purposes\u2019 \u201d].) Naturally, language of limitation can also reveal that a defeasible fee was conveyed. <em>(Epworth Assembly </em>v. <em>Ludington &amp; N. Ry. </em>(1926) 236 Mich. 565 [211 N.W. 99, 102] [deeds for \u201c \u2018railroad purposes\u2019 \u201d; but \u201c[i]n neither deed is the land conveyed for a right of way\u201d].) Such is not the case here, however: a \u201cright of way\u201d was conveyed \u201cfor ... a Steam Railroad . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">So far I believe that the majority and I largely agree. They lead themselves astray only when they begin to place undue emphasis on certain other language in the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">First, they conclude that because the term \u201cquit-claim\u201d appears in the indenture, a rule of construction supports the view that fee title was conveyed. What they fail to understand, however, is that any interest in land that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>can be conveyed by deed is conveyable by quitclaim deed. This includes an easement. <em>(Westlake </em>v. <em>Silva </em>(1942) 49 Cal.App.2d 476, 478-479 [121 P.2d 872].) It even includes a reversionary interest such as a right to recover possession on breach of condition subsequent. <em>(Thornton </em>v. <em>Middletown E. Corp. </em>(1937) 21 Cal.App.2d 707, 708-710 [70 P.2d 234]; see Civ. Code, \u00a7 1046.)</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">It is true that the grantors in <em>Westlake </em>held no more than an easement. But cases construing quitclaim deeds by the apparent or stated holder of fee title as conveying an easement to a railroad are many. <em>(Estate of Rockafellow </em>v. <em>Lihs </em>(Iowa Ct.App. 1992) 494 N.W.2d 734, 735-736; <em>Veach </em>v. <em>Culp </em>(1979) 92 Wn.2d 570 [599 P.2d 526, 527-528]; <em>Vandalia R. Co. </em>v. <em>Topping </em>(1916) 62 Ind.App. 657 [113 N.E. 421, 422-424] [construing statute]; <em>Cincinnati, H. &amp; D. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Wachter </em>(1904) 70 Ohio St. 113 [70 N.E. 974, 975]; <em>Cincinnati, I., St. L. &amp; C. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Geisel, supra, </em>21 N.E. 470.) A somewhat standardized form appears to have been used for such conveyances.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Indeed, as plaintiffs explain with regard to defendants herein, the majority simply \u201cconfuse the <em>form </em>of the conveyance with the <em>interest </em>being conveyed.\u201d The term \u201cquitclaim\u201d has nothing to do with the latter. It has been stated that \u201c[a] quitclaim deed transfers whatever present right or interest the grantor has in the property.\u201d <em>(Westlake </em>v. <em>Silva, supra, </em>49 Cal.App.2d at p. 478.) But the term \u201cwhatever,\u201d with its connotation of uncertainty, is the key to understanding such declarations. If the vendor simply wishes to sell an interest in land \u201cas is,\u201d i.e., without right of possession by the grantee, warranty of title, or other covenants implied in certain grant deeds, a quitclaim deed is the proper instrument. (See 2 Miller &amp; Starr, Current Law of Cal. Real Estate (2d ed. 1989) \u00a7 6:5, pp. 493-494; <em>id., </em>\u00a7 6:12, p. 504.) The grantor may not even know what interest he or she has (see 2 Miller &amp; Starr, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>\u00a7 6:12, p. 504), but may wish to divest himself or herself of it in exchange for some benefit or to avoid some detriment\u2014e.g., in exchange for a nearby railroad, or to avoid being a defendant in a quiet title suit\u2014 without warranting title or making other assurances. If so, then a quitclaim deed is the device used. If \u201cit has been often decided by this court that a quitclaim deed conveys the absolute fee-simple title if the party executing it had such title\u201d <em>(Spaulding </em>v. <em>Bradley </em>(1889) 79 Cal. 449, 456 [22 P. 47]), that is likely so because the grantor wished to eliminate his or her entire estate or interest, whatever it might be, without \u201cmakfing any] assurance to the grantee that he or she actually has good title to, or even any interest at all in, the property . . . .\u201d (6A Powell on Real Property (1995 ed.) ^ 897[1] [b], p. 81A-29.) Here, in notable contrast, the face of the deed shows unequivocally that only a right-of-way was conveyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Second, the majority make too much of the use of \u201cland\u201d in the deed. That instrument describes the right-of-way as \u201ca strip of land of the uniform width <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>of 100 feet\u201d and as \u201ccontaining an area of 32.46 acres of land, more or less.\u201d When the deed is read as a whole, it is clear that these definitional references are inconsequential. The right-of-way <em>is </em>a strip of land\u2014it does not float in the air. The fact that an easement that consists of a burden on land is described in units of land measure does not transform it into a fee, as an appellate decision of this state has implicitly recognized. In <em>Moakley </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Pacific Ry. Co., supra, </em>139 Cal.App. 421, a right-of-way consisting of \u201c \u2018a strip of land 35 feet in width . . . containing 0.67 of an acre of land\u2019 \u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 422) was conveyed. The conveyance also provided that \u201c \u2018said right of way and land shall immediately . . . revert\u2019 \u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 423) to the grantors and their heirs under certain conditions. <em>Moakley </em>found only the last-quoted reference to \u201cland\u201d controversial on the question whether fee title or an easement was conveyed <em>(id. </em>at p. 423), and correctly concluded that an easement was created <em>(id. </em>at p. 425).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Given the wealth of law explaining the meaning of the deed\u2019s repeated references to a right-of-way and its language of appurtenance, it cannot be said that \u201capplication of pertinent rules of interpretation to the face of the instrument leaves it <em>genuinely uncertain </em>which of two or more meanings is the proper meaning.\u201d <em>(Siegel </em>v. <em>Hackler, supra, </em>310 P.2d 914, 917, italics added.) Neither the quitclaim nature of the conveyance nor its mentions of \u201cland\u201d create so great an ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Other observations made by the majority require only brief comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The majority observe that the term \u201cright of way\u201d may refer to land itself rather than the use of land. That is true <em>(Machado </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Transportation Co., supra, </em>233 Cal.App.3d 347, 354), but it is beside the point. In the 1888 deed no land was conveyed, but only a right-of-way for a railroad. That is the crucial distinction. \u201cThere is a vast difference between a grant for purposes of \u2018right of way\u2019 for a road and a grant of land \u2018to be used for a road.\u2019 The latter grant may be entirely consistent with the conveyance of a fee-simple title . . . , but the grant of land as a right of way recognizes nothing but an easement.\u201d <em>(Parks </em>v. <em>Gates </em>(1921) 186 Cal. 151, 155 [199 P. 40].)</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">The majority further note that the right-of-way is given a precise legal description and its acreage is also described. Relying on <em>Moakley </em>v. <em>Blog, supra, </em>90 Cal.App. 96, they conclude that when a deed includes a legal description of this type, it is evidence that a fee was conveyed. But <em>Moakley </em>is properly read as deciding that a fee was conveyed because the deed recited that the grantors conveyed to the railroad \u201c \u2018all that certain lot, piece or parcel of land . . . bounded and particularly described as follows . . . .\u2019\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number><em>(Ibid.) </em>The salient observation to be made about the 1888 deed\u2019s legal description and acreage of the right-of-way is that it describes not \u201c \u2018that certain lot, piece or parcel of land\u2019 \u201d <em>{ibid.), </em>but instead the land \u201cupon over and along\u201d which the right-of-way extends. It appears not to have been unusual to describe the land across which an railroad easement extends, and that is what occurred here. <em>(Moakley </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Pacific Ry. Co., supra, </em>139 Cal.App. 421, 422, 425 [deed conveyed \u201c \u2018a right of way for railroad purposes over and along all that certain lot, piece or parcel of land . . . bounded and particularly described as follows, to wit: a strip of land 35 feet in width the center line of which is described as follows: . . . containing 0.67 of an acre of land\u2019 easement created]; <em>El Dorado &amp; Wessen Railway Company </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1961) 233 Ark. 298 [344 S.W.2d 343, 344, 345] [conveying \u201c \u2018strip of land . . . over and upon the following described land [five 40-acre tracts are described]\u2019 \u201d created easement]; <em>Rock Island, A. &amp; L. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Gournay, supra, </em>17 So.2d 8, 10 [conveying \u201c \u2018strip of land . . . over and upon the following described land ....[*][] [legal description] . . . said right of way hereby conveyed containing 3.81 acres\u2019 \u201d created easement (italics deleted)]; <em>Sherman </em>v. <em>Petroleum Exploration </em>(Ky.Ct.App. 1939) 280 Ky. 105 [132 S.W.2d 768, 770, 772, 132 A.L.R. 137] [conveying \u201c \u2018strip, tract or parcel of land for railroad right of way\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018containing [2.2] acres, more or less\u2019 \u2019\u2019 created easement].)</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">The majority urge that certain language of reservation in the 1888 deed supports the view that fee title was conveyed. Their discussion, however, is incomplete. The deed both \u201creserve[s]\u201d and \u201cexcept[s] from the operation of this conveyance\u201d \u201ca space\u201d \u201cfor a ware-house and ware-house storage purposes. . . .\u201d \u201cException\u201d and \u201creservation\u201d mean entirely different things, \u201cthough the terms are often used promiscuously\u201d <em>(Lange </em>v. <em>Waters </em>(1909) 156 Cal. 142, 146 [103 P. 889]): an exception limits the extent of the interest or estate conveyed, keeping the whole prior estate or interest in the grantor, whereas a reservation creates a new, lesser interest in a grantor conveying fee title. (See 5 Miller &amp; Starr, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>Easements \u00a7 15:18, pp. 444-445; see also <em>Golden West Baseball Co. </em>v. <em>City of Anaheim </em>(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 11, 38 [31 Cal.Rptr.2d 378].) \u201cAn exception is always of some part of the estate not granted at all. A reservation is always of something taken back out of that which is clearly granted.\u201d <em>(Sears </em>v. <em>Ackerman </em>(1903) 138 Cal. 583, 586 [72 P. 171].) Thus it was inartful drafting to both \u201creserve\u201d and \u201cexcept\" some land from the right of way. It is practical, however, to conclude that the parties intended to except from the right-of-way land for a warehouse, so that the land company would keep fee title to it unencumbered by any servitude. In other words, they merely limited the size of the easement to a very slight extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">The majority also suggest that the deed\u2019s reverter clause is evidence that a fee was conveyed. That is implausible.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>An easement may be conveyed subject to conditions subsequent and extinguished if they occur. <em>(Lincoln </em>v. <em>Narom Development Co. </em>(1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 619, 622-623 [89 Cal.Rptr. 128]; <em>Dotson </em>v. <em>Wolfe </em>(Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1980) 391 So.2d 757, 759; <em>University City </em>v. <em>Chicago, R. I. &amp; P. Ry. Co. </em>(1941) 347 Mo. 814 [149 S.W.2d 321, 326].) The deed contains three conditions requiring the right-of-way to be maintained so as to avoid diminishing the value of adjoining land. By law the easement could be extinguished only under certain general conditions. (Civ. Code, \u00a7811.) Although the statute vaguely declares that one such condition is \u201cthe performance of any act upon either tenement, by the owner of the servitude, or with his assent, which is incompatible with its nature or exercise\u201d <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 811, subd. 3), the land company undoubtedly wished to require that specific conditions be met so that the right-of-way would not damage the value of adjacent land, and hence the deed provides that failing to provide proper infrastructure or maintenance would terminate the railroad\u2019s interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">\u201cOf course the word \u2018revert\u2019 in its technical sense as dealing exclusively with titles should not be used in conjunction with an easement.\u201d <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>Weare </em>(1941) 348 Mo. 135 [152 S.W.2d 649, 655, 136 A.L.R. 286].) For \u201can easement . . . abandoned by nonuse or use outside its limitations does not \u2018revert\u2019 to the grantor, it is simply extinguished.\u201d <em>(Concord &amp; Bay Point Land Co. </em>v. <em>City of Concord, supra, </em>229 Cal.App.3d 289, 295.) But the inaccurate use of \u201crevert\u201d in a railway conveyance appears to be widespread. (See <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Weare, supra, </em>152 S.W.2d at p. 655.) Hence, a deed conveying a right-of-way rather than title to land may have a reverter clause, and though the term is misused, yet an easement is conveyed. <em>(Moakley </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Pacific Ry. Co., supra, </em>139 Cal.App. 421, 422, 423, 425 [deed conveyed \u201c \u2018right of way for railroad purposes\u2019 \u201d and provided that on abandonment \u201c \u2018said right of way and land shall immediately thereafter revert to said first parties\u2019 \u201d; easement conveyed].) In <em>Rosecrans </em>v. <em>Pacific Elec. Ry. Co. </em>(1943) 21 Cal.2d 602 [134 P.2d 245], the deed conveyed a \u201cright of way for a railroad across the real property therein described\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 603)\u2014i.e., an easement\u2014and provided that \u201c \u2018upon . . . breach [of specified conditions] the right of way hereby granted shall revert to first party his heirs or assigns, and upon such breach, first party, his heirs or assigns shall have the right to enter upon said right of way and take possession thereof.[\u2019]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 604.)</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The majority mention that the deed nowhere uses the term \u201ceasement.\u201d It would, however, have been imprecise to do so. In addition to \u201c[t]he right-of-way\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 801, subd. 4), many other types of appurtenant easements have been recognized in our Civil Code since 1872. These include the \u201cright of pasture\u201d <em>(id., </em>subd. 1), the \u201cright of taking water, wood, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>minerals, and other things\u201d <em>(id.., </em>subd. 5), and even the \u201cright of a seat in church\" <em>(id., </em>subd. 16). The majority hint that \u201ceasement\u201d and \u201cright of way\u201d may be equivalent, but they are not\u2014\u201cright of way\u201d is the more specific term, and to utilize it was better drafting.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">In addition to the legal principles explicated above, it would not have been practical to convey fee title to the railroad. The parties\u2019 exhibits suggest that the strip was perhaps two or three miles long. A long strip 100 feet wide meandering through others\u2019 adjacent land in what was remote territory <em>(Manhattan Beach </em>v. <em>Cortelyou </em>(1938) 10 Cal.2d 653, 664 [76 P.2d 483]) would not have been more valuable if held in fee simple rather than used for a right-of-way: it was landlocked and to be marketable as subdivided parcels would have required, at a minimum, the creation of many ways of necessity. \u201c[T]he shape of the tract, a 100-foot strip, is peculiarly suited to railway purposes and to little else.\u201d <em>(El Dorado &amp; Wessen Railway Company </em>v. <em>Smith, supra, </em>344 S.W.2d 343, 345.) The size and shape of the right-of-way supports the conclusion that an easement was conveyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\"><em>Pacific Gas &amp; E. Co. </em>v. <em>G. W. Thomas Drayage etc. Co., supra, </em>69 Cal.2d 33, held that extrinsic evidence must be considered to interpret the term \u201cproperty\u201d in a contract <em>(id. </em>at p. 36) notwithstanding any claim that \u201cthe contract had a plain meaning\u201d <em>(ibid.). </em>From that holding, the case drew broad conclusions regarding the propriety of considering, \u201cat least [as] a preliminary\u201d matter <em>(id. </em>at p. 39), extrinsic evidence when presented with a written transaction that appears to contain unambiguous terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Such aspects of <em>Pacific Gas &amp; E. Co. </em>have been criticized as \u201ccasting] a long shadow of uncertainty over all transactions negotiated and executed under the law of California.\u201d <em>(Trident Center </em>v. <em>Connecticut General Life Ins. </em>(9th Cir. 1988) 847 F.2d 564, 569.) In the same vein, in a dissent joined by two other justices, I have criticized the \u201cemasculation of the parol evidence rule\u201d in <em>Pacific Gas &amp; E. Co. (Delta Dynamics, Inc. </em>v. <em>Arioto </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 525, 531 [72 Cal.Rptr. 785, 446 P.2d 785] (dis. opn. of Mosk, J.).) \u201cThe problem,\u201d I stated, \u201cis that which devolves upon members of the bar who are commissioned by clients to prepare a written instrument able to withstand future assaults. . . . The written word, heretofore deemed immutable, is now at all times subject to alteration by self-serving recitals based upon fading memories of antecedent events. This, I submit, is a serious impediment to the certainty required in commercial transactions.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 532.)</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">Nowhere are the foregoing criticisms more telling than in the case of a deed giving notice to the world of the boundaries and nature of ownership of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>a plot of land. As stated, a deed may need to provide such notice for centuries, and very precise terminology and syntax have been devised for that purpose. Hence, a conveyance of a \u201c \u2018right of way\u2019 \u201d <em>(Highland, supra, </em>46 Cal.2d 669, 676) transfers an entirely different interest in land from a conveyance of a \u201c \u2018certain strip or parcel of land for a right of way\u2019 \u201d <em>(Machado </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Transportation Co., supra, </em>233 Cal.App.3d 347, 351). To question the meaning of such precisely differentiated terminology on the basis of dubious extrinsic evidence is to undermine the reliability of notice on which the public depends.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Fortunately, <em>Pacific Gas &amp; E. Co. </em>v. <em>G. W. Thomas Dray age etc. Co., supra, </em>69 Cal.2d 33, is distinguishable: it did not consider a recorded instrument that, using venerable terms of art, announced interests in land to the world. We need not rely on <em>Pacific Gas &amp; E. Co. </em>in a case such as this. Instead we must firmly adhere to the rule that if the language of a conveyance unambiguously states the nature of the interest conveyed, there is no need to turn to extrinsic evidence bearing on that question. <em>(Baker </em>v. <em>Ramirez, supra, </em>190 Cal.App.3d 1123, 1132.)</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">The majority\u2019s reliance on extrinsic evidence for their conclusion that the 1888 deed conveyed fee title does, however, require a response. It becomes apparent that the extrinsic evidence sheds scant light on the nature of the interest conveyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">It has been held that when there is \u201c \u2018no conflict\u2019 in such extrinsic evidence as has been introduced, \u2018we must make an independent determination of the meaning\u2019 of a legal instrument.\u201d <em>(Faus </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>67 Cal.2d 350, 360.) The rule could be more precisely stated. If the nonconflicting extrinsic evidence consists solely of other written instruments such as contracts or deeds, we interpret their meaning and their effect on the 1888 deed de novo. If, on the other hand, the extrinsic evidence consists primarily of facts adduced through testimony at trial, we must defer to trial court findings that are based on such evidence, even if there appears to be no conflict, because the court is better positioned than are we to observe a witness\u2019s demeanor and discern his or her credibility. Testimony can be uncontroverted and yet be presented in a fashion that is unpersuasive for reasons not evident on a written record.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Turning to the extrinsic evidence presented:</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">The trial court found that \u201c[ejxtrinsic evidence also supports, but is not necessary to, such construction [of the 1888 deed as conveying an easement]. Such extrinsic evidence includes: (a) the fact that in other deeds the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Redondo Land Company clearly transferred fee interests but did not utilize similar language in the 1888 deed; [and] (b) the fact that the Redondo Land Company purported to convey property which included a portion of the subject right-of-way in the metes and bounds description and in the calculated acreage in a deed to Duncan . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">If extrinsic evidence were necessary to our conclusion, we would review the instruments transferring fee interests de novo. The court was apparently referring to deeds conveying property to Blanton Duncan. Conveyances to him evidently occurred in 1895 and 1896. The record contains only transcriptions of the purported deeds and not the originals. In those transcriptions the Redondo Land Company conveys to him, respectively, \u201call those certain lots, pieces or parcels of land\u201d and \u201call that certain lot, piece or parcel of land . . . .\u201d There does not appear to be a stipulation that these transcriptions faithfully reproduced the originals. On independent review, however, if we were to agree that the transcriptions are proper evidence and were to construe their language, we should agree with the trial court that the language was materially different and illustrated that some years later the drafter knew how to convey a fee rather than an easement. (See <em>Moakley </em>v. <em>Blog, supra, </em>90 Cal.App. 96, 99.)</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The trial court\u2019s finding that the Redondo Land Company conveyed part of the right-of-way in a deed to Duncan should be reviewed for substantial evidence, for it is based on surveyors\u2019 expert testimony at trial. Substantial evidence in the record supports that finding: the surveyors testified that the legal description of the conveyance traversed the right-of-way.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">The trial court found, \u201c[w]ith respect to defendants\u2019 arguments based on extrinsic evidence, the unrecorded indenture of 1897 . . . did not demonstrate a contrary intent in 1888 to convey more than an easement. Nor did it constitute a later conveyance to the railroad of an interest greater than an easement. [*][]... The quiet title judgment of 1901 . . . and the pleadings in the various consolidated quiet title actions ... do not demonstrate a contrary intent in 1888 to convey more than an easement. Nor do these exhibits demonstrate that the railroad ever obtained more than an easement interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">On independent review, it is evident that the trial court ruled correctly in part and erroneously in part. The majority observe that the unrecorded 1897 indenture modifying the 1888 deed\u2019s infrastructure and maintenance conditions declared that the deed \u201cshall remain a grant <em>as therein expressed </em>. . . .\u201d (Italics added.) What the deed expressed, however, was a grant of an easement. In fact, the 1897 indenture referred to \u201cthe right of way in said [1888] deed granted . . . .\u201d The 1897 indenture supports the view that an easement was conveyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>On the other hand, an amended complaint in a 1901 action to quiet title to land owned by plaintiff Redondo Land Company excepted from the suit the land underlying the conveyance to the railroad under the 1888 deed. Defendants contend that if the company still held fee title to the land, it would have included it in the suit. On independent review, we may concede that this exception provides some extrinsic evidence for that view.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">The parties also discuss what is purported to be a judgment in that action. However, their exhibits contain no copy of an original document, but only a typed transcription. In the absence of a stipulation, we should not consider it to be evidence. Nor should we conclude that a memorandum of agreement regarding interests in land, apparently by the Redondo Land Company\u2019s shareholders, shows that a fee was conveyed in 1888. To the extent that the transcription of that memorandum contained in the exhibits is competent evidence of anything, it excepted \u201cthose certain parcels of land heretofore granted by the Redondo Land Company to Blanton Duncan\u201d and \u201cthat certain right of way heretofore granted\u201d to the railroad. That language, differentiating between \u201cland\u201d and the \u201cright of way,\u201d does not show that the 1888 deed conveyed fee title. It suggests the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The foregoing items, to the extent they are competent evidence at all, are, as the Court of Appeal effectively concluded, trifling: they shed little light on the meaning of the 1888 deed. Perhaps sensing so, defendants emphasize a 1903 decree of dissolution of the Redondo Land Company. The decree states in part, \u201cAnd it appearing further that all of the property of said corporation has been disposed of and that all of the business of said corporation has come to an end [\u2022}[] Now therefore it is ordered and adjudged that the said corporation, The Redondo Land Company, be, and the same is hereby dissolved, and its corporate existence ended . . . .\u201d (Capitalization altered.)</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">The Court of Appeal agreed to take judicial notice of the contents of the decree, but concluded that it was of \u201cmarginal\u201d significance. Defendants insist that the 1903 decree shows not only that fee title was conveyed in 1888, but also that even if an easement was conveyed in 1888, the decree means that plaintiffs cannot now claim any title to the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">This claim fails because it relies on evidence that the parties stipulated at trial would not be introduced. Apparently it came to the parties\u2019 attention after trial was concluded and while appeal was pending. However, at the beginning of trial, the parties bound themselves as to the corpus of evidence to be considered in this case by stipulating that \u201cby the time each party rests in this case the parties will have offered into evidence all documents in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>chain of title to the subject property or adjacent land that are pertinent to the decision of this case. [&lt;]D The parties are unaware of any other documents. The court need not consider the possible existence of other documents. Apart from the documents offered there are no others that the parties are aware of that bear on this case or are necessary for the court to consider in arriving at a decision on this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">A fair reading of this stipulation is that the parties agreed to be bound by the documentary evidence presented at trial. Having entered into the stipulation, defendants may not present new evidence now. (See <em>Estate of Cooper </em>(1970) 11 Cal.App.3d 1114, 1119, 1122-1124 [90 Cal.Rptr. 283].) The majority grant the request for judicial notice, but it should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">As the Court of Appeal concluded, \u201cconstruction of the deed does not require resort to extrinsic evidence.\u201d The material that exists, if competent or admissible evidence at all, \u201ceither does not support [defendants\u2019] interpretation or is too attenuated to be of much relevance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Defendant Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company (Santa Fe) contends that the Court of Appeal erred in affirming the trial court\u2019s judgment that it was liable along with defendant city of Manhattan Beach (the city) in inverse condemnation for taking the land underlying the easement. Insofar as it concerns this point, Santa Fe\u2019s contention that the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment should be reversed has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">In 1986 and 1989, in recorded documents creating and then modifying a \u201cPark Acquisition Agreement,\u201d the city and Santa Fe agreed essentially as follows: Santa Fe wanted to develop 2.12 acres of land lying at one end of its right-of-way for a commercial project, and the city wanted to acquire the right-of-way for a recreational trail. Santa Fe agreed to convey to the city its interest in the land over which the right-of-way ran within the city, except for the 2.12-acre parcel. The city agreed to pay $4.2 million, to give Santa Fe title to certain parcels, and to rezone the 2.12-acre parcel for commercial use. Santa Fe agreed to \u201cindemnify ... the city . . . from any claim . . . arising out of alleged defective title to any portion or parcel of railroad right-of-way sold . . . under this agreement\u201d (capitalization altered) up to the sum of (1) the $4.2 million purchase price of the right-of-way and (2) the value of the parcels to which the city was giving it title. The parties agreed that if any claim of disputed title over the right-of-way was presented to the city, Santa Fe could begin, at its own expense, eminent domain proceedings in the city\u2019s name to acquire the claimant\u2019s interest. Finally, the city agreed to rezone the right-of-way for \u201cOpen Space Recreation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>At trial, virtually no evidence regarding the acquisition agreement was introduced. Nor was there much discussion of the point at closing argument. Nevertheless, in the trial court\u2019s statement of decision it determined, in essence, that the acquisition agreement showed that Santa Fe actively participated in taking plaintiffs\u2019 land and therefore it was liable under the authority of <em>Breidert </em>v. <em>Southern Pac. Co. </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 659 [39 Cal.Rptr. 903, 394 P.2d 719].</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Because the trial court based its determination largely (and probably entirely, given the dearth of evidence presented at trial) on the acquisition agreement, it decided a question that was either a question of law\u2014the interpretation of a written instrument <em>(Faus </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>67 Cal.2d 350, 360)\u2014or was a mixed question of law and fact that was primarily legal. Its ruling should be subjected to independent review.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Under that standard, it appears that the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the agreement was erroneous. The acquisition agreement\u2019s provisions are designed to facilitate the transfer of the right-of-way from Santa Fe, as private seller, to the city as buyer, in exchange for which the former would be paid, given other land, and allowed to develop its 2.12-acre parcel. Santa Fe appears to be correct that nothing in the agreement shows that it took the land underlying the right-of-way for public use: if any entity did so, it was the city. Contrary to the trial court\u2019s and the Court of Appeal\u2019s reasoning, the acquisition agreement created no joint project to develop the right-of-way: Santa Fe wanted to be rid of it. Although the agreement declares that Santa Fe \u201cseeks to transform undeveloped property in [the city] into developed property in accordance with the plan for the Project,\u201d elsewhere the \u201cProject\u201d was defined as \u201call Project areas east of Sepulveda Boulevard\u201d\u2014 i.e., the 2.12-acre parcel.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Article I, section 19, of the California Constitution provides: \u201cPrivate property may be taken or damaged for public use only when just compensation, ascertained by a jury unless waived, has first been paid to, or into court for, the owner. The Legislature may provide for possession by the condemnor following commencement of eminent domain proceedings upon deposit in court and prompt release to the owner of money determined by the court to be the probable amount of just compensation.\u201d As Santa Fe persuasively argues, a private seller cannot be liable in inverse condemnation merely because it conveys an interest in land to a municipality that converts the land to a public use. And that is all that the acquisition agreement provides for. It is true that in <em>Breidert </em>v. <em>Southern Pac. Co., supra, </em>61 Cal.2d 659, 662, we held that a railroad can be liable in inverse condemnation when it acts alongside the state to cause an interest in land to be condemned. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number><em>Breidert </em>is distinguishable. There the railroad \u201cwas an active joint participant in closing [a] crossing\u201d <em>(ibid.) </em>for the public benefit, creating a cul-de-sac where the crossing once gave property owners access to the network of public streets. No such \u201cactive joint participat[ion]\u201d <em>(ibid.) </em>in creating a park appears in the acquisition agreement before us. The city alone is liable to plaintiffs for any taking of their land that may have occurred. Because plans for future appropriations of interests in land do not give rise to a cause of action in inverse condemnation <em>(Selby Realty Co. </em>v. <em>City of San Buenaventura </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 110, 119-120 [109 Cal.Rptr. 799, 514 P.2d 111]), it is unnecessary to analyze liability for future takings of land or interests therein, including those accompanying or following future eminent domain or other proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Whether the 1888 deed conveyed a defeasible fee or an easement is not an arcane academic question. With railroad rights of way currently being converted to other uses, sometimes with the possibility of resuming their original function, it is of considerable practical importance to interpret deeds of this type correctly. (See 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1247(d) [converting railroad rights of way to trails and preserving them for future rail use]; 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(a), final par. [\u201cterm \u2018transportation enhancement activities\u2019 \u201d includes \u201cpreservation of abandoned railway corridors\u201d]; 49 U.S.C. former \u00a7 10906, now \u00a7 10905 [entitled \u201c[offering abandoned rail properties for sale for public purposes\u201d].) The majority\u2019s interpretation is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment should be reversed insofar as it concludes that Santa Fe is jointly liable with the City of Manhattan Beach in inverse condemnation. In all other respects, its judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b301-7\">KENNARD, J., Dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"Ar6\">I agree with the view expressed by Justice Mosk in his concurring and dissenting opinion that the 1888 deed at issue here conveyed an easement, and not, as the majority holds, a fee interest. As Justice Mosk points out, both the language of the deed itself (conc. and dis. opn. of Mosk, J., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 252-261) and the extrinsic evidence <em>(id. </em>at pp. 262-265) compel the conclusion that the interest conveyed was an easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">Unlike Justice Mosk, however, I would hold liable for inverse condemnation not only defendant City of Manhattan Beach (the City), but also defendant Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company (Santa Fe), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>because the latter was actively, and jointly with the City, involved in the condemnation of the property here in issue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">The City and Santa Fe entered into a contract, the \u201cPark Acquisition Agreement,\u201d to enable the City to develop a park on land involved here in exchange for certain benefits to be granted Santa Fe by the City. The contract states in relevant part: \u201cThis Agreement is for the purpose of carrying out the Project. City seeks to obtain certain public benefits as set forth herein. Santa Fe seeks to transform undeveloped property in City into developed property in accordance with the plan for the Project.\u201d Under the agreement, Santa Fe promised to indemnify the City against claims to title of the property here in issue and reserved the right to initiate eminent domain proceedings in the City\u2019s name. The City, in turn, agreed to cooperate with Santa Fe in eminent domain proceedings; to rezone property acquired by the City as open space; to grant Santa Fe redevelopment rights to part of the property retained by Santa Fe; to rezone property held by Santa Fe to allow for commercial planned development; and to help Santa Fe acquire access to property retained by Santa Fe. Because the Park Acquisition Agreement reflects significant actions by both the City and Santa Fe, I would hold them jointly liable for the inverse condemnation. <em>(Breidert </em>v. <em>Southern Pac. Co. </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 659, 662 [39 Cal.Rptr. 903, 394 P.2d 719] [railroad is proper party to inverse condemnation action if it was an active joint participant in taking property for public use].) This conclusion was also reached by the trial court and by the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Werdegar, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">The petition of real parties in interest for a rehearing was denied June 19, 1996. Mosk, J., Kennard, J., and Werdegar, J., were of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b302-8\">Because the majority concludes that Santa Fe had full legal title in fee simple, it does not address the question of whether Santa Fe is jointly liable with the City for inverse condemnation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
