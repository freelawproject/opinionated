One of the sons of the testator has since died, leaving one son, and he and the surviving son of the testator are the defendants in this suit; and the plaintiffs and defendants are all the persons interested in the testator\u2019s estate. The debts and legacies to the sons were duly paid. The testator\u2019s widow entered into possession of the estate, after his decease, and has since held the same, remaining unmarried. The whole estate was appraised at $17,401; and the debts were less than $100.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-6\">The defendants contended that in case she should die unmarried the remainder of the estate would descend as intestate property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-7\">The case was reserved by <em>Hoar, </em>J., for the determination of the whole court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b432-8\"><em>F. E. Parker, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADTq\">The will is illiterate, confused and hasty; and in construing such a will the court will make such transpositions as to make it intelligible. If read thus, the will shows an intention to dispose of the whole estate, and not to die intestate as to any part of it; and to provide for every member of the family. The testator considered the legacies to his sons as a sufficient provision for them, as appears from his express exclusion of them from any further share of his estate in the event of his widow\u2019s second marriage; and he intended to leave the residue to the widow, in trust for the benefit of herself and the daughters. That it was a trust, see <em>Raikes </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>1 Hare, 445; <em>Thorp </em>v. <em>Owen, </em>2 Hare, 607; <em>Woods </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>1 Myl. &amp; Cr. 401. The words of the fourth clause should be transposed, so that the words \u201cbut in case of her second marriage \u201d should come before the words \u201c to have and to hold the same so long as she shall remain my widow.\u201d That transposition makes the sense clear, and gives a fee to the trustee, under Eev. Sts. <em>c. </em>62, \u00a7 4. The authorities sanction such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>transposition. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Allcock, </em>1 B. &amp; Ald. 137. <em>Brimmer </em>v. <em>Sohier, </em>1 Cush. 118. 1 Redfield on Wills, 468. The testator is thus prevented from dying intestate as to any part of his estate ; and this construction is favored by law. <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>11 Met. 97. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Hicks, </em>7 T. R. 437. The other construction would give a bounty to the widow, in case of her second marriage; and in case of her not marrying again, would punish the daughters.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b433-5\"><em>H G. Parker, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A23\">If the construction contended for by the plaintiffs is correct, all of the last half of the fourth clause is to be rejected as useless and without meaning; and especially the words, \u201cto have and to hold the same so long as she shall remain my widow.\u201d But all the words of a will must be retained, if they convey an intelligible meaning. These words are universally construed to create only a life estate, at the most. <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>5 Met. 134. <em>Nickerson </em>v. <em>Bowly, </em>8 Met. 424. The words\"\u201c use, improvement and income \u201d also have a tendency to show that only a life estate was intended to be given <em>Bowers </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>4 Pick. 204. <em>Fay </em>v. <em>Fay, </em>1 Cush. 104. The widow and daughters take only the income, so long as the widow remains unmarried, and in case she dies unmarried the property takes the course of intestate property. <em>Raymond </em>v. <em>Morse, 4 </em>Gray, 248. <em>Phifer </em>v. <em>Phifer, </em>6 Ired. Eq. 155. <em>Pryor </em>v. <em>Dunkle, </em>2 Wash. C. C. 416.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b433-6\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"AD8\">The true construction of the will of Nathaniel Smith gives to his widow the whole residue of his estate, after payment of the debts and legacies to his sons, in trust during widowhood; one third thereof in fee, and the other two thirds to hold during widowhood with remainder in fee to the two daughters.</p>\n<p id=\"A8u\">\n<em>Decree accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
