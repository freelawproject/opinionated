The derrick and chain belonged to the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-4\">The defendants introduced evidence tending to show that the laborers received their orders from the truckman, as to the mode of unloading the sled; that the freight agent requested the truck-man to back his horse and sled, so that the engine might be directly under the end of the boom, but the truckman, in attempting to do so, started his horse forward, and pulled the sled from under the engine, by reason of which it .swung against the car; and that the derrick was not frozen, but worked properly and freely.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-5\">The judge instructed the jury that the defendants\u2019 liability as common carriers commenced when the engine was delivered to and accepted by them for the purpose of transportation; that until such delivery the truckman, who was also a common carrier, would be liable; but after such delivery and acceptance the defendants would be liable for the negligence of those employed by them to load or transport the engine ; that it was for the jury to determine from the evidence whether there had been such delivery and acceptance, and that in order to constitute such delivery and acceptance it must appear that the defendants had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>through their agent taken and assumed the charge and custody of the engine, for the purpose of transportation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-5\">After the charge, the defendants requested the court to instruct the jury what was in law an acceptance under the circumstances claimed by either side in this action ; but the judge declined to give any further instructions upon this point. The defendants further requested him to instruct the jury that if the accident happened by the joint negligence of the defendants\u2019 servants and the truckman, while acting in concert under the directions of the truckman, the defendants would not be liable but the judge declined so to rule, and upon this point instructed the jury that if the accident happened before a delivery by the truckman the defendants would not be liable; but if, after such delivery and acceptance as above stated, the accident happened through the joint negligence of the defendants\u2019 servants and the truckman in assisting them to load the engine, the defendants would be liable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-6\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, and the defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b90-7\"><em>C.

The mode of placing the engine upon the cars by means of a derrick was an arrangement of the defendants, and they provided the derrick for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">The evidence on the part of the defendants, as to the superintendence and control of the operation of removing the engine from the sled of the truckman to the cars, conflicted with that of the plaintiff; and this was submitted to the jury. It became necessary t\u00f3 ascertain at what point, as respects the rights of the bailor, the truckman^ responsibility for the safe transportation of the engine ceased, and when the same was cast upon the defendants. The court properly ruled that it was when the engine was delivered to and accepted by them for the purpose of transportation, and that in order to constitute such delivery and acceptance it must appear that the defendants had through their agent taken and assumed the charge and custody of the engine for the purpose of transportation. Story on Bailm. \u00a7 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Of course in deciding the question when the custody does thus attach, much will depend upon the manner in which they receive goods for transportation, the provision they make for raising heavy articles into their cars, and the active participation of the agent of the company in reference to the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">As to warehousemen, it has been held that as soon as the goods arrive and the crane of the warehouse is applied to them to raise them into the warehouse, the liability of the warehouseman commences, and it is no defence that they are afterwards injured by falling into the street from the breaking of the tackle. Story on Bailm. \u00a7 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">In the opinion of the court, the instructions were sufficiently full, and the further instructions assed were properly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\"><em>Exceptions </em>overruled.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"Aez\"> Bigelow, C.
