Young, secretary Trinity Church Society.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-5\">To this letter the plaintiff replied as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-6\">\u201c Waltham, January 6th, 1863. Messrs. Clay and Snow: Gentlemen: The invitation which the Trinitarian Congregational Society of Neponset, through you as their committee, have been pleased to extend to me to act as pastor of your society for the year to come, I have, as you are already aware, informally accepted. This note is simply a formal acknowledgment and acceptance. I am to preach, as signified in a previous line to Mr. Young, the present month as usual. The year for which I am engaged commencing with the first of February current, and payments, at rate proposed, quarterly from that date. As to vacation, it will give me pleasure so to supply the pulpit the present year that no additional expense may fall upon the society. I am, as ever, yours in Christian love J. B. Johnson.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-7\">The plaintiff was also allowed to testify, against the defendants\u2019 objection, to a certain conversation between himself and Mr. Clay and Mr. Young, on the 5th of January 1863, as to the terms of the contract; as to which, however, he was contradicted by them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-8\">It appeared that the above letter of the plaintiff was duly received and passed to the secretary of the society, who read it o the society at their annual meeting in March 1863, but no action was taken upon it and no reply was made to the plaintiff and he continued to preach as their pastor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>The plaintiff introduced in evidence the record of a meeting of the society on the 5th of December 1863, when a vote was passed appointing a committee to wait upon him and request him to withdraw and terminate his pastoral relation with them \u201c for various reasons, a part of which are as follows, to wit: that his letter to Mr. Brooks relative to his gas bill was a misrepresentation of facts and injurious to the society, inasmuch as he therein asserts that the society is indebted to him in the sum of three hundred dollars, the payment of which has for some time been daily and hourly expected; whereas the facts are, Mr. Johnson\u2019s gas bill amounting to about five dollars was due from him to the gas company October 1st, at which time the society were not indebted to him in the least, and would not become so indebted to him by the terms of the agreement until November following.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-5\">The plaintiff was also allowed, under objection, to introduce in evidence the following extract from the record of a meeting of the society held on the 12th of December 1863: \u201c Resolved, that a committee of two be appointed to wait upon Mr. Johnson and inform him that, inasmuch as he has refused to withdraw from the pulpit of the society as requested, therefore the society propose to him as follows: that for the six intervening Sabbaths from December 14th to February 1st the society will supply the pulpit, making their own selections and paying therefor whatever sum is just and proper, and the residue to Mr. Johnson at the rate of $1200 per annum.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-6\">\u201c Voted, that the committee be instructed to require of Mr. Johnson an immediate answer to the foregoing proposition as a compromise.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-7\">The plaintiff was also allowed, under objection, to read and put into the case a part of a sermon which he said he preached to the usual congregation of the defendants\u2019 society on the first Sunday of February 1863, and in which he spoke of their meeting \u201c at the beginning of a year to us of united Christian labor.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-8\">The defendants brought into court the sum of two hundred dollars, which the plaintiff took; and they objected that under the pleadings the plaintiff could not recover except for services <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>prior to January 1st 1864. The judge, however, overruled the objection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-5\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff for one hundred and nine dollars, under instructions authorizing them to do so; and the defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b134-6\"><em>W. Colburn, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Azv\">1. The contract relied upon was within the statute of frauds, and there was no sufficient note or memorandum in writing thereof. Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>105, \u00a7 1, 2. The conversation with Clay and Young was inadmissible. 3. The extract from the sermon was incompetent evidence. The occasion forbade a reply to it; no one was authorized to speak for the defendants; it was merely paroi evidence of a. contract within the statute of frauds; and as a contract, or proof of one, was in violation of the statutes for the observance of the Lord\u2019s day. 4. The resolutions of December 12th were merely propositions for a compromise. 5. Under the pleadings, no recovery can be had for the month of January. 2 Greenl.

The declaration is sufficient to maintain the plaintiff\u2019s action, if the contract upon which he relied was supported by the evidence. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Catholic Cong. Soc. in Rehoboth, 5 </em>Pick. 469. <em>Sheldon </em>v. <em>Cong. Parish in Easton, </em>24 Pick. 481 His readiness to perform his duties as a minister during the whole time for which he was settled, if he was prevented from performing them by the act of the defendants, would enable him to sue upon an account annexed, nothing remaining to be done under the contract but the payment of money.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-11\">2. The defence of the statute of frauds is not available to the defendants, if the plaintiff proved a contract for the year ending February 1st 1864. In that case it would be a contract not to be performed within a year from the time it was made, and the statute would require a memorandum in writing. Such a memorandum is supplied by the letter of January 1st 1863, and the recital in the votes passed at the meeting of the society on the 5th of December 1863, which together contain all the terms of the contract. The <em>\\ </em>roposal contained in the letter was accepted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>by the plaintiff in his letter of January 6th 1863, with two modifications; that the year of service should begin on the first of February instead of the first of January, and that the salary should be paid quarterly. It then remains to show, by a writing signed by the defendants or an authorized agent, that they assented to these modifications; and we think the statement in the vote of December 5th is sufficient to authorize the conclusion that such was the fact. There is nothing in the vote which is inadmissible in evidence on the ground that it was passed as the offer of a compromise. It is a recital of facts which are alleged as a reason for asking the plaintiff to terminate his relations with the society.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">3. But while we decide that the contract on which the plaintiff declares is supported by a sufficient memorandum under the statute of frauds, if the contract itself was proved to the satisfaction of the jury, it is important to observe the distinction between the contract and the memorandum. The memorandum is not the contract, although it may be evidence of it. It was for the jury to find whether the contract declared on was th| real contract between the parties; and they must do it upon competent evidence. And as evidence was admitted against the objection of the defendants which appears to us to have been incompetent, the exceptions must for that reason be sustained and a new trial granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">No authority was shown to have been conferred on the witnesses Clay and Young to make admissions binding the defendants; and the evidence of their declarations was therefore incompetent to support the plaintiff\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">The vote of December 12th 1863 was expressly stated to be the offer of a compromise, and should not therefore have been admitted to prejudice the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">The extract from the plaintiff\u2019s sermon, if it proved anything, was merely his declaration of a fact in his own favor, not communicated to the defendants in their corporate capacity, and made under circumstances which could hardly require or admit a contradiction or disclaimer. That the congregation heard it without reply or comment had no tendency to prove that the defendants assented to its truth.</p>\n<p id=\"Adj\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
