Fuller, setting forth a copy of the testator\u2019s will, which contained the following devise:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-11\">\u201c I give, bequeath and aevise to my father, Warren Fuller, and to my mother, Eliza B. Fuller their heirs and assigns, all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>the right, title and interest which I own in the homestead now occupied by my said father, Warren Fuller, excepting that my aunts, Eliza Fuller and Hannah Fuller, are to have free and undisturbed possession of the old house, with all the privileges they have heretofore had, except that of cutting off wood.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-5\">The will also contained various devises and legacies of money, and gave the residue of the personal estate to his wife, \u201c after the payment of all my just debts, legacies and charges against my estate.\u201d The bill further set forth that the land described in the devise above quoted was subject to a mortgage by the testator to secure his promissory note for $1666.67, with interest payable semi-annually; that the testator paid the interest on this debt as it became due, up to the time of his death, in January 1864; that since his death no interest had been paid; that the legacies of money amounted to $4300, and the assets, exclusive of specific devises and bequests, to about $5541; and praying that the several defendants, who were the widow and legatees of the testator, might be decreed to interplead, and that it might be determined by whom the mortgage debt should be paid. These facts were all admitted by the several parties who appeared as defendants.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b148-6\"><em>W. S. </em>Leland, for the widow and one of the legatees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQE\">There is an obvious distinction between a devise of the testator\u2019s interest in an estate and a devise of the estate itself, and in this particular the present case is distinguishable from <em>Andrews </em>v <em>Bishop, </em>5 Allen, 490. In the present case, the estate owned by the testator was the equity, and the thing devised was not the estate itself, but his interest in it. This clearly includes only the equity. And the intent of the testator to this effect is fairly manifest, upon inspection of his will.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b148-7\"><em>W. </em>Colburn, for Warren Fuller and wife.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b148-8\">Gray, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5p\">The general rule of law, in the absence of any expressed intent, is that debts contracted by the testator, although secured by mortgage, are to be pair out of his personal property t&lt;? the exoneration of his real estate. <em>Seaver </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>14 Mass. 83. <em>Hewes </em>v. <em>Dehon, </em>3 Gray, 205. In this case, the expressed intent accords with the general rule. The gift of the personal property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>to the widow is in terms postponed to the payment of all debts, legacies and charges against the estate. In the devise of the homestead to the father, the use of the words restricting it to the testator\u2019s right, title and interest is accounted for by the outstanding right of dower in his mother, if not by a life estate in his aunts. The direction to sell other real estate has no tendency to charge this. The manifest intention of the testator was to devise to his father the homestead which had once been his, subject only to his wife\u2019s right of dower, and to the possession for life of the testator\u2019s maiden aunts. The personal property is therefore to be applied to the discharge of the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">\n<em>Decree accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
