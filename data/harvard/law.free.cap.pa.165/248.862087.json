Before Greer, P.

He protests against the acknowledgment of said deed for the reason that the sale was not properly advertised and was misleading, the land being advertised to be sold on Aug. 19, 1893, and at the same time advertised to be sold on Aug. 28, 1893, neither of which sales was at the regular term. On Aug. 19 the sale was stayed until 2 o\u2019clock of Sept. 5, 1893, by the court, and then on that day until four o\u2019clock of said day, at which time the sale was made, after the great majority of the people in attendance on the sheriff sales had gone home, and the plaintiffs in the writs had the bidding all their own way. The public did not know of the orders of court stajdng said sale. They look in the usual places, the public newspapers and in the printed handbills which the law requires. Had there been such notices at the regular term a much higher price would have been bidden, as exceptant verily believes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-9\">\u201c 2. The land having heen advertised to be sold subject to two mineral mining grants belonging to the plaintiffs in the writs, had the effect of keeping or deterring bidders from bid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>ding on the land; and all for the purpose, as exceptant believes, to keep away bidders.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-4\">\u201c 6. Deponent, as a further reason against the confirmation, of the sale, files the following bid of nine thousand dollars ($9,000). Said bid is made jointly by John and Eli Vanderlin, they owning in fee simple over six hundred acres of land in said county, unincumbered, valued at a low estimate of $10,000, the same being bona fide.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-5\">At the hearing the plaintiffs offered to increase their bid to $10,000 by allowing an additional credit of $2,000 on their liens, which were prior to all others. Eli and John Vanderlin then offered to increase their prior bid to $11,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-6\">The sheriff\u2019s sale was advertised for Aug. 28, 1893, in newspapers issued Aug. 11, 18, and 25, 1893.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-7\">The court dismissed the exceptions and confirmed the sale, and took the acknowledgment of the sheriff\u2019s deed, in an opinion by Greer, P.

Boyer, 14 Pa. 380; Hoffa\u2019s Ap., 82 Pa. 297; Germer v. Ensign, 155 Pa. 464; Ritter v. Getz, 161 Pa. 648; Jackson v.

Hovis, 152 Pa. 11, and Hollister\u2019s Ap., 146 Pa. 138.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AsdL\">Jan. 7, 1895:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b275-8\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"ALx\">Mr. Justice Mitchell,</author>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">The objection to the sheriff\u2019s sale that it was not of the defendant\u2019s interest in the land, but of the land, \u201c subject to two mineral mining estates\u201d owned by the use plaintiffs, has been disposed of by the decision in Porter v. Vanderlin, 158 Pa 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">The further objection is made to the advertisement of the sale that it was not made three full weeks before the day fixed for the sale. The language of the act of June 16,1836, sect. 63, P. L. 772, is that the officer making the sale shall give notice by advertisement \u201c once a week during three successive weeks.\u201d Does this require that the first notice shall be three full weeks, or twenty-one days, before the day of sale ? It does not appear that this point has ever been expressly decided by this court, and the decisions of the courts of common pleas are not uniform upon it. The general practice however has been against such requirement, and to regard the statute as referring to calendar weeks, or specified periods of time, and an advertisement in each of three successive periods of the kind, although the advertisements may not have been all on the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>day of the week, and there may not have been twenty-one full days between the first and the date of the sale. This is the rule laid down in the books of practice, 1 Troubat &amp; Haly, sect. 1250, and has been recognized by this court inferentially at least in Re North Whitehall Township, 47 Pa. 156, where a notice directed to be given \u201c three weeks before the time of meeting \u201d was held to mean twenty-one full days, and was expressly distinguished by Strong-, J., from a notice \u201c during three successive weeks,\u201d or one for \u201c a given number of insertions in successive weeks.\u201d Many hundreds of titles have been made under this view of the law, and it would require a very clear case of error to justify us in throwing a doubt upon them by a contrary construction. No such showing has been made. This objection cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">The remaining exceptions by the appellant are to matters of discretion in the court below. The sale was at first advertised for August 19 but subsequently for August 28. As the advertisements for the 28th were complete and regular and the sale was regularly adjourned from that date there was no legal right of appellant violated. If intending bidders were in fact misled by conflict of dates presumably it could have been shown. What the mistake was which induced the re-advertisement does not appear, but the whole matter was before the court below, and there is nothing to show that its discretionary power was not rightfully exercised. The proceedings being regular appellant\u2019s application to set aside the sale was left to depend on inadequacy of price, and this has been uniformly held not to be of itself sufficient. The application might therefore have been dismissed without more, and the sale confirmed at the price bidden thereat. Appellant would have had no ground of complaint,' and he is certainly no worse off because the court accepted the offer of the purchasers to give an additional credit on their judgment. The circumstances were peculiar. The beneficial plaintiffs had a judgment which was the first lien, larger than any bid made at any time for the property. They purchased at the sale, receipting to the sheriff for the amount of their bid. There were no proceeds of the sale to go to any one else. When, in order to put an end to the contention, or possibly to satisfy any doubt in the mind of the judge arising from the offer of one thousand dollars advance by the Yander<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>lins, the purchasers offered to give an additional credit on their judgment, and the court accepted the offer, the appellant was just that much better off by the reduction of his debt, and no one else was injured. There was no feature of auction by the court about the transaction. Auction on the contrary would have been started had the court then entertained the new bid from the Vanderlins. This he properly refused to do. All that he did was to accord the appellant a benefit ex gratia, of which he has no reason to complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-3\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
