Before White, J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b608-12\">At the trial it appeared that plaintiff, a girl thirteen years and eight months old, was employed by the defendant to run towels through a mangle in a laundry. The machine at which she worked consisted of a cylinder, about six feet long, and three smaller cylinders above it. The towels were passed in at one side and after going through the rolls, came out at the other side. In ordinary use there was a box on the top of these rolls, and a guard in front, where the towels passed in. There was no danger of the hands getting in between those cylinders when the box was on. There was room enough for the towels to pass in, but not enough for the hand to pass in, and the towels were taken out on the other side. Plaintiff\u2019s injury did not happen when engaged in the ordinary business of putting towels through the mangle, but afterwards when she was requested by defendant to wax the cylinder. Beeswax was used to rub on the large cylinder, in order to prevent its rusting, and, on this occasion, the top box was taken off and exposed all of the cylinders. Plaintiff alleged that the machinery was not perfect; that the step which was used for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>stopping the motion of the cylinder was off of the treadle. It seemed that one treadle would stop the motion, by throwing off the band that revolved the cylinder, and that on the other side was a step, also, for starting it. The step was off, but the projection on which the step was fastened was there, and had been in use without the step for some time by all the employees. Plaintiff testified that she was not instructed by defendant how to wax the machine.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-5\">Verdict and judgment for plaintiff for 1400.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-6\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were (1, 2) instructions recited in opinion of the Supreme Court, quoting them.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b609-7\"><em>J.

In one of them the court was requested to charge: \u201c From the evidence in this case, the point of danger in the mangle was where the two cylinders, revolving' towards each other, came together, and the danger of being caught was obvious and the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence and cannot recover.\u201d In the other, the court was asked to say: \u201c That under all the evidence in the case the verdict should be for the defendant.\u201d We are satisfied from an examination of the testimony that the question of defendant\u2019s negligence and also that of plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence were so presented that the court was bound to submit both to the jury as questions of fact exclusively for their determination. That was done in a clear and adequate charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>that appears to be free from any error of which the defendant can justly complain. In view of the testimony bearing on each of said questions it would have been manifest error for the court to have affirmed either of the points referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"A8M\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
