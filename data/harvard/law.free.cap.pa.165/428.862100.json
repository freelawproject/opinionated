[159 Pa. 64.] That a dispute has arisen between them and W. B. Stoughton as.to the amount of said judgment petitioners are entitled to, and that the amount has been paid to the sheriff. That the cause of action was a claim for damages against defendant for the destruction by fire of certain houses and personal property of said Stoughton, which were covered by policies of insurance held by Stoughton, being one of $2,000 on a house, made by the Phoenix Co., and three made by the Western Co., being $800 on said house, $300 on another house, and $1,500 on personal property. That said Phoenix Co. paid to said Stoughton on its policy $1,980.64, and the other company paid on its policies $792.25, $300 and $1,454.50 respectively, aggregating $4,527.36.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-6\">That at the time of said payments said Stoughton assigned and transferred to said companies said several amounts by subrogation receipts (copies of which are attached to the petition), transferring all claims against any person arising from such loss, and subrogating said companies to his rights to the extent of the amount named in said subrogation receipts; that said action was carried on for the benefit of petitioners as well as said Stoughton, he being entitled to any loss he had sustained over and above the amount covered by the policies. That petitioners actively participated in prosecuting the suit, and that it was carried on with the understanding that Stoughton was to have whatever was recovered over the sum of $4,527.36. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>That Stoughton now claims the whole of the fund, but that petitioners believe they are entitled to the sum of $4,527.36 out of the fund.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-4\">The petition prayed that $2,676.21 may be decreed to the Western Assurance Co., and $2,081.29 to the Phoenix Co.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-5\">W. R. Stoughton filed an answer averring: That his said property was worth at the time it was destroyed by fire the sum of $9,972.77, and that his whole loss by said fire much exceeded that amount, and that he furnished proofs of loss to said companies showing his loss to be $9,972.77. That said companies then paid him the several sums alleged by them. That said policies being in the standard form contained the following clause:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-6\">\u201c If this company shall claim that the fire was caused by the act or neglect of any person or corporation, private or municipal, this company shall, on payment of the loss, be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all right of recovery by the insured for the loss resulting therefrom, and such right shall be assigned to this company by the insured on receiving such payment.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-7\">That said companies having claimed that the fire was caused by the negligence of other parties, he gave them subrogation receipts as alleged, said receipts being in the form prescribed by the insurance department. That he thereupon brought an action against the Manufacturers\u2019 Natural Gas Co. to recover for the loss occasioned by the fire both to propertjr insured and other property not covered by the insurance,\u2019 upon the allegation that it was caused by their negligence, and recovered a judgment for $5,575.89. That said action was marked in part for the use of said companies, but they were not parties to it in any other sense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-8\">He denied that there was any understanding that the companies should receive whatever might be recovered to the extent of the amounts paid to him, if it is meant that they were to \u25a0receive the same before he should be compensated for his loss.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-9\">He admitted that petitioners took an active part in the prosecution of the suit, and that in addition to his loss by fire he has expended the sum of $1,192.88 for counsel fees in the prosecution of said suit; that he is advised that he is entitled to the whole of said judgment, less the amount, if any, which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>same and the payments of the said insurance companies exceed his loss.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-3\">The subrogation receipts, signed by Stoughton, after acknowledging the receipt of the money paid by each insurance company, continued: \u201c And in consideration of such payment the undersigned hereby assigns and transfers to the said company each and all claims and demands against any person, persons or property, arising from or connected with such loss or damage, (and the said company is subrogated in the place of, and to the claims and demands of the undersigned against any person, persons or property in the premises) to the extent of the amount above named.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-4\">The court entered the following decree:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-5\">\u201c And now, to wit, March 22,1894, this cause came on to be heard, on petition and answer, as set down by consent of parties, and was argued by counsel, and the court being of opinion that the equitable plaintiffs are entitled to receive of verdict and judgment to the extent of the several sums assigned to them by W. R. Stoughton, the legal plaintiff, to wit, the Phoenix Assurance Co., $1,980.61, and the Western Assurance Co., $2,646.75 (but not to interest prior to verdict) ; \"it is hereby adjudged and decreed that the amount remaining in the sheriff\u2019s hands, to wit, the sum of $4,771.53, being the amount of debt and interest of judgment, less $1,192.88 paid by consent of parties to J. M. Garrison, Esq.

To have subrogation they must first. have paid the whole amount of his loss, whether covered by insurance or not, and they could not ask for subrogation or any interest in the suit until after they had done so: Ins. Co. v. Fidelity Co., 123 Pa. 523; Forest Oil Co.\u2019s Ap., 118 Pa. 138; Assn. v. Lister, L. R. 9 Ch. Ap. 483; Ins. Co. v. McClaren, 12 Ont. 682.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b456-4\">The act of 1891 provides for subrogation and not assignment in the ordinary sense, as assumed by the court below.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b456-5\">The verdict against the wrong-doer does not fix the amount of the loss as between the insured and the insurer. It is res inter alios acta: Ins. Co. v. McClaren, 12 Ont. 682; Ins. Co. v. Confer, 158 Pa. 598.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b456-6\"><em>James </em>Bredin, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AEh\">Where the assured has sustained loss beyond that paid by the insurers the entire liability must be determined in the same suit, an action for a single tort being indivisible: Sheldon on Subrogation, \u00a7 229; Wood on Fire Ins. \u00a7 473; Flanders on Fire Ins. \u00a7 648; Hart v. R. R., 13 Metc. 99; Ins. Co. v. Erie Ry., 73 N. Y. 399; Ins. Co. v. Hutchinson, 21 N. J. Eq. 107; Steam Co. v. Ph\u0153nix Ins. Co., 129 U. S. 398; Bean v. R. R., 58 Mo. 82; Hall v. R.

Fidelity Co., 123 Pa. 526.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b456-7\">The fact that the suit against the gas company was not brought by the insured until after the insurance, companies had paid him the amount for which they were liable does not change the legal effect of the recovery against the gas company: Darrell v. Tibbitts, L. R. 5 Q. B. D. 560.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b456-8\">They were proper parties to the suit; were named on the record; had a direct interest in the result, and, as admitted by appellant in his answer to their petition, did take an active part in the prosecution of the suit, as they had a right to do. This brought them within the rules as parties to the action, bound by the judgment: Greenl. Ev. \u00a7 523; Peterson v. Lothrop, 34 Pa. 223; Giltinan v. Strong, 64 Pa. 242; Lloyd v. Barr, 11 Pa. 41.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ALE\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>Jan. 7, 1895:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b457-2\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"ASf\">Me. Justice Mitchell,</author>\n<p id=\"b457-3\">The plaintiff brought his suit against the gas company for his whole loss, and prima facie the verdict must be considered as representing the whole loss. That was the question at issue, and it has been determined by the tribunal which has authority to conclude it. In this case there is nothing to rebut this presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">Subrogation is based upon equity, and no doubt the statute, in directing through its standard form of insurance policy the subrogation of the insurers to the rights of the insured against the party primarily responsible for the loss, meant that it should be administered on equitable principles. But the effect of the statute is to put such subrogation on the footing of a legal right, which must prevail unless a stronger equity be shown against it. In the first instance it relieves the insurer who has paid his policy, from the burden of showing his equity to subrogation, because it is now an express legal right given by the statute and the contract of the parties. If it is not to prevail, the burden of showing why, must be assumed by the other party. Such burden has not been met by the appellant. There may be cases where the wrongdoer would not be liable for the plaintiff\u2019s whole loss, as where after an interval of time, or the intrusion of some other agency, an additional .loss occurs of which the wrongful act is not the proximate cause and yet which would be covered by the insurance. Such an instance is suggested by Haverly v. R. R. Co., 135 Pa. 50. In those cases the verdict would not be the measure of the plaintiff\u2019s loss, and therefore of the insurer\u2019s right to subrogation out of it, but such cases are exceptional and should be proved. The presumption, at least for the purpose of distribution, is that the verdict represents the whole of the loss. As said by our Brother Williams in Ins. Co. v. Fidelity Co., 123 Pa. 523, \u201c if the insured had proceeded against the gas company a recovery against it for the loss by fire would when paid have reimbursed the insured, and his claim being thus satisfied no recovery could have been had against the insurance company.\u201d What was said in \u00c6tna Ins. Co. v. Confer, 158 Pa. 598, 605, upon the non-conclusiveness of the judgment as to the loss, was said in illustration of the policy of this court not to express any opinion upon the merits of a case before it on the sufficiency of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>affidavit of defence, and is sustained by the consideration of the exceptional cases already referred to. There is nothing shown in the present case to take it out of the general rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
