Skilton, 13 Pa. 152; Biddle\u2019s Est., 28 Pa. 59; Schoonmaker v. Stockton, 37 Pa. 461; Fahrney v. Holsinger, 65 Pa. 388; Morrison v.

Chief Justice Steebett,</author>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">Although the devise to Amanda Stephens was made before the act of 1833 and without words of inheritance, yet, when read in connection with the introductory clause of James S. Stevenson\u2019s will, there is a plain intent manifested in the first instance to give her an absolute estate. In McCullough v. Gilmore, 11 Pa. 370, where substantially the same expression was used, this court said: \u201c These words, and the like of them, are generally carried down into the corpus of the will, to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>that the testator meant to dispose of his whole interest in a particular devise, unless words are used which plainly indicate an intent to limit it.\u201d Numerous cases to the same effect are cited in Schriver v. Meyer,19 Pa. 87. The first taker is always the favorite object of testator\u2019s bounty and as such entitled to the benefit of every implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">There are no words used in the second paragraph of the will, containing the devise to Amanda, which indicate any intent to limit her estate. Had the will stopped there, the devise would unquestionably have been absolute. ' The following paragraph was not intended to operate by way of limitation, but was manifestly substitutionary in its character. The thought would very naturally occur to testator to make an alternative devise for the contingency of Amanda\u2019s dying without issue, Biddle\u2019s Ap., 28 Pa. 59; and this was in effect what was done. \u201cIn the event,\u201d said testator, \u201cof Amanda dying unmarried, or if married, dying without offspring by her husband, then these lots are to be sold, and the proceeds to be divided equally among the heirs of John Barber.\u201d The word \u201c offspring \u201d here used is but a synonym for \u201c issue; \u201d and \u201c issue \u201d cannot be lawful without marriage. The devise is then in the first Instance to Amanda; and in the event of her dying without issue over to alternative beneficiaries. Dying without issue was thus made the contingency upon which the substituted beneficiaries could take: Coles v. Ayres, 156 Pa. 197. But death when? Where, as here, there is nothing to indicate an adverse intent, additional limitations dependent on no other contingency than is implied from the language, \u201c if any of them die,\u201d or \u201c in case of death,\u201d or the like, cannot be referred to the event whenever it may happen,\u2014for that would be to give a forced construction to the words,\u2014but must be construed as referring to death in association with some additional circumstance which makes it actually contingent. That circumstance is said to be naturally in regard to the time of happening, and that time, where, as here, the gift is immediate, is necessarity the death of the testator, there being no other period to which the death can refer: Caldwell v. Skilton, 18 Pa. 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">This view is strengthened by the presumption that, in the absence of a fixed period, the power of sale was intended to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>exercised at' a near, rather than a remote, period after testator\u2019s death: Hill on Trustees, 474. The circumstances which gave rise to the creation of the power must necessarily change, and perhaps entirely disappear in the lapse of time. \u201c A power of sale without limit would doubtless,\u201d said Mr. Justice Clark, in Wilkinson v. Buist, 124 Pa. 253, 261, \u201cbe bad, under the rule against perpetuities, and a testator will not be presumed to have intended anything so absurd.\u201d The intended exercise of the power of sale given in this will is referable to the period either of (1) testator\u2019s death, or (2) a definite, or (3) an indefinite failure of issue. The last may at once be dismissed as too remote; while, as between the other two periods, it is scarce within the range of probability that testator should have intended sale after a long life. The change of circumstances might be radical, whereas at testator\u2019s death the change would in all probability be relatively small.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-3\">Another consideration of weight is that testator had in view living persons as substituted beneficiaries\u2014the gift over is to the \u201c heirs,\u201d and therefore the children, of John Barber who was living\u2014and the natural inference is he intended them to take as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">The suggestion that, because of Amanda Stephens\u2019 extreme youth, testator could not have had in contemplation the contingency of her marriage and death without issue in his lifetime, is without merit. No presumption could arise from the fact of making a will that testator expected to die before she should attain a marriageable age. So far as appears from the record, he may have had an expectation of long life. But whatever his expectations, he expressly meets both aspects of the case by providing that \u201cin the event of her dying unmarried, or if married, dying\u201d without issue, the estate should go over. She might die in her infancy unmarried, or marry and die leaving no issue in his lifetime; and the gift over to the substituted donees would prevent lapse.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">There is no reason for discrimination against her on account of age. She was the favorite object of the testator\u2019s bounty; and having survived him, became thereupon seized of the absolute estate intended for her.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">The judgment of the court below should therefore be affirmed,</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
