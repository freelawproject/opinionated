No safety gates were maintained at the crossings, which were guarded by one watchman, a man some seventy-five years old. The boy ivas struck by two cars which had been detached from the seashore express in order to allow another ear to be connected with that train ahead of them. The evidence as to the speed of the cars was conflicting. Some of the witnesses estimated it at ten and others at four miles an hour.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-8\">The child\u2019s mother testified as follows: \u201c I am the wife of Julius, and mother of Sydney Lederman, lived at 36 East Walnut street, on July 3,1891. I last saw my little boy when he left the dinner table about or near one o\u2019clock, R. M. We ate in the dining-room. You go from it through the kitchen out in the yard. He said he was going out to where Harry Marshall was selling shooting crackers. He had been helping him all morning. Harry Marshall lived a few doors from us, on the same side of the street towards North Queen street. He went out the kitchen way, and out through the alley, and I didn\u2019t see him again until they brought his body home. I heard of his death about fifteen minutes after he left the house. ... I had not sent Sydney on an errand. I did not direct him where to go. He went to Harry Marshall at his stand where he was selling shooting crackers to help him ; it was just a stand for over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>July.

[7] John Keneagy, called by defendant, testified as follows: \u201cI remember, the accident, July 3, 1891, when the boy was killed. I was working on the railroad, was foreman of the floating gang, track men, west of Lemon street about 500 feet. I saw the seashore express go by, it was divided into two parts before it passed me and the front part was drawing away from the rear part. I could see the rear part go past Lemon street, after that I didn\u2019t look at it. I have been about the railroad for 14 years. Saw cars run and rode on them. Q. What, in your judgment, was the \u00abrate of speed of these two detached cars when they passed you, and what at Lemon street?\u201d Objected to, disallowed and exception. [9]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-7\">The court charged in part as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-8\">\u201c [During the argument of the case reference has been made to the speed of those two detached passenger cars. With reference to which the testimony of witnesses differs, some fixing the rate as low as four miles an hour, some as high as ten miles, and the ordinances of the city of Lancaster have been cited and referred to as showing that running cars at a higher speed than five miles an hour, is negligence on the part of the company. This is an error; while it may be considered in ascertaining whether the train was being run negligently, or not, it is not per se evidence of negligence.] [5] ....</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-9\">\u201c [The Supreme Court say, in a late case, that if a railroad company makes it safe for the public to cross on the highway, by gates, by watchman, or other means, it may run its trains at any rate of speed, but if it neglects to use every precaution necessary for the safety of the public, no moderation of speed will excuse its neglect.] \u201d [6]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Defendant\u2019s -points were among others as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-3\">\u201c 2. The ordinance given in evidence, limiting the rate of speed of cars and trains on any railroad within the limits of the city of Lancaster to five miles an hour, is unreasonable and invalid, and does not make a higher rate of speed of cars or trains in or through said city unlawful, or evidence of negligence on the part of a railroad company using such higher rate of speed. <em>Answer: </em>It is not necessary in this proceeding to consider whether or not the ordinance referred to is unreasonable and invalid or not. While it is not perse evidence of negligence in a railroad company, if it should run its cars at any higher rate of speed than five miles per hour, it may be taken into consideration by the jury, with other evidence, in ascertaining whether or not the cars on July 3, 1891, were run at too high and dangerous a rate of speed where this accident occurred.\u201d [1] \u201c3. As there was a watchman attending to and performing his duties at Prince street and Walnut street, where the defendant\u2019s railroad crosses said streets, and there was a brakeman performing his duties, on the front end of the front car of the two detached cars that ran over Sidney Lederman on Walnut street, there is no evidence of negligence on the part of the defendant as to the running or movement of said' cars across said streets. <em>Answer: </em>The facts set forth in the 3d point are under the evidence in the cause for the jury and we leave them with the jury, to say whether there was negligence.\u201d [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-4\">\u201c 5. There is no sufficient evidence that the speed of the said two detached cars at Walnut street was improper or dangerous, or that the accident to the boy was the result of any improper or unreasonable speed of said cars. <em>Answer : </em>The matter contained in 5th point is for the jury. We leave it with them.\u201d [3] 6. Request for binding instruction. Refused.

From the point of severance to the station there was a descending grade, and the railway tracks crossed three streets diagonally. When the detached cars were between Lemon and Walnut streets the brake was \u201c thrown off to get a little more momentum and headway,\u201d and at the crossing of the latter they ran over and killed the plaintiff\u2019s child. There were no gates at this crossing, but there was an old man there whose duty it was to watch two crossings and see that persons walking or driving on Prince street or Walnut street did not get in the way of the trains. The evidence in regard to the speed of the cars at the point where the accident oc-. curred was conflicting, some of the witnesses estimating it at ten, and others at four miles an hour. The crossings watched as above-stated were in a populous district of the city and there was a large amount of travel over them. No signal announced the approach of the cars to the crossing unless the waving of the watchman\u2019s flag can be regarded as such. In the presence of the undisputed facts and the conflicting testimony to which we have referred, the defendant company requests us to say there was no negligence on its part in connection with the occurrence under investigation. This we cannot do. In view of the great age and consequent infirmity of the watchman, there is room for doubt respecting his fitness for the duty with which he was charged. But waiving this and assuming that he was competent for the work assigned to him, did the company make adequate provision for and have due regard to the safety of persons walking or driving upon the streets in the vicinity of these crossings ? As we have already seen, the crossings were in a populous district, and there was necessarily considerable travel over them on foot and in vehicles. Can a solitary watchman stationed on a corner bounded by the railway tracks and the intersected streets properly warn persons traveling upon these streets of the approach of a train ? To do so he must wave his flag where all persons approaching the crossings can see it, and he must be careful to note that the little box or house on his corner does not obstruct the view <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>from any direction. Ought the company to have maintained gates at these crossings ? Ought it to have allowed the detached cars to descend upon them at the rate of ten miles an hour with \u201c the brake thrown off to get a little more momentum and headway ? \u201d These were questions to be answered by the jury upon the evidence, and therefore the learned court below did not err in refusing to affirm the company\u2019s third point.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-3\">The latter, however, contends that it has a defence to the action in the negligence of the plaintiff in permitting the child to go upon.the.streets alone in the manner described in the testimony. But this contention also presented, in our opinion, a question for the jury, to whom it was referred in appropriate instructions. It is for them and not for the learned court below, or for us, to say whether the implied permission given by the mother to the child to go to a near neighbor\u2019s on the same street to help his playmate sell \u201c shooting crackers \u201d from a stand erected at his own home constituted negligence which satisfied the company\u2019s contention on this point: Long et ux. v. Phila. &amp; Reading Railroad Company, 75 Pa. 257, and Dunseath v. Traction Co., 161 Pa. 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">We discover nothing in the rulings upon offers of evidence which calls for a reversal of the judgment. That the company very soon after the accident erected gates at the crossing where it occurred was a fact for the consideration of the jury: Penna. R. R. Co. v. Henderson, 51 Pa. 315; West Chester &amp; Phila. R. R. Co. v. McElwee, 67 Pa. 311; and McKee v. Bidwell, 74 Pa. 218. The evidence was particularly pertinent in this case because the jury had been upon the ground, and had seen the gates there. To rebut an inference that the gates were there at the time of the accident it was proper to inform them when they were erected.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Ample opportunity was afforded the company to show the speed of the cars near to and at the crossing. John Keneagy was five hundred feet west of Lemon street, and did not see the cars after they crossed it. He was not very well qualified to speak of their speed after \u201c the brakes were thrown off \u201d and they were nearing the point where the accident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">We are not convinced that the court erred in overruling the objections to and admitting the ordinance in relation to the speed of railway trains within the city limits, or in the instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>tions to the jury respecting the consideration they should give to it in connection with the other'evidence in the case : Penna. R. R. Co. v. Lewis, 79 Pa. 33, and Lane v. Atlantic Works, 111 Mass. 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
