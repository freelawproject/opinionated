Section 4\u00b1 provided that \u2018To prevent all disputes and litigation it is further agreed by and between the parties to this contract that the engineer shall in all cases determine the quantity and quality of the several kinds of work which are to be paid for under this contract, and their decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>shall be final and conclusive in the premises; and they shall determine all questions in relation to lines, levels and dimensions of the work, or as to the interpretation of the plans and specifications.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-4\">\u201c The comprehensive language of this section covers all questions or disputes that might arise between the contracting parties, and is also conclusive upon the city. It embraces materials as well as work, for it embraces all \u2018 which are to be paid for under this contract.\u2019 The cit}r engineer was made the final arbiter in all matters.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-5\">\u201c The affidavit of claim avers that theplaintiffs performed said contract, under the directions of F. W. Patterson, city engineer of said city, and to his satisfaction; . . . . that at the completion of the work, the said engineer made a final estimate thereof, showing the amounts due plaintiffs; . . . . and plaintiffs, during the year following the completion of the work, made all repairs required by said engineer.\u2019 None of these averments is denied in the affidavit of defence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-6\">\u201c The contention of the defendants is, that the engineer was negligent and careless in superintending the work, and making his estimates; that some of the materials\u2014bricks and curbstones\u2014are not the kinds required in the contract; that the foundation of the brick pavement is not in accordance with the contract; that his estimates for grading and other work are excessive.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-7\">\u201cThe affidavit also states that the defendants made complaint of these matters to the city engineer during the progress of the work, and after its completion; that the engineer made some correction in his estimates. It thus appears that the city engineer, the arbiter appointed in this contract, was appealed to upon these disputed questions, and he passed upon them. Is not his decision final and conclusive ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-8\">\u201cThe measurements and calculations of Mr. Taylor, an engineer employed by the defendants, differ considerably from those of the city engineer. Which is correct ? It was for this, very purpose of preventing just such \u2018 disputes,\u2019 and avoiding \u2018litigation,\u2019 that the parties agreed that the city engineer\u2019s \u2018 decision shall be final and conclusive in the premises.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-9\">\u201c There is no allegation of fraud or collusion between the city engineer and the plaintiffs. The only averments are that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>the city engineer was negligent and careless and made mistakes. Take all the facts set forth in the affidavit of defence and they amount to nothing more than this. When the parties agreed to make his decision final and conclusive, they waived the risk of negligence and mistakes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-3\">\u201c The principle governing cases of this kind has been sustained by numerous decisions, from Monongahela Nav. Co. v. Fenlon, 4 W. &amp; S. 205, to Hart\u00fcpee v. City of Pittsburg, 131 Pa. 535. Fraud will impeach and set aside any award or judgment. But it must be an \u2018 actual and intentional \u2019 fraud, as said in Hostetter v. City of Pittsburg, 107 Pa. 419, \u2018 and not constructive, such as flows from an erroneous or unjust judgment. Partiality and some improper conduct of the arbitrator in making the award will not impeach it unless the party benefited thereby be implicated in that misconduct.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-4\">\u201c Rule for judgment made absolute.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-5\"><em>Frror assigned </em>was above order.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b421-6\"><em>tT.

Curiam,</author>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">We find nothing in the affidavit of defence that can be regarded as a sufficient answer to the conclusive effect given, by the 44th section of the contract, to the decision of the engineer in relation to the several matters therein specified. There is no allegation of fraud or collusion between the plaintiffs and the city engineer. Averments to the effect that the latter was <em>negligent </em>and made mistakes are not sufficient. When the parties agreed that, \u201cto prevent all disputes and litigation,\u201d his decision, as to any of the matters referred to,should \u201cbe final and conclusive,\u201d they impliedly assumed the risk of negligence and consequent mistakes.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">Further consideration of the questions involved is unnecessary. They are sufficiently presented and rightly disposed of in the opinion of the court below, and on it we affirm the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
