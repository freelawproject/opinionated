J. Eddie, assistant teller. The check itself has not been presented to the auditor, but it is conceded that, at and prior to the time of the assignment, the Penn Bank was indebted to the Germania Savings Bank, $88,000, and that said indebtedness was evidenced by said check of its assistant teller, drawn to the order of the treasurer of the Ger-mania Bank, and passed into the custody of said last named bank as its property, prior to the date of the assignment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-5\">\u201c Prior to the date of the assignment, the Germania Savings Bank agreed to discount and did discount for the Penn Bank four promissory notes, each dated May 23, 1884, each for the sum of $10,625, pa3uible at 30, 60, 90 days and four months, respectively, each made by W. N. Riddle, A. A. Hutchinson, J. O. Bx-own, F. B. Laughlin, T. Brent Swearingen, George C. Davis, D. W. C. Carroll, S. Severance and Thos. Flare, and each indorsed \u2018 G. L. Reiber, cashier.\u2019 These notes, aggregating $42,500, were discounted by the Germania Savings Bank, either on May 23, 1884, or May 24, 1884. (Mr. Charles Seibert, the secretary and treasurer of the Germania Savings Bank, at that time, testifies that to the best of his recollection the notes, were discounted on May 23, but in the books of the Germania Bank it appears that the proceeds of these notes, amounting to $41,942.21, were credited on May 24, 1884, to \u2018 G. L. Reiber, cashier.\u2019) On May 24, \u2018 G. L. Reiber, cashier,\u2019 was charged with the proceeds of discount, for which he received two checks, one on the German National Bank of Pittsburg, for amounts aggregating $41,942.21. Mr. Reiber, the cashier of the Penn Bank, had, on the morning of the 24th of May, 1894, sent a check on the Germania Savings Bank to that bank for the amount of the proceeds of the discount of the four notes, and the Germania Savings Bank thereupon made two checks, to the order of the Penn Bank, each dated Ma3&gt;- 24, 1884, one on the Third National Bank for $21,942.21 and the other on the German National Bank for $20,000. These checks were delivered to the Penn Bank on May 24th. On the same day (May 24th,) the Germania Savings Bank deposited with the Farmers\u2019 Deposit National Bank of Pittsburg, which repre-, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>sented the Penn Bank in the Clearing House, the $88,000 check for collection, and the Penn Bank deposited with the Farmers\u2019 Deposit National Bank, also for collection, the two checks for $41,942.21 on the German National and the Third National Banks.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-5\">[\u201c The Penn Bank had closed its doors on May 21, 1884, and did not re-open them to the public until May 23, 1884. In the meanwhile, for the purpose of enabling it to re-open its doors and resume business, certain banks of the city of Pitts-burg, including the Germania Savings Bank, agreed to loan it money, and these four notes, given by the directors of the Penn Bank, were discounted by the Germania Savings Bank, in pursuance of said agreement.] [3] May 24th was Saturday, and the three checks last mentioned were not presented for payment until May 26th, on which date they were presented through the Clearing House. The Penn Bank was unable to pay its cheek, and refused payment at the time it was presented. The other two checks passed through the Clearing House and went to the banks on which they were drawn, but they were not paid, because the officers of the Germania Savings Bank, about noon of May 26, 1884, and immediately on receiving information that the Penn Bank had refused to pay the $88,000 check, stopped their payment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-6\">\u201c The steps taken to stop payment were within the rules of the Clearing House Association, and the Germania Savings Bank had the right to do so. The two checks having been returned to the Farmers\u2019 Deposit National Bank, that bank charged them back to the Penn Bank. On May 26, 1884, the Penn Bank again closed its doors, and on May 28th made an assignment. On May 26th the Farmers\u2019 Deposit National Bank charged back to the Germania Savings Bank the $88,000 check, and tendered the check to the Germania Bank, which tender was refused. On the same day the Germania Bank had ch\u00e9eked out $2,447.50 as against the $88,000, but on the next day it returned to the Farmers\u2019 Bank the money checked out. Subsequently, at the instance of the assignee of the Penn Bank, the Farmers\u2019 Deposit National Bank entered suits against the Third National Bank and the German National Bank, to recover on the two checks given by the Germania Savings Bank on these banks, to the order of the Perm Bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>\u201c These suits were brought in this court at Nos. 707 and 708 June Term, 1885, respectively. The one against the German National Bank was tried, and a verdict and judgment were had thereon for the amount of the claim, but the Supreme Court reversed the judgment, on the ground that the Germania Savings Bank had the right to stop payment of the check ; that it exercised that right before the actual payment; that it was within the rules of the Clearing House Association in doing so, and that the Blirmers\u2019 Deposit National Bank, being the mere agent of the Penn Bank for collection, had no right of action against the German National Bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-5\">\u201c This case is reported in 118 Pa. 294. The suit against the .Third National Bank, because of this decision, was not tried.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-6\">\u201c On May 27, 1884, the Germania Savings Bank sent a written notice to the Farmers\u2019 Deposit National Bank to apply all moneys in its hands or thereafter to be received for or on account of the Penn Bank, to the payment of the $88,000 check. The Farmers\u2019 Bank had, at that time, and on the day of the assignment, $23,218.29 which belonged to the Penn Bank.' At No. 302 Sept. Term, 1884, of this court, the Penn Bank, for use of Henry Warner, Assignee, brought suit against the Farmers\u2019 Deposit National Bank to recover the amount of this deposit of the Penn Bank. The Farmers\u2019 Bank claimed the right to set off the $88,000 check, and the Supreme Court sustained its claim. The case is reported in 123 Pa. 283. A venire facias de novo having been awarded, the Farmers\u2019 Bank was given, at the second trial, a certificate as against the Penn Bank for $64,781.71, being the difference between $88,000 and $23,218.29. This judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court in 130 Pa. 209.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-7\">\u201cIn the meanwhile, the Farmers\u2019 Deposit National Bank, being the holder of the $88,000 check, presented it to Hon. C. Magee, the auditor appointed to distribute the funds in the hands of the assignee, as shown by his first account. The auditor distributed to this check the sum of $5,170. The four notes for $10,625 each were also presented to the said auditor, and he distributed to the Germania Savings Bank the sum of $2,496.87 on account thereof, the sums being the pro rata shares to which the respective parties were entitled on the face of their claims. The notes themselves were paid to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>Germania Savings Bank by the Directors of tbe Penn Bank afterwards.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-4\">\u201c On Dec. 5, 1889, the foregoing litigation having been concluded, and the Farmers\u2019 Deposit National Bank, so far as concerned the $88,000 check, having acted as mere agent of tbe Germania Savings Bank, the Farmers\u2019 Bank returned to the Germania Savings Bank the check for $88,000, and at the same time paid to said Germania Bank the $23,218.29 which it had retained out of the funds of the Penn Bank, and the $5,170 which had been allowed by the auditor as a dividend on the $88,000 check. It also assigned to the Germania Bank the certificate for $64,781.71 which it had obtained against the Penn Bank.

The assignee denied that they were under anjr obligation to pay them, and that they had any right to pay them. The master allowed them credit for the payment of said notes.

There can be no question about this statement of affairs so far as the facts are concerned. They are admitted by the officers of the Germania Savings Bank, in the case of Warner, Assignee, v.

Justice Mitchell,</author>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">The facts are mainly undisputed, the only difference as to them between the parties being whether the appellant\u2019s agreement to discount the four notes for the Penn Bank was conditional on the paymeut of the latter\u2019s check for $88,000. But if we look at the substance of the agreement, and what took place under it, the question whether it was conditional or not becomes immaterial. Taking its own version, the appellant was to be paid the check of eighty eight thousand dollars, and, to enable the Penn Bank to pay it, appellant was to lend the Penn forty thousand dollars the proceeds of the discount of the four notes made by the directors of the Penn, and look to the makers of the notes for payment. In effect this agreement was nothing more or less than a division by appellant of its claim against the Penn Bank into two portions\u2014one of which was to be paid by the Penn itself at once, and the other by the makers of the notes as the latter matured. If the agreement had been carried out as made, the appellant would have received eightj? eight thousand dollars at once for payment in full, and would have paid out forty thousand for which it would have held the four notes of ten thousand each, made by the guaranteeing directors of the Penn. Instead of going through however the plan failed, the Penn was unable to pay its eighty eight thousand dollar check, but the appellant got the four notes, and when it stopped payment of the checks it had drawn in favor of the cashier of the Penn for the proceeds, it had thus got or kept the notes for nothing. The whole consideration to the directors of the Penn for making the notes was to obtain the loan of forty thousand dollars, to help, with other loans, the Penn to open its doors again and resume payment. The appellant got those notes on the promise to make the loan, but in fact never made it, and never parted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>with a dollar of money in return for them. Stripped of immaterial details and the complications of mere book-keeping, this is the whole case.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">It is too late for appellant to say that these notes should not be deducted from its claim on the Penn Bank\u2019s check. Conceding that when that check was not paid on May 26,1884, the agreement was broken and it had a right to stop payment of its own checks in favor of Penn\u2019s cashier, none the less, it had by the transaction received forty thousand dollars for which it had given nothing.- Its duty was, <em>on </em>stopping its own checks, to have returned the notes to their makers thus rescinding the agreement altogether and restoring the status quo. But it did not do so, on the contrary it kept the notes and exacted payment from their makers. To this it had not the shadow of a claim except as a payment <em>on </em>account of the eighty eight thousand dollar check. It is not worth while to discuss whether this is a technical set-off, or a defalcation under our statute, because it is entirely clear that it was in equity a partial payment. Appellant\u2019s own dealings with these forty thousand dollars show that it treated them as a partial payment. As already said, there was no other justification for enforcing payment of the notes, or retaining a single dollar of the proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">The case of Warner v. Hare, 154 Pa. 548, decides nothing that affects this matter. That case was between other parties, and the issue was not the amount of the Penn Bank\u2019s debt to the present appellant but the right of the makers of the notes to a credit for payment of them in an account for collaterals received from the Penn Bank. The amount of the appellant\u2019s judgment was not in controversy there, and the decision is not an adjudication of such amount that is conclusive upon the other creditors here.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Nor is there any place here for the application of Miller\u2019s Appeal, 35 Pa. 481, and other cases which hold that a creditor of an insolvent estate is entitled to a dividend on his whole claim at the time of the assignment although he may have received subsequently a partial payment from collaterals or another fund. The directors\u2019 notes for forty thousand dollars received by the appellant were not collaterals for or on account of the present claim on the eighty eight thousand dollar check, but for the forty thousand loan to the Penh Bank which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>never made, and as already said the retention of the notes and enforcing payment can only be sustained as a direct partial payment in reduction of the claim. The directors making it were protected by the transfer of securities of the Penn Bank, which thus diminished the assets going to the other creditors. It was not therefore a dividend received by appellant from another fund but a diminution of the same fund as that to which th.e creditors in this proceeding had to look, and as against those creditors a dividend now on the full sum of eighty eight thousand dollars would, as well said by the learned auditor, be a \u201c payment a second time on those notes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Decree affirmed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
