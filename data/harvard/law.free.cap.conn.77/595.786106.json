The latter appeared for the State at the hearing, and a certificate was signed by <em>Judge Wheeler </em>containing a finding as to the material facts alleged in the complaint; stating certain questions of law which were raised by the complainant and \u201c which he claims should be reviewed by the Supreme Court of Errors\u201d; and concluding thus: \u201cWherefore, pursuant to the terms of \u00a7 1684 of the General Statutes of Connecticut of 1902, and by agreement of the counsel herein represented, the undersigned hereby transmits this certificate, including a copy of the complaint, which is hereto annexed, together with this finding of facts, and the complainant\u2019s questions of law, to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Errors.\u201d This course was taken in the belief on the part of the counsel for the plaintiff and the Attorney-General that it was a proper mode of bringing the questions of law so stated before the Supreme Court of - Errors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b608-6\">The Chief Justice, on receipt of the certificate, acting under General Statutes, \u00a7 1684,-called a special session of the court, at the opening of which, at the request of the court, the question of jurisdiction was first argued.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b608-7\"><em>George D. </em>Watrous, for the complainant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b608-8\"><em>William A. </em>King, Attorney-General, for the State.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b608-9\">The Attorney-General stated that he interposed no objection to the consideration of the questions of law presented by the certificate.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b608-10\">The court retired for consultation, and on its return dismissed the cause for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b608-11\">Baldwin, J.

These sections contemplate action by this court only by way of review of questions of law decided by a judge of the Superior Court. His certificate of his \u201c finding or decision,\u201d if he find that there was \u201c any error in the rulings of the moderator, or any mistake in the count of said votes,\u201d is to be transmitted to the secretary of the State, in which case it is made \u201c final and conclusive upon all questions relating to errors in the rulings of said moderators and to the correctness of said count, and shall operate to correct the returns of such moderators or presiding officers so as to conform to such finding or decision, unless the same be appealed from as hereinafter provided.\u201d The provision to which reference is thus made is found in \u00a7 1684, which reads as follows :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-8\">\u201c If, upon any such hearing by a judge of the superior court, any question of law shall be raised, which any party to the complaint shall claim should be reviewed by the supreme court of errors, such judge, instead of filing the certificate of his finding or decision with the secretary of state, shall transmit the same, including therein such questions of law, together with a proper finding of facts, to the chief justice of the supreme court of errors, who shall thereupon call a special session of said court for the purpose of an immediate hearing upon the questions of law so certified; and a copy of the finding and decision so certified by the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>of the superior court, together with the decision of the supreme court of errors on the questions of law therein certified, shall he duly attested by the clerk of the supreme court of errors, and by him transmitted to the secretary of state on or before the third Monday of the December next succeeding such election <em>; </em>and the finding and decision of the judge of the superior court, together with the decision of the supreme court of errors on the questions of law thus certified, shall be final and conclusive upon all questions relating to errors in the rulings of said moderators and to the correctness of said count, and shall operate to correct the returns of such moderators or presiding officers so as to conform to such decision of said court.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-6\">It thus appears that the certificate of the judge of the Superior Court is to be filed with the secretary of the State unless his \u201c finding or decision \u201d be \u201c appealed from \u201d by a party to the proceeding, who desires that a question of law raised before the judge may \u201c be reviewed \u201d by this court. There can be no judicial review of a question of law which has not been previously determined. No decision of any of the questions of law which were raised before- <em>Judge Wheeler </em>was made by him. There is therefore nothing to review and the cause is dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-8\">After the dismissal of the case by this court on December 9th, 1904, the parties appeared before <em>Judge Wheeler </em>and requested him to decide the issues.raised upon the hearing previously held by him, and to transmit a certificate of his finding and decision thereon to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Errors. This request was complied with, and a decision rendered which upheld the rulings and action of the moderator; and a certificate thereof was transmitted to the Chief Justice on December 14th, 1904. On the same day the complainant gave notice of appeal to this court, and on December 20th filed his appeal, which was taken to the term next to be held, in the third judicial dis - trict on the third Tuesday of January, 1905.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AJ0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number><em>Henry T. Blake </em>and <em>Greorge D. Watrous, </em>for the appellant (complainant).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"An7\"><em>William </em>A. <em>King, </em>Attorney-General, for the State.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b611-7\">Hamersley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AnSU\">The complaint is based upon sections of a statute passed in 1895, which, as amended in 1897, appear as \u00a7\u00a7 1688 and 1684 in the Revision of 1902. This Act, entitled \u201c An Act to secure Correct Returns by Moderators' of Electors\u2019 Meetings,\u201d in substance provides that a judge of the Superior Court, or the Supreme Court of Errors upon an appeal in the form of a certificate transmitted by the judge, may, during the period between the day of a State election and the day fixed for the completion of the canvass of the votes by the constitutional board of canvassers, correct the list of votes given at any electors\u2019 meeting, prepared and certified at that meeting and transmitted to the secretary of State in the manner prescribed in the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">Where the title to an office is in issue in an action brought against a <em>de facto </em>possessor by a <em>de jure </em>claimant affirming his election to office, the court may determine the very right of the election, and, in this investigation, is not necessarily bound by acts of the ministerial officers who conducted the process of election; and where an office is created by statute, or where a statute alone regulates the mode of ascertaining the result of an election to office, it may provide for an action which shall judicially determine the conflicting rights of claimants under an election, before either has taken possession of the office. But an Act of the legislature-which authorizes a court to intervene and control the action of executive officers in ascertaining the result of a State election, during the process of ascertaining that result as prescribed by tire Constitution, presents a novel question, involving, according as the provisions of the Act may be construed, other questions of the highest importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">We cannot review the action of the Superior Court judge without passing upon these questions, or some of them. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>But we cannot adjudicate any question involved in the judge\u2019s action, not even the preliminary one of the validity of the application, unless that action is brought before us for review by some process authorized by law. This \u201c appeal \u201d is not such process. The appeal was allowed after the time, Within which any action of this court to effectuate the purpose contemplated by the Act could be taken in accordance with its provisions, had expired. It is plain, and admitted, that the appeal does not follow the method prescribed by the Act of 1895 for transferring to this court the questions raised before the judge. It is evident from the nature and purpose of the Act that the method prescribed is intended to be exclusive of any other method. For this reason, and because the certificate before us is not a final judgment within the meaning of the statute authorizing appeals to this court, the appeal is not authorized by \u00a7 807 relating to appeals from the final judgments of a judge of the Superior Court. The case must therefore be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">It is ordered that the case be erased from the docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
