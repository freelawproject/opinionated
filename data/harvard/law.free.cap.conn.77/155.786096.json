JS,\u201d it appeared that defendant requested the plaintiff to pay $50 to C?, an attorney, to procure a settlement of said case, that the plaintiff in pursuance of said request released to <em>G </em>a debt owed by <em>G </em>to him, and <em>G </em>accepted said release in payment of his services for defendant. <em>Held </em>that the variance as to the mode of payment was immaterial, and that the trial court properly refused to charge that the jury must render a verdict for the defendant.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b167-8\">If a cause of action is substantially stated in the complaint, defects in the mode of statement are waived by pleading a general denial and going to trial on that issue.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b167-9\">Where the issue is whether the defendant requested the plaintiff to pay <em>G </em>a certain sum for his services, the real value of the services of <em>G </em>is immaterial.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"AYs\">Argued June 8th</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AN0s\">decided August 12th, 1904.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-11\">Action to recover money alleged to have been paid at the request of the defendant, brought by appeal from a judgment of a justice of the peace to the Court of Common Pleas in New Haven County and tried to the jury before Bishop, <em>J.; </em>verdict and judgment for the plaintiff, and appeal by the defendant.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"A5k\">\n<em>No error.</em>\n</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-12\">The complaint contained eleven paragraphs, each purporting to allege a separate cause of action. Before trial the plaintiff abandoned all his allegations except the following : \u201c On and before March 1st, 1902, the plaintiff paid, laid out, and expended the sum of $75 for the defendant. Said sum is justly due to the plaintiff from the defendant and the defendant has never paid the same. The plaintiff claims $100 damages.\u201d An amendment was filed in the following form : \u201c Bill of Particulars. To cash paid at request of defendant in settling case of State v. Barnes before Court of Common Pleas, $50.\u201d The defendant answered by deny<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>ing \u201c the truth of matters in plaintiff\u2019s complaint and bill of particulars.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-6\">Upon trial to the jury, evidence was produced by plaintiff and defendant, without objection, upon which the plaintiff claimed to have proved, among other facts, the following: In 1901 the defendant was convicted of a breach of the peace and sentenced to be imprisoned for thirty days and to pay a fine of $25 ; he transferred the cause by appeal to the Court of Common Pleas, giving a bond for prosecution in which the plaintiff was his surety; he desired to settle this cause by arranging with the Prosecuting Attorney that his punishment upon a plea of guilty should be limited to a fine; for the purpose of securing such a settlement the services of Mr. Jacob P. Goodhart, at an agreed price of $50, were secured by the defendant through the plaintiff at an interview between Mr. Goodhart, the plaintiff and defendant; following Mr. Goodhart\u2019s efforts to arrange the settlement desired, the defendant pleaded guilty and was sentenced to pay a fine of $15. At the time of the foregoing facts Mr. Goodhart was justly indebted to the plaintiff in the sum of $50 ; after the settlement of the defendant\u2019s case the plaintiff gave Mr. Goodhart a receipt for said sum and a release in full of such indebtednessin settlement of Mr. Goodhart\u2019s charge against the defendant; this payment to Goodhart by the. plaintiff was made with .the knowledge, sanction and assent of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-7\">Upon the same evidence the defendant claimed that he had never authorized the plaintiff to employ Goodhart, nor to pay Goodhart, and had never agreed nor assented to the payment of $50 to Goodhart.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-8\">The defendant requested the court to charge the jury that proof that the plaintiff, at the request of the defendant, released Goodhart from an indebtedness of $50 due the plaintiff in settlement of Goodhart\u2019s charge against the defendant, did not correspond with the allegations of the bill of pai\u2019ticulars, \u201c to cash paid at request of defendant in settling the case of State- v. Barnes before the Court of Common Pleas,\u201d and therefore the jury must bring in a verdict for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>the defendant; that there was a fatal variance between the allegation and the proof, and that judgment for the plaintiff could not be supported on the allegation by such evidence as the plaintiff had introduced. This request was denied by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-6\">The appeal assigns error in the denial of the defendant\u2019s request to charge, and also claims error in the charge as given.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b169-7\"><em>David E. Fitzgerald </em>and <em>Walter J. Walsh, </em>for the appellant (defendant).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b169-8\"><em>Sanford B. Martin, </em>for the appellee (plaintiff).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b169-9\">Hamersley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aei\">Upon (1) the defendant\u2019s requesting the plaintiff to pay, on behalf of the defendant and for his benefit, the sum of $50 to Goodhart in satisfaction of Good-hart\u2019s claim to that amount against the defendant, (2) the plaintiff\u2019s transferring, in pursuance of that request, the sum of $50 belonging to him to Goodhart, and (3) Goodhart\u2019s acceptance of the sum thus transferred in payment and satisfaction of his claim against the defendant, the law imposed upon the defendant the duty of reimbursing the plaintiff for the sum thus expended on behalf and for. the benefit of the defendant, and upon the defendant\u2019s failure to perform this duty a right of action accrued to the plaintiff. This is the cause of action proved by the evidence of the plaintiff, and this cause of action is in substance alleged in the complaint as amended; its defective and faulty statement was waived by the defendant in denying the allegations of the complaint and going to trial upon that issue. It is evident that while an actual payment to Goodhart of the sum of $50 may be matter of substance, the precise manner in which that payment was accomplished is immaterial. If the plaintiff in proving his actual payment to Goodhart of the sum of $50 did disclose a mode' of payment differing from that described in his complaint, such a variance in proof is immaterial, and immaterial variances must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>be wholly disregarded. Rules under the Practice Act, III, \u00a7 6. The trial court, therefore, did not err in refusing to charge as requested by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">The exceptions taken to the charge as given furnished no ground for a new trial. Upon the issues joined, the value of the services on which Goodhart\u2019s claim was based was immaterial, and the court properly charged the jury that they must find an actual payment to Goodhart by the plaintiff and the actual amount so paid, but that the value of Goodhart\u2019s services was not in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The other claim of the defendant, that the court omitted to sufficiently instruct the jury as to the questions of law arising upon the pleadings, the state of the evidence, and the legitimate claims of the parties, is plainly unsupported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">There is no error in the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
