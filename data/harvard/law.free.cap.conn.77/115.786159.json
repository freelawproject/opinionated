Prior to the accident he had been in the employ of the defendant as a laborer, and had so worked until directed by the defendant to do blasting with dynamite. He had never used dynamite, nor seen it used, until he entered the defendant\u2019s employ, several weeks before the accident, and had no knowledge of its nature and qualities, or of its proper use, or of the danger attending its use, and had never used hard dynamite until the time of the accident.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-7\">On the day of the accident the defendant, who was a contractor engaged in the work of repairing and improving certain highways, directed the plaintiff to set off a blast in a certain rock. The plaintiff, upon going to the box in which the dynamite was kept by the defendant, found that the soft dynamite, which had been before provided for his use, was gone, and that only frozen dynamite remained. Through an interpreter he informed the defendant that such dynamite could not be compressed and used in the manner he had been instructed to use it, and the defendant told the plaintiff to use the hard dynamite, and that it was all right to use it. The plaintiff thereupon proceeded to use the hard dynamite, and while endeavoring to insert it in the drill-hole as he had been instructed by the defendant, the dynamite exploded and injured him as described in the complaint.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-8\">The dynamite so used by the plaintiff was in a dangerous condition from being frozen, and was for that reason more liable to explode than soft or plastic dynamite. The dangerous condition of such frozen or hard dynamite is well recognized by scientific authorities, and is well known and generally recognized by persons familiar with the nature and qualities of dynamite and the proper way of using it in blasting, and was known, or by the exercise of due care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>should have been known, by the defendant. The using of frozen dynamite, as the defendant ordered the plaintiff to use it, was a highly dangerous operation, as was well known to experienced users of dynamite, and opposed to all sound practice, and the danger of so using it was so great and so well recognized that the defendant ought to have known it in the exercise of ordinary care in the conduct of his business.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-6\">The plaintiff had no knowledge of the danger attending the use of frozen dynamite, and did not hold himself out to the defendant as possessing experience in the use of dynamite, and the defendant had no reason to believe that the plaintiff had \u25a0 such knowledge. The defendant gave the plaintiff no warning of the danger of using said frozen dynamite.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-7\">The defendant claimed to have proved that frozen dynamite was less liable to explode when subjected to a pressure then soft dynamite; that the defendant did not know, and had never heard, that the use of frozen dynamite by subjecting it to a pressure was dangerous ; that such danger, if it existed, was wholly unknown to prudent men of many years\u2019 practical experience in the use of dynamite; that the plaintiff was experienced in the use of dynamite for blasting; that he used said hard dynamite contrary to defendant\u2019s orders and without defendant\u2019s knowledge; that in loading said blast the plaintiff carelessly used a crowbar in tamping the charge, while knowing that the use of such an instrument was dangerous ; and that the plaintiff at the time of the accident was using such dynamite without having obtained a written permit or license therefor from the town clerk or selectmen, as required by statute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-8\">The defendant, among other things, requested the court to charge the jury that to entitle the plaintiff to recover he must prove that the alleged dangerous condition of the dynamite was known to the defendant; and that if the plaintiff at the time of .the accident was using dynamite without having first obtained a written-permit therefor, as required by statute, such use of the dynamite was illegal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>and the failure to obtain such permit was a bar to his recovery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b131-6\">The jury rendered a verdict for the plaintiff for $3,000.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b131-7\"><em>Samuel Tweedy </em>and <em>Leonard J.

In other words, that the admission by the default of the mere allegation of knowledge was of actual knowledge, and was notan admission of actual and constructive knowledge which required the defendant to disprove both. A clear distinction is made in that case between the right of the plaintiff to prove constructive knowledge, under an allegation of knowledge, when such allegation is denied, and the burden imposed upon the defendant in a hearing in damages by his admission of such an allegation by suffering a default. The real ground of the present action is the alleged negligence of the defendant in furnishing, for the use of the plaintiff, his employee, dynamite, which, from its frozen condition, was liable to explode when subjected to pressure, without warning the employee of such danger in using it. It was the duty of the employer to exercise reasonable care to put reasonably safe materials in the hands of its employee to be used in the work in which he was engaged. <em>O\u2019Keefe </em>v. <em>National Folding Box &amp; Paper Co., </em>66 Conn. 38, 47. The employer neglects such duty if he places in the hands of his employee materials which he either knows or ought to know are not reasonably safe for the work which the employee is performing, and of the dangerous condition of which the employee is ignorant and has not equal means of knowing. <em>Hayden </em>v. <em>Smithville Mfg. Co., </em>29 Conn. 548, 560. The plaintiff was required to allege that the defendant had neglected such duty, and this he did by averring that the defendant, a contractor, etc., furnished the frozen dynamite with knowledge of its dangerous condition, of which the plaintiff, who was inexperienced in the use of dynamite, was ignorant. As proof of the employer\u2019s knowledge of the alleged defect in materials, for the purpose of showing his neglect of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>duty, the law treats either actual or constructive knowledge as knowledge. It imputes to the employer knowledge of a fact of which the exercise of reasonable care and diligence would have apprised him. <em>Peters </em>v. Goodrich, 3 Conn. 146, 150; <em>Post </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>35 id. 339, 342. The defendant had full opportunity to meet the facts showing imputed knowledge, and endeavored to disprove them. Certainly, proof of constructive knowledge of the alleged defect charged the defendant with no greater negligence or liability than proof of actual knowledge. We regard the allegation of knowledge contained in the complaint as broad enough to permit proof either of actual knowledge, or of that constructive knowledge which the law treats as its equivalent. <em>Mellors </em>v. Shaw, 1 Best &amp; Smith, 437; <em>Lake Erie &amp; W. </em>R. <em>Co. </em>v. <em>McHenry, </em>10 Ind. App. 525; <em>Evansville &amp; T. H. </em>R. <em>Co. </em>v. <em>Duel, </em>134 Ind. 156, 165; <em>Louisville, etc., </em>R. <em>Co. </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>140 id. 685. When a plaintiff is required to allege that he had no knowledge of the defect or danger complained of, he need not allege that he could not have known it by the exercise of ordinary care. <em>Peter &amp; M. S. Stoneworks </em>v. <em>Green, </em>76 Southwestern Rep. (Ky.) 844. Under an allegation of no knowledge, proof of want of actual knowledge may be met by evidence of facts showing imputed knowledge. <em>Salisbury Savings Soc. </em>v. <em>Cutting, </em>50 Conn. 113, 120. There was no error in the charge of the court that imputed knowledge might be proved in support of the averment of knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">The trial court also correctly instructed the jury that \u201c the failure of the plaintiff to take out a permit for the use of dynamite has nothing whatever to do with this case,\u201d and should not be considered by the jury as having any bearing upon their conclusion. Section 2618 of the General Statutes, which provides that \u201c no person shall procure, transport, or use any compound more explosive than gunpowder without first obtaining a written permit therefor, signed by the town clerk or selectman of the town where the same is to be used or kept for sale, specifying the name of the purchaser, the amount to be purchased, and purpose for which it is to be used,\u201d and \u00a7 2622 providing that any person who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>shall manufacture, transport, use, or have in his possession such explosive shall be fined not more than $10,000, or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both, are parts of an Apt passed in 1885 (Public Acts of 1885, p. 519, Chap. 114), the first and second sections of which appear in \u00a7\u00a7 1183 and 1140, respectively, and the remainder of the Act in \u00a7\u00a7 2617 to 2622 of'the General Statutes. The original Act made it a felony for any person to wilfully injure person or property by any explosive material or compound, or to manufacture, transport, have or dispose of the- same, having reason to believe that it was to be used for that purpose, or to advocate or contribute money for any such use of the same. It made all murder perpetrated in attempting injury to any person or property by such explosives murder in the first degree ; required all persons manufacturing, dealing in, procuring, using, or having in their possession materials or compounds more explosive than gunpowder to obtain a written license or permit therefor, and imposed a punishment upon persons so acting without such license. The object of the Act was neither to prohibit nor restrict the manufacture, sale, or use of such explosives for legitimate purposes, but to prevent the manufacture, sale, or use of them for unlawful purposes ; and in aid of that object to require those lawfully manufacturing, selling, or using them, to have written evidence of such fact. Town clerks and selectmen are not by the Act made judges of the qualifications of applicants for licenses to properly manufacture, sell, or use explosives. The only restriction placed upon the granting of the licenses is that these officials shall be satisfied that a lawful use of the explosive is intended. If the statute in question applied to \u25a0the plaintiff, who was a mere laborer employed by the person controlling the use of the explosive, his unlawful act was not the act itself of using the dynamite for blasting, but in making a lawful use of it without having procured the required permit; and his failure to obtain the permit in no way. contributed to cause his injury. <em>Broschart </em>v. <em>Tuttle, </em>59 Conn. 1, 13; <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Hartford Street Ry. Co., </em>76 id. 201, 207. But it is only the name of the purchaser of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>explosive which is required to be specified in the license. Assuming that the defendant was such purchaser, it was his duty to obtain a permit, and we do not think the statute requires every laborer, who handles such explosives under the direction of his employer, to procure a permit to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">The complaint alleged that the sight of one of the plaintiff\u2019s eyes was destroyed by the explosion, rendering it necessary to remove it; that a piece of the ulna of his left arm was blown out, causing a.permanent injury and greatly impairing its use; and that by reason of said injuries the plaintiff suffered great pain. Evidence was offered that the wearing of an artificial eye had caused the plaintiff some pain, and that his arm where it was fractured would be more liable to ulcerate, and that it would require, in that case, a longer time to heal. Defendant\u2019s objection to this evidence, upon the ground that such injuries were not described in the complaint, was properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">The question by defendant\u2019s counsel upon cross-examination of the interpreter employed upon said work, whether he communicated to the plaintiff anything that was said about his using dynamite carelessly, was rightly, excluded upon the ground that it improperly assumed that something of that kind had been said.'</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">The testimony of the expert Shupphaus, that the forcing of a stick of hard or frozen dynamite into a drill-hole in a rock with a stick, requiring the use of considerable force to push it into the drill-hole, was a highly dangerous operation, opposed to all sound practice, -was properly admitted. It was applicable to the explosive described in the complaint, and apparently even to the kind of dynamite which the defendant claims was used, and tended to prove the dangerous condition of the dynamite as described in the complaint, namely, that it was liable to explode when subjected to pressure.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">There was no error in excluding the question asked the defendant by his counsel, for the purpose of showing that the defendant acted in good faith and not maliciously or \u2022 wantonly, whether from what he observed in the plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>use of dynamite, and what the interpreter told him as to the plaintiff\u2019s experience before, he honestly believed that the plaintiff was capable of handling and using dynamite. The complaint contained no allegation of wilful or wanton conduct by the defendant. The plaintiff disclaimed such conduct by the defendant and any right to punitive damages, and the court charged the jury that only compensatory damages could be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Defendant\u2019s witness Daniel, having testified that hardness from freezing was not a defect in dynamite, and that its only effect was to prevent it from exploding, the question by defendant\u2019s counsel as to when dynamite was defective, was properly excluded as irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Defendant\u2019s witness Baldwin, having testified that he had used dynamite in blasting for twenty years, and had had one experience with frozen dynamite, the court correctly ruled that he had not been shown to be qualified to answer the question, whether from his experience and what he had read frozen dynamite was more liable to explode when subjected to pressure than dynamite in a plastic condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
