The present defendant Williams had given special bail for the defendant in said action. Counsel for the plaintiff knew of the discontinuance, but through his mistake arising from his confusing said action with another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>between the same parties and having the same title, in which he also appeared, supposed that the case discontinued was the other case and not the case in question. Counsel did not discover his mistake until November following. Meanwhile, owing to his mistake, he made no motion to restore the case upon motion day, as provided by the rules, or thereafter. December 24th he brought these proceedings. . The defendant Williams demurred to the complaint, the demurrer was sustained, and judgment of dismissal followed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b32-6\"><em>Howard W.

He also claims that the demurrer does not set out with the necessary precision and definiteness any ground of objection which can be successfully urged against his contention. The soundness of the claim as to the insufficiency of the demurrer depends largely upon the correctness of legal propositions which the exigencies of this case do not require us to consider. The circumstances of the case are such that the plaintiff -can obtain no substantial benefit from our action unless his main con tention is well made. We may, therefore, properly consider the case upon its broad general features and without regard to possible technical aspects of the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">The plaintiff does not rest his application entirely upon the provisions of \u00a7 815 of the General Statutes, providing for the granting of new trials for reasonable cause. On the contrary, he relies especially upon the general equity powers inherent in the court to which his complaint is addressed. The power thus invoked is that which was under discussion in <em>Tyler </em>v. <em>Aspinwall, </em>73 Conn. 493, and <em>Goldreyer </em>v. <em>Cronan, </em>76 id. 113. In <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>71 Conn. 427, we said that new trials might be granted for equitable cause, where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>no legal ground for such relief is shown, and that the power to grant them is inherent in courts of equity and confirmed by statute. The plaintiff points to this case, to which he might have added <em>Carrington </em>v. <em>Holabird, </em>17 Conn. 530, as furnishing authority for his contention that the Court of Common Pleas had the power to grant the relief he seeks. If this be assumed, the plaintiff still remains beset with insurmountable difficulties. It is a well-established principle that courts of equity will not relieve against the operation of judgments rendered through the negligence or inattention of the party claiming to be aggrieved or his attorney. <em>Crim </em>v. Handley, 94 U. S. 652; <em>Amherst College </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>165 Mass. 178; <em>Babcock </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>25 Vt. 550; <em>Barhorst </em>v. <em>Armstrong, </em>42 Fed. Rep. 2. The plaintiff, however, contends that the situation presented is one arising from mistake and not from negligence. The distinction is not fundamental. Equity will not, save in rare and extreme cases, relieve against a judgment rendered as the result of a mistake on the part of a party or his counsel, unless the mistake is \u201c unmixed with negligence,\u201d or to use the language of this court, \u201c unconnected with any negligence or inattention on the part of the judgment debtor,\u201d or, to quote again, \u201c when the negligence of the party is not one of the producing causes.\u201d <em>Crim </em>v. Handley, 94 U. S. 652; <em>Winchell </em>v. Sanger, 73 Conn. 399; <em>Allis </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>76 id. 322; 1 Swift\u2019s Digest, s. p. 788; <em>Amherst College </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>165 Mass. 178; <em>Babcock </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>25 Vt. 550; <em>Barhorst </em>v. <em>Armstrong, </em>42 Fed. Rep. 2. The negligence or inattention of an attorney is the negligence or inattention of the client. Cases <em>supra. </em>The facts of this case furnish the plaintiff no means of escape from the application of these well-settled rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">Incidentally the plaintiff seeks to save his case from the operation of the general rule that a court has no control over its judgment at a term subsequent to that at which it was rendered, upon the theory that there was no final judgment, but an order of discontinuance. An order of discontinuance is only preliminary to a judgment, and, when made effective, involves a judgment which terminates the action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>and exhausts the jurisdiction of the court over it. A judgment thus rendered is as final, as any judgment can be. <em>O'Dell </em>v. <em>Cowles, </em>76 Conn. 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
