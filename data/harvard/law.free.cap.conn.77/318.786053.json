Shortly after its appointment the committee chose the plaintiff to be chairman. The building was constructed and paid for, and the town paid the members of the committee, including the plaintiff, for expenses incurred by them, and reimbursed the plaintiff for moneys advanced by him in payment of expenses of construction authorized by the committee in excess of the appropriation made by the town.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-6\">The plaintiff then claimed that the town was liable to him for the reasonable value of services he had performed while a member and chairman of the committee, in preparing plans for the building, in the superintendence of the building and in selecting and contracting for the heating, lighting and furnishing of the same ; and upon refusal of the town to pay for such services brought this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-7\">No reason of appeal is assigned except the alleged error of the trial court in denying the plaintiff\u2019s motion to set aside the judgment of nonsuit which the court had rendered upon motion of the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b331-8\"><em>Charles H.

For the purpose of proving these facts the plaintiff produced in evidence the votes of the town, the contract and specifications for construction of the building between the building committee and the contractor, and the specifications accepted by the building committee for heating, lighting and furnishing the building. These documents constituted the only evidence produced in support of these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">The legal sufficiency of the documents to prove the essential facts was, in this case, a pure question of law; they were not dependent upon parol evidence in any such way as to present a mixed question of law and fact. We think this documentary evidence was legally insufficient to prove any one of the facts essential to the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action, and that this legal insufficiency is too clear to justify a recital of the voluminous documents ; it consists in the plain \u2022and unquestionable absence of anything in the documents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>showing either an agreement with the town to pay, or authority of the building committee to make such agreement. The suggestion made in. argument, that the appointment of a building committee involved authority to that committee to employ a building inspector for pay, and to appoint as such inspector the person who might be its chairman, need not be considered. There is no evidence that the plaintiff was so employed. The fact as testified to by the plaintiff, that some time after his appointment as chairman of 'the committee and several months prior to the vote of the town accepting plans for the building and directing the committee to contract for its construction in accordance with those plans, he said to another member of the committee, referring to his services as the committee\u2019s chairman, that if he rendered services he should expect pay for the same, is legally insufficient to prove such employment. Under these circumstances the trial court properly granted the motion for a nonsuit. The motion was not granted because the court disbelieved witnesses the jury might believe, nor because it thought that the weight of evidence which the jury might find to be in favor off the plaintiff was in favor of the defendant. It was not granted because the complaint stated no cause of action, but because the plaintiff, having produced his evidence- and closed his case, had failed to produce any evidence which, in view of settled rules of law wholly within the province of the court to determine, was legally capable of proving the cause of action which the eomplaint did state. The action of the court in granting the\" motion was within its legal discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">There is no error in the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred;</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
