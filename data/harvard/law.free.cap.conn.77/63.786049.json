He is so described in the caption of the judgment-file, but the judgment rendered was \u201c that the plaintiff recover of the defendant one hundred and seventy-nine dollars and fifty-nine cents (1179.59) damages, and her costs, taxed at 66 dollars and 95 cents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">The cause of action stated is that, as administrator, the defendant sold and conveyed to the plaintiff a building lot on Sherman Avenue in New Haven, belonging to the estate, at a price determined by the number of feet of its frontage on the street, and induced her to buy, by means of a representation, upon which she relied, that the lot was of equal width throughout, whereas it was in fact considerably narrower on the rear.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">An administrator cannot subject the estate in his charge to a judgment for damages suffered through any false representations which he may have made, while acting in its behalf. The remedy is against him personally. See <em>Hallock </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>50 Conn. 127. On the other hand, no personal judgment against him can be rendered in a suit for such a cause brought against him as administrator. See <em>Middlebrook </em>v. Pendleton, 47 Conn. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-11\">General Statutes, \u00a7 739, authorizes suits against an administrator for moneys paid or services rendered for the estate, and provides that if the plaintiff\u2019s claim shall be found a just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>one, and such as equitably ought to be paid out of the estate, judgment to that effect may be rendered. The plaintiff is not suing for money paid; but if she were, such an action on the statute could not support a judgment against an administrator in his individual capacity. <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>57 Conn. 304, 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">It follows that the motion in arrest of judgment should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">The bill of exceptions filed by the plaintiff, under General Statutes, \u00a7 804, calls for consideration only in case a new trial is advised. As the record now stands, a new trial will be of no avail. Should an amendment be asked and allowed, to make the action one against the defendant individually, he would then become a party in a new capacity, in respect to which he was not a party to the former trial. Under these circumstances we think it inexpedient to consider any question except that presented by the motion in arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">There is error.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
