B. Horton (the defendant) account.\u201d The plaintiff accepted the check and it was duly paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>On the 18th of March the defendant, by his same attorneys, wrote letters to George F. Bassett &amp; Company and Acker, Merrall &amp;Condit, New York creditors of the defend-, ant, inclosing checks for seventy-five per cent, of their respective claims against him, and stating, among other things, that the two prior offers of lesser sums submitted to them had been ignored ; that defendant\u2019s indebtedness amounted to $4,400 ; that he had inventoried his stock at $2,800, but that.experts thought it worth no more than $2,000, and that this, with a horse and carriage possibly worth $250, was all the property he owned; that one Donaghue, one of his creditors, had advanced him the sum of $2,500, taking a bill of sale of the store as security, and that the remainder of the seventy-five per cent, offered had been raised by mortgaging Mrs. Horton\u2019s property, and by collections made by the defendant. These letters further stated : \u201cAs the proposition now stands Horton\u2019s creditors get seventy-five cents on the dollar leaving an indebtedness of $2,500 to Mr. Donaghue. . . . Under these circumstances I believe it is for your interests, as well as the other creditors (and I am writing a similar letter to the other creditors) to accept this offer.\u201d These two letters were received in evidence against the defendant\u2019s objection that they were not relevant to the issue framed by the pleadings. It did not appear that these two creditors accepted this proposed compromise. Indeed the record shows that the plaintiff offered to prove that their claims were paid in full,' but that the evidence was excluded by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">The trial court excluded the question asked by the defendant of his witness Donaghue, whether the defendant had repaid him the $2,500, advanced to enable him to effect the compromise with his creditors, refused to grant a nonsuit upon defendant\u2019s motion, and denied defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial upon the ground that the verdict was against the evidence'.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">The reasons of appeal assigned by the defendant are: (1) the denial of his motion for a nonsuit; (2) the admission in evidence of defendant\u2019s letters to Bassett &amp; Company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>and to Acker, Merrall &amp; Condit; (3) the exclusion of the question of the witness Donaghue; and (4) the denial of his motion for a new trial upon the ground that the verdict was against the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">This court has repeatedly said that the refusal to grant a nonsuit furnishes no ground for appeal. <em>McVeigh </em>v. <em>Ripley, </em>77 Conn. 136, 141; <em>Dubuque </em>v. <em>Coman, </em>64 id. 475, 481; <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Agricultural Ins. Co., </em>51 id. 504, 512.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Of composition contracts between an insolvent debtor and his creditors, this court said in <em>Huntington </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>39 Conn. 540, 553: \u201c The utmost good faith must be observed by all parties. It scarcely need be said that any misrepresentation or concealment on the part of the insolvent renders his release void.\u201d It is true that in the present case there was no compromise agreement signed by the plaintiff which had been or was to be signed by the other creditors of the defendant, nor does it appear, nor is it alleged by the plaintiff, that there .was any specific agreement that it should not be bound by its acceptance of the defendant\u2019s offer of compromise unless it was assented to by all the defendant\u2019s creditors. But these facts furnish no reason why the agreement between the plaintiff and defendant should not be tested by the same standard of good faith and fairness that is applied' to contracts of compromise signed by all the creditors. If not expressed, it was clearly implied in the letters to the plaintiff that all the defendant\u2019s creditors must release him upon the same terms and that all would receive the same treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">But the plaintiff\u2019s complaint here is, not that other creditors received a larger percentage of their claims, or were paid in full, but that the defendant\u2019s representations as to his liabilities and assets, and his inability to pay more than forty per cent, of his debts, which induced the plaintiff to accept the offer of compromise, were false and fraudulent. As tending to prove this, the two letters to other creditors, written soon after the letters to the plaintiff, were admissible. <em>Argall </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>43 Conn. 160, 166. They contained a different statement of the defendant\u2019s assets and liabilities, from. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>that made to the plaintiff, and an offer to pay \u00e1 larger percentage than that which the defendant had represented to the plaintiff was the largest he could pay. The defendant was of course entitled to explain why these different statements and offers were made to other creditors. He claimed to have done so by the letters themselves and by other evidence, but the jury apparently did not accept his explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">It does not appear that the exclusion of the question asked the witness Donaghue could have been prejudicial to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">From the evidence before us we cannot say that the trial court erred in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial upon the ground that the verdict was against the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred\".</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
