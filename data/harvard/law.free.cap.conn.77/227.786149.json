Squier of New Haven, appear in the second and third counts, respectively, in place of the Peck &amp; Bishop Company in the first count, and that the names of Martin C. Swaner, Frank N. Palmer, and James L. Nesbit, each described as of New Haven, and as engaged in the livery business, etc., and employing for that purpose a large number of workmen who were members of \u201c Local 483,\u201d appear in the fourth, fifth and sixth counts respectively, in the place of the Peck &amp; Bishop Company mentioned in the first count; and with the further exception that the agreement described in the fourth, fifth and sixth counts, alleged to have been required to be executed by the liverymen, did not contain articles two and eight of the agreement above set forth to be executed by the team owners, and con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>tained different provisions as to the time required for a day\u2019s or week\u2019s work and as to the wages to be paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-6\">It appears from the finding that the State offered evidence tending to prove all these allegations, and to show that the team owners described in the first three counts, and liverymen described in the last three counts, having refused to sign said agreements, the acts described in the information as the methods and means adopted to accomplish the purpose of the alleged conspiracy were performed and carried out by the defendants and their associates; and that the defendants offered evidence to show that said allegations were not true, and that neither they nor other officers or members of the union ever instructed any pickets to in any way interfere with the employees of said team owners and liverymen, or to use any threats, intimidations or violent methods, but instructed them that, without using any violence or stopping them from their work, they might persuade nonunion men to join the union.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-7\">The State having offered evidence that the defendants and other members of the unions had, after the commencement of the strike, endeavored by threats to prevent customers from further patronizing said team owners and liverymen, one Norton, an employee of the Peck &amp; Bishop Company and familiar with its business, and one Donnelly, secretary of the Smedley Company, were permitted to testify as to the number of customers lost by said companies, respectively, after the strike, against the objection of the defendants that it did not appear how said customers were lost.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-8\">Alfred Coolman, a teamster of the Peck &amp; Bishop Companys testified that he ceased work the first week of the strike and then resumed work; that afterwards he saw twenty-five or thirty teamsters wearing the union button, some of whom insulted and threatened him; that on one occasion a crowd of twenty or more teamsters hooted and yelled at him as he was driving a team of the Peck &amp; Bishop Company, arid three of them, who wore the union button, stopped him and talked of \u201c pulling him off the wagon and smashing him,\u201d and told him they would get even with him; that on another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>occasion, while the witness was driving a wagon for said company, one Taylor, a teamster, who, it had been shown, belonged to the union and had worked for the Peck &amp; Bishop Company, and had, on one other occasion at least, interfered with the teams of the company, said to the witness : \u201cIf I had you out of the wagon here I would break your bloody head, and I will do it yet \u201d; that one night while the witness was acting as a watchman for the Peck &amp; Bishop Company, about a week after said remark of Taylor, some one shot at him, and that \u201c lie felt the wind of it,\u201d and one of the bullets struck a wire on a bale of hay against which the witness was leaning. This testimony was received against the objection of the defendants that the shooting had not been connected with any union man.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-6\">William Talmadge, one of the defendants, having testified, on behalf of the defendants, that he was president of Local 340 and assisted in preparing the form of said agreement, that he was business agent of the union and presided at its meetings, and that the men were instructed not to interfere with or annoy any one, was asked on cross-examination, after he had testified that he was present at the meeting when the strike was ordered, if he did not understand that the purpose of calling out the men employed 'by those concerns and individuals who had refused to sign the agreement, was to cripple them in their business. The witness answered: \u201c I knew that if they didn\u2019t sign that agreement the men would be called out. That was the object of calling the men out, naturally.\u201d This evidence was admitted against the defendants\u2019 objection that it was immaterial and improper and called for the witness\u2019s construction of an act of the union. The same witness was asked whether it was not the pui-pose, as he understood it, that his branch of the union should be in absolute control of all the teamsters employed in New Haven. He answered that he could not state they controlled them all. The defendants\u2019 general objection to this question and answer was overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-7\">Peter Flynn, one of the defendants, having testified in behalf of the defendants that he was secretary of Local 340, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>that he appointed pickets and instructed them as to their duties, and that they should use no violence, and that they were so instructed at the meetings of the union, but that instances of violence had come to the knowledge of himself and other officers of the union, and having testified on cross-examination that as secretary he had employed counsel to defend men who had been arrested for using violence, was asked on cross-examination who paid such counsel. Tlie witness answered, \u201c The union.\u201d Defendants\u2019 objection to said question and answer were overruled by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-6\">The defendant Cornelius testified upon direct examination as to instructions given to union men to use no violence, and, on cross-examination, that he had no knowledge of any one interfering with one Joseph Kinney by insulting or abusive language or otherwise, excepting as he had read of it, and that he did not so interfere with him and insult him. He was thereupon asked by the State\u2019s Attorney if he was not the person convicted in the Court of Common Pleas of having, on the 17th of May, 1908, committed a breach of the peace in New Haven streets upon said Kinney. In connection with this inquiry the State offered the record of such conviction, the defendants having before objected to the question whether1 the Avitness had been convicted of using violence during the strike, upon the ground that the record was the best evidence. The court admitted said inquiry against the defendants\u2019 objection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-7\">Among other things the defendants requested the court, in substance, to charge the jury that the defendants and other members of the unions had a legal right to strike for the purpose of obtaining higher wages, although they may have known that by so doing the strike would injure the business of their employers; that there Avas nothing unlawful in the agreements presented to the team owners and liverymen for signature, and that upon their refusal to sign it, the accused had the right to stop work and request all others to stop work until some satisfactory arrangement should be made as to wages and hours of labor; that members of a union had a right to trade with whom they pleased, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>and to solicit members of other unions and others to give their patronage to union men and those friendly to them, and to cease to give their trade and patronage to others; and that an agreement among members of a union to solicit patronage and trade to be so given, as a means of inducing employers whose union men had struck to make satisfactory terms as to rate of wages and hours of labor, was not unlawful and did not constitute an unlawful combination; that members of a union had the right to refuse to work with nonunion men, and to combine to establish a rule not to work with them, and that the refusal of union men, in pursuance of such a rule, and not with malicious intent to injure the business of another, to so work, was not unlawful; that the sending out of pickets, after the strike, not in sufficient numbers to overawe or intimidate employees, and without instructions to use violence but to persuade workmen to join the union, and join in the strike for the purpose of obtaining what the union deemed to be sufficient wages, and a combination to so employ pickets for that purpose, were not unlawful.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b247-6\"><em>E.

The allegations as to these subjects are the same in the several counts, excepting that two different agreements were presented to be executed, and that they were to be signed by different parties. By these allegations but a single offense is described in each count, namely, a criminal combination to procure a certain agreement to be signed by certain described methods.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>A combination of persons for the accomplishment of a particular object may be criminal, either because the object itself is criminal in its character, or because the means by which that object is to be effected are criminal. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gannon, </em>75 Conn. 206, 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The agreements which the defendants sought to have signed contain no provisions which are contrary to the criminal law of this State, and if the only purpose of the combination was to procure these agreements to be entered into in order to advance the legitimate interests of the employees of the team owners and liverymen, without the view of injuring the business and property of their employers, such purpose was not criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">If the alleged purpose of the combination was not criminal, were the methods to be pursued criminal? It is alleged that the defendants maliciously conspired to compel the employers to sign the agreements. It is not alleged that it was intended to directly threaten the employers to induce them to sign the agreements, nor does it appear that they were directly threatened. The information states how they were to be compelled \u2014 and we think it is in effect alleged that they were to be compelled only by the particular methods described in the information \u2014 the first of which is by inducing the workmen, by concerted action, to strike and leave the employment of the employers named. Such a strike may be lawful, or it may be unlawful and criminal. Whether it is lawful or not depends upon its object and the manner in which it is conducted. A combination to cause a strike for the purpose of injuring and destroying the business and property of-another, or of depriving another of his liberty or property without just cause, is both unlawful and criminal. 1 Eddy on Combinations, \u00a7 521 <em>et seq.; Old Dominion S. S. Co. </em>v. <em>McKenna, </em>30 Fed. Rep. 48; <em>Arthur </em>v. <em>Oakes, </em>68 id. 310; <em>Plant </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>176 Mass. 492, 498; <em>State </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>59 Vt. 273, 289; <em>State ex rel.

A combination which contemplates the use of force, threats, or intimidation, to in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>duce workmen to abandon together the service of their employers, is criminal (authorities above cited), and a combination for that purpose is also criminal because it is to induce the commission of an offense which is made criminal by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Workmen may lawfully combine to accomplish their withdrawal in a body from the service of their employers, for the purpose of obtaining an advance in wages, a reduction of the hours of labor, or any other legitimate advantage, even though they may know that such action will necessarily cause injury to the business of their employers, provided such abandonment of work is not in violation of any continuing contract, and is conducted in a lawful manner and not under such circumstances as to wantonly or maliciously inflict injury to person or property. 1 Eddy on Combinations, \u00a7 521; <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Evarts, </em>17 N. Y. Supp. 264; <em>Farmers Loan </em>&amp; <em>Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Northern Pacific R. </em>Co., 60 Fed. Rep. 803.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">A combination to use the second, third and fourth alleged methods of obtaining the execution of the agreements is a combination to compel workmen and others, by threats and intimidation, to refrain from doing that which they have a legal right to do, and is criminal. The use of such means is made a criminal offense by \u00a7 1296 of the General Statutes, which provides that \u201c every person who shall threaten, or use any means to intimidate any person to compel such person, against his will, to do or abstain from doing any act which such person has a legal right to do, or shall persistently follow such person in a disorderly manner, or injure, or threaten to injure, his property, with intent to intimidate him, shall be fined not more than one hundred dollars, or imprisoned not more than six months.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">A combination to use the fifth alleged means, by preventing such employers from carrying on business and ruining and destroying their business and property, is equally criminal both at common law (see authorities above cited) and under the statute quoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">The language or conduct which will constitute the unlawful use of threats or means to intimidate, need not be such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>as to induce a fear of personal injury.. Any words or acts which are calculated and intended to cause an ordinary person to fear an injury to his person, business or property, are equivalent to threats. <em>State </em>v. <em>Donaldson, </em>32 N. J. L. 151; <em>Barr </em>v. <em>Essex Trades Council, </em>53 N. J. Eq. 101; <em>Crump </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>84 Va. 927; <em>Rogers v. Evarts, 17 N. </em>Y. Supp. <em>264; O'Neil </em>v. <em>Behanna, </em>182 Pa. St. 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Upon the trial of the present case the contest appears to \u2022have been upon questions of fact rather than of law; upon the question of whether violence, threats and intimidation \u2022were the means used and directed by the defendants to be used, rather than whether proof of those facts was necessary in order to convict. The evidence is not before us, but the record shows that witnesses testified that pickets were instructed in open meetings by several of the defendants to use violence to prevent workmen from continuing in. the employ of the team owners and liverymen, and that such instructions were obeyed.</p>\n<p id=\"AcP\">The court instructed the jury that the information charged a criminal conspiracy, and properly defined that offense in the language of the opinion in <em>State </em>v. <em>Gannon, </em>75 Conn. 206; that the right of the defendants and others to strike or leave the service of their employer singly or in a body, even though they believed that the result of such action would be to bring the business of their employer\u2019s temporarily to an end, and the right to meet together and counsel such action, were unquestionable; that if the only purpose-of the strike was to procure better pay or shorter hours, the purpose was a lawful one, but that the defendants had no right to combine to accomplish such purpose by means of a crime; that if the real purpose of the strike was to ruin the employers\u2019 business by threats and intimidation, it was unlawful, and that a conspiracy for that purpose was a crime; that the stationing of pickets for the purpose of obtaining information as to the extent of the business of the person whom the picket was directed to watch, was not unlawful; that it might be lawful to attempt to induce another to leave his employer\u2019s service by fair arguments, and, also, perhaps, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>to station pickets to ascertain how such persons might, be reached and lawful means employed to induce them to leave their employers\u2019 service; that it was the right of members of these unions and other drivers to refuse to drive their carriages at any time, and was lawful for the defendants to solicit the business which was being done by said team owners and liverymen, and to induce their customers by fair means to employ the defendants and their friends; but that a combination to do these things by threats and intimidation was a criminal combination, and that the placing of pickets to induce one to leave his employer\u2019s service by threats and intimidation was unlawful; but that the defendants should not be convicted for what some one else had done, but only for what they had themselves done; that the words \u201cthreat\u201d .and \u201c intimidation \u201d had their ordinary meaning in the statute, and that for the purposes of this case a threat was a menace of such nature as to unsettle the mind of the person upon whom it operated.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Upon an examination of the entire charge we are satisfied that the defendants have no just cause of complaint, either upon the ground that the court failed to instruct the jury sufficiently fully upon the subjects embraced in their requests, or to fairly and properly present the case to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">Evidence of acts of the accused and of their agents in endeavoring to accomplish the purpose of the conspiracy was admissible as evidence of the manner in which it was designed to be accomplished; and after <em>prima facie </em>proof of the alleged conspiracy, evidence of the acts and declarations of the individual conspirators was admissible. <em>State </em>v. Thompson, 69 Conn. 720, 726.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">The testimony of the witnesses Norton and Donnelly was properly admitted. To render their testimony admissible the State was not required to first prove by direct evidence that the customers referred to had been solicited, by the defendants or their associates, to refrain from giving their patronage to the team owners. Whether the losses of custom were occasioned by such alleged acts were questions for the .jury upon all the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>For similar reasons the testimony of Coolman, that he -was shot at, was admissible. The question was one of the weight and effect of his testimony in connection with the circumstances proved, as showing that the shooting was by a union man.
