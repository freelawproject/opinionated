In the plea agreement, Rawls agreed to waive his right to appeal his conviction and sentence, except for any claims of ineffective assistance of counsel or prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-19\">On appeal, Rawls\u2019 attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but questioning whether counsel was ineffective for failing to file a suppression motion prior to Rawls\u2019 guilty plea. Although informed of his right to file pro se supplemental brief, Rawls has not done so. The Government has moved to dismiss Rawls\u2019 appeal based on the appellate waiver provision in his plea agreement. We dismiss in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-20\">We review a defendant\u2019s waiver of appellate rights de novo. <em>United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162, 168 (4th Cir.2005). \u201cA defendant may waive his right to appeal if that waiver is the result of a knowing and intelligent decision to forgo the right to appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Amaya-Portillo, </em>423 F.3d 427, 430 (4th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). Generally, if the district court fully questions the defendant about the waiver during the Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 plea colloquy, the waiver is valid and enforceable. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>410 F.3d 137, 151 (4th Cir.2005). We will enforce a valid waiver so long as \u201cthe issue being appealed is within the scope of the waiver.\u201d <em>Blick, </em>408 F.3d at 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-21\">Our review of the record leads us to conclude that Rawls\u2019 waiver of appellate rights was knowing and intelligent. Therefore, we grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss Rawls\u2019 appeal as to his sentence and dismiss this portion of the appeal. The waiver provision does not, however, preclude our review of Rawls\u2019 claim that his attorney was ineffective for failing to file a suppression motion. Unless an attorney\u2019s ineffectiveness is conclusively apparent on the face of the record, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>ineffective assistance claims are not generally addressed on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Benton, </em>523 F.3d 424, 435 (4th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999) (providing standard and noting that ineffective assistance of counsel claims generally should be raised by motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255). We find the record in this case falls short of this exacting standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues that are outside the scope of the appeal waiver. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment as to all issues not encompassed by Rawls\u2019 valid waiver of his right to appeal. This court requires that counsel inform Rawls, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Rawls requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Rawls. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
