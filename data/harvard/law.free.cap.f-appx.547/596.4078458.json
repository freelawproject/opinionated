He contends that his sentence of 87 months of imprisonment, which was within the applicable guideline sentencing range, was substantively unreasonable. Jaime-Juarez did not object to the reasonableness of his sentence in the district court and therefore our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">Jaime-Juarez\u2019s contention that sentences calculated under the illegal reentry guideline are not entitled to a presumption of reasonableness, is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009) (affirming a within-guideline sentence following conviction of illegal reentry and rejecting Appellant\u2019s argument that this Court must examine the empirical basis for the relevant Sentencing Guidelines provision before affording a presumption of reasonableness to the within-guideline sentence). Jaime-Juarez\u2019s argument that his sentence is unreasonable because his offense was a mere international trespass is likewise foreclosed by this Circuit\u2019s precedent. <em>See United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 212 (5th Cir.2008) (rejecting argument that the Appellant\u2019s 87 month prison sentence for illegal reentry was unreasonable because the offense was \u201cno more than simple trespass.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-14\">Finally, the district court rejected the argument that Jamie-Juarez was unable to comprehend that reentry into the United States could have serious consequences, as Jaime-Juarez had been convicted of illegal reentry once before and had been admonished to this effect. Jaime-Juarez has not shown that the district court\u2019s finding in this regard amounts to plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-15\">Jaime-Juarez has failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness given to his within-range sentence. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 553-54 (5th Cir.2006). He has failed to show error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b623-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
