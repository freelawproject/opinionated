He was sentenced to 180 months of imprisonment on each count to be served concurrently. On appeal, counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but raising the following issue: whether McClure\u2019s prior North Carolina conviction for second degree sexual offense triggered the fifteen-year mandatory minimum sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(b)(l) (2012). For the reason that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">McClure\u2019s prior state offense, which involved forcing a fourteen-year-old girl to perform oral sex, was a proper predicate offense for the enhancement under \u00a7 2252A(b)(1). <em>See United States v. Spence, </em>661 F.3d 194, 197 (4th Cir.2011) (concluding that \u201cinvolving a minor\u201d modifies only \u201cabusive sexual conduct\u201d and applying modified categorical approach to determine proper predicate conviction for \u00a7 2252A(b) enhancement). We therefore conclude that the district court properly used McClure\u2019s above state offense to impose a mandatory minimum fifteen-year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-12\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case, including the issues raised in McClure\u2019s pro se supplemental brief, and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. McClure\u2019s guilty plea revealed he knowingly and voluntarily pled guilty, <em>United States v. Vonn, </em>535 U.S. 55, 58, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002), and that the hearing complied with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11. We further find no abuse of discretion in McClure\u2019s sentence, <em>see Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (providing review standard), and note that he was sentenced within a properly calculated advisory Sentencing Guidelines range in which the court expressly considered 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2012) sentencing factors. <em>See United States v. Mendoza-Mendoza, </em>597 F.3d 212, 217 (4th Cir.2010) (noting appellate presumption of reasonableness for sentence imposed within a properly calculated Guidelines range).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-13\">We therefore affirm McClure\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform McClure, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If McClure requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on McClure. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
