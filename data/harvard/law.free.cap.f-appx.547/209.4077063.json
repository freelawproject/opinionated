Hodge, Jr., appeals the district court\u2019s order dismissing his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2006) civil rights action under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) (2006) for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted, confining his appeal to the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>court\u2019s dismissal of his claim against Defendant Christopher Esnes for racial profiling<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in connection with a traffic stop. We affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal of a claim for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted. <em>Slade v. Hampton Rds. Reg\u2019l Jail, </em>407 F.3d 243, 248 (4th Cir.2005). Although a pro se litigant\u2019s pleadings are to be construed liberally, <em>Gordon v. Leeke, </em>574 F.2d 1147, 1151 (4th Cir.1978), his complaint must contain factual allegations sufficient \u201cto raise a right to relief above the speculative level\u201d and that \u201cstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). This \u201cplausibility standard requires a plaintiff to demonstrate more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.\u201d <em>Francis v. Giacometti, </em>588 F.3d 186, 193 (4th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). He must articulate facts that, when accepted as true, demonstrate he has stated a claim entitling him to relief. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">To state a claim under \u00a7 1983 for a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, a plaintiff must allege facts sufficient to show that he has been treated differently from others with whom he is similarly situated and the unequal treatment resulted from intentional or purposeful discrimination. <em>Morrison v. Garraghty, </em>239 F.3d 648, 654 (4th Cir.2001). Hodge\u2019s complaint, however, does not articulate facts demonstrating that a racially discriminatory intent or purpose was a factor in Esnes\u2019 decisions to stop his vehicle, to issue a citation for his failure to possess a valid change-of-address card, or to issue a warning ticket for his failure to yield the right-of-way. Accordingly, as Hodge did not state a plausible claim under \u00a7 1983 for an equal protection violation, we affirm the district court\u2019s order. <em>Hodge v. Gansler, </em>No. 8:13-cv-01949-AW (D.Md. July 18, 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b236-6\">. Although there exists no federal claim for \"racial profiling,\u201d in adherence to our obligation of construing the filings of a pro se party liberally, <em>Gordon, </em>574 F.2d at 1151, we construe Hodge\u2019s claim as one for a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b236-7\">. In his informal appellate brief, Hodge does not present any specific arguments challenging as error the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint as to his remaining claims and the remaining Defendants. Accordingly, Hodge has forfeited appellate review of these issues. 4th Cir. R. 34(b); <em>Wahi v. Charleston Area Med. Ctr., Inc., </em>562 F.3d 599, 607 (4th Cir.2009); <em>Williams v. Giant Food Inc., </em>370 F.3d 423, 430 n. 4 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
