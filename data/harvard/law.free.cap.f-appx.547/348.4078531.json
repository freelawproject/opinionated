Bond under the Crime Victims\u2019 Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3771 (\u201cCVRA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-16\">The CVRA affords to victims of crime the rights to reasonable protection from the accused, to notice of court proceedings, to participation in court proceedings, to confer with government counsel, to receive restitution, to proceedings free from unreasonable delay, and to be treated with fairness. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3771(a). These rights may be asserted in the district court and, if the district court denies relief, the movant may petition the court of appeals for a writ of mandamus. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3771(d)(3). If such a petition is filed, \u201c[t]he court of appeals shall take up and decide such application forthwith within 72 hours after the petition has been filed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the court of appeals denies the relief sought, \u201cthe reasons for the denial shall be clearly stated on the record in a written opinion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-18\">Bond filed a Motion for Relief under the Crime Victim\u2019s Rights Act in the district court on November 20, 2013 alleging that the Maryland U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office is violating his rights under the Crime Victim\u2019s Rights Act, and the rights of all the citizens of Maryland, by failing to protect them from judicial misconduct of federal judges and misconduct by \u201cincompetent and unethical attorneys.\u201d Bond has been attempting to intervene in the underlying criminal case since 2009, to unseal documents which he claims will show misconduct on the part of judges and attorneys in the case. (Bond is named as an \u201cinterested party\u201d on the docket sheet of the underlying criminal case.) The district judge denied the motion on November 21, 2013, by handwriting the word \u201cdenied\u201d on the first page of the motion without further discussion (see attached).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-19\">Petitioner filed the petition for writ of mandamus pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3771, Crime Victims\u2019 Rights in this court on December 5, 2013 at 3:21 p.m. According to Bond, this case involves \u201ca highly publicized Maryland political corruption case in which a total of nine people were prosecuted and convicted by the Government.\u201d Bond had been attempting to intervene in this case for many years to unseal the record in the criminal case. In 2009, the district court denied his motion to intervene and unseal \u201cattorney disqualification\u201d and \u201cprosecutorial misconduct\u201d documents, and this court, in 09-7572, in an unpublished per curiam opinion, affirmed for the reasons stated by the district judge (see docket entry 221 of the district court docket, entered July 16, 2009.) Petitioner is now attempting to relitigate these same issues by claiming his status as \u201ccrime victim\u201d under the Crime Victim\u2019s Rights Act and alleging that the Maryland U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>Attorney\u2019s Office owes a duty to him, and the other citizens of Maryland, to protect them from the federal judges who have \u201crepetitiously violated 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455,\u201d pertaining to the disqualification of judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Petitioner is not a crime victim under the Crime Victim\u2019s Rights Act. He was not the victim in the underlying criminal matter \u2014 he is listed on the district court docket as \u201can interested party.\u201d His failed attempts to intervene in the criminal case do not make him a crime victim, nor do the alleged denials of his rights under the Crime Victim\u2019s Rights Act bootstrap him to this status. By his own admission, \u201cthere is no prosecution to be as yet underway.\u201d The rights he seeks-unsealing of documents and protection \u201cfrom two Article III judges who have repetitiously violated 28 U.S.C. 455\u201d are not rights enumerated in 18 U.S.C. 3771(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Accordingly, the court denies petitioner\u2019s application to proceed in forma pauperis and dismisses the petition for writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
