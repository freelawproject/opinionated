Jones seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order dismissing his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2006) complaint without prejudice for failure to comply with the court\u2019s order to file an amended complaint specifically providing the names of each defendant and the actionable conduct attributable to each defendant. This court may exercise jurisdiction only over final orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2006), and certain interlocutory and collateral orders. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 (2006); Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 545-47, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). The order Jones seeks to appeal is neither a final order nor an appealable interlocutory or collateral order, because it is possible for him to cure the pleading deficiencies in the complaint that were identified by the district court. <em>Domino Sugar Corp. v. Sugar Workers Local Union 392, </em>10 F.3d 1064, 1066-67 (4th Cir.1993) (holding that an order dismissing a complaint without prejudice is a final, appealable order only if \u201cno amendment [to the complaint] could cure the defects in the plaintiffs case\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>see also Chao v. Rivendell Woods, Inc., </em>415 F.3d 342, 345 (4th Cir.2005) (explaining that, under <em>Domino Sugar, </em>this court must \u201cexamine the appealability of a dismissal without prejudice based on the specific facts of the case in order to guard against piecemeal litigation and repetitive appeals\u201d). Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal conten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>tions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
