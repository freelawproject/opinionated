We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-24\">On appeal, we confine our review to the issues raised in the Appellant\u2019s brief. <em>See </em>4th Cir. R. 34(b). Because Lopez\u2019s informal brief does not challenge the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for sentence reduction, he has forfeited appellate review of that portion of the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-25\">With respect to the district court\u2019s denial of the motion to compel, it is well-settled that whether to file a Rule 35(b) motion is a matter left to the Government\u2019s discretion. Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b); <em>United States v. Dixon, </em>998 F.2d 228, 230 (4th Cir.1993). A court may remedy the Government\u2019s refusal to move for a sentence reduction under Rule 35(b) if: (1) the Government has obligated itself in the plea agreement to move for the reduction; or (2) the Government\u2019s refusal to move for the reduc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>tion was based on an unconstitutional motive. <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">After review of the record, we conclude that neither circumstance is present here. The plea agreement between Lopez and the Government clearly establishes that the decision whether to file a Rule 35(b) motion rested with the Government\u2019s discretion, and Lopez did not claim in the motion to compel that the Government\u2019s refusal to file a Rule 35(b) motion was based on an unconstitutional motive.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Lopez\u2019s motions. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
