By moving to proceed IFP, Cobb is challenging the district court\u2019s certification decision that his appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Our inquiry into an appellant\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-22\">Cobb argues that the Fair Sentencing Act (FSA) should be entirely retroactive to those sentenced before its enactment, such as him, and that the failure to apply the FSA to him was racially discriminatory in violation of his equal protection and due process rights. He complains that his sentence exceeds what his statutory maximum would have been under the FSA. These arguments do not present a nonfrivolous issue for appeal. <em>See United States v. Kelly, </em>716 F.3d 180, 181 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 134 S.Ct. 439, 187 L.Ed.2d 295, 2013 WL 4206079 (Oct. 15, 2013) (No. 13-5815).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-25\">In his next argument, Cobb contends that the continued enhancement of his sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.2 violates Amendment 591 to the Sentencing Guidelines. This argument is frivolous because Cobb\u2019s sentence did not involve the application of \u00a7 2D 1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-26\">Cobb also contends that the district court abused its discretion by failing to properly assess the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and denying a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based in part on his receipt of a prior reduction in his sentence pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35. For the same reasons set forth in <em>United States v. Cobb, </em>514 Fed.Appx. 502, 503 (5th Cir.2013), this argument does not present a nonfrivolous issue for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-27\">Lastly, Cobb asserts that the Government failed to file a notice under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 regarding the enhancement of his sentence and that his sentence was imposed in violation of <em>Jones v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 227, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 143 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>L.Ed.2d 311 (1999); <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000); and their progeny because the drug quantity supporting his sentence was not submitted as a question to the jury and proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Section 3582(c)(2) proceedings are not full resentencings, and Cobb\u2019s attempt to relitigate the facts underlying his original sentencing exceeds the scope of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See United States v. Hernandez, </em>645 F.3d 709, 712 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The IFP motion and appellate brief filed by Cobb do not demonstrate a nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, his IFP motion is denied, and the appeal is dismissed. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Cobb is warned that frivolous, repetitive, or otherwise abusive filings in the future will invite the imposition of sanctions, including dismissal, monetary sanctions, and/or restrictions on his ability to file pleadings in this court and any other court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction. He is further warned that, in order to avoid the imposition of sanctions, he should review any pending appeals and actions and move to dismiss any that are frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTION FOR LEAVE TO PROCEED IFP DENIED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b612-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
