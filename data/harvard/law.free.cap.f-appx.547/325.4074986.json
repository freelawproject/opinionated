On appeal, Leonard\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal but questioning whether the sentence imposed by the district court was substantively reasonable. The Government has filed a motion to dismiss Leonard\u2019s appeal based on the appellate waiver provision in the plea agreement. Leonard\u2019s counsel opposes the Government\u2019s motion as premature. Leonard filed a pro se supplemental brief, in which he argues that the sentence imposed was procedurally and substantively unreasonable and that his appellate waiver was not knowing and voluntary because the court failed to fully question his understanding of the waiver provision and because counsel was ineffective for failing to advise him of the consequences of the appellate waiver. We grant in part the Government\u2019s motion and dismiss Leonard\u2019s appeal of his sentence, and we deny in part the Government\u2019s motion and affirm Leonard\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-22\">We review de novo a defendant\u2019s waiver of appellate rights. <em>United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162, 168 (4th Cir.2005). \u201cA defendant may waive his right to appeal if that waiver is the result of a knowing and intelligent decision to forgo the right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Amayar-Portillo, </em>423 F.3d 427, 430 (4th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see United States v. General, </em>278 F.3d 389, 400 (4th Cir.2002) (providing standard). The district court\u2019s failure to specifically question the defendant\u2019s understanding of the waiver provision is relevant to, but not dispositive of, the question of whether the waiver was knowing and intelligent. <em>General, </em>278 F.3d at 400. Additionally, while \u201ca waiver of the right to appeal may not be knowing and voluntary if tainted by the advice of constitutionally ineffective trial counsel\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>410 F.3d 137, 151 (4th Cir.2005), such ineffective assistance must \u201cconclusively appear[] from the record\u201d for the claim to proceed on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>136 F.3d 972, 979 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Our review of the record leads us to conclude that the present record does not conclusively show that counsel rendered ineffective assistance, and that Leonard\u2019s waiver of appellate rights was knowing and voluntary. Thus, the waiver is valid and enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">We will enforce a valid waiver so long as \u201cthe issue being appealed is within the scope of the waiver.\u201d <em>Blick, </em>408 F.3d at 168. We conclude that the sentencing issues raised in both the <em>Anders </em>brief and the pro se supplemental brief fall within the scope of the appellate waiver provision, because the 210-month sentence imposed by the district court was within the Guidelines range established at the sentencing hearing. Therefore, we grant in part the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss and dismiss this portion of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The waiver provision does not, however, preclude our review of Leonard\u2019s conviction pursuant to <em>Anders. </em>We have reviewed the plea colloquy for plain error and have found none. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.2002) (providing standard); <em>see also United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (detailing plain error standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no unwaived and potentially meritorious issues for review. We therefore grant Leonard\u2019s pro se motion to supplement the record and affirm Leonard\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">This court requires that counsel inform Leonard, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Leonard requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Leonard. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
