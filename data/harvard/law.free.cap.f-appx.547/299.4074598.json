On appeal, Chitty\u2019s sole argument is that the district court erred in dismissing her complaint without providing her notice of the court\u2019s intention and an opportunity to respond. But under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), which governs proceedings in forma pauperis, a district court is directed to dismiss a case \u201cat any time\u201d if the court finds that the case or appeal is frivolous or malicious, fails to state a claim, or seeks damages from a party who is immune from such relief. Because Chitty moved for and was granted leave to proceed in forma pauper-is, \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) authorized the sua sponte dismissal effected by the district court. <em>See Jones v. Bock, </em>549 U.S. 199, 214, 127 S.Ct. 910, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007) (noting Prison Litigation Reform Act allows sua sponte dismissal of in forma pauperis case for failure to state a claim, among other grounds). We therefore conclude that Chitty\u2019s argument lacks merit,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">We deny Liberty University\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b326-8\">. Chitty's brief does not contend that any of her claims did, in fact, sufficiently state a claim for relief, and we therefore do not address that issue. <em>See Suarez-Valenzuelo, v. Holder, </em>714 F.3d 241, 248-49 (4th Cir.2013) (holding issues not raised in argument section of opening brief are abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b326-9\">. Even if the district court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice would otherwise be a non-appeal-able interlocutory order, <em>see Domino Sugar Corp. v. Sugar Workers Local Union 392, </em>10 F.3d 1064, 1066-67 (4th Cir.1993), the applicable two-year statute of limitations period on Chitty\u2019s fraud claims has passed. Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 8.01-243(A) (2013 Cum.Supp.). Thus, we conclude that the district court\u2019s dismissal order is effectively final.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
