He filed an untimely 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition in 2007, followed by an unsuccessful motion for relief from judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b). We denied a certificate of appealability (COA) from each of those decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">In 2012, Adams filed a second Rule 60 motion, arguing that no COA should have been required for his appeal from the denial of the first Rule 60 motion. The district court denied the motion. Adams has appealed to our court without having sought a COA from the district court or our court. Adams denies that a COA is needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-10\">A COA is required before we may consider this appeal. <em>See Ochoa Canales v. Quarterman, </em>507 F.3d 884, 886-88 (5th Cir.2007); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1). Because Adams has not obtained a COA and does not ask for one, his appeal is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(1); <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 335-36, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003) (holding that the COA requirement of \u00a7 2253(c)(1) \u201cis a jurisdictional prerequisite\u201d). We note nonetheless that the claims Adams seeks to raise on appeal are so plainly frivolous that any further effort to obtain a COA would be futile.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b638-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
