We previously granted a certificate of appealability with respect to Diaz\u2019s claim that counsel rendered ineffective assistance in failing to note a direct appeal as requested. After additional briefing, we vacate in part and remand and dismiss the appeal in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-12\">In his \u00a7 2255 motion, which was verified in compliance with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746 (2006), Diaz claimed that he requested that counsel file a notice of appeal. The Government presented an affidavit from counsel attesting that Diaz never requested that a notice of appeal be filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-13\">In <em>United States v. Peak, </em>992 F.2d 39, 41-42 (4th Cir.1993), this court held that counsel\u2019s failure to file a notice of appeal as directed constitutes per se ineffective assistance. Under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255(b), unless the pleadings, files, and records conclusively show that the prisoner is not entitled to relief, the district court shall hold an evidentiary hearing. <em>United States v. Witherspoon, </em>231 F.3d 923, 925-27 (4th Cir.2000). Whether an evidentiary hearing is necessary is generally left to the sound discretion of the district judge, but we long ago recognized that there remains \u201ca category of petitions, usually involving credibility, that will require an evidentiary hearing in open court.\u201d <em>Raines v. United States, </em>423 F.2d 526, 530 (4th Cir.1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-14\">Diaz\u2019s claim that counsel failed to file a notice of appeal when requested, if believed, states a colorable claim of ineffective assistance. <em>Peak, </em>992 F.2d at 41-42. However, the district court denied relief with respect to this claim after determining that it lacked credibility. In light of Diaz\u2019s claim, under penalty of perjury, that counsel failed to honor his request to file a notice of appeal and counsel\u2019s conflicting affidavit denying that Diaz asked him to note an appeal, the record did not conclusively show that Diaz was not entitled to relief. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255(b); <em>see Raines, </em>423 F.2d at 530 (\u201cWhen the issue is one of credibility, resolution on the basis of affidavits can rarely be conclusive.\u201d). The district court therefore abused its discretion in concluding, without an evidentiary hearing, that Diaz did not direct counsel to file a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>Accordingly, we vacate that portion of the district court\u2019s order denying relief on Diaz\u2019s claim that counsel rendered ineffective assistance in failing to file a notice of appeal as requested and remand for further proceedings as to this issue.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We previously denied a certificate of appealability as to Diaz\u2019s remaining claim of ineffective assistance and dismiss the appeal as to that claim. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">\n<em>VACATED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b331-16\"> By this disposition, we indicate no view as to the appropriate outcome of the proceedings on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
