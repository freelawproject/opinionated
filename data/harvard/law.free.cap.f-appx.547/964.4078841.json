California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Our independent review of the entire record reveals that counsel\u2019s assessment of the relative merit of the appeal is correct. Because independent examination of the entire record reveals no arguable issues of merit, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and Ramadan\u2019s convictions and sentences are AFFIRMED. Ramadan\u2019s request for a 60-day extension to file an initial appellate brief is DENIED AS MOOT.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">Additionally, there is a clerical error in the judgment \u2014 Count 1 of the judgment incorrectly notes that Ramadan was convicted of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and conversion of public property, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. However, Ramadan was indicted and convicted of conspiracy to commit mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1349. Accordingly, the case is REMANDED to the district court with instructions to correct the clerical error in Count 1 of the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
