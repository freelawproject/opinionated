For the reasons below, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-28\">In March 2011, Evans filed a civil rights complaint alleging that the defendants had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>abandoned his inebriated father who was subsequently struck by a car and killed. Evans had brought an earlier complaint in state court raising claims based on this same event. The state courts dismissed the complaint in part and granted summary judgment on the remaining claims in the defendants\u2019 favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">On April 3, 2012, the District Court concluded that under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, it lacked jurisdiction over the complaint to the extent that Evans sought to invalidate the state courts\u2019 judgment. <em>See D.C. Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983); <em>Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923). It also concluded that the claims were barred by claim and issue preclusion and the statute of limitations. It determined that amendment of the complaint would be futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Evans filed a timely motion pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b), in which he argued that the state courts refused to apply the law in the death of an African-American against a white police officer. On June 4, 2012, the District Court denied the motion because Evans had not shown extraordinary circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">On June 19, 2012, Evans filed a document entitled \u201cRule 9 Special Pleading Request of Rehearing.\u201d He repeated his argument that the state court judge denied \u201cequal legal review\u201d because the defendant was a white police officer and the son of a politician. On August 28, 2012, Evans filed a motion for an extension of time to appeal the June 4, 2012 order. On September 7, 2012, the District Court construed the June 19th motion as a motion for reconsideration and denied it.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">On February 28, 2013, Evans filed a motion to reopen the case. On July 26, 2013, the District Court denied the motion to reopen the case but granted the still-pending motion for an extension of time to appeal the June 4, 2012 order. On August 2, 2013, Evans filed a notice of appeal from the District Court\u2019s April 3, 2012 and June 4, 2012 orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">We lack jurisdiction over those two orders.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because Evans\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion was filed within twenty-eight days, it tolled the time to appeal the April 3rd order until it was decided on June 4, 2012. Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(A)(vi). However, Evans\u2019s June 19, 2012 motion for reconsideration did not toll the time to appeal the June 4, 2012 order. Where a motion for reconsideration is made by a party who lost an earlier Rule 4(a)(4) motion and the factual and legal issues are similar, the motion does not postpone the time to appeal. <em>Turner v. Evers, </em>726 F.2d 112, 114 (3d Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-11\">Thus, the time to file a notice of appeal from the April 3rd and June 4th orders expired thirty days later on July 5, 2012. When Evans filed a motion for an extension of time to file a notice of appeal from the June 4, 2012 order on August 28, 2012, it was not filed within thirty days after the time to appeal had expired, i.e., by Monday, August 6, 2012. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5)(A)(i). Thus, the time to appeal could not be extended.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-12\">Construing Evans\u2019s notice of appeal liberally, we have jurisdiction over the District Court\u2019s July 26, 2012 order denying his motion to reopen. In that motion, Evans argued that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Martinez v. Ryan, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 1309, 182 L.Ed.2d 272 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>(2012), allowed him to overcome the untimeliness of his complaint because he did not have counsel in state court. In <em>Martinez, </em>the Supreme Court held that ineffective assistance of counsel in a state initial-review collateral proceeding can constitute cause to excuse the default of an ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim in a petition filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. <em>Martinez, </em>132 S.Ct. at 1315. <em>Martinez </em>is not applicable to this matter which involves a civil rights complaint, and the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">For the above reasons, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order. Appellant\u2019s motions for the appointment of counsel are denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b118-7\">. If we had jurisdiction over those orders, we would summarily affirm for the reasons given by the District Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
