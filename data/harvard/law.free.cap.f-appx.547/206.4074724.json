Chen disputes the finding that he failed to qualify for asylum, withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-20\">A determination regarding eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal is affirmed if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Administrative findings of fact, including findings on credibility, are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to decide to the contrary. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (2012). This court reviews legal issues de novo, \u201caffording appropriate deference to the [Board\u2019s] interpretation of the [Immigration and Nationality Act] and any attendant regulations.\u201d <em>Li Fang Lin v. Mukasey, </em>517 F.3d 685, 691-92 (4th Cir.2008). We will reverse the Board only if \u201cthe evidence ... presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>was so compelling that no reasonable fact-finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812; <em>see Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s finding that Chen failed to meet his statutory burdens. We therefore uphold the denial of Chen\u2019s requests for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004) (\u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum-even though the facts that must be proved are the same-an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d). Finally, to qualify for CAT protection, a petitioner bears the burden of demonstrating that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2013). Based on our review, we find that substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s conclusion that Chen did not qualify for this relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
