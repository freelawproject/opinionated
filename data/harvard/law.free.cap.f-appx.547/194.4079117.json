The district court downwardly varied from the fifty-seven to seventy-one-month Guidelines range, sentencing Stanfield to concurrent forty-two-month prison terms. Stanfield timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-19\">Counsel has filed a brief, pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), certifying that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but questioning whether Stan-field\u2019s sentence is greater than necessary to comply with the requirements of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2012). Stanfield was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but he did not file one. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-20\">We review the district court\u2019s sentence, \u201cwhether inside, just outside, or significantly outside the Guidelines range[,] ... under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). This standard of review involves two steps; under the first, we examine the sentence for significant procedural errors, and under the second, we review the substance of the sentence. <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir.2007) (analyzing <em>Gall, 552 </em>U.S. at 50-51, 128 S.Ct. 586). Significant procedural errors include \u201cfailing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall, 552 </em>U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-21\">If there are no significant procedural errors, we then consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence, \u201ctak[ing] into account the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the sentence is within or below the properly calculated Guidelines range, this Court applies a presumption on appeal that the sentence is substantively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>reasonable. <em>United States v. Yooho Wean, </em>722 F.3d 583, 590 (4th Cir.2013). Such a presumption is rebutted only if the defendant shows \u201cthat the sentence is unreasonable when measured against the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). We have reviewed the record and conclude that Stanfield\u2019s below-Guidelines sentence is both procedurally and substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform Stanfield, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Stanfield requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Stanfield. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
