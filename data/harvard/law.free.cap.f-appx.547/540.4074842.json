Contreras-Cano argues that the district court should have granted him the minor participant adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b) because he was less culpable than the other participants in the offense. He contends that he was a mere courier hired to drive a truck that others loaded to a place others told him to go.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-21\">Contreras-Cano pleaded guilty to importation and possession with intent to distribute more than 50 kilograms of marijuana. Although his role may have been less culpable than others in the broader conspiracy, his role in actually bringing the marijuana across the border was integral to his offenses. As the district court noted, Contreras-Cano was paid to carry loads of marijuana across the border six times, and was paid even more to transport the marijuana deep into the interior of the United States. The district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>did not clearly err in finding that Contreras-Cano was not entitled to a minor participant adjustment. <em>See United States v. Silva-De Hoyos, </em>702 F.3d 843, 847 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b566-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
