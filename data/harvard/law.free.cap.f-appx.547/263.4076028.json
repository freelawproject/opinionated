Johnson, the administrator of Kirill Denyakin\u2019s estate, brought this action against City of Portsmouth Police Officer Stephen D. Rankin, alleging that Rankin was liable for excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and battery and gross negligence under Virginia law. A jury ruled in favor of Rankin on all counts. Johnson now appeals, arguing that the district court erred in making certain evidentiary determinations. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-18\">On the night of April 23, 2011, Rankin received a \u201cPriority One\u201d emergency call from City of Portsmouth, Virginia, Dispatch reporting a \u201cburglary in progress\u201d at an apartment building. Priority One calls are reserved for situations in which someone is in physical danger. Rankin testified that the dispatcher told him that a man was trying to break down a door. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>According to Rankin, when he arrived, he saw a man matching the suspect\u2019s description violently banging on a glass door with both hands over his head, apparently trying to gain entry into the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">Rankin testified that he positioned himself about thirty-five feet away from the suspect \u2014 Denyakin, an immigrant from Kazakhstan. Rankin stated that he drew his weapon, identified himself as a police officer, and repeatedly told Denyakin to stop, show his hands, and get down on the ground. According to Rankin, Denyakin stopped banging on the door when Rankin issued his commands. Denyakin then lowered his hands to his sides and shoved his right hand in his pants, a place where Rankin knew that suspects can hide weapons. Rankin testified that Denyakin appeared to be \u201cdigging for an object.\u201d At this time, Rankin called \u201cclear the air\u201d into his radio, which is a signal that lets other officers know that an emergency situation is unfolding. Rankin testified that Denyakin then charged at him and did not stop when Rankin ordered him to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Rankin further testified that, although he did not see a weapon, Denyakin\u2019s behavior led him to believe that he was in serious physical danger. He fired his weapon eleven times over the course of about three seconds, and each shot struck Denyakin, Wiling him. RanWn may have fired the last one or two shots as DenyaWn fell to the ground. Although Rankin testified that DenyaWn had his right hand inside his pants when he started the charge, he is unsure when Denyakin removed his hand because his focus shifted to Denya-Wn\u2019s \u201ccenter mass\u201d when he began charging. A search later revealed that Denya-Wn was not carrying a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">Johnson brought this action against RanWn, both individually and in his official capacity, alleging a claim of excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment under \u00a7 1983 and state law claims for battery and gross negligence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A jury trial commenced on February 28, 2012. This appeal concerns three evidentiary determinations that the district court made. First, Johnson challenges the district court\u2019s decision to allow \u201cprior bad act\u201d evidence regarding DenyaWn\u2019s alcoholism and his behavior during an earlier encounter with police. At trial, Johnson contended that Denyakin could not have charged at RanWn due to his high blood alcohol content (BAC) \u2014 0.28%\u2014at the time of the incident. In support of this theory, Johnson presented lay witness testimony about DenyaWn\u2019s heavy drinWng and inappropriate behavior the day of the shooting. He also offered the expert testimony of toxicologist Alphonse PolWs, who believed that DenyaWn was too drunk to charge at RanWn. In response, Rankin presented lay witness testimony that Denyakin appeared coherent and coordinated before his encounter with Rankin and that he smoked a cigarette, walked along the street, and went up and down steps. RanWn also offered expert testimony that Denyakin was a chronic alcoholic who had developed a tolerance for alcohol and could charge at RanWn despite his high BAC. Finally, RanWn presented lay and expert testimony regarding a confrontation DenyaWn had with police on February 21, 2011, when he had a BAC of 0.22%. During that encounter, Denyakin walked without stumbling, and a police officer told him that he could shoot him if he failed to show his hands. The testimony also revealed that Denyakin threatened to beat his girlfriend, punched her apart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>ment window, and drew a bloody symbol on her door.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Second, Johnson challenges the district court\u2019s decision to exclude two of Rankin\u2019s Facebook postings from the liability phase of trial. Johnson sought to introduce the postings as evidence of Rankin\u2019s motivation for shooting Denyakin. One posting included a photograph of an ethnic lynching with the caption, \u201cLOVE IS ... Doing whatever is necessary.\u201d Another posting showed guns and gun-cleaning equipment with the caption \u201cRankin\u2019s box of vengeance\u201d and the comment that it would be better if Rankin were \u201cdirtying\u201d the guns. The district court concluded that the postings were \u201cinflammatory\u201d and decided to bifurcate the issue of punitive damages from the rest of the trial, allowing the Facebook evidence only at the punitive damages stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Third, Johnson contests the district court\u2019s decision to exclude an autopsy photograph. At trial, Johnson called Virginia Assistant Chief Medical Examiner Elizabeth Kinnison \u2014 the doctor who performed the autopsy on Denyakin \u2014 as an expert witness. Kinnison testified regarding a gunshot wound on Denyakin\u2019s right hand. According to Kinnison, \u201c[t]he way that the edges of [the wound] tore made me favor that [the bullet] went from the palm of his hand to the back of his hand, but I\u2019m not absolutely certain that it couldn\u2019t have gone from back to front.\u201d Johnson sought to admit a photograph of the wound, claiming that it showed that Denyakin\u2019s hand could not have been in his pants at the time of the shooting because people typically insert their hands into their pants with the palm facing the body. The court declined to admit the photograph following this exchange with Kinnison:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-8\">THE COURT: The issue was if this would help her opinion or help her be more sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-9\">THE COURT: Does that photograph, Dr. Kinnison, assist you in making any different conclusion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-10\">THE WITNESS: No, ma'am.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">The court held that the photograph\u2019s \u201cprejudicial value clearly outweighs any probative value on [Kinnison\u2019s] testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Au\">On March 1, 2012, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Rankin on all counts. Johnson filed this timely appeal, challenging the aforesaid evidentiary decisions. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-13\">Johnson contends that the district court erred in admitting prior bad act evidence that \u201cportrayed Denyakin as ... an alcoholic, an abuser of women, and that he had previously been arrested by a different police officer.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Most of this evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>stemmed from Denyakin\u2019s February 21, 2011, encounter with police, during which a police officer informed him that the police could shoot him if he did not comply with their instructions. Although he was highly intoxicated, Denyakin was able to walk without stumbling and behave violently toward his girlfriend.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">We review the district court\u2019s rulings regarding the admissibility of evidence for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Cole, </em>631 F.3d 146, 153 (4th Cir.2011). A district court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily, <em>see id., </em>or applies \u201cerroneous legal principles to the case,\u201d <em>United States v. Mason, </em>52 F.3d 1286, 1290 (4th Cir.1995). This Court has established a four-part test for determining the admissibility of prior act evidence under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-6\">(1) The evidence must be relevant to an issue, such as an element of an offense, and must not be offered to establish the general character of the defendant. In this regard, the more similar the prior act is (in terms of physical similarity or mental state) to the act being proved, the more relevant it becomes. (2) The act must be necessary in the sense that it is probative of an essential claim or an element of the offense. (3) The evidence must be reliable. And (4) the evidence\u2019s probative value must not be substantially outweighed by confusion or unfair prejudice in the sense that it tends to subordinate reason to emotion in the factfinding process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-7\"><em>Cole, </em>631 F.3d at 154 (quoting <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>617 F.3d 286, 296-97 (4th Cir.2010)).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">With respect to the first step of this inquiry, Rankin contends that the evidence is relevant for two reasons that are unrelated to Denyakin\u2019s general character. First, the evidence demonstrates that Denyakin was capable of charging at Rankin while extremely intoxicated, which Johnson disputed. Second, the evidence shows that Denyakin was on notice that he would be shot if he did not comply with Rankin\u2019s instructions, which is relevant to Rankin\u2019s assumption of the risk and contributory negligence defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-11\">Johnson questions both of Rankin\u2019s arguments in favor of the relevance of this evidence. First, Johnson argues that the evidence merely shows Denyakin\u2019s past experience with alcohol, which is unrelated to the true issue in this case: Denyakin\u2019s ability to attack a police officer. We disagree. The events of February 21, 2011, demonstrate that Denyakin could walk, respond lucidly to a police officer, and behave violently while drunk. The testimony regarding Denyakin\u2019s alcoholism further illustrates his heightened ability to act while intoxicated. Specifically, the testimony shows that Denyakin had developed a tolerance to alcohol that allowed him to function with a high BAC. We therefore find that the evidence in question speaks to Denyakin\u2019s ability to function while intoxicated, which bears on whether Denyakin could have charged at Rankin while drunk.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-12\">Second, Johnson contends that the contributory negligence defense involves an objective inquiry, rendering irrelevant the question of whether Denyakin was on notice that he could be shot. However, pursuant to Virginia law, contributory negligence has a subjective component: it \u201crequires sufficient evidence of knowledge on the part of [the] plaintiff of the danger <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>to be guarded against.\u201d <em>Philip Morris, Inc. v. Emerson, </em>235 Va. 380, 368 S.E.2d 268, 280 (1988); <em>see also Arndt v. Russillo, </em>231 Va. 328, 343 S.E.2d 84, 88 (1986) (\u201cTo establish th[e] [contributory negligence] defense, [the defendant] was required to prove that [the plaintiff] knew or should have known that [the plaintiff] would drive recklessly....\u201d). Furthermore, Virginia\u2019s assumption of the risk defense requires the defendant to prove that the plaintiff \u201cfully appreciated\u201d \u201cthe nature and extent of the risk\u201d and \u201cvoluntarily incurred\u201d that risk. <em>Monk v. Hess, </em>213 Va. 244, 191 S.E.2d 229, 230 (1972) (quoting <em>Leslie v. Nitz, </em>212 Va. 480, 184 S.E.2d 755, 757 (1971)) (internal quotation marks omitted). This certainly is a subjective inquiry. Accordingly, the district court did not err in determining that the evidence regarding Denyakin\u2019s alcohol abuse and actions on February 21, 2011, was relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">The evidence in question also survives the second step of the above test because \u201cit is probative of an essential claim.\u201d <em>Cole, </em>631 F.3d at 154. Each of Johnson\u2019s claims turns on whether Rankin was justified in using lethal force, and evidence that illustrates Denyakin\u2019s ability to charge while intoxicated \u2014 such as the February 21, 2011, incident and Denyakin\u2019s alcoholism \u2014 speaks to whether Rankin was so justified. The third step of the above test \u2014 the reliability of the evidence \u2014 is not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Regarding the fourth step, the district court engaged in a limited inquiry regarding whether the prior act evidence\u2019s probative value outweighed its prejudicial effect under Federal Rule of Evidence 403. After the district court overruled Johnson\u2019s objection that the evidence constituted hearsay, the district court noted that the evidence was \u201chighly relevant to contributory negligence, because ... a person has for a second time knowingly put themselves in the same path of danger.\u201d The court also gave a cautionary instruction to combat any prejudice. In this way, the district court implicitly recognized that the evidence\u2019s probative value outweighed its prejudicial effect. This Court has explained that, \u201c[a]s long as the record as a whole indicates appropriate judicial weighing, we will not reverse for failure to recite mechanically the appropriate balancing test.\u201d <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>780 F.2d 1140, 1142 (4th Cir.1986). We therefore determine that the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the evidence in question satisfies Rule 403. Because the evidence regarding Denyakin\u2019s alcoholism and prior encounter with police complies with this Court\u2019s four-part test, we hold that the district court did not err in admitting this evidence pursuant to Rule 404(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">Next, Johnson contends that the district court erred in excluding Rankin\u2019s Face-book postings from the liability phase of the trial. At the time of trial, Johnson contended that the postings were \u201cparticularly relevant to [Rankin\u2019s] motive, intent, and state of mind as it relates to [Johnson\u2019s] punitive damages claims under \u00a7 1983 and the state tort claims\u201d and \u201cgo towards the issue of reckless or callousness under the Supreme Court\u2019s test [for punitive damages in <em>Smith v. Wade, </em>461 U.S. 30, 56, 103 S.Ct. 1625, 75 L.Ed.2d 632 (1983) ].\u201d Johnson now contends that the Facebook postings speak to Rankin\u2019s credibility, implying that they show Rankin was motivated to intentionally engage in ethnic violence \u2014 such as shooting an immigrant \u2014 and lie about why he did it. Because Johnson failed to preserve his objection on credibility grounds, we review the district court\u2019s ruling only for plain error. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number><em>See Beech Aircraft Corp. v. Rainey, </em>488 U.S. 153, 174, 109 S.Ct. 439, 102 L.Ed.2d 445 (1988) (to preserve an objection to the exclusion of evidence, its proponent must \u201cmak[e] known ... the party\u2019s objection ... and the grounds therefor\u201d). To reverse, there must be (1) an error, (2) which is plain, (3) which affects substantial rights, and (4) which seriously affects \u201cthe fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-37, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The trial court excluded the Facebook postings on the grounds that they were (1) \u201cinflammatory\u201d and (2) irrelevant due to the standard that the Supreme Court set forth in <em>Graham v. Connor, </em>490 U.S. 386, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989). In <em>Graham, </em>the Supreme Court held that the plaintiff in a \u00a7 1983 excessive force case does not bear the burden of proving that the officer acted with \u201csubjective motivations\u201d that were \u201cmalicious and sadistic.\u201d 490 U.S. at 397, 109 S.Ct. 1865. The Supreme Court also explained, however, that evidence of the officer\u2019s \u201cill-will\u201d can come into play in \u201cassessing the credibility of an officer\u2019s account of the circumstances that prompted the use of force.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 399 n. 12, 109 S.Ct. 1865. Therefore, contrary to Rankin\u2019s assertions, <em>Graham </em>does not indicate that evidence of motive \u2014 such as the Facebook postings \u2014 is irrelevant to the \u00a7 1983 calculus.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Rankin\u2019s motive and credibility could also weigh on Johnson\u2019s gross negligence and battery claims. In Virginia, \u201c \u2018[gjross negligence\u2019 is that degree of negligence which shows an utter disregard of prudence amounting to complete neglect of the safety of another,\u201d <em>Frazier v. City of Norfolk, </em>234 Va. 388, 362 S.E.2d 688, 691 (1987), and battery is the \u201cunwanted touching which is neither consented to, excused, nor justified,\u201d <em>Koffman v. Gar-nett, </em>265 Va. 12, 574 S.E.2d 258, 261 (2003). If Rankin was untruthful about whether Denyakin charged at him, it could affect both of these claims by showing the unreasonableness of, and lack of justification for, his actions. The district court therefore erred in concluding that the evidence was irrelevant per se because it spoke to Rankin\u2019s motivation.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">But the error was not plain. Apart from the credibility issue, the Facebook postings are irrelevant to Rankin\u2019s liability in this case. As we explained above, Rankin\u2019s motivation does not affect his liability under \u00a7 1983 due to the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Graham </em>decision. Rankin does not dispute that he intended to shoot Denyakin, and his motive is irrelevant to the battery inquiry apart from his justification for doing so. <em>See id. </em>Finally, because the tort of negligence is governed by an objective standard, <em>see Sturman v. Johnson, </em>209 Va. 227, 163 S.E.2d 170, 176 (1968); <em>see also Va. Elec. &amp; Power Co. v. Dungee, </em>258 Va. 235, 520 S.E.2d 164, 174 (1999), Rankin\u2019s Facebook postings are not pertinent to this claim beyond their bearing on Rankin\u2019s credibility. In sum, although the Facebook postings are relevant to Rankin\u2019s liability, they are relevant in such a limited way that we cannot say that their exclusion affected Johnson\u2019s \u201csubstantial rights\u201d or contravened the fairness and integrity of the trial. <em>See Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">This is especially so given that, in addition to excluding the evidence for lack of relevance, the district court also found that it was inadmissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 403. The court agreed with Johnson\u2019s assessment that the postings were particularly probative with respect to punitive damages. However, the court explained that the postings had limited probative value with respect to Rankin\u2019s liability under the <em>Graham </em>objective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>reasonableness test. The court also found the postings \u201cinflammatory\u201d and opined that they could \u201ctake[ ] everything off the track of what the jury should be deciding\u201d and \u201ccould skew a trial.\u201d In light of the postings\u2019 limited relevance to Rankin\u2019s liability and their high prejudicial value, we determine that the district court did not err by excluding these postings from the liability phase of the trial pursuant to Rule 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Finally, Johnson argues that the district court erred in excluding an autopsy photograph showing a gunshot wound to Denyakin\u2019s hand. Johnson contends that the photograph is especially probative of Rankin\u2019s credibility because it shows that the bullet entered Denyakin\u2019s hand through the palm, making it unlikely that Denyakin\u2019s hand was in his pants at the time of the shooting. The court found that the photograph\u2019s prejudicial effect outweighed its probative value after Kinnison \u2014 the doctor who conducted the autopsy \u2014 testified that the photograph did not make her any more sure of whether Denyakin\u2019s hand was palm \u2014 forward when the bullet entered it. Kinnison testified that she \u201cfavored\u201d the theory that the bullet entered through Denyakin\u2019s palm based on the skin \u201ctags\u201d \u2014 or tears \u2014 on his hand. She then illustrated how she believed the bullet entered Denyakin\u2019s hand using her own hand. However, Kinnison emphasized that she was \u201cnot entirely certain\u201d about how the bullet hit Denyakin\u2019s hand or what position he was in when he received the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Johnson contends that the district court erred in hinging the photograph\u2019s admissibility on whether it would aid Kinnison in illustrating her testimony. However, the court simply used the photograph\u2019s usefulness to Kinnison to gauge its probative value for the Rule 403 balancing test. This Court has recognized that autopsy photographs are highly prejudicial,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and it will not disturb a district court\u2019s decision regarding their admissibility \u201cabsent a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Analta, </em>975 F.2d 119, 126 (4th Cir.1992). In light of the abuse of discretion standard and the prejudicial effect of autopsy photographs, we determine that the district court did not err in excluding the photograph, even if it had some probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in (1) allowing evidence of Denyakin\u2019s alcoholism and prior encounter with police under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b), (2) excluding Rankin\u2019s Facebook postings from the liability phase of the trial, and (3) excluding the autopsy photograph showing Denyakin\u2019s hand. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s evidentiary determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b291-6\">. Johnson also alleged cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment under \u00a7 1983. Johnson consented to the dismissal of this count on August 30, 2011, and it is not at issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b292-6\">. Johnson also challenges evidence \"portray[ing] Denyakin as a \u2018foreigner\u2019 and an illegal alien.\u201d The evidence showed that Denyakin was from Kazakhstan and went by the nickname \"KGB,\u201d which were simply facts of the case that Johnson's own witnesses discussed. Rankin presented minimal evidence of Denyakin\u2019s immigration status through Denyakin's brother\u2019s deposition. When Rankin asked Denyakin\u2019s brother whether Denyakin had been \"arrested at any time before\u201d the day of his death, his brother answered \u201cyes\u201d and explained that \"[t]he arrest was connected with immigration policy.\u201d The deposition does not include any further discussion of this arrest. This isolated comment hardly \"paint[s] Denyakin as a dangerous person of bad character\u201d as Johnson contends. Furthermore, this evidence did not pervade the trial to the extent that evidence of immigration status did in the cases Johnson cited in the memorandum he references in his reply brief. <em>See, e.g., TXI Transp. Co. v. Hughes, </em>306 S.W.3d 230, 245 (Tex.2010) (noting that the plaintiff \"sought to hedge his theory by calling attention to [the defendant's] illegal immigration status whenever he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>could\u201d); <em>Maldonado v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>789 So.2d 464, 466, 470 (Fla.Ct.App.2001) (deciding that the prejudicial effect of the defendant\u2019s immigration status outweighed its probative value when that status was \"a central feature\u201d at trial). We therefore do not further consider this portion of Johnson\u2019s argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b296-6\">. Johnson recognizes that photographs of dead bodies are highly prejudicial, arguing that the district court\u2019s ruling regarding the autopsy photograph was arbitrary and capricious because it admitted a more graphic photograph from the scene of the shooting. However, Johnson simply cites the photograph itself as support for his argument and does not explain why the district court's decision was arbitrary or capricious. We therefore see no reason to conclude that the district court abused its discretion by disallowing the autopsy photograph but admitting the scene photograph.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
