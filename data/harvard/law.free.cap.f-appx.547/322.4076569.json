On appeal, McNeil argues that the district court committed procedural error by failing to address one of his arguments in favor of a within-Guidelines sentence and that the extent of the departure rendered his sentence substantively unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-13\">We review any criminal sentence, \u201cwhether inside, just outside, or significantly outside the Guidelines range,\u201d for reasonableness, \u201cunder a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>United States v. King, </em>673 F.3d 274, 283 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 216, 184 L.Ed.2d 111 (2012); <em>see Gall v. United States, 552 </em>U.S. 38, 46, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). When the district court imposes a departure or variant sentence, \u201cwe consider whether the sentencing court acted reasonably both with respect to its decision to impose such a sentence and with respect to the extent of the divergence from the sentencing range.\u201d <em>United States v. Hemandez-Villanueva, </em>473 F.3d 118, 123 (4th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-16\">McNeil first argues that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to address McNeil\u2019s argument that his immediate and significant assistance to the police warranted a within-Guidelines sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-17\">When the defendant presents nonfrivolous reasons for imposing a particular sentence, the \u201cdistrict judge should address the party\u2019s arguments and explain why he has rejected those arguments.\u201d <em>United States v. Carter, </em>564 F.3d 325, 328 (4th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). In explaining the chosen sentence, the \u201csentencing judge should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-18\">On this record, there is no room to question the district court\u2019s awareness of McNeil\u2019s cooperation. It was mentioned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>by counsel for both sides at sentencing and discussed in the presentence report, with which the court plainly was familiar. As such, although McNeil is correct that the court did not explicitly state why this factor was not controlling as to the issue of what sentence to impose, we \u201cconclude that the district court considered and implicitly rejected it as a sufficient reason to impose a within-Guidelines sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Bowens, </em>527 Fed.Appx. 256, 258 (4th Cir.2013) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">The sentencing transcript makes plain the court\u2019s view that any efforts at cooperation paled in comparison to McNeil\u2019s high likelihood of recidivating, as evidenced by his commission of multiple breakings-andenterings in a relatively short period of time, and McNeil\u2019s demonstrable lack of respect for the law, evidenced by McNeil\u2019s persistent refusal to conform his behavior to the law or to abide by the terms of his probation. The court also considered the lenient treatment McNeil received for his past offenses and that McNeil had other dismissed and uncharged conduct. Finally, the court expressly acknowledged \u2014 but rejected \u2014 McNeil\u2019s more robust argument that his youth and immaturity countenanced a shorter term of imprisonment, opining that its duty to protect the public would be discharged only if McNeil were sentenced to a significant term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">\u201cWe will not vacate [a] sentence simply because the court did not spell out what the context of its explanation made patently obvious: namely, that a shorter prison term was inappropriate for a defendant who had repeatedly committed a serious offense and who had already proven immune to other means of deterrence.\u201d <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 381 (4th Cir.2006). We accordingly reject McNeil\u2019s claim of procedural error.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Turning, then, to the substantive reasonableness of the sentence, substantive reasonableness review requires that we evaluate \u201cthe totality of the circumstances to see whether the sentencing court abused its discretion in concluding that the sentence it chose satisfied the standards set forth in [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) [(2012)].\u201d <em>United States v. Hargrove, </em>701 F.3d 156, 160-61 (4th Cir. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 2403, 185 L.Ed.2d 1114 (2013). Of course, \u201cdistrict courts have extremely broad discretion when determining the weight to be given each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Jeffery, </em>631 F.3d 669, 679 (4th Cir.2011). The Supreme Court mandates that this court \u201cgive due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance. The fact that the appellate court might reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">Though McNeil\u2019s sentence is almost double the high end of his Guidelines range, we discern no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s determination that such a deviation was justified. The district court\u2019s decision was rooted in McNeil\u2019s criminal history and the resistance he had previously demonstrated to conforming his conduct to the mandates of the law. McNeil\u2019s criminal record was all the more concerning considering his relatively young age, and the fact that most of his crimes were committed within a three-year period. Because the district court\u2019s decision to depart fourteen months above the Guidelines range is supported by the record, it does not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>We accordingly hold that McNeil\u2019s departure sentence is reasonable, both procedurally and substantively, and affirm the district court\u2019s criminal judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
