The district court originally sentenced James to life imprisonment. In his first appeal, James challenged the district court\u2019s denial of his suppression motion, the court\u2019s use of a cross-reference for murder as relevant conduct under the Sentencing Guidelines, and the proportionality of the sentence to his offenses. We affirmed the convictions, but vacated the sentence and remanded for resentencing as we concluded that the district court erred in applying the cross-reference for murder under the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Sellers, </em>512 Fed. Appx. 319, 330-32 (4th Cir.) (unpublished), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 2786, 186 L.Ed.2d 231 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-25\">Prior to the resentencing hearing, James filed several objections to the presentence report, including objections to the drug weight; enhancements for his role in the offense and possession of a firearm; and the failure to reduce the applicable offense level for James\u2019 acceptance of responsibility. The district court, however, declined to conduct a de novo sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>hearing and adopted its previous findings on the issues that James had raised at the original sentencing hearing. The court then again sentenced James to a total of life imprisonment and James now appeals. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">James argues on appeal that the district court erred in failing to conduct a de novo resentencing hearing and failing to consider his Guidelines challenges, as this court\u2019s mandate did not indicate a limited remand. \u201cWe review de novo the district court\u2019s interpretation of the mandate.\u201d <em>United States v. Susi, </em>674 F.3d 278, 283 (4th Cir. 2012). \u201cThe mandate rule governs what issues the lower court is permitted to consider on remand-it is bound to carry out the mandate of the higher court, but may not reconsider issues the mandate laid to rest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Where a remand for resentencing fails to impose any further limitations, \u201cresentencing may proceed de novo, constrained only by the constitutional bar against vindictiveness, ... the controlling statutes, and the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Broughton-Jones, </em>71 F.3d 1143, 1149 n. 4 (4th Cir.1995) (citing <em>United States v. Bell, </em>5 F.3d 64, 67 (4th Cir.1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">However, the mandate rule also prohibits \u201clitigation of issues decided by the district court but foregone on appeal or otherwise waived, for example because they were not raised in the district court.\u201d <em>Susi </em>674 F.3d at 283 (citation omitted). Moreover, under the mandate rule, \u201cany issue that could have been but was not raised on appeal is waived and thus not remanded.\u201d <em>Doe v. Chao, </em>511 F.3d 461, 465 (4th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); <em>see also S. Atl. Ltd. P\u2019ship of Tenn. v. Riese, </em>356 F.3d 576, 583 (4th Cir.2004) (mandate rule \u201cforecloses litigation of issues decided by the district court but foregone on appeal or otherwise waived\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Here, the issues James sought to raise on resentencing were all waived. With respect to his challenges to the drug weight and the firearm enhancement, he raised those challenges at the first sentencing hearing, but failed to raise them on appeal. They were thus not remanded to the district court. <em>See Chao, </em>511 F.3d at 465. In addition, James failed to raise the remaining issues at the first sentencing hearing and likewise failed to raise them on appeal. Those arguments were therefore also waived. <em>See Susi, </em>674 F.3d at 283. We thus conclude that the district court did not err in declining to consider those arguments on resentencing following this court\u2019s remand of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
