On appeal, Rosas-Rosas argues that the district court procedurally erred when it enhanced his sentence based on a prior conviction of Maryland second-degree assault, which the district court found to be a crime of violence. We vacate and remand for resentencing in light of our recent decision in <em>United States v. Royal, </em>731 F.3d 333 (4th Cir. Oct. 1, 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-20\">This court reviews a criminal sentence under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We must first ensure that the district court did not commit any \u201csignificant procedural error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cAn error in the calculation of the applicable Guidelines range, whether an error of fact or of law ... makes a sentence procedurally unreasonable even under our deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>United States v. Diaz-Ibarra, </em>522 F.3d 343, 347 (4th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-21\">We review de novo the issue of whether a prior conviction constitutes a crime of violence for purposes of a sentencing enhancement under the Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>Under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7 2L1. 2(b)(l)(A)(ll), the base offense level of a defendant convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) should be increased by sixteen levels if he has a prior conviction \u201cfor a felony that is ... a crime of violence.\u201d A \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d as used here, is defined to include \u201cany ... offense under federal, state, or local law that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. 1 (B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-22\">Rosas-Rosas has a prior conviction for Maryland second-degree assault. The relevant statute provides that \u201c[a] person may not commit an assault.\u201d Md.Code Ann., Crim. Law \u00a7 3-203(a). Following this court\u2019s approach in <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>659 F.3d 339 (4th Cir.2011), the district court applied the modified-categorical approach to find that Rosas-Rosas\u2019s Maryland second-degree assault conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>was for a crime of violence. Accordingly, it applied the sixteen-level enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">After the district court sentenced Rosas-Rosas, the Supreme Court decided <em>Descamps v. United, States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 183 S.Ct. 2276, 2283-86, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013), which reiterated the elements-centric approach for determining whether a prior conviction constitutes a crime of violence for sentencing purposes. More recently, we held in <em>Royal, </em>731 F.3d at 340-42, that Maryland second-degree assault is categorically not a crime of violence for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">We have consistently held that the ACCA and the Guidelines are substantively identical with regard to their definitions of a violent offense. <em>See, e.g., United States v. King, </em>673 F.3d 274, 279 n. 3 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 216, 184 L.Ed.2d 111 (2012). We have also applied the categorical approach developed under the ACCA to the Guidelines. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Cabreror-Umanzor, </em>728 F.3d 347, 353-54 (4th Cir.2013). Thus, we conclude that the district court committed procedural error when it applied the sixteen-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and remand for resentencing. We deny as moot Rosas-Rosas\u2019s motion to accelerate case processing and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">\n<em>VACATED &amp; REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
