Harding, III, appeals the district court\u2019s order dismissing his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2006) action without prejudice <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) (2012) for failure to state a claim, and its order denying his motion for reconsideration and various related post-judgment motions. On appeal, we confine our review to the issues raised in the Appellant\u2019s brief. <em>See </em>4th Cir. R. 34(b). Because Harding\u2019s informal brief does not challenge the bases for the district court\u2019s dispositions, Harding has forfeited appellate review of the court\u2019s orders. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment and post-judgment order. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b253-16\"> Based on the district judge\u2019s opinion, we conclude that the dismissal was without prejudice, despite a statement to the contrary in the court\u2019s text order denying reconsideration. Although dismissals without prejudice generally are interlocutory and not appeal-able, here the court's order of dismissal is a final one, as the grounds for dismissal indicate that Harding could not \"save his action by merely amending his complaint.\u201d <em>Domino Sugar Corp. v.
