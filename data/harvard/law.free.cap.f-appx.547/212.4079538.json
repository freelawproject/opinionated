Pless, Sr., appeals the district court\u2019s judgment in favor of Defendants in Pless\u2019 civil action and the court\u2019s order denying his motion to reconsider that judgment. For the reasons that follow, we dismiss in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-20\">While Pless\u2019 notice of appeal designated only the court\u2019s August 22, 2013 order denying reconsideration, his informal brief appears primarily to challenge the district court\u2019s order requiring Defendants to explain their untimely summary judgment motion and its order granting summary judgment in favor of Defendants. However, we lack jurisdiction to review these orders.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because Pless\u2019 post-judgment motion was not filed within twenty-eight days of the judgment, it did not toll the appeal period. Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(A) (addressing tolling of appeal period pending disposition of certain post-judgment motions); Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) (stating time to file motion to alter or amend judgment). Pless\u2019 notice of appeal therefore was untimely as to the court\u2019s underlying judgment and all other orders, except the post-judgment order denying reconsideration. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A) (providing thirty-day appeal period). Accordingly, we dismiss Pless\u2019 appeal in part, insofar as it challenges the court\u2019s underlying judgment in favor of Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-21\">Turning to the order denying reconsideration, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying this motion, as Pless did not meet the requisite showing for Rule 60(b) relief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b) (enumerating grounds for relief); <em>Aikens v. Ingram, </em>652 F.3d 496, 500-01 (4th Cir.2011) (en banc) (addressing requirements for Rule 60(b) relief, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>recognizing that Rule 60(b) motion is not substitute for appeal); <em>Dowell v. State Farm, Fire &amp; Cas. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>993 F.2d 46, 48 (4th Cir.1993) (describing required threshold showing). Thus, finding no reversible error, we affirm in part, insofar as the appeal challenges the district court\u2019s order denying reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">We grant Pless leave to proceed in for-ma pauperis. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b238-17\">.
