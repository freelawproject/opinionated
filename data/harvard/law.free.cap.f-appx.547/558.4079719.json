His brief contains no citations to the record in support of either his statement of the facts or his legal argument. Under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(a)(7) and (9), the appellant\u2019s brief must include \u201ca statement of facts relevant to the issues submitted for review with appropriate references to the record\u201d and an argument section that contains the \u201cappellant\u2019s contentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies.\u201d Because Cooper has not provided any record support for his appellate arguments, he has abandoned them by failing to adequately brief them. <em>See United States v. Cothran, </em>302 F.3d 279, 286 n. 7 (5th Cir.2002); <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir. 1993); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">Accordingly, Cooper\u2019s motion to file a supplemental brief is GRANTED, the motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b585-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
