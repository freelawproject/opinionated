We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">Bajraktari challenges the finding below that no exception applied to excuse the untimely filing of his asylum application. Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (2012), the Attorney General\u2019s decision regarding whether an alien has complied with the one-year time limit for filing an application for asylum or established changed or extraordinary circumstances justifying waiver of that time limit is not reviewable by any court. <em>Gomis v. Holder, </em>571 F.3d 353, 358-59 (4th Cir.2009). Although 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) (2012) provides that nothing in \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B), (C), \u201cor in any other provision of this chapter ... which limits or eliminates judicial review, shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law,\u201d this court has held that the question of whether an asylum application is untimely or whether the changed or extraordinary circumstances exception applies \u201cis a discretionary determination based on factual circumstances.\u201d <em>Gomis, </em>571 F.3d at 358 (emphasis omitted). Accordingly, \u201cabsent a colorable constitutional claim or question of law, [the court\u2019s] review of the issue is not authorized by \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because Bajraktari fails to raise any such issues, we lack jurisdiction to review this finding. We therefore dismiss the petition for review of Bajraktari\u2019s asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">Next, Bajraktari disputes the conclusion that he failed to qualify for the relief of withholding of removal. \u2018Withholding of removal is available under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3) [ (2012) ] if the alien shows that it is more likely than not that [his] life or freedom would be threatened in the country of removal because of [his] race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Gomis, </em>571 F.3d at 359 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). We have reviewed the record and conclude that substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that Bajraktari failed to demonstrate a clear probability of future persecution on account of a protected ground. Because the evidence does not compel us to conclude to the contrary, we uphold the denial of relief. <em>See Djadjou v. Holder, </em>662 F.3d 265, 273 (4th Cir.2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 788, 184 L.Ed.2d 581 (2012). Finally, we uphold the finding below that Bajraktari did not demonstrate that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if removed to Albania so as to qualify for protection under the Convention Against Torture. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-12\">We accordingly dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-13\">\n<em>PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
