His arguments are foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>Gallegos-Hernandez v. United States, </em>688 F.3d 190, 192-93 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 561, 184 L.Ed.2d 365 (2012). We are barred from considering his argument that <em>Gallegos-Hemandez </em>was wrongly decided by our rule of orderliness. <em>Jacobs v. Nat\u2019l Drug Intelligence Ctr., </em>548 F.3d 375, 378 (5th Cir.2008) (\u201cIt is a well-settled Fifth Circuit rule of orderliness that one panel of our court may not overturn another panel\u2019s decision, absent an intervening change in the law, such as by a statutory amendment, or the- Supreme Court, or our en banc court.\u201d). His argument that his status is materially different from that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>of the defendant in <em>Gallegos-Hemandez </em>is incorrect. Like Barajas, <em>Gallegos-Hernandez </em>was a federal prisoner against whom an ICE detainer had been lodged.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">Accordingly, Torres Barajas\u2019s motion to proceed IFP is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b437-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
