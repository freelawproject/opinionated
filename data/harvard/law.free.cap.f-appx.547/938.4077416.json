Kalejaiye argues that the BIA failed to examine all of the reasonableness factors as required by 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(3), which demonstrate that it would be unreasonable to expect him to internally relocate. He explains that, in addition to prevalent persecution against Christians by Muslims, Nigeria has ongoing civil strife, problems with the administrative and judicial infrastructure, displacement of over one million people, and widespread gender discrimination that would negatively impact his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-9\">Kalejaiye is a citizen of Nigeria who entered the United States on or around December 20, 2001 on a temporary visa permitting him to stay through December 19, 2002. In September 2002, Kalejaiye filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under CAT. Kalejaiye and his family are Christians, and he served as a Vicar Warden in his church. Following several delays and a hearing, the IJ denied all requested relief but granted voluntary departure. On April 10, 2006, Kalejaiye appealed the IJ\u2019s decision to the BIA, which \u201cadopt[ed] and affirm[ed] the decision of the [IJ] in whole, including his determination that the respondents failed to carry their burden of proof that they had suffered past persecution or have a well-founded fear of future persecution in Nigeria.\u201d Subsequently, Kalejaiye filed a motion with the BIA to reopen the case, arguing that his counsel at initial proceedings was deficient. The BIA granted his motion, remanding the case for further proceedings. On remand, after reviewing significant evidence submitted from each side, the IJ denied Kalejaiye\u2019s application, concluding that although he suffered past persecution due to his religion, the DHS rebutted the presumption of a well-founded fear of persecution by a preponderance of the evidence because Kalejaiye could avoid persecution by relocating to a different area of southern Nigeria. On appeal, the BIA affirmed, concluding that the IJ\u2019s determination that DHS rebutted the presumption of a well-founded fear was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-13\">\u201cWe review only the [BIA\u2019s] decision, except to the extent that it expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion. Insofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted). We review legal and constitutional questions de novo, and we \u201creview[ ] factual determinations under the substantial evidence test.\u201d <em>Zhou Hua Zhu v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>703 F.3d 1303, 1307 (11th Cir.2013). This factual review is highly deferential, and we review the record in the light most favorable to the agency decision. <em>Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1351 (11th Cir.2009). \u201c[T]his Court must affirm if the BIA\u2019s decision is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Zhou, </em>703 F.3d at 1307 (internal quotation marks omitted). Reversal based on factual findings is only appropriate if \u201cthe record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). DHS has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of \u201crefugee.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). \u201cRefugee\u201d is defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b966-5\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. To establish eligibility, the alien must, with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of a factor listed in the statute, or (2) a well-founded fear that the factor will cause future persecution. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-8\">A showing of past persecution creates a presumption of a well-founded fear of persecution, which is subject to rebuttal. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). To overcome the presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution, the government must provide evidence for the IJ to find either: \u201c(1) that there has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution,\u201d or \u201c(2) the applicant could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of the applicant\u2019s country of nationality and under all the circumstances, it would be reasonable to expect the applicant to do so.\u201d <em>Kazemzadeh, </em>577 F.3d at 1351-52 (internal alterations omitted). In considering the reasonableness of relocation, the Code of Federal Regulations provides the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b966-9\">[Adjudicators should consider, but are not limited to considering, whether the applicant would face other serious harm in the place of suggested relocation; any ongoing civil strife within the country; administrative, economic, or judicial infrastructure; geographical limitations; and social and cultural constraints, such as age, gender, health, and social and familial ties. Those factors may, or may not, be relevant, depending on all the circumstances of the case, and are not necessarily determinative of whether it would be reasonable for the applicant to relocate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b966-10\">8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(3). To rebut the presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution, the government must establish \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence that, under all the circumstances, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>would be reasonable for the applicant to relocate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1208.13(b)(3)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">We have held that, where persecution could be expected throughout a country, relocation would not be reasonable. <em>Arboleda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>434 F.3d 1220, 1226-27 (11th Cir.2006). In <em>Arboleda, </em>DHS did not meet its burden to establish that petitioners could reasonably relocate because \u201cevidence in the record compelled] a finding that the [militant group FARC] operate[d] country-wide in Colombia,\u201d and petitioner\u2019s evidence \u201cattested] to the widespread nature of [the militant group\u2019s] atrocities committed throughout the entire country.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, the BIA\u2019s failure to mention any of the reasonableness factors in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(3) was reversible error. <em>Id. </em>at 1225, 1227.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we deny Kalejaiye\u2019s petition. We review only the BIA\u2019s decision, because it did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s opinion. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284; <em>see also Arboleda, </em>434 F.3d at 1222.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-8\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that DHS rebutted Kalejaiye\u2019s well-founded fear of persecution because he could reasonably relocate within southern Nigeria to avoid persecution. The 2010 International Religious Freedom Report for Nigeria, submitted by DHS, indicated that religious conflicts between Muslims and Christians occurred largely in the northern and central regions of the country, while southern Nigeria was predominantly Christian. Kalejaiye\u2019s evidence of religious violence supported this finding, as the articles primarily describe events of violence in the northern and central regions. Further, although the Muslim extremist organization Boko Haram asserts that its goal is to replace the Nigerian government with an Islamic regime, there was no evidence this goal would be achieved. Further, although Kalejaiye maintains that the BIA relied entirely on two U.S. State Department reports to rebut the presumption of persecution, this court has noted that \u201cnothing in our precedent suggests that two country reports issued by the State Department are <em>pre se </em>insufficient to ... rebut a presumption of future persecution.\u201d <em>Mehmeti v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>572 F.3d 1196, 1198-1200 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-11\">Unlike in <em>Arboleda, </em>where there was danger of persecution throughout the country, 434 F.3d at 1225-27, here the threat of persecution against Christians is much less significant in the southern region. In <em>Arboleda, </em>this court considered that after the petitioner relocated to avoid persecution by the radical group FARC, he and his family continued to be threatened. <em>Id. </em>at 1226. In contrast, here, the evidence indicates that when Kalejaiye left Lagos and lived elsewhere in southern Nigeria, he did not suffer persecution. In fact, here the BIA specifically noted that Kalejaiye had traveled freely throughout the country and had fled Lagos, living elsewhere in southern Nigeria, without harm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b967-12\">In addition, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that it would be reasonable to expect Kalejaiye to relocate within Nigeria. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(i)(B). The BIA cited \u00a7 1208.13(b)(3) and acknowledged the reasonableness factors that it considered. The regulation does not require the IJ or BIA to consider every factor because not all factors will be relevant in every case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number><em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1208.13(b)(3); <em>see Ayala v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>605 F.3d 941, 948 (11th Cir. 2010). Here, the BIA considered that Kalejaiye was able to travel through central and northern Nigeria in his official capacity as Vicar\u2019s Warden, and he traveled and resided in cities in southern Nigeria outside of Lagos. We do not re-weigh evidence, and there is no evidence in the record which would compel us to reverse the BIA\u2019s determination that Kalejaiye could relocate to somewhere within southern Nigeria outside of Lagos. <em>See Zhou, </em>703 F.3d at 1307. Construing the evidence in light most favorable to the BIA\u2019s determination, the record did not support the notion that violence against Christians would likely spread to southern Nigeria.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b965-10\">. The district court also denied Kalejaiye's request for withholding of removal pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3), and relief under the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c). On appeal, the BIA concluded that because Kalejaiye did not meet the lesser burden of proof to qualify for asylum, he did not carry the higher burden for withholding of removal. Also, he was ineligible for CAT relief because he did not show that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured upon his return to Nigeria. As Kalejaiye does not appeal these claims, they are deemed abandoned. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. </em>SW <em>Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b967-9\">.

Although Kalejaiye points to civil strife, political problems, and gender discrimination that was described in the DHS country reports, that evidence does not compel reversal on the basis that it would be unreasonable to expect him to relocate to elsewhere in southern Nigeria.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
