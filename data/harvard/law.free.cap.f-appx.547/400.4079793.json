The IJ found that Amador was removable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(6)(A)(i) as an alien who was present in the United States without being admitted or paroled, a finding that Amador has waived by failing to challenge it in his petition for review. <em>See Thuri v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 788, 793 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-20\">Upon being found removable, Amador announced his intention to seek relief in the form of cancellation of removal for certain non-permanent residents under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b). Certain of Amador\u2019s prior criminal convictions precluded him from seeking such relief; however, Amador filed state habeas corpus applications in an attempt to invalidate those convictions. Amador\u2019s state habeas applications were based on <em>Padilla v. Kentucky, </em>559 U.S. 356, 130 S.Ct. 1473, 176 L.Ed.2d 284 (2010), and sought relief on the ground that counsel in his criminal proceedings rendered ineffective assistance by failing to inform Amador about the harsh immigration consequences he faced by pleading guilty. The IJ twice continued the immigration proceedings based on Amador\u2019s contention that he was seeking to invalidate his prior convictions under <em>Padilla. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>The IJ denied Amador\u2019s third such motion, however. No \u00a7 1229b(b) application for cancellation of removal was never filed, and Amador has been removed to Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Amador argues that the denial of his request for a continuance for the purpose of pursuing his collateral attack on his aggravated-assault-with-a-deadly-weapon convictions pursuant to <em>Padilla </em>violated his due process rights. He maintains that the failure to grant continuances to aliens seeking to raise such collateral attacks on their convictions renders the ruling in <em>Padilla </em>meaningless because, in the absence of continuances, no aliens would have time to raise and litigate <em>Padilla-based </em>challenges to their convictions before they are removed from the United States. Thus, he contends, he was unlawfully deprived of all avenues of relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">We have jurisdiction to review constitutional claims like that presented here by Amador. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>Alvarado de Rodriguez v. Holder, </em>585 F.3d 227, 233-34 (5th Cir.2009). Amador\u2019s reliance on <em>Padilla, </em>however, is unavailing. A pending collateral attack on a conviction does not disturb the finality of the conviction for immigration purposes. <em>See Cabral v. Holder, </em>632 F.3d 886, 890 (5th Cir.2011). Further, nothing in <em>Padilla </em>suggests that immigration proceedings must be stayed while a Padilla-type claim is being pursued in postconviction proceedings. <em>See Padilla, </em>130 S.Ct. at 1475-87. Moreover, failing to grant a continuance in these circumstances does not cut off all avenues of relief as Amador could seek to have the BIA reopen his proceedings or reconsider the removal order in the event that he has his prior criminal convictions invalidated. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a). Accordingly, Amador\u2019s PETITION FOR REVIEW is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b426-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
