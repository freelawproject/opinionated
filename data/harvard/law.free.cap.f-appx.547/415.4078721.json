The district court also revoked Frias\u2019s term of supervised release on a prior conviction and imposed a sentence at the top of the advisory range of 18 months, to run consecutively to the illegal reentry sentence. Fri-as is appealing from the imposition of the consecutive revocation sentence, arguing that it was not reasonable because the stacked sentence was greater than necessary to meet the objectives of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">Frias contends that review of his revocation sentence should be for reasonableness. Because Frias failed to object to the reasonableness of his revocation sentence, we need not reach any dispute over standards of review because this court\u2019s review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259-60 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). Frias argues that the imposition of the consecutive sentence was plainly unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to achieve the goals of the sentencing factors in \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-13\">The imposition of the consecutive revocation sentence is authorized by statute and preferred under the Guidelines. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(f), p.s., &amp; comment, (n. 4). The district court\u2019s comments at sentencing reflect that it had considered the permissible \u00a7 3553(a) factors in determining that the consecutive 18-month revocation sentence, which was within the advisory range, was an appropriate and reasonable sentence. Frias has failed to show that the district court, in determining that the revocation sentence should run consecutively to the sentence for the new offense, committed any error, plain or otherwise. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-14\">Frias has not challenged his illegal reentry conviction or the sentence imposed for that offense. Thus, he has abandoned any claims arising out of that conviction or sentence. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993)</p>\n<p id=\"b442-15\">The convictions and sentences in both of the appeals are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b442-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
