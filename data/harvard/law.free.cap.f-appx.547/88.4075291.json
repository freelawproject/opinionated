Faison, Sr. (\u201cFaison, Sr.\u201d), appeals pro se from the District Court\u2019s order granting the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss a Pennsylvania wrongful death action brought under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d). Because the District Court properly determined that Faison, Sr., lacked standing to pursue his claim, we will summarily affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-16\">In April 2008, Faison, Sr.\u2019s son, Louis T. Faison, Jr. (\u201cFaison, Jr.\u201d), died while incarcerated at USP-Lewisburg. He was survived by his wife and three adult children. His widow, and the executrix of his estate, Veta B. Faison (\u201cVeta\u201d), brought a wrongful death action in December 2010. <em>See Faison v. United States, </em>M.D. Pa. Civ. No. 10-cv02603. A mediated settlement was reached in September 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-17\">Separately, in February 2011, Faison, Sr., filed the present action, alleging that Faison Jr., was \u201csubjected to damage, injury and death as a result of careless and negligent acts of the defendant ... in providing inadequate medical care and treatment to the ... decedent.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Government filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that Faison, Sr., lacked standing and was not entitled to recover damages under the Pennsylvania Wrongful Death Act. The District Court agreed, and granted the motion to dismiss. Faison, Sr., appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"A4Y\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review of a dismissal for a lack of standing is plenary. <em>Goode v. City of Philadelphia, </em>539 F.3d 311, 316 (3d Cir.2008). We may summarily affirm if the appeal presents no substantial question. <em>See </em>3d Cir. LAR 27.4; 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">The FTCA provides that \u201cthe United States is liable for injury caused by the negligent act of a government employee to the same extent a private employer would be liable.\u201d <em>McSwain v. United States, </em>422 F.2d 1086, 1087-88 (3d Cir.1970). Liability under the FTCA is determined by applying the substantive law of the state in which the injury occurred. <em>See Gould Elecs. Inc. v. United States, </em>220 F.3d 169, 179 (3d Cir.2000). Because the alleged negligent acts in this case occurred at USP-Lewisburg, Faison, Sr.\u2019s claims are governed by Pennsylvania law. <em>DeJesus v. United States Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>479 F.3d 271, 279 (3d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">The Pennsylvania Wrongful Death Act provides that an action may be brought for the death of an individual caused by negligence if no action for damages was brought by the injured person during his lifetime. 42 Pa. Con. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 8301(a). This right of action exists for the benefit of the spouse, children, or parents of the deceased. 42 Pa. Con. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 8301(b). Under the Act, \u201cbeneficiaries of a death action award share according to the law of intestate distribution.\u201d <em>Olden v. Hagerstown Cash Register, Inc., </em>619 F.2d 271, 275 (3d Cir. 1980) (citing 42 Pa. Con. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 8301(b)). Where, as here, no action is brought within six months following the decedent\u2019s death, an action may be brought only by the \u201cpersonal representative or by any person entitled by law to recover damages in such action as trustee ad litem on behalf of all persons entitled to share in the damages.\u201d Pa. R. Civ. P. 2202(b). The term \u201cpersonal representative\u201d is defined as \u201cthe executor or administrator of the estate of a decedent duly qualified by law to bring actions within this Commonwealth.\u201d Pa. R. Civ. P. 2201.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-11\">Here, Faison, Jr.\u2019s widow and the executrix of his estate, Veta, brought a wrongful death action in the District Court in 2010, and a mediated settlement was reached in September 2011. <em>See Faison v. United States, </em>M.D. Pa. Civ. No. 10-cv-02603 (order entered Sept. 13, 2011). Because Veta \u201cbrought the wrongful death action as the executrix of the decedent\u2019s estate ... [i]t was ... impermissible for the other [potential] beneficiaries to maintain separate actions ... or formally join in the action.\u201d <em>Machado v. Kunkel, </em>804 A.2d 1238, 1247 (Pa.Super.Ct.2002). Therefore, the District Court properly concluded that Faison, Sr., lacked standing to bring a separate wrongful death suit. <em>See Ferencz v. Medlock, </em>905 F.Supp.2d 656, 671-72 (W.D.Pa. 2012) (concluding that, under Pennsylvania law, mother lacked standing to bring wrongful death action in her individual capacity (as opposed to in her capacity as administratrix) against prison employees for her son\u2019s death while he was incarcerated); <em>cf. </em>Pa. R. Civ. P. 2202(c) (providing that \u201c[w]hile an action is pending it shall operate as a bar against the bringing of any other action for such wrongful death.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-12\">Faison, Sr., suggests that the District Court should have permitted him to petition as an interested party in the settlement award received by Veta. <em>See </em>Pa. R. Civ. P. 2206(b) (requiring court to apportion damages from wrongful death verdict or settlement \u201cupon petition of any party in interest\u201d). As noted above, wrongful death action beneficiaries share the award according to the law of intestate distribution. 42 Pa. Con. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 8301(b). Under Pennsylvania\u2019s intesta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>cy laws, parents of the decedent are not entitled to a share of the estate when there is a surviving spouse and children. 20 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2102 (describing surviving spouse\u2019s intestate share when there are surviving issue); \u00a7 2103(1) (providing that the share of the estate to which the surviving spouse is not entitled shall pass first to the issue of the decedent). Here, Faison, Jr., was survived by his wife and children. Therefore, even if allowed to proceed as an interested party under Rule 2206(b), Faison, Sr., would not have been entitled to any recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment. <em>See </em>3d Cir. LAR 27.4; 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b115-13\">. The case was initially filed, through counsel, by Terry Faison Williams (Faison, Sr.\u2019s daughter and Faison, Jr.\u2019s brother) on behalf of Faison Sr., pursuant to a power of attorney. Williams\u2019 counsel later sought leave to withdraw, which the District Court granted. Thereafter, the District Court permitted Williams to litigate pro se on behalf of Faison, Sr. The District Court entered summary judgment in the Government\u2019s favor on the ground that both Williams and Faison, Sr., lacked standing under Pennsylvania law to pursue a wrongful death action. On appeal, we remanded, holding that the \"District Court should not have allowed ... Williams to represent her father pro se after permitting her counsel to withdraw.\u201d <em>Williams v. United States, </em>477 Fed.Appx. 9, 11 (3d Cir.2012) (not precedential). On remand, the District Court terminated Williams as a plaintiff and permitted Faison, Sr., to proceed pro se.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
