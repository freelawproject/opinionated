The district court sentenced her to 32 months\u2019 imprisonment. Jones\u2019s counsel filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that, in counsel\u2019s view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but questioning the propriety of the guilty plea and the reasonableness of the sentence. Although advised of her right to file a pro se supplemental brief, Jones has not done so. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-22\">In the absence of a motion in the district court to withdraw a guilty plea, this court\u2019s review of the plea colloquy is for plain error. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.2002). After reviewing the plea agreement and the transcript of the plea hearing, we conclude that the district court fully complied with the requirements of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11, and that Jones\u2019s guilty plea was knowing and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-23\">We have reviewed Jones\u2019s sentence and conclude that the sentence imposed was reasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Llamas, </em>599 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>381, 387 (4th Cir.2010). The district court followed the necessary procedural steps in sentencing Jones, appropriately treated the Sentencing Guidelines as advisory, properly calculated and considered the applicable Guidelines range, and weighed the relevant 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2012) factors in light of Jones\u2019s individual characteristics and history. We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the chosen sentence. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 41, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>United States v. Allen, </em>491 F.3d 178, 193 (4th Cir.2007) (applying appellate presumption of reasonableness to within-Guidelines sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. This court requires that counsel inform Jones, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Jones requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Jones. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
