He contends that the sentence is unreasonable because the district court denied his request for a variance based on his post-sentencing rehabilitation without addressing how Lewis\u2019s rehabilitation efforts impacted the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2012). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-23\">We have reviewed Lewis\u2019s sentence and conclude that the sentence imposed was reasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Llamas, </em>599 F.3d 381, 387 (4th Cir.2010). The district court followed the necessary procedural steps in sentencing Lewis. The court properly calculated and considered the applicable Guidelines range, and appropriately treated the Sentencing Guidelines as advisory. We conclude that the district court appropriately considered and rejected Lewis\u2019s request for a variant sentence in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and Lewis\u2019s individual characteristics and history, sufficiently explained the reasons for the sentence, and did not abuse its discretion in imposing the chosen sentence. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 41, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>United States v. Allen, </em>491 F.3d 178, 193 (4th Cir.2007) (applying appellate presumption of reasonableness to within-Guidelines sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-24\">Accordingly, we affirm Lewis\u2019s 74-month sentence. We deny Lewis\u2019s motion for a transcript at government expense and his motion for leave to file a supple<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>mental brief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
