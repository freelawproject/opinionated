(\u201cCBN\u201d), and two officers on its police force, Chief Christopher Mitchell and Officer Yahzin Moreno (collectively, \u201cDefendants\u201d). The district court denied relief on these claims against all Defendants, and Bailey appealed. In a prior appeal, we affirmed the court\u2019s judgment in favor of Defendants CBN and Mitchell, as well as certain discovery orders. We vacated the judgment in favor of Defendant Moreno and portions of the court\u2019s pretrial discovery order, and we remanded to the district court for further consideration of those discovery issues. <em>Bailey v. Christian Broad. Network, </em>483 Fed.Appx. 808 (4th Cir.2012) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">On remand, the magistrate judge issued a clarification order, explaining the basis for his prior discovery rulings and reissuing those rulings. Over Bailey\u2019s objections, the district court adopted those rulings and reissued judgment in favor of Moreno. Bailey now appeals the court\u2019s remand orders and judgment in favor of Moreno. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">As an initial matter, we address the scope of our review in this appeal. \u201cThe mandate rule is a specific application of the law of the case doctrine\u201d to cases that have been remanded on appeal. <em>Volvo Trademark Holding Aktiebolaget v. Clark Mach. Co. (\u201cVolvo </em>\u201d),510 F.3d 474, 481 (4th Cir. 2007). The rule generally binds a lower court to carry out a higher court\u2019s mandate, prohibiting the lower court from considering on remand matters decided or laid to rest by the higher court. <em>United States v. Susi, </em>674 F.3d 278, 283 (4th Cir.2012) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>Doe v. Chao, </em>511 F.3d 461, 465 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-13\">Generally, where an issue could have been \u2014 but was not \u2014 raised in an initial appeal, that issue is waived in the initial appeal and is \u201cnot remanded\u201d to the district court. <em>Chao, </em>511 F.3d at 465. Because a waived issue does not fall within the scope of the appellate court\u2019s mandate, the mandate rule generally provides that \u201cit is inappropriate to consider [such an issue] on a second appeal following remand.\u201d <em>Omni Outdoor Adver., Inc. v. Columbia Outdoor Adver., Inc., </em>974 F.2d 502, 505 (4th Cir.1992); <em>see also Volvo, </em>510 F.3d at 481 (\u201c[U]nder the mandate rule[,] a remand proceeding is not the occasion for raising new arguments or legal theories.\u201d). We may deviate from the mandate rule in limited, exceptional circumstances. <em>See United States v. Pileggi, </em>703 F.3d 675, 681-82 (4th Cir.2013) (describing exceptions to mandate rule).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-14\">On appeal, Bailey challenges the magistrate judge\u2019s order requiring a protective order as a condition for compelling Defendants to provide Bailey with the address of a witness. Because Bailey did not raise this specific challenge in his original appeal, it falls outside the scope of the appellate mandate. Bailey does not identify any circumstance warranting deviation from the mandate rule, and we have identified none. Accordingly, this issue is barred by the operation of the mandate rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-15\">Bailey next challenges the district court\u2019s judgment in favor of Moreno.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>also challenges the district court\u2019s order on remand clarifying and reissuing the portions of the discovery order (1) denying Bailey\u2019s motion for an extension of time to file requests for admission (\u201cRFAs\u201d) and deeming those RFAs admitted, and (2) denying his request for specific sanctions against Defendants Mitchell and Moreno for failure to timely disclose a witness. Contrary to Bailey\u2019s assertion, on remand, the magistrate judge and the district court fully complied with our mandate requiring further consideration of these discovery rulings. We have reviewed the record with regard to these rulings and the court\u2019s judgment in favor of Moreno and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm these rulings substantially for the reasons stated by the district court and the magistrate judge. (E.D. Va. filed Nov. 3, 2011 &amp; entered Nov. 4, 2011; Oct. 31, 2012; filed June 4, 2013 &amp; entered June 5, 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Finally, Bailey challenges the district court\u2019s order on remand clarifying and reissuing the portions of the discovery order limiting the scope of Dr. Reid\u2019s testimony and striking Bailey\u2019s claims for financial damages. Because these issues relate only to Bailey\u2019s claims for damages, but the district court properly concluded that none of the Defendants were liable to Bailey, these remaining challenges are moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We deny Bailey\u2019s motion for a deposition transcript at government expense. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b223-11\"> Because we vacated the district court\u2019s judgment in favor of Moreno pending the resolu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>tion of the discovery disputes on remand, the judgment was reissued by the district court on remand, and Bailey challenged this judgment both in his initial appeal and the instant appeal, the judgment in favor of Moreno is properly before us at this juncture.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
