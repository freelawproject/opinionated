We lack jurisdiction to review this determination pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (2012), and find that the Petitioners have failed to raise a constitutional claim or question of law that would fall under the exception set forth in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) (2012). <em>See Gomis v. </em>Holder, 571 F.3d 353, 358-59 (4th Cir.2009). Given this jurisdictional bar, we cannot review the underlying merits of their asylum claims. Accordingly, we dismiss this portion of the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-20\">The Petitioners also contend that the agency erred in denying Murani\u2019s request for withholding of removal. \u201cWithholding of removal is available under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3) if the alien shows that it is more likely than not that [his] life or freedom would be threatened in the country of removal because of [his] race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Gomis, </em>571 F.3d at 359 (citations omitted); <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3) (2012). An alien \u201cmust show a \u2018clear probability of persecution\u2019 on account of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Djadjou v. Holder, </em>662 F.3d 265, 272 (4th Cir.2011) (quoting <em>INS v. Stevie, </em>467 U.S. 407, 430, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984)), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 788, 184 L.Ed.2d 581 (2012). Based on our review of the record, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the finding that Murani failed to establish either past persecution or a clear probability of future persecution in India at the hands of his in-laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>Accordingly, we dismiss the petition for review in part and deny the petition for review in part. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">\n<em>PETITION DISMISSED IN PART; DENIED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
