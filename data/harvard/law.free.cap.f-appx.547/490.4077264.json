Holder, </em>569 F.3d 531, 536 (5th Cir.2009). Thus, the court\u2019s review herein is limited to the BIA\u2019s adoption of the IJ\u2019s determination that Salazar was not entitled to relief in the exercise of discretion. Therefore, the court lacks jurisdiction to address Salazar\u2019s argument that the IJ erred in determining that Salazar had not established by clear and convincing evidence that his marriage was bona fide or his argument that the IJ found him inadmissible for adjustment of status because he was an alien who is likely at any time to become a public charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">Salazar argues that the IJ applied the incorrect standard of law in exercising his discretion. He contends that the adverse factors relied on by the IJ have not been treated as adverse in immigration proceedings and, thus, the IJ applied the incorrect standard in requesting that he provide unusual or outstanding equities to rebut those factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-15\">This court is statutorily barred from reviewing the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s purely discretionary denial of Salazar\u2019s application for adjustment of status to permanent resident filed pursuant to \u00a7 1255. <em>See Ayanbadejo v. Chertoff, </em>517 F.3d 273, 275, 276-78 &amp; 277 n. 11 (5th Cir.2008); <em>Hadwani v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 798, 800 (5th Cir.2006). This court is not precluded from reviewing claims raising constitutional or purely legal questions. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). Despite the fact that a petitioner\u2019s purported challenge to the BIA\u2019s standard of review is phrased as a question of law, the court lacks jurisdiction to consider that challenge if it was actually a request to review the denial of discretionary relief. <em>Delgado-Reynua v. Gonzales, </em>450 F.3d 596, 599-600 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-16\">Relying on the standard announced in <em>Matter of Arai, </em>13 I. &amp; N. Dec. 494 (BIA 1970), the IJ considered all the positive and adverse factors in Salazar\u2019s case in determining that relief was not warranted as a matter of discretion. Salazar has not provided evidence to support his conclusional assertion that the multiple adverse factors cited affect the majority of young couples. Salazar has not raised a substantial legal or constitutional question in that he is merely challenging the IJ\u2019s balancing of the factors that were present in his case. This determination was a discretionary decision, which the court lacks jurisdiction to review. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B),(D); <em>Delgado-Reynua, </em>450 F.3d at 599-600; <em>Hadwani, </em>445 F.3d at 800. Therefore, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>petition for review is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b517-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
