We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">Robert J. Ray, Sr., (\u201cRay\u201d) is a former correctional counselor<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> who threatened a co-worker after the co-worker reported that Ray had violated workplace computer-use policy. Ray, in fact, concedes that he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you and I know how to do it.\u201d Shortly after this incident, his employer held a hearing and dismissed Ray because the threats violated corporate policy. Ray then filed suit against his former employer and several former coworkers, alleging that the employer\u2019s explanation for the termination was mere pretext for a termination prohibited by law. Ray argues that the true motivation is either his race, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2; or his history of activity protected by the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 215(a)(3). Ray also alleges that certain former co-workers violated 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985 when they initiated the termination proceedings and/or facilitated a criminal prosecution arising out of the incident.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b471-15\">The district court granted summary judgment with respect to all of Ray\u2019s claims. We review summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standard as the district court, and considering all facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Haverda v. Hays Cnty., </em>723 F.3d 586, 591 (5th Cir.2013). Summary judgment is appropriate only if there is \u201cno genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-16\">We first turn to Ray\u2019s claims that his employer impermissibly dismissed him from his position in violation of either Title VII or the FLSA. It is undisputed that the employer has offered an ostensibly legitimate reason for termination. Ray thus bears the burden of producing evidence of pretext. <em>Samford v. Stolle Corp., </em>181 F.3d 96 n. 2 (5th Cir.1999) (an FLSA case, applying the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework as explained in <em>Long v. Eastfield Coll., </em>88 F.3d 300, 304-05 (5th Cir.1996), a Title VII case).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-17\">Ray\u2019s primary argument on appeal revolves around a silent surveillance video of the incident. Ray claims that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>blurry, wordless video somehow shows that his threat was not serious, and that he never intended any physical harm to his co-worker.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He proposes, therefore, that because the threat was not serious, there must have been some ulterior motive behind his firing. This argument is not persuasive. Even if we were inclined to determine when workplace death threats become sufficiently serious to justify termination \u2014 which we are not \u2014 the only suggestion that Ray\u2019s language should not be construed as such a threat is Ray\u2019s own affidavit. Indeed, multiple witnesses have described the incident, but no one corroborates Ray\u2019s version of the facts. Yet it is well settled that \u201ca self-serving affidavit, without more evidence, will not defeat summary judgment.\u201d <em>Sanchez v. Dall./Fort Worth Int\u2019l Airport Bd., </em>438 Fed.Appx. 343, 346-7 (5th Cir.2011) (citing <em>DIRECTV, Inc. v. Budden, </em>420 F.3d 521, 531 (5th Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">Moreover, we have emphasized that a plaintiff alleging pretext cannot survive summary judgment merely by \u201cdisputing the truth of the underlying facts\u201d that led to an employment decision. <em>Haverda, </em>723 F.3d at 596 n. 1. Instead, he must submit sufficient evidence to \u201csupport an inference\u201d that the employer had an impermissible motive. <em>Id. </em>Here, even taking Ray\u2019s affidavit as true, he has provided no evidence of such a motive. There is nothing in the record to link his two-year-old FLSA claim to the termination, such that there might be a violation of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 215. <em>See Clark Cnty. Sch. Disk v. Breeden, </em>532 U.S. 268, 273-274, 121 S.Ct. 1508, 149 L.Ed.2d 509 (2001) (finding a lapse of twenty months inadequate to allow such an inference). Nor is there any indication that his termination was motivated by race in violation of Title VII. And the fact that he was replaced by a man of the same race only further undermines this claim. <em>Goree v. Comm\u2019n Lincoln Parish Detention Ctr., </em>437 Fed.Appx. 329, 331 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Newman v. First Baptist Church of W. Monroe, </em>983 F.2d 232 (5th Cir.1993) (unpublished). Consequently, Ray has provided no evidence of pretext, and we affirm summary judgment with respect to these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Ray\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim also fails. Section 1983 prohibits the deprivation of \u201cany rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws\u201d by a person acting under color of law. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Ray argues that his former employer and several co-workers filed false criminal charges and then committed perjury at the subsequent trial for assault. It is unclear exactly which right has allegedly been breached. Regardless, Ray has not explained how his co-workers or former employer acted under \u201ccolor of law.\u201d The Supreme Court has long emphasized that actionable deprivations must be based on \u201c[m]isuse of power, possessed by virtue of state law and made possible only because the wrongdoer is clothed with the authority of state law.\u201d <em>United States v. Classic, </em>313 U.S. 299, 326, 61 S.Ct. 1031, 85 L.Ed. 1368 (1941). Here, the misconduct Ray alleges \u2014 perjury and the false filing of criminal charges \u2014 are not made possible by state authority, but could readily be committed by any private individual. Nor has Ray presented any evidence that the state \u201cexerted coercive power [over] or provided significant encouragement\u201d to the actors. <em>Cornish v. Corr. Servs. Corp., </em>402 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>F.3d 545, 549 (5th Cir.2005) (citations omitted). In addition, it appears that Ray is indirectly challenging the validity of his criminal proceeding and conviction, which is not a permissible use of \u00a7 1983. <em>See Cormier v. Lafayette City-ParishConsol. Gov\u2019t, </em>493 Fed.Appx. 578, 583 (5th Cir. 2012) (collecting cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Finally, we likewise affirm the court\u2019s decision with respect to Ray\u2019s claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985. Section 1985 prohibits, <em>inter alia, </em>conspiracy to deprive \u201cany person or class of persons the equal protection of the laws.\u201d <em>Montoya v. FedEx Ground Package Sys., Inc., </em>614 F.3d 145, 149 (5th Cir.2010). Despite a careful review of Ray\u2019s filings, the factual and legal foundation of his \u00a7 1985 claim remains unclear. Before the district court, Ray argued that the claim is rooted in alleged perjury at his workplace hearing and criminal trial; yet now he abandons that argument and insists that the claim is rooted in a longstanding practice of racial discrimination by his former employer. His briefs cite no legal authority to support either argument, and his allegations of conspiracy are wholly eonclusory. Where, as here, an appellant fails to state his \u201ccontentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities ... on which [he] relies,\u201d the appellant\u2019s argument is waived. <em>Raj v. La. State Univ., </em>714 F.3d 322, 327 (5th Cir.2013) (quoting Fed. R.App. P. 28); <em>see also Offord v. Parker, </em>456 Fed.Appx. 472, 475 (5th Cir.2012) (noting that plaintiff-appellant\u2019s allegations of conspiracy were eonclusory).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Consequently, for the reasons stated herein, summary . judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b471-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b471-13\">. Ray served as a counselor to inmates at a Mississippi penitentiary, but did not work for the state. He worked for a private entity that provides correctional services.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b471-20\">. The precise nature of the claim is unclear, as explained <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b472-5\">. Ray claims that he only intended to expose the co-worker\u2019s fraudulent credentials and try to get him fired. Ray wants to recharacterize the death threat so he can argue that his misconduct was indistinguishable from behavior for which other employees were not fired. However, as explained, Ray has no support for the claim that his threats should not have been taken seriously.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
