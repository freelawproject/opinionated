He seeks to challenge his conviction for using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), on the ground that it cannot be sustained following <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-16\">The district court correctly determined that Nutall had not made the required showing that the <em>Bailey </em>decision rendered him actually innocent so as to satisfy the savings clause of \u00a7 2255 and qualify for relief under \u00a7 2241. <em>See Christopher v. Miles, </em>342 F.3d 378, 382 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED. Nutall\u2019s motion to stay is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b432-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
