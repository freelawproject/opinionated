Because the petition for review was not filed within thirty days of the Board\u2019s order, the petition must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">The Board entered the order on May 23, 2013. Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1) (2012), Lenga had thirty days, or until June 24, 2013, to timely file a petition for review.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> This time period is \u201cjurisdictional in nature and must be construed with strict fidelity to [its] terms.\u201d <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995). It is \u201cnot subject to equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because Lenga did not file his petition until June 25, 2013, it is untimely filed. Under Rule 25(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, filings are not timely if not filed with the clerk of the court within the time fixed for such a filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-13\">Accordingly, we dismiss the petition for review for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-14\">\n<em>PETITION DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"A1Y\"> The thirtieth day was Saturday, June 22, 2013. Therefore, the petition was due no later than Monday, June 24, 2013. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 26(a)(1)(C).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
