Soto argues that he is entitled to a new hearing because 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.10(a)(1) unambiguously required the immigration judge (IJ) to have Soto \u201cstate then and there\u201d at the removal hearing whether he desired representation and the IJ failed to elicit Soto\u2019s express statement. Soto posits that if an agency violates its own regulation and that regulation helps to protect a constitutional or statutory right, a new hearing is required without requiring the alien to show that the violation caused prejudice because such a violation is prejudice per se.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-22\">Because Soto\u2019s claim is grounded in his claim that he was denied the right to counsel, we have jurisdiction over the appeal. <em>See Mai v. Gonzales, </em>473 F.3d 162, 164 (5th Cir.2006). We review the BIA\u2019s decision and consider the IJ\u2019s decision only to the extent that it influenced the BIA. <em>Ogunfuye v. Holder, </em>610 F.3d 303, 305 (5th Cir.2010). The BIA\u2019s conclusions of law are reviewed de novo. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>We need not reach Soto\u2019s arguments that \u00a7 1240.10(a)(1) is unambiguous and that the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the regulation is not entitled to deference because, contrary to his assertion, Soto is required to make an initial showing of substantial prejudice. Section 1240.10(a)(1) provides that the IJ in a removal proceeding shall \u201c[ajdvise the respondent of his or her right to representation, at no expense to the government, by counsel of his or her own choice authorized to practice in the proceedings and require the respondent to state then arid there whether he or she desires representation.\u201d The regulation implements 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362, which provides that an alien \u201cshall have the <em>privilege </em>of being represented (at no expense to the Government)....\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">As nothing in \u00a7 1362 required the IJ to elicit from Soto at the removal hearing an express statement as to whether he desired representation, \u00a7 1240.10(a)(1) is not a regulation that enforces a fundamental statutory right. <em>See Arzanipour v. INS, </em>866 F.2d 743, 743 (5th Cir.1989). Further, Soto\u2019s argument that \u00a7 1240.10(a)(1) enforces his Fifth Amendment due process right to counsel belies his argument that he is not required to make an initial showing of prejudice. In <em>Ogbemudia v. INS, </em>988 F.2d 595, 598 (5th Cir.1993), this court recognized that \u201cthe absence of an attorney may create a due process violation if the defect impinged upon the fundamental fairness of the hearing in violation of the fifth amendment,\u201d and there was substantial prejudice. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cDue process challenges to deportation proceedings require an initial showing of substantial prejudice.\u201d <em>Anwar v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 140, 144 (5th Cir.1997). Before we will intervene in the outcome of a removal hearing based on a lack of representation, the alien must demonstrate prejudice that implicated the fundamental fairness of the proceeding. <em>Prichard-Ciriza v. INS, </em>978 F.2d 219, 222 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">The IJ informed Soto of his right to be represented by counsel, gave him a list of low cost counsel, and offered a continuance for him to obtain counsel. The IJ also addressed Soto individually and demanded a verbal response to ensure that Soto understood the rights the IJ had described. Moreover, Soto, now represented by counsel, has not advanced grounds for relief that were available at the time of the removal hearing that an attorney might have brought to the IJ\u2019s attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">Soto has not shown that he was denied a full and fair hearing, and he has not made the initial requisite showing that the alleged violation of \u00a7 1240.10(a)(1) prejudiced him; he has not presented sufficient grounds to require that he receive a new hearing. <em>See Anwar, </em>116 F.3d at 144; <em>Prichardr-Ciriza, </em>978 F.2d at 222. Accordingly, his petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b440-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
