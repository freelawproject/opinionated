On appeal, Andrews argues that the evidence presented and argued by the Government at trial resulted in a fatal variance that requires this court to vacate his convictions. He also contends that the district court erred in sentencing him as a career offender. The Government argues that there was no fatal variance between the indictment and the evidence presented at trial, and that Andrews\u2019 convictions should accordingly be affirmed. The Government concedes, however, that Andrews\u2019 career offender sentence is improper after this court\u2019s decision in <em>United, States v. Davis, </em>720 F.3d 215 (4th Cir.2013), and therefore that his sentence should be vacated and the case remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">According to Andrews, evidence presented at trial established that the money taken from the Domino\u2019s business belonged to the franchise owner rather than to Domino\u2019s, and such evidence constituted a fatal variance from the indictment. \u201cThis court reviews de novo a claim of constructive amendment to an indictment.\u201d <em>United States v. Malloy, </em>568 F.3d 166, 177 (4th Cir.2009). \u201cWhen the government, through its presentation of evidence or its argument, or the district court, through its instructions to the jury, or both, broadens the bases for conviction beyond those charged in the indictment, a constructive amendment \u2014 sometimes referred to as a fatal variance \u2014 occurs.\u201d <em>United States v. Allmendinger, </em>706 F.3d 330, 339 (4th Cir. 2013) (citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 2747, 186 L.Ed.2d 194 (2013). \u201cAn indictment is constructively amended, and a fatal variance occurs when the indictment is altered to change the elements of the offense charged, such that the defendant is actually convicted of a crime other than that charged in the indictment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Based on our review of the record, we conclude that no fatal variance occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-12\">Andrews argues, and the Government concedes, that his career offender designation is no longer valid after <em>Davis, </em>because he received only a single sentence on the multiple charges that were consolidated by the state court. The presentence investigation report noted Andrews\u2019 convictions on five counts of felony robbery with a dangerous weapon, two counts of felony assault with a dangerous weapon with intent to kill, and one count of felony discharge of a weapon into occupied property. These charges were consolidated for judgment and resolved at a single hearing, after which the state court issued a single judgment sentencing Andrews to a term of imprisonment. In <em>Davis, </em>this court held \u201cthat a consolidated sentence under North Carolina law is a single sentence for purposes of the career offender enhancement.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>720 F.3d at 216; <em>see also id. </em>at 219-20. Thus, after <em>Davis, </em>the state charges that were resolved by the consolidated judgment count as only one career-offender predicate. Andrews has no other prior felony convictions, and thus he does not qualify for sentencing as a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm Andrews\u2019 convictions, vacate his sentence, and remand for resentencing. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
