On appeal, Trujillo\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal but questioning whether Trujillo\u2019s trial counsel was ineffective. Trujillo filed a pro se supplemental brief, in which he claims that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, that the drug amount on which his sentence was based was erroneous, that there was insufficient evidence to support the money laundering conviction and related increase to his base offense level, and that there exists an unwarranted sentencing disparity between himself and a co-conspirator. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">The sole issue raised in the <em>Anders </em>brief is whether trial counsel was ineffective for failing to take the steps necessary to ensure that Trujillo received the benefit of the safety valve provision. \u201cA defendant can raise the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel ... on direct appeal if and only if it conclusively appears from the record that his counsel did not provide effective assistance.... \u201d <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>136 F.3d 972, 979 (4th Cir.1998). To prove ineffective assistance the defendant must satisfy two requirements: (1) \u201cthat counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness\u201d; and (2) \u201cthat there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). In the context of a guilty plea, \u201cin order to satisfy the \u2018prejudice\u2019 requirement, the defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\u201d <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 59, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985). The present record does not conclusively demonstrate that counsel was ineffective. Thus, Trujillo\u2019s claim is not cognizable on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record, including Trujillo\u2019s pro se arguments, and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform Trujillo, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Trujillo requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Trujillo. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
