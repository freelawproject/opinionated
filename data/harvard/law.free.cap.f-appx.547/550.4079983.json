(Hook &amp; Anchor) is excess to ACE\u2019s coverage in the underlying litigation and that American States is entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees and prompt-payment penalties under the Texas Insurance Code. ACE cross-appeals the district court\u2019s partial grant of summary judgment in favor of American States that ACE is responsible for one-half of the costs of Hook &amp; Anchor\u2019s defense. We reverse in part, vacate in part, and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-19\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b577-20\">American States provided coverage to Hook &amp; Anchor under a commercial auto policy during the period from August 2008 to August 2009. ACE provided coverage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>to Chemical Weed Control, Inc. (Chemical Weed) under a business auto policy during the period from June 2008 to June 2009. Both policies contained identical \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses providing for primary coverage for \u201ccovered autos\u201d owned by the policyholder and excess coverage for \u201ccovered autos\u201d not owned by the policyholder.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">In October 2008, Jayme Lynn Jones, an employee of Hook &amp; Anchor, was involved in a collision with Alexander Kosaka while Jones was driving a truck owned by Chemical Weed. Kosaka brought suit against Hook &amp; Anchor,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and American States tendered the defense of Hook <em>&amp; </em>Anchor to ACE. ACE rejected the tender and offered instead to share the defense costs with American States. American States repeated its tender, which ACE again refused. American States then undertook the defense of Hook &amp; Anchor in full and subsequently commenced this action seeking defense costs and attorneys\u2019 fees and a declaration that ACE had the sole duty to defend Hook &amp; Anchor in the suit against Kosaka.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">American States moved for partial summary judgment on its claims that its coverage obligation to Hook <em>&amp; </em>Anchor was excess to ACE\u2019s and that it was entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees and prompt-payment penalties. ACE filed a crossmotion for summary judgment against American States on all claims. The district court granted each motion in part and denied each in part, holding that ACE had a duty to defend Hook &amp; Anchor, but that American States\u2019 coverage obligation was not excess to that of ACE and liability should be prorated. The district court also concluded that ACE\u2019s offer to share defense costs was in line with its obligation to provide pro rata coverage and that accordingly, ACE did not breach its contract with Hook &amp; Anchor and American States was not entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees or prompt-payment penalties. The district court ordered ACE to pay American States $80,500.00 for its prorated share of American States\u2019 defense of Hook <em>&amp; </em>Anchor from the date American States tendered the defense to ACE. Both parties now appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b578-11\">We review the grant or denial of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standard as the district court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In making this determination, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and draw all inferences in its favor.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The district court\u2019s interpretation of an insurance contract is a question of law subject to de novo review.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-12\">HI</p>\n<p id=\"b578-13\">The central issue on appeal is whether the identical \u201cother insurance\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>clauses in the American States and ACE policies rendered ACE\u2019s coverage primary and American States\u2019 coverage excess due to Chemical Weed\u2019s ownership of the vehicle, or whether the clauses conflict and are knocked out.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Conflicts involving \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses arise when \u201cmore than one policy covers the same insured and each policy has an \u2018other insurance\u2019 clause which restricts its liability by reason of the existence of other coverage.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, under the rule announced by the Supreme Court of Texas in <em>Hardware Dealers Mutual Fire Insurance Co. v. Farmers Insurance </em>Exchange,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> when an insured would receive \u201ccoverage from either one of two policies but for the other, and each contains a provision which is reasonably subject to a construction that it conflicts with a provision in the other concurrent insurance, there is a conflict.... [that can be] solved by ignoring the two offending provisions.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This court has interpreted <em>Hardware Dealers </em>broadly, holding that even when a plausible interpretation of opposing \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses would render one policy\u2019s coverage primary and the other\u2019s excess, if a \u201creasonable construction\u201d of the two policies from the insured\u2019s perspective would result in full coverage under each policy but for the existence of the other, the policies conflict and liability should be apportioned pro rata.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-11\">In the present case, the district court found that \u201cfrom the perspective of Hook &amp; Anchor ... the ACE Policy would provide coverage for Hook &amp; Anchor in the Underlying Litigation if the American States Policy did not exist, and ... the American States Policy would provide full coverage for Hook <em>&amp; </em>Anchor in the Underlying Litigation if the ACE Policy did not exist.\u201d Consequently, the district court concluded that the \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses in the American States and ACE policies were in conflict and held that liability should be shared pro rata.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-12\">American States argues that <em>Hardware Dealers </em>does not apply because the \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses included in the American States and ACE policies are not designed to evade primary liability when other coverage is available, and we agree. Unlike the \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses in <em>Hardware Dealers </em>and subsequent decisions of this court interpreting <em>Hardware Dealers</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em>, </em>the existence of primary cover<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>age under each of the \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses in the American States and ACE policies turns not on the availability of other insurance but rather on vehicle ownership. Because the availability of other insurance is not dispositive of the existence of primary coverage, the issue addressed in Hardware Dealers \u2014 \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses that \u201crestrict[ ] ... liability by reason of the existence of other coverage\u201d \u2014 is not implicated in the present case.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">In <em>Snyder v. Allstate Insurance Co.,</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a post-Hardware Dealers case, the Supreme Court of Texas dealt with nearly identical facts and concluded that no conflict existed.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Although the <em>Snyder </em>court did not discuss the relevance of <em>Hardware Dealers </em>with respect to the priority of coverage, the court noted that when \u201c[two] policies have \u2018other insurance\u2019 clauses which state that the policy provides only excess insurance with respect to non-owned automobiles, but provide for prorated coverage with respect to the owned automobile.... [i]f the [vehicle involved in the accident] was an \u2018owned automobile\u2019 within the meaning of [one insurer\u2019s] policy, then [that insurer\u2019s] coverage is primary and [the other insurer\u2019s] \u2018non-owned\u2019 coverage is excess within the meaning of both policies.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Moreover, the court declined to impose pro rata liability on the nonowner\u2019s insurer and affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment that the vehicle owner\u2019s insurer had \u201can obligation to defend [the non-owners involved in the accident] in all actions and to pay all claims up to its policy limits arising out of the collision.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Because the \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses do not limit liability or coverage based on the existence of other available insurance, we hold that the policies do not conflict, and that under the terms of the \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses, ACE was obligated to provide primary coverage to Hook &amp; Anchor and is liable for the entirety of Hook &amp; Anchor\u2019s defense. Accordingly, we reverse the district court\u2019s judgment that the \u201cother insurance\u201d provisions should be ignored and that liability should be prorated between ACE and American States.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">In addition to its defense costs, American States also seeks its attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in this action and prompt-payment penalties under Texas Insurance Code \u00a7 542.060. The district court held that an award of damages under \u00a7 542.060 would be improper because ACE\u2019s offer to share in Hook &amp; Anchor\u2019s defense accorded with the district court\u2019s determination that the defense costs should be prorated between ACE and American States. Because we conclude that the district court erred in imposing pro rata liability, we vacate the district court\u2019s judgment with respect to American States\u2019 claim for attorneys\u2019 fees and prompt-payment penalties and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">On cross-appeal, ACE contends that because American States rejected ACE\u2019s of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>fers to share the cost of Hook &amp; Anchor\u2019s defense and \u201cvoluntarily\u201d paid for the entire defense, American States has \u201cno contractual or equitable right to recover from ACE.\u201d The district court did not explicitly rule on this question. Accordingly, we remand to the district court to determine in the first instance whether American States\u2019 payment for Hook &amp; Anchor\u2019s defense was voluntary, and whether American States is contractually or equitably subrogated to Hook <em>&amp; </em>Anchor\u2019s rights against ACE.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is REVERSED in part and VACATED in part, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b577-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
