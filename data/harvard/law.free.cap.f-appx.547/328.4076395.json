We have reviewed the administrative record and Funes Cruz\u2019s claims and conclude that we lack jurisdiction over the petition for review. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i), (a)(2)(D) (2012); <em>Sorda v. Holder, </em>643 F.3d 117, 124-25 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 776, 181 L.Ed.2d 487 (2011). Accordingly, we dismiss the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-23\">\n<em>PETITION DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
