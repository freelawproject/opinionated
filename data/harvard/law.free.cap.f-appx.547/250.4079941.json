He appeals, arguing that his sentence was unreasonable because the district court failed to address mitigating evidence he presented at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-21\">In reviewing a sentence, we must first ensure that the district court did not commit any \u201csignificant procedural error,\u201d such as failing to properly calculate the applicable Guidelines range, failing to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2012) factors, or failing to adequately explain the sentence. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The district court is not required to \u201crobotically tick through \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s every subsection.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 345 (4th Cir.2006). However, the district court \u201cmust place on the record an \u2018individualized assessment\u2019 based on the particular facts of the case before it. This individualized assessment need not be elaborate or lengthy, but it must provide a rationale tailored to the particular case at hand and adequate to permit \u2018meaningful appellate review.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Carter, </em>564 F.3d 325, 330 (4th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. 586) (internal footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-22\">At Degraffenreid\u2019s sentencing hearing, his attorney argued for a below-Guidelines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>sentence of 24 months \u2014 pointing out to the court, inter alia, Degraffenreid\u2019s excellent work history, his family\u2019s support, and serious injuries he had already sustained after an attack by another inmate. Degraffenreid addressed the court personally, apologizing for his conduct and also pointing out that he had remained in school after his indictment and completed a course to obtain his commercial driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">We conclude, based on our review of the record, including the sentencing transcript, that the district court adequately considered the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors and explained its reasons for the chosen sentence. The court clearly took into consideration the specific arguments Degraffenreid\u2019s attorney made for a downward variance but found that a Guidelines sentence was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Accordingly, we affirm Degraffenreid\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
