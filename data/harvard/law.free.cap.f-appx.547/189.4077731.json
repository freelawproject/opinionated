Pursuant to a downward departure for substantial assistance and a variance, the court sentenced Ochoa to a term of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. Counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that there are no meritorious issues for appeal but questioning whether Ochoa\u2019s guilty plea colloquy substantially complied with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 and whether his sentence is reasonable. Although Ochoa was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, he has not done so. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">Prior to accepting a guilty plea, a trial court, through colloquy with the defendant, must inform the defendant of, and determine that the defendant understands, the nature of the charge to which the plea is offered, any mandatory minimum penalty, the maximum possible penalty he faces, and the various rights he is relinquishing by pleading guilty. Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(1). The court also must ensure that the defendant\u2019s plea was voluntary, was supported by a sufficient factual basis, and did not result from force, threats, or promises not contained in the plea agreement. Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(2), (3). \u201cIn reviewing the adequacy of compliance with Rule 11, this court should accord deference to the trial court\u2019s decision as to how best to conduct the mandated colloquy with the defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 116 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-11\">Because Ochoa did not move to withdraw his guilty plea in the district court or raise any objections during the Rule 11 colloquy, the plea colloquy is reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. General, </em>278 F.3d 389, 393 (4th Cir.2002). To demonstrate plain error, a defendant must show that: (1) there was an error; (2) the error was plain; and (3) the error affected his \u201csubstantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Upon a thorough review of the record, we conclude that the district court substantially complied with Rule 11 and that Ochoa\u2019s plea was knowing and voluntary. Though the district court did not inform Ochoa of the government\u2019s right, in a prosecution for perjury or false statement, to use any statement Ochoa made under oath against him, Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(b)(1)(A), we conclude that this error did not affect Ochoa\u2019s substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-12\">Next, we review Ochoa\u2019s sentence for reasonableness, applying an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In so doing we first examine the sentence for significant procedural error, including whether the district court properly calculated the defendant\u2019s advisory Guidelines range, considered the parties\u2019 arguments in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006) factors, selected a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, and adequately explained the selected sentence. <em>Id. </em>When considering the substantive reasonableness of the sentence, we \u201ctake into account the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the sentence is within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>or below the properly calculated Guidelines range, we presume on appeal that the sentence is reasonable. <em>United States v. Yooho Weon, </em>722 F.3d 583, 590 (4th Cir. 2013). Upon our review, we conclude that Ochoa\u2019s below-Guidelines sentence is both procedurally and substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform Ochoa, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Ochoa requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Ochoa. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
