On appeal, Divine asserts that his revocation sentence was procedurally unreasonable, because the court erred in concluding that his most serious violation \u2014 possession of marijuana \u2014 was properly classified as a Grade B violation. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-12\">Generally, we will affirm a sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release unless the sentence is \u201cplainly unreasonable.\u201d <em>See United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 437 (4th Cir.2006). We first determine whether the sentence is unreasonable, applying the same general inquiry used to assess the reasonableness of original sentences. <em>Id. </em>at 438. If the sentence is found unreasonable, we must determine whether it is \u201cplainly\u201d so, relying on the same definition of \u201cplain\u201d applied when conducting a plain-error analysis. <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>595 F.3d 544, 547-48 (4th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-14\">Because Divine did not challenge in the district court the characterization of his possession-of-marijuana violation as a Grade B -violation, we review the issue for plain error. <em>See United States v. Bennett, </em>698 F.3d 194, 199 (4th Cir.2012), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 1506, 185 L.Ed.2d 559 (2013). To establish plain error, Divine must show (1) an error occurred, (2) the error was plain, and (3) the error affected his substantial rights. <em>United States v. King, </em>628 F.3d 693, 699 (4th Cir.2011). Even if he makes this showing, we will exercise our discretion to reverse \u201conly if the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Powell, </em>680 F.3d 350, 358 (4th Cir.) (internal quotation marks omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 376, 184 L.Ed.2d 222 (2012). \u201cThe term \u2018plain\u2019 error is synonymous with \u2018clear\u2019 or \u2018obvious\u2019 error. An error is plain if the settled law of the Supreme Court or this circuit establishes that an error has occurred.\u201d <em>United States v. Carthorne, </em>726 F.3d 503, 516 (4th Cir.2013) (some internal quotation marks omitted; citations omitted); <em>see also United States v. Strieper, </em>666 F.3d 288, 295 (4th Cir.2012) (\u201c[Wjhere we have yet to speak directly on a legal issue and other circuits are split, a district court does not commit plain error by following the reasoning of another circuit.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-17\">Divine asserts that the district court plainly erred in classifying his marijuana possession as a Grade B violation, rather than a Grade C violation. Grade A violations include</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-18\">conduct constituting (A) a federal, state, or local offense punishable by a term of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>imprisonment exceeding one year that (i) is a crime of violence, (ii) is a controlled substance offense, or (iii) involves possession of a firearm or destructive device of a type described in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(a); or (B) any other federal, state, or local offense punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding twenty years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-4\"><em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 7Bl.l(a)(l), p.s. (2003). Grade B violations include \u201cconduct constituting any other federal, state, or local offense punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year.\u201d USSG \u00a7 7Bl.l(a)(2), p.s. Grade C violations include conduct constituting any other criminal offense punishable by a year or less of imprisonment or any other violation of a supervised release condition. USSG \u00a7 7B1.1(a)(3), p.s. \u201cThe grade of violation does not depend upon the conduct that is the subject of criminal charges or of which the defendant is convicted in a criminal proceeding. Rather, the grade of the violation is to be based on the defendant\u2019s actual conduct.\u201d USSG \u00a7 7B1.1 cmt. n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">The parties agree that Divine\u2019s conduct would be punishable as a federal offense under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a) (2012), which criminalizes the simple possession of a controlled substance. A person who violates this provision and has no prior drug conviction is subject to a maximum sentence of one year of imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>However, a person who violates this provision and has a prior drug conviction is subject to a sentence of fifteen days\u2019 to two years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">Although Divine\u2019s criminal history reveals at least one prior controlled substance conviction, he asserts that this prior conviction is not \u201cconduct\u201d relevant in determining the classification for his supervised release violation. He relies upon both <em>Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, </em>560 U.S. 563, 130 S.Ct. 2577, 177 L.Ed.2d 68 (2010), and <em>United States v. Simmons, </em>649 F.3d 237, 243 (4th Cir.2011) (en banc), to argue that the court could not consider the recidivist enhancement for his hypothetical \u00a7 844(a) offense because the Government was unable to comply with the protections of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 (2012) in the context of a revocation proceeding. He also identifies authority affirming revocation sentences for simple possession violations that were classified as Grade C violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">In response, the Government argues that the district court did not err in classifying Divine\u2019s offense as a Grade B violation, as Divine was eligible for the recidivist enhancement due to his prior conviction, and \u00a7 851 notice requirements are inapplicable in the supervised release context. The Government also distinguishes <em>Carachuri-Rosendo </em>and <em>Simmons </em>and identifies unpublished cases affirming revocation sentences in which simple possession violations were classified as Grade B violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-11\">Ultimately, we need not resolve this dispute, as any error by the district court was not \u201cplain.\u201d The district court\u2019s conclusion that Divine\u2019s marijuana possession was a Grade B offense is supported by unpublished authority from this circuit, <em>e.g., United States v. Jemerson, </em>132 Fed.Appx. 488, 489-90 (4th Cir.2005) (No. 04-5008); <em>United States v. Justice, </em>70 Fed.Appx. 719, 720 (4th Cir.2003) (No. 03-4388), as well as authority from other circuits, <em>see United States v. Trotter, </em>270 F.3d 1150, 1154 (7th Cir.2001) (recognizing that, when determining whether defendant\u2019s conduct is punishable by more than one year of imprisonment in context of supervised release revocation, \u201ccourt must determine whether the conduct is a felony (etc.) after prior convictions are taken into account\u201d); <em>United States v. Crace, </em>207 F.3d 833, 837-38 (6th Cir.2000) (permitting court to consider prior convictions when determining whether conduct was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>properly classified as Grade B violation); <em>United States v. Seiber, </em>516 Fed.Appx. 208, 214-16 (3d Cir.2013) (No. 12-2523) (rejecting argument, under <em>Carachuri-Rosendo, </em>that \u00a7 851 notice was required to apply recidivist enhancement when determining possible penalty for simple possession, and concluding recidivist simple possession is Grade B violation); <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>510 Fed.Appx. 149, 155-56 (3d Cir.) (No. 12-2390) (rejecting argument that supervised release violation based on simple possession could not be Grade B felony unless Government filed \u00a7 851 information), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 1477, 185 L.Ed.2d 378 (2013). Moreover, to the extent <em>Carachuri-Rosendo </em>and <em>Simmons </em>may provide support for Divine\u2019s conclusion that his conduct was a Grade C violation, they do not clearly compel that conclusion, as they do not address drug possession in the context of revocation proceedings. Thus, while this circuit\u2019s unpublished authority finding simple possession offenses as Grade B violations predates both <em>Carachuri-Rosendo </em>and <em>Simmons, </em>neither <em>Carachuri-Rosendo </em>nor <em>Simmons </em>so clearly abrogates the court\u2019s prior reasoning as to require reversal for plain error. The district court\u2019s classification of Divine\u2019s conduct as a Grade B offense therefore did not run afoul of any settled law and was not obviously incorrect under available authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Because Divine cannot demonstrate plain error, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
