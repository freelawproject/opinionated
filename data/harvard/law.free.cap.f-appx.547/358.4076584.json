The district court originally sentenced Walker to 262 months of imprisonment, followed by five years of supervised release, but later reduced the sentence to 120 months of imprisonment on the Government\u2019s motion. After Walker\u2019s release from incarceration, the district court revoked Walker\u2019s supervised release and sentenced him to twelve months of incarceration, followed by four years of supervised release. Following his second release, the district court found that Walker had again violated the terms of his supervised release. The court revoked Walker\u2019s supervised release and sentenced him to twenty-four months of imprisonment. Walker appeals. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-22\">Walker argues that the district court improperly considered 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006) factors that are not to be considered when determining a revocation sentence. We review a sentence imposed on revocation to determine whether the sentence was plainly unreasonable. <em>United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 437 (4th Cir. 2006). Although a district court must consider the policy statements in Chapter Seven of the United States Sentencing Guidelines along with the statutory requirements of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583 (2006) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006), \u201cthe court ultimately has broad discretion to revoke its previous sentence and impose a term of imprisonment up to the statutory maximum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 439 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We have reviewed the record and have considered Walker\u2019s arguments and discern no reversible error. We therefore conclude that Walker\u2019s sentence is not plainly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order. We also grant Walker\u2019s motion filed August 19, 2018 to the extent it seeks to withdraw his prior motions filed on June 4 and 6, 2013. We deny the motion to the extent that Walker seeks to file a pro se supplemental brief, and deny Walker\u2019s November 8, 2013, motion to file a pro se reply brief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
