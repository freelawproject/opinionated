The order is not appealable unless a circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A) (2006). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2006). When the district court denies relief on procedural grounds, the prisoner must demonstrate both that the dispositive procedural ruling is debatable, and that the petition states a debatable claim of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484-85, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Newkirk has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny Newkirk\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel, deny a certificate of appealability, deny leave to proceed in forma pauperis, and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
