Rueda contends that the district court misapplied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b) by allowing the Government to decline to move for the additional one-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility based on his refusal to waive his right to appeal and that the district court should have awarded the additional acceptance point in consideration of Rueda\u2019s acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">Rueda\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by <em>United States v. Newson, </em>515 F.3d 374, 376-79 (5th Cir.2008), which held that a district court may not award a reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3El.l(b) absent a motion from the Government and that \u201c[a] defendant\u2019s refusal to waive his right to appeal is a proper basis for the Government to decline to make such a motion.\u201d The district court committed no error under the Sentencing Guidelines in effect at the time of sentencing. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>478 F.3d 266, 270 (5th Cir.2007) (stating that construction of the guidelines is a question of law that is reviewed de novo).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b548-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
