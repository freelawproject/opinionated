Hart, who was previously employed by the Hanover County School Board (\u201cthe Board\u201d), filed a complaint against the Board and its Director of Pupil Transportation, Michael Ashby, asserting that her employment was terminated in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 201-219 (West 1998 &amp; Supp.2013). We previously affirmed the district court\u2019s order granting Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss Hart\u2019s complaint, but vacated the district court\u2019s order denying Hart\u2019s Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) motion to vacate, and her Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a) motion to amend her complaint. On remand, the district court denied Hart\u2019s motion to amend her complaint, and denied her Rule 59(e) motion. Hart timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-21\">We have reviewed the record and considered the parties\u2019 arguments and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s final order. <em>Hart v. Hanover County Sch. Bd., </em>No. 3:10-cv-00794-JRS, 2013 WL 1867388 (E.D.Va. May 2, 2013). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-22\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
