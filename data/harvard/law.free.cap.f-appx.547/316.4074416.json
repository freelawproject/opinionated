The district court sentenced Bethea to forty-six months\u2019 imprisonment on the robbery count and a consecutive eighty-four months, the statutory mandatory minimum, on the \u00a7 924(c) brandishing count. Bethea timely appeals, arguing that the district court erred in applying a four-level enhancement for abduction, <em>see U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual, </em>\u00a7 2B3.1(b)(4)(A) (2012), and that his sentence is unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to comply with the purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2012). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">First, Bethea\u2019s offense level, derived from the robbery Guideline, was increased by four levels based on the abduction of two victims during the robbery. Bethea does not contest the district court\u2019s factual findings but argues that the facts do not support an application of the enhancement. However, as counsel concedes, our decision in <em>United States v. Osborne, </em>514 F.3d 377 (4th Cir.2008), forecloses any argument that moving employees from one part of a store to another does not constitute abduction. Because \u201c[a] panel of this court cannot overrule ... the precedent set by a prior panel of this court,\u201d this argument fails. <em>Watkins v. SunTrust Mortg., Inc., </em>663 F.3d 232, 241 (4th Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Bethea next argues that his sentence is unreasonable. We review a sentence for reasonableness, applying \u201ca deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We must first \u201censur[e] that the district court committed no significant procedural error,\u201d such as improperly calculating the Guidelines range, insufficiently considering the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors and the parties\u2019 arguments, or inadequately explaining the sentence imposed. <em>United States v. Lynn, </em>592 F.3d 572, 575 (4th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">If the sentence is free of significant procedural error, we review it for substantive reasonableness. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. The sentence imposed must be \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes [of sentencing].\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). In reviewing a sentence for substantive reasonableness, this court \u201cexamines the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>United States v. Mendoza-Mendoza, </em>597 F.3d 212, 216 (4th Cir. 2010). If the sentence is within the properly calculated Guidelines range, we apply a presumption on appeal that the sentence is substantively reasonable. <em>United States v. Susi, </em>674 F.3d 278, 289 (4th Cir.2012). Such a presumption is rebutted only by showing \u201cthat the sentence is unreasonable when measured against the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). An appellate court will only reverse a sentence if it is unreasonable, even if the appellate court would have imposed a different sentence. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>526 F.3d 155, 160 (4th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">Bethea argues that he should have received a downward variance because the mandatory minimum sentence for brandishing punishes both the brandishing and the abduction. Further, Bethea contends that his sentence is greater than necessary to comply with the \u00a7 3553(a) factors because the abduction only constituted moving employees a short distance.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">We conclude that Bethea\u2019s sentence is not unreasonable when measured against the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The district court rejected Bethea\u2019s argument for a below-Guidelines sentence based on the four-level enhancement overstating the seriousness of the offense, noting that Bethea victimized two individuals during the robbery. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), (C). Fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>ther, we simply disagree with Bethea\u2019s argument that the abduction enhancement and the brandishing conviction subjected him to double punishment for the same conduct. In light of the deference accorded the district court\u2019s exercise of its sentencing discretion, we conclude that Bethea has failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness accorded his within-Guidelines sentence. <em>Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d at 379.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Accordingly, we affirm Bethea\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
