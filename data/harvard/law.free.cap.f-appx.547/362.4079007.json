We have thoroughly reviewed the record, including the transcript of Jing\u2019s merits hearing, the record of Jing\u2019s sworn statement taken after his arrival in the United States, the credible fear interview and Jing\u2019s supporting evidence. We conclude that the record evidence does not compel a ruling contrary to the Board\u2019s dismissal and that substantial evidence supports the adverse credibility finding. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (2012); <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
