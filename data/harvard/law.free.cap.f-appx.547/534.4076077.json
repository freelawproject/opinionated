In that petition, Lewis argued, pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that he should have been held accountable only for the amount of drugs alleged in the indictment. He asserted that he was actually innocent of his sentence because it was based on drug amounts neither admitted by him nor found beyond a reasonable doubt by a jury. He also asserted that his sentence was erroneously enhanced based on unproven conduct that was unrelated to his offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-20\">On appeal, Lewis reiterates the merits of his habeas claims. Lewis raises only one argument challenging the district court\u2019s grounds for dismissing his petition. He complains that the court failed to give reasons for finding that it lacked jurisdiction to consider his claims. That argument lacks merit. The district court clearly indicated that it was dismissing Lewis\u2019s petition for lack of jurisdiction because his claims arose under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 and Lewis had not established his eligibility to proceed under the savings clause in \u00a7 2255(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>As a general rule, a federal prisoner who seeks to collaterally challenge the legality of his conviction or sentence must file a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 425-26 (5th Cir.2005). Such claims may be raised in a \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) only if the prisoner shows that the \u00a7 2255 remedy is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d \u00a7 2255(e). To make that showing, the prisoner must raise \u201ca claim of actual innocence (i) that is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense and (ii) that was foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Although Lewis asserted that he was actually innocent of his sentence based on <em>Booker </em>and <em>Apprendi, </em>neither of those decisions has been made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review. <em>Padilla, </em>416 F.3d at 427. Nor do those decisions have any bearing on whether the facts in Lewis\u2019s case supported his conviction of the substantive offense. <em>Id. </em>As Lewis did not establish that his \u00a7 2255 remedy was ineffective, the district court did not err in dismissing his \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b560-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
