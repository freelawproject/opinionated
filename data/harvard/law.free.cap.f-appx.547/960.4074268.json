On appeal, Wortham argues that the district court did not address or explain, as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1), its rejection of Wortham\u2019s mitigation argument or its reasons for imposing the sentence that it did. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-21\">We review <em>de novo </em>the sufficiency of the district court\u2019s explanation under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1), even if the defendant did not object below. <em>United States v. Bonilla, </em>463 F.3d 1176, 1181 (11th Cir.2006). A district court is required to state reasons for its particular sentence, and if the sentence is of a kind and within the range recommended by the Guidelines and that range exceeds 24 months, the reason for imposing a sentence at a particular point within that range. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1); <em>Bonilla, </em>463 F.3d at 1181. Section 3553(c)(1) applies to the district court\u2019s statements \u201cat the time of sentencing\u201d and \u201cin open court.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b986-22\">A district court is not required to incant the specific language used in the guidelines or articulate its consideration of each individual \u00a7 3553(a) factor, so long as the rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>ord reflects the district court\u2019s consideration of the \u00a7 3558(a) factors. <em>Bonilla, </em>463 F.3d at 1182. More generally, the district court should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that the court has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising its own legal decision-making authority. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). The appropriateness of the brevity or length of a district court\u2019s reasons for accepting or rejecting an argument depends upon the circumstances, leaving much to the court\u2019s judgment. <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhere the defendant or prosecutor presents nonfrivolous reasons for imposing a different sentence, however, the judge will normally go further and explain why he has rejected those arguments. Sometimes the circumstances will call for a brief explanation; sometimes they will call for a lengthier explanation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 357.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">Here, even though the district court\u2019s explanation for Wortham\u2019s sentence was terse, the district court said that it had read the letters submitted prior to the sentencing hearing on Wortham\u2019s behalf. After the district court heard substantial argument from both parties about the appropriate sentence and Wortham\u2019s allocution, the district court determined that the mid-range guideline sentence was sufficient for punishment and for deterrence. The court also concluded that the PSI was accurate. The district court further provided that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in imposing sentence. On this record, Wortham has failed to show that the district court violated \u00a7 3553(c)(1) or committed any other significant procedural error.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
