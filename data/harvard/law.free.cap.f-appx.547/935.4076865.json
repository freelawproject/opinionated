Maradiaga-Larios asserts that, in calculating his Sentencing Guidelines range, his prior misdemeanor-battery offense was improperly considered an aggravated felony, based solely on the technical wording of the trial judge\u2019s judgment; he further contends he was subject to disparate treatment compared to similarly situated individuals. Additionally, Maradiaga-Larios argues his sentence does not account for the two months he spent in immigration custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-18\">We review de novo the definition of an aggravated felony in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>United States v. Ayala-Gomez, </em>255 F.3d 1314, 1316 (11th Cir.2001). We review the reasonableness of a sentence deferentially for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-19\">\u201cIf the defendant previously was deported, or unlawfully remained in the United States, after a conviction for an aggravated felony,\u201d he receives an eight-level increase to his offense level. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). The term \u201caggravated felony\u201d means \u201can offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another\u201d for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2L1.2, cmt. n.3(A); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>\u201cterm of imprisonment\u201d includes parts of the sentence probated by the trial court under Georgia law. <em>Ayala-Gomez, </em>255 F.3d at 1319 (holding that, although the defendant\u2019s five-year sentence of imprisonment was probated to eight months of imprisonment and four years and four months of probation, the sentence properly was treated as a five-year sentence for the purpose of being considered an aggravated felony under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">The substantive reasonableness of a sentence is determined in light of the totality of the circumstances; we will not vacate a sentence as substantively unreasonable, unless we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district judge clearly erred in weighing the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and imposed a sentence outside the range of reasonable sentences. <em>United States v. Turner, </em>626 F.3d 566, 571 n. 2, 573 (11th Cir.2010). \u201cThe party challenging the sentence bears the burden to show it is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 573.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">The district judge is required to impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in \u00a7 3553(a), including the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, and protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). In imposing a particular sentence, the district judge also must consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable Guidelines range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1),(3)-(5) and (7). The district judge must \u201cavoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(6). A defendant, however, does not show unwarranted sentencing disparities when he does not identify similarly situated defendants, who received substantially different sentences. <em>United States v. Spoerke, </em>568 F.3d 1236, 1252 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-8\">The judge does not have to discuss each \u00a7 3553(a) factor explicitly. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cAn acknowledgement the district court has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors will suffice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We will defer to the district judge\u2019s judgment regarding the weight given to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, unless the judge made a clear error and \u201cimposed a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Ordinarily, we expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-9\">The district judge did not err in treating Maradiaga-Larios\u2019s prior battery conviction as an aggravated felony under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>See Ayala-Gomez, </em>255 F.3d at 1316. The portion of his sentence that was probated under Georgia law comprised part of the \u201cterm of imprisonment\u201d; therefore, his sentence of 12 months for battery constituted an aggravated felony. <em>See id. </em>at 1319. The judge considered the totality of circumstances, including Maradiaga-Larios\u2019s disparity arguments, and found his criminal history warranted a sentence within the Guidelines range rather than below it. Maradiaga-Larios failed to identify any similarly situated defendants, who received substantially lower sentences than his sentence. Instead, he offered only hypothetical examples; accordingly, he did not show an unwarranted sentence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number><em>See Spoerke, </em>568 F.3d at 1252. The district judge also did not err in crediting Maradiaga-Larios with only five weeks toward his sentence for the time he spent in immigration custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">Maradiaga-Larios\u2019s sentence is well below the statutory maximum; we defer to the district judge\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, in the absence of any clear error in judgment. <em>Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324. Accordingly, we affirm Maradiaga-Larios\u2019s 32-month sentence as substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
