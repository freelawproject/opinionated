In these consolidated appeals, the Kings argue that the district court erred in responding orally to the jury\u2019s request for a written copy of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>jury instructions pertaining to the statutory elements of the Kings\u2019 offenses. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Because the Kings timely objected, we review for an abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s decision to respond to the jury\u2019s request and the form of that response. <em>United States v. Foster, </em>507 F.3d 233, 244 (4th Cir.2007). Likewise, a district court\u2019s decision not to provide a jury with a written copy of the instructions is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>353 F.3d 816, 818 &amp; nn. 2-3 (9th Cir.2003) (collecting cases). \u201cIn responding to a jury\u2019s request for clarification on a charge, the district court\u2019s duty is simply to respond to the jury\u2019s apparent source of confusion fairly and accurately without creating prejudice.\u201d <em>Foster, </em>507 F.3d at 244 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). \u201cThe particular words chosen, like the decision whether to issue any clarification at all, are left to the sound discretion of the district court,\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>62 F.3d 641, 646 (4th Cir.1995), and \u201c[a]n error requires reversal only if it is prejudicial in the context of the record as a whole.\u201d <em>Foster, </em>507 F.3d at 244.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Here, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion. The Kings identify no legal error in the district court\u2019s response to the jury\u2019s request for reinstruction, and the district court\u2019s comments primarily tracked the relevant portion of the court\u2019s original jury instructions, to which the Kings did not object. Accordingly, the record does not support the partiality the Kings suggest. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>136 F.3d 972, 977-78 (4th Cir.1998); <em>Smith, </em>62 F.3d at 645-46; <em>United States v. United Med. &amp; Surgical Supply Corp., </em>989 F.2d 1390 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Also unavailing is the Kings\u2019 reliance on <em>United States v. Van Dyke, </em>14 F.3d 415 (8th Cir.1994), and suggestion that the district court left the jury hopelessly confused, improperly deprived of written instructions, and biased by the court\u2019s comments during trial. Assuming for the sake of argument that the Kings\u2019 charges were as complicated as they claim, the jury never requested a full written copy of the jury instructions, and the Kings expressly agreed with the district court\u2019s refusal to provide such \u2014 a sharp break with the facts of <em>Van Dyke. See id. </em>at 423. Also unlike <em>Van Dyke, </em>the jury here did not seek further clarification following the district court\u2019s reinstruction, and thus there was no clear indication that the jury remained confused regarding the elements of the Kings\u2019 offenses. <em>Id.; see United States v. Burgess, </em>684 F.3d 445, 453-54 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 490, 184 L.Ed.2d 308 (2012); <em>see also United States v. Glover, </em>681 F.3d 411, 423 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 548, 184 L.Ed.2d 356 (2012), <em>and </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 559, 184 L.Ed.2d 356 (2012), <em>and </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 568, 184 L.Ed.2d 370 (2012); <em>United States v. Sotelo, </em>97 F.3d 782, 792-93 (5th Cir.1996). Further, the record also belies the Kings\u2019 claim that the district court\u2019s comments during trial signaled incredulity of the Kings\u2019 defense. For these reasons, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in responding to the jury\u2019s request for reinstruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-15\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgments. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal conclusions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-16\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
