The district court sentenced Terry to 180 months\u2019 imprisonment. Terry appeals, challenging his enhanced sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) (2012). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-26\">Terry asserts that the district court erred by relying on his North Carolina convictions for breaking or entering, N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-54(a) (2011), to designate him an armed career criminal. Because Terry raises this claim for the first time on appeal, our review is for plain error. <em>United States v. Lynn, </em>592 F.3d 572, 577-78 (4th Cir.2010). To establish plain error, Terry must demonstrate that an error occurred, the error was plain, and the error affected his substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>at 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-27\">A defendant convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm who has three pri- or convictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses is subject to sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>as an armed career criminal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1); <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4B1.4 (2011). Terry contends that his prior North Carolina convictions for breaking or entering are not qualifying convictions for purposes of the ACCA. We have held to the contrary on several occasions. <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>588 F.3d 197, 202 (4th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>421 F.3d 278, 284 (4th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Bowden, </em>975 F.2d 1080, 1084-85 (4th Cir.1992). The Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013), does not affect our conclusion. Terry\u2019s North Carolina conviction for second-degree burglary also qualifies as an ACCA predicate. The elements of second-degree burglary in North Carolina clearly track the definition of \u201cgeneric burglary.\u201d <em>Descamps, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2283; <em>State v. Rick, </em>342 N.C. 91, 463 S.E.2d 182, 188 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">We therefore discern no error, plain or otherwise, in Terry\u2019s armed career criminal designation. Accordingly, we affirm his sentence. Terry\u2019s pro se motion to file a supplemental brief is denied. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this Court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b394-5\"> Terry does not dispute that his two North Carolina armed robbery convictions qualify as predicate offenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
