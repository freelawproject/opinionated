On appeal he raises two issues, whether his sentence: (1) was procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2012) factors raised by defense counsel and applied the same standard to reject his requests for a variance and departure, and (2) was substantively unreasonable because the court improperly balanced the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-23\">In reviewing a sentence, we must first ensure that the district court did not commit any \u201csignificant procedural error,\u201d such as failing to properly calculate the applicable Sentencing Guidelines range, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, or failing to adequately explain the sentence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number><em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Once we have determined that there is no procedural error, we must consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence, taking into account the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>If the sentence imposed is within the appropriate Guidelines range, it is presumptively reasonable. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). The presumption may be rebutted by a showing that the sentence is unreasonable when measured against the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court committed no procedural or substantive error in imposing Howell\u2019s sentence. Howell does not contest that the twenty-seven-month sentence he received was at the bottom of his properly calculated advisory Guidelines range. The court adequately explained why it rejected Howell\u2019s arguments for an eighteen-month sentence, which could have been achieved by a downward variance or departure. <em>See United States v. Diosdado-Star, </em>630 F.3d 359, 365-66 (4th Cir.2011).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> A district court has flexibility in fashioning a sentence even outside of the Guidelines range and need only set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that it has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for its decision. <em>Id. </em>at 364. Moreover, the court specifically addressed Howell\u2019s argument for lower sentence based on cultural assimilation. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2L1.2. comment., (n.8) (2012). Howell\u2019s sentence is substantively reasonable because it was imposed within his advisory Guidelines range and he has failed to show it was unreasonable based on application of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d at 379.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Accordingly, we affirm Howell\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b218-5\"> Howell is incorrect that the district court needed to apply a different standard to his request for a variance and departure. <em>See Diosdado-Star, </em>630 F.3d at 364-65 (noting that <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), did not indicate either a difference or preference between departures or variances, or comment upon the precise procedure of applying either).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
