Two prior lawsuits established that Smith is not entitled to \u00e1 salvage award under admiralty law and' that he has no legal right to excavate the supposed shipwreck. This is now the third lawsuit in which he seeks to litigate, through voluminous and increasingly convoluted pleadings, the issue of whether he can explore for the same shipwreck.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Defendants on nearly all of Smith\u2019s claims. The district court adopted in full the magistrate judge\u2019s comprehensive and well-reasoned October 26, 2012 Memorandum and Recommendation, which noted that almost all of Smith\u2019s claims depend on a determination that he has an ownership interest in the alleged ship. Because that issue has already been litigated in the two prior suits, however, the magistrate judge concluded that Smith is now barred by collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, from relitigating the issue in this proceeding. Thus, all of Smith\u2019s claims depending on that issue were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-15\">For essentially the reasons assigned in the magistrate judge\u2019s careful Memorandum and Recommendation, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b593-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b593-11\">. The district court designated the partial judgment as final pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b), giving us jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Smith's only remaining claim, which is still before the district court, is one for legal malpractice against Defendants Richard Schwartz and the Law Office of Schwartz, Junnell, Greenberg and Oathout.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b593-27\">. These orders are the district court\u2019s November 16, 2012 order adopting the magistrate judge's October 26, 2012 memorandum and recommendation; the district court\u2019s November 16, 2012 preclusion order barring Smith from filing any more complaints or actions on the alleged shipwreck without prior leave of court; and the district court's May 1, 2013 order granting certain defendants\u2019 motions for entry of final judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
