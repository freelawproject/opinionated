We have thoroughly reviewed the record, including the evidence relevant to country conditions in China, the transcript of He\u2019s merits hearing, and He\u2019s supporting affidavit and exhibits. We conclude that the record evidence does not compel a ruling contrary to any of the administrative factual findings, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (2012), and that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s decision. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Accordingly, we deny the petition for review for the reasons stated by the Board. <em>See In re: He </em>(B.I.A. Feb. 7, 2013). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
