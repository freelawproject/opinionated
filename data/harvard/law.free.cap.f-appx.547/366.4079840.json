We have reviewed the record and the Board\u2019s order and conclude that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a), (b) (2013). We therefore deny the petition for review. <em>See In re: Gomes </em>(B.I.A.Feb.27, 2013). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
