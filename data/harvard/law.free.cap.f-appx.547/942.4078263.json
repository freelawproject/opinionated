After a thorough review of the record and briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-18\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b969-19\">A. Attempted Firearm Purchase</p>\n<p id=\"b969-20\">In November 2011, Defendant Cameron and Allison Gornail visited Shooters of Jacksonville (\u201cShooters\u201d), a store that sells firearms and ammunition. Cameron and Gornail spoke with the store manager. Gornail expressed an interest in purchasing an AK-47 assault rifle <em>for herself.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b969-21\">The store manager suspected that Gornail was actually purchasing the firearm for Cameron, and not for her own personal use, because Gornail did not know why she was buying the firearm, whereas Cameron was very knowledgeable about the firearm. After Cameron attempted to pay for the firearm, the store manager asked Camer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>on to fill out a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives Form 4478 (\u201cATF form\u201d), which has to be completed before an individual can buy a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">The ATF form requires a buyer of a firearm to provide his name and address and state whether the buyer is the \u201cactual transferee/buyer\u201d of the firearm. The ATF form also includes a warning, which provides that \u201c[y]ou are not the actual buyer if you are acquiring the firearm(s) on behalf of another person. If you are not the actual buyer, the dealer cannot transfer the firearm(s) to you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">Question lli of the ATF form asks whether the buyer, here Defendant Cameron, has a conviction for a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. The instructions for question Hi of the ATF form set forth the statutory definition of a \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If a buyer represents on the ATF form that he has a conviction for a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, the buyer is disqualified from buying a firearm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">In filling out the ATF form, Defendant Cameron represented that he, and not Gornail, was the actual transferee/buyer of the AK-47. Cameron also represented that he had never been convicted in a court of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. Finally, Cameron certified that his answers on the ATF form were true and correct and that he read and understood the notices, instructions, and definitions on the form.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-9\">After Defendant Cameron completed the form, Shooters conducted a background check of Cameron through the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (\u201cFDLE\u201d). The FDLE reported that Cameron was ineligible to buy the firearm. Thus, Shooters could not sell Cameron the firearm. Once Cameron and Gornail left Shooters, the store manager notified law enforcement about Cameron\u2019s attempt to purchase the AK-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-10\">B. Indictment and Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b970-11\">A federal grand jury returned an indictment charging Cameron with making a false or fictitious statement to a federally licensed firearm dealer. The indictment alleged that, on the ATF form that Cameron completed at Shooters, Cameron falsely represented that he had not been convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-12\">At Cameron\u2019s trial, a government witness testified that, in November 2004, Cameron pled guilty to actually and intentionally touching or striking a family or household member, against her will or intentionally causing bodily harm to that person, in violation of Fla. Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 784.03 and 741.28. There was no objection to this testimony. The government introduced into evidence the information charging Cameron with domestic battery and the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-13\">Later at trial, Cameron testified in his own defense that, in November 2011, Gornail asked for his assistance in purchasing a firearm for her protection. He went <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>with Gornail to Shooters to assist her in purchasing a firearm. Cameron also intended to pay for the firearm Gornail selected. At the store, once Cameron indicated that he would pay for the firearm, a Shooters employee asked Cameron to fill out an ATF form. Cameron testified that, on the ATF form, he represented that he was the actual transferee/buyer of the firearm because he believed that, if he did not make that representation, Shooters would not complete the firearm sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">Cameron further testified that, on the ATF form, he represented that he did not have a prior conviction for a misdemeanor domestic violence conviction because the documents in his possession showed that he only had a prior conviction for battery, not <em>domestic </em>battery.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Furthermore, prior to pleading guilty to what he now knew was domestic battery, he only \u201cvaguely\u201d remembered the judge explaining to him the details about the charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">On cross-examination, the government asked Cameron about the events of October 6, 2004, the date of the domestic battery. At side bar, Cameron\u2019s counsel objected to the government eliciting the underlying details of the domestic battery offense because Cameron had admitted he committed the battery. Cameron\u2019s counsel stated that it was \u201cirrelevant and overly prejudicial to get into the details of the battery.\u201d The district court requested that the government first ask questions that related to Frison\u2019s relationship with Cameron and whether Cameron admitted to having committed the battery. The court stated that, depending on Cameron\u2019s answers, the government might not need to address the underlying conduct that constituted the battery. Following the court\u2019s resolution of his objection, Cameron stated \u201c[o]kay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b971-9\">The government thus asked Cameron whether he recalled committing a battery on Mikeisha Frison on October 6, 2004, and he answered affirmatively. Cameron clarified that he did not know at the time of the 2011 attempted firearm purchase that he had committed a <em>domestic </em>battery, because he thought that he and Frison had to be \u201cofficial boyfriend and girlfriend\u201d for his actions toward Frison to constitute domestic battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-10\">Cameron affirmed that he now knew, \u201cif you batter the mother of your child, that ... is domestic battery.\u201d At the time of the battery, Cameron, however, was uncertain as to whether he was the father of Frison\u2019s child. Cameron claimed that, although he had never contested paternity, he had doubts as to whether he was actually the child\u2019s father because Frison had cheated on him. Nevertheless, on the date of the battery, Cameron knew that, \u201cat least, according to the child\u2019s mother, the birth certificate and anybody else who had ever been told,\u201d he was the father of Fri-son\u2019s child. The government then asked whether Frison was pregnant with Cameron\u2019s second child at the time of the battery, and Cameron responded affirmatively-</p>\n<p id=\"b971-11\">Cameron also testified that he recalled being charged with two offenses in connection with the October 2004 incident. Cameron conceded that his public defender offered Cameron a plea bargain with respect to one of the charges, which was a felony charge, but he did not want to take that offer. The following exchange then occurred between the government and Cam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>eron, which led to this discussion of the details of the battery:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-4\">Q. And why didn\u2019t you want to take the offer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-5\">A. At the time, I felt since I called the police, that I wasn\u2019t wrong. But apparently in those situations, I\u2019m wrong, regardless of who actually called the police.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-6\">Q. You\u2019re not denying that you struck Mikeisha Frison on October 6th, 2004, are you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-7\">A. I\u2019m not denying it. She had a bruise. I can\u2019t say when it became apart, but she had a bruise and, subsequently, we were struggling at a point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASj\">Q. Okay. You were struggling and fighting with her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-8\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b972-9\">Cameron, however, did not subsequently object to the government\u2019s questions or move to strike his responsive testimony. On appeal, Cameron argues that the district court abused its discretion in admitting this discussion of the details of the battery.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b972-10\">C. Jury Instructions and Excused Juror</p>\n<p id=\"b972-11\">Following closing arguments, the district court instructed the jury. The court cautioned that the jury could consider Cameron\u2019s prior domestic battery only to determine \u201cwhether the elements of the offense charged against the Defendant in the indictment have been established. The fact that the Defendant was previously found guilty of another crime does not mean that he committed the crime for which he is on trial here.\u201d The court further cautioned, \u201c[y]ou must not consider this prior conviction for any purpose other than to establish the existence of the prior conviction.\u201d The court also cautioned the jury that Cameron was on <em>trial11 only </em>for the specific crime charged in the indictment\u201d and that the jury was only to determine whether Cameron was guilty or not guilty of the specific crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-17\">The district court sent the jury home for the evening with deliberations set to begin the next day. When the district court reconvened proceedings the next morning, it announced that a juror had received a Facebook friend request from Cameron the night before. According to the juror, she had not accepted the request or viewed Cameron\u2019s Facebook profile page. Nevertheless, the juror found the friend request unsettling. Therefore, the district court excused the juror and replaced her with an alternate juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-18\">D. Verdict and Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b972-19\">The jury deliberated and found Cameron guilty of making a false or fictitious statement to a federally licensed firearm dealer.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-20\">The probation officer prepared a Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d), stating that Cameron\u2019s base offense level was 20, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1. The probation officer applied a two-level increase for obstruction of justice, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, based on Cameron using his personal Facebook account to contact one of the jurors hearing his case. With no further adjustments, Cameron\u2019s total offense level was 22, and his criminal history category was III. His advisory guidelines range was 51 to 68 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-21\">In his written objections and at sentencing, Cameron objected to the two-level en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>hancement for obstruction of justice, arguing that he lacked the \u201cspecific intent to obstruct justice,\u201d necessary for application of the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">The district court found that Cameron obstructed justice by willfully sending a Facebook friend request to a juror who was preparing to deliberate in his trial. The district court thus overruled Cameron\u2019s objection and applied the obstruction-of-justice enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">The district court further stated that, even if Cameron had not sent the Face-book friend request, his trial testimony was sufficient to support the obstruction-of-justice enhancement because he made at least two material false statements during his testimony. First, Cameron testified that Gornail was actually purchasing the firearm, and second, he testified that he did not know that he had a prior domestic violence conviction. The district court concluded that both statements were clearly false and were rejected by the jury. Further, Cameron did not make the false statements as a result of confusion or mistake, but rather with the intent to mislead the jury. The court determined that these false statements independently warranted the obstruction-of-justice enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">The district court adopted the advisory guidelines range set forth in the PSI and sentenced Cameron to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment. Afterwards, Cameron\u2019s counsel stated that Cameron maintained his objection to the obstruction-of-justice enhancement. However, Cameron\u2019s counsel did not specifically object to the court\u2019s alternative basis for imposing the enhancement. Cameron now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b973-9\">A. Admissibility of Evidence about Domestic Battery Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b973-10\">On appeal, Cameron argues that the district court abused its discretion by allowing the government to introduce the details of his 2004 domestic battery conviction because those details were irrelevant and unduly prejudicial. According to Cameron, the only relevant issue at trial was whether Cameron knew that the conviction was for a <em>domestic </em>battery, and thus, the evidence should have been limited to discussion of the relationship between himself and Frison.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-12\">We generally review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Turner, </em>474 F.3d 1265, 1275 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-13\">Once a defendant voluntarily testifies on his own behalf, he may be cross-examined as to (1) matters \u201creasonably related\u201d to the subject matter of the direct examination, and (2) matters affecting credibility. <em>United States v. Pilcher, </em>672 F.2d 875, 877 (11th Cir.1982) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-14\">Only relevant evidence is admissible, and Federal Rule of Evidence 401 defines \u201crelevant evidence\u201d as evidence having any tendency to make a fact of consequence more or less probable than it would be without the evidence. Fed.R.Evid. 401, 402. A party\u2019s concession as to a matter sought to be proved in a case may, at times, call for the exclusion of evidence offered to prove the point conceded. <em>Old Chief v. United States, </em>519 U.S. 172, 184, 117 S.Ct. 644, 652, 136 L.Ed.2d 574 (1997); <em>see </em>Fed.R.Evid. 401 advisory committee\u2019s notes, 1972 Proposed Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-16\">Such a ruling, or exclusion, however, should be made on the basis of such considerations as waste of time and undue prejudice under Federal Rule of Evidence 403, rather than under any general requirement that evidence is admissible only where it is in dispute. <em>Old Chief, </em>519 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>at 184, 117 S.Ct. at 652; <em>see </em>Fed.R.Evid. 401 advisory committee\u2019s notes, 1972 Proposed Rules. Rule 403 permits a court to \u201cexclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of one or more of the following: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">\u201cRule 403 is an extraordinary remedy which should be used only sparingly since it permits the trial court to exclude concededly probative evidence. In criminal trials relevant evidence is inherently prejudicial. Thus, the rule permits exclusion only when unfair prejudice substantially outweighs probative value.\u201d <em>United States v. Merrill, </em>513 F.3d 1293, 1301 (11th Cir.2008) (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cIn doubtful cases, \u2018the balance under Rule 403 should be struck in favor of admissibility.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Gibson, </em>708 F.3d 1256, 1282 (11th Cir.) (brackets omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>(U.S. Oct. 7, 2013) (No. 13-5826). Limiting instructions minimize the prejudicial effect of evidence. <em>United States v. Fortenberry, </em>971 F.2d 717, 721 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">Here, evidence of the details of the October 2004 domestic battery was relevant under Rule 401, regardless of whether Cameron conceded that he committed a battery against Frison. <em>See Old Chief, </em>519 U.S. at 184, 117 S.Ct. at 652. Cameron testified that he struck Frison, that he struggled and fought with Frison, that Fri-son was pregnant at that time, and that Frison was bruised during the battery. This evidence was relevant as to Cameron\u2019s credibility and to establish that Cameron knowingly and falsely represented on the ATF form that he did not have a misdemeanor offense of domestic battery in relation to the October 2004 incident. Evidence showing that Cameron had actually committed the elements of a domestic battery offense, that is, he had struck Fri-son, who was pregnant with his child at that time, made it more probable that, at the time he filled out the ATF form, he knew he had been convicted of domestic battery not just battery, notwithstanding his direct testimony that he was unaware that he had a conviction for domestic battery. <em>See </em>Fed.RJBvid. 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-7\">Moreover, the details of the 2004 domestic battery offense had a high probative value that was not substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice, such that the district court should have found the evidence inadmissible. <em>See Merrill, </em>513 F.3d at 1301. On cross-examination, Cameron testified that he had doubts as to whether Frison was the mother of one of his children, and thus, the government elicited further details about his relationship with Frison, including that she was pregnant with his second child at the time of the domestic battery, in order to show the domestic nature of Cameron\u2019s relationship with Frison. Further, Cameron testified that he was unwilling to plead guilty to any crime in connection with the battery incident because he believed that he had not committed any wrongful act against Fri-son, and this testimony placed in dispute whether Cameron had actually committed a battery against Frison.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-8\">Any unfair prejudice resulting from Cameron\u2019s testimony of the details of the domestic battery offense was slight, as the jury had already heard the unobjected-to testimony of a government witness providing that Cameron had pled guilty to either intentionally touching or striking Frison against her will or causing her bodily harm. In addition, Cameron volunteered that Frison had a bruise and that he struggled with Frison before the government asked any specific questions as to these details. Finally, the district court\u2019s limit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>ing instructions minimized any prejudice arising from the jury hearing the details of the domestic battery conviction. <em>See Fortenberry, </em>971 F.2d at 721. We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the admission of the details of the domestic battery offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">B. Obstruction-of-Justice Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">Cameron argues that the district court clearly erred in finding the government\u2019s evidence sufficient to support the two-level obstruction-of-justice enhancement under \u00a7 3C1.1 based on his sending a Facebook friend request to a juror. Cameron claims the evidence did not show that his conduct was willful and thus was insufficient to show obstruction of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-7\">In reviewing the district court\u2019s application of an obstruction-of-justice sentencing enhancement, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its application of the sentencing guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Doe, </em>661 F.3d 550, 565 (11th Cir.2011), <em>cert denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 1648, 182 L.Ed.2d 242 (2012). The government bears the burden of proving the facts needed to support a sentencing enhancement by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Turner, </em>626 F.3d 566, 572 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-10\">Section 3C1.1 of the sentencing guidelines provides a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice where \u201cthe defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice with respect to the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. The enhancement applies where the defendant, <em>inter alia, </em>(1) directly or indirectly threatens, intimidates, or otherwise unlawfully influences, a juror, or attempts to do so, or (2) commits perjury. <em>Id., </em>comment, (n. 4). Where the enhancement is based on a defendant\u2019s commission of perjury, a district court must find that the elements of perjury are satisfied. <em>United States v. Ellisor, </em>522 F.3d 1255, 1276 (11th Cir.2008). A witness testifying under oath commits perjury where he gives false testimony concerning a material matter with the willful intent to provide false testimony, rather than as a result of confusion, mistake, or faulty memory. <em>Id. </em>at 1277 n. 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-12\">Cameron challenges the district court\u2019s imposition of a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice based on a finding that he willfully attempted to obstruct the administration of justice by sending a juror a Facebook friend request on the eve of deliberations. The district court based the enhancement on this finding, but it also alternatively based the enhancement on the finding that Cameron committed perjury at trial by making at least two materially false statements when he testified that (1) the firearm was not actually being purchased for him, and (2) he did not know his prior conviction was for domestic battery. The district court found that these statements were not made as a result of confusion or mistake, but rather were made with the intent to mislead the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-13\">Although Cameron argues that the district court clearly erred in imposing the enhancement on the basis of the Facebook friend request sent to a juror, he does not challenge on appeal the district court\u2019s independent alternative basis for the enhancement that he committed perjury by making two materially false statements during his trial. This finding was sufficient to support the application of the enhancement, and by failing to address this finding in his initial brief Cameron has abandoned it on appeal. <em>See United States v. Jemigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1283 n. 8 (11th Cir.2003) (holding that issues not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>raised in an appellant\u2019s initial brief are deemed abandoned). Thus, we uphold the application of the obstruction-of-justice enhancement on the basis of the district court\u2019s alternative finding that Cameron committed perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">Alternatively, we also conclude there is no merit to Cameron\u2019s claims that there was insufficient evidence to support the obstruction-of-justice enhancement. The record evidence adequately supported the district court\u2019s findings both as to the Facebook friend request and as to the perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm Cameron\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b970-7\">.
