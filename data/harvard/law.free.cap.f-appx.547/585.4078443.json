He argues that his remedy under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 for challenging his wire fraud convictions is inadequate and ineffective because this court, after partially granting him a certificate of appealability on an issue raised in his \u00a7 2255 motion, remanded his case to the district court instead of addressing his appeal and reversing his convictions. He also complains that the district court did not address his claim of actual innocence. Finally, he argues that it was proper for him to raise his claims in a \u00a7 2241 petition because he is challenging the fact and duration of his unconstitutional confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-23\">As a general rule, a federal prisoner who seeks to collaterally challenge the legality of his conviction or sentence must file a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 426-27 (5th Cir.2005). Such claims may be raised in a \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) only if the prisoner shows that the \u00a7 2255 remedy is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d \u00a7 2255(e). Hills has not made such a showing as he has not established that his claims are based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision establishing that he was convicted of a nonexistent offense. <em>See Padilla, </em>416 F.3d at 426-27; <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-24\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Hills\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition is AFFIRMED. Hills\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b611-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
