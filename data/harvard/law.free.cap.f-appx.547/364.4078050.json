Kubinski appeals <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> the district court\u2019s orders denying him relief under Fed.R.Crim.P. 35 (1990) (\u201cold Rule 35\u201d) and denying his postjudgment motion under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e). Our review of the record convinces us that Kubinski was properly sentenced under the federal Sentencing Guidelines, and that he is not entitled to relief under old Rule 35. Therefore, the district court did not err in denying relief under old Rule 35 or in declining to alter or amend the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">In any event, the claims Kubinski asserts are more properly raised under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp.2013), but because he has already challenged the convictions in question under \u00a7 2255, he cannot file a second or successive motion without authorization from this Court. In accordance with Circuit authority, we have construed Kubinski\u2019s notice of appeal and informal brief as an application to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200, 208 (4th Cir.2003). In order to obtain authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, a prisoner must assert claims based on either:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-16\">(1) newly discovered evidence that ... would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty of the offense; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-17\">(2) a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-18\">28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255(h). Kubinski\u2019s claims do not satisfy either of these criteria. Therefore, we deny authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-19\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-20\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b391-12\"> We reject the Government's claim that Kubinski\u2019s notice of appeal is untimely. <em>See MLC Auto., LLC v. Town of S. Pines, </em>532 F.3d 269, 279 (4th Cir.2008) (''[Djesignation of a post-judgment motion in the notice of appeal is adequate to support a review of the final judgment when the intent to do so is clear.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
