The referee had also so found, however the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board had reversed the referee and reinstated an award of 30 degrees for 20 percent loss of use of claimant\u2019s right leg. The Fund concedes the partial disability to the leg and prays that the order of the Board be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">Claimant, when injured, was a 44-year-old timber faller and bucker. In January, 1973, in the course of his work, he received a blow to his right knee. He lost no work time, but he continued to have discomfort in the knee. In December, 1973, again in the course of work, he suffered a more severe injury to his right knee. Surgery was performed to correct a tear in the cartilage about the knee joint. Six weeks after surgery, claimant returned to work, but he was unable to continue on the job because of pain in the joints of both knees, both feet, both wrists and all fingers, caused by rheumatoid arthritis.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Causation is the issue. The award below is based upon a finding that the industrial injury was a substantial cause of the general rheumatoid arthritic condition. That factual issue requires an evaluation of the credibility of the contradictory evidence of two physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Dr. W. J. McHolick, an orthopedic surgeon, was claimant\u2019s treating physician. He reports that claimant\u2019s arthritic condition had preexisted for \"a number of years\u201d without requiring treatment, that it was \"totally unrelated to the industrial injury,\u201d and that the knee injury had healed following surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">Dr. Robert E. Rinehart, a specialist in treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, examined claimant in June, 1975, a year-and-a-half after the second injury. His report and testimony indicate that there is growing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>medical recognition that chronic muscle stress and fatigue can cause rheumatoid arthritis, although he also acknowledges a \"considerable disagreement\u201d among physicians as to the nature and degree of stress required to generate arthritis. He disputes Dr. McHolick\u2019s observation of preexisting arthritis. Instead, he concludes that the chronic stress on the knee, beginning with the January, 1973, injury, \"initiated\u201d the arthritic condition. The more severe knee injury of December, 1973, he concludes, was an acute stress which aggravated the preexisting non-symptomatic arthritis throughout the body in an \"explosive\u201d manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-3\">The claimant has the burden of proving that the industrial injury to one part of the body is also the cause of the disabling condition of other parts of the body, <em>Fisher v. Consolidated Freightways, </em>12 Or App 417, 507 P2d 53 (1973), or, in this case, that the injury to the knee was a cause of the arthritic condition of the other knee and leg, both wrists and all fingers.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">In light of the general and speculative nature of Dr. Rinehart\u2019s conclusions, and of the contradictory evidence given hy claimant\u2019s treating physician, Dr. McHolick, we find that the claimant has not established by a preponderance of evidence a causal relationship between the blow to claimant\u2019s knee and the arthritic condition in the rest of his body. Based upon the concession by the Fund, we find in accordance with the Board\u2019s order that claimant has suffered permanent partial disability of 30 degrees loss of use of claimant\u2019s right leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
