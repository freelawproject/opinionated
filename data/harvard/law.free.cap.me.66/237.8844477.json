J.</author>\n<p id=\"At1\">This was an action to recover damages for an assault upon the female plaintiff. The plaintiffs obtained a verdict and the defendant filed a motion for a new trial, and the cause was continued. After the continuance, and before judgment, the parties settled ; and the plaintiffs\u2019 claim was discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">The attorney, by whom the suit had been successfully prosecuted, claims that the demand had been assigned to him, and that this assignment was made before or at the commencement of the suit. But the demand was not assignable. It has been repeatedly held that a claim for damages for a personal assault cannot be assigned before final judgment. <em>McGlinchy </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>58 Maine, 152. <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>1 Allen, 566.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-12\">The lien of an attorney does not attach until the rendition of judgment. <em>Young </em>v. <em>Dearborn, </em>27 N.
