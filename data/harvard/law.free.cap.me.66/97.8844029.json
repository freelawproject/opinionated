An agreement to find help in such case, is an agreement to furnish manual labor, not to pay for the use of such an implement.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-8\">On report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-9\">Assumpsit, for removing pianos in the city of Bangor, under a contract by which the plaintiff was to move the pianos and the defendant to find help and to pay 75 cents each.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-10\">The account annexed contained about 1,200 items for moving pianos and organs covering a period from February 4, 1869, to June 13, 1873.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-11\">The case was sent to an auditor who reported that exclusive of two items there was due from the defendants to the plaintiff at the date of the writ the sum of $673.25. The defendants were defaulted for that amount, with leave on the part of the plaintiff to have the default taken off and the case stand for trial if in the opinion of the court upon the plaintiff\u2019s testimony he is entitled to more.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-12\">The plaintiff claimed pay for two items not covered by the auditor\u2019s report; 1st. Interest at 6 per cent to July 1, 1873, $121.74. 2nd. Use of piano rigging from August 13, 1870, in moving 451 pianos, 50 cents each, $225.50.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-13\">The plaintiff testified in substance, that he procured certain rigging, trucks, and a harness of his own invention, to be used by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>men, by which the pianos could be moved more easily in and out of houses and up and down stairs; that he thereby saved to the defendants, the cost and labor of one or two men in moving each piano ; that he had several conversations in regard to the adjustment of the account before the commencement of the action.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b98-4\"><em>F.

The plaintiff was a truckman and the defendants were dealers in pianos; and all the charges in the plaintiff\u2019s writ, except those reserved for the determination of the court, were for removing pianos and organs.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">The auditor reported that the contract bet.ween the parties was that all the pianos within city limits should be moved for seventy-five cents a piece. The evidence shows that the defendants agreed to \u201cfind help\u201d for removing the pianos, and that they did so in several instances. In such cases the defendants either paid the assistants directly, or they were paid by the plaintiff who charged the several sums to the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">By the defendants\u2019 agreement \u201cto find help\u201d they were bound to furnish such manual-labor on request as the plaintiff might reasonably need in addition to his own services in order to accomplish the work' of removal. If they had refused to do so, the plaintiff had the alternative of .abandoning the contract, or employing the necessary help for its fulfillment and charging the amount paid therefor to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-11\">The evidence does not show that the defendants neglected or refused to find help when requested to do so; nor is there now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>any controversy between the parties as to the amount paid for help by the plaintiff. The charge in the writ that we are called upon to consider is \u201cfor use of piano rigging.\u201d It appears in evidence that in order to facilitate the work of removal the plaintiff invented, made and used an apparatus which cost about $25. For the use of this apparatus he has charged fifty cents in each instance, amounting in all to $225.50. The testimony shows that the use of \u201cthe piano rigging\u201d saved considerable manual labor\u2014 the witnesses differing somewhat in their estimate of the amount thus saved.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">Yfe do not think that the plaintiff is entitled to recover upon this item in his account. The agreement was to find help, that is, manual labor. There was no agreement express or implied to pay for the use of apparatus of any kind ; no mention was made of the piano rigging. The testimony shows that the defendants had a contrivance of their own which they used to advantage for the same purpose. It is reasonable to suppose that they would have made provision for the use of their own implement, if they had contemplated that they would be liable for the use of any such gear. The damages for failing \u201cto find help\u201d a,re direct and easy to be ascertained; they are what it reasonably cost the plaintiff \u201cto find the help\u201d himself. On the contrary, the method of ascertaining the value of the use of the piano rigging is indirect and secondary; involving, in the first place, the cost of the help the defendants were required to furnish, and then the amount saved by the use of the apparatus. The use of the piano rigging was made at the plaintiff\u2019s own motion and risk, and entirely outside of the contract; the minds of the parties never met in any agreement express or implied, to pay for its use ; and there is no implication of law arising from the facts in this case that renders the defendants liable therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">\u25a0 The elements necessary to entitle the plaintiff to interest on the items in his account are wanting. There was no agreement to pay interest, nor was there any demand of payment, or what would be equivalent thereto. <em>Default to stand.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b99-6\">AppletoN, C.
