One of the notes was dated August 31, 1836, payable on demand; and the other was dated Sept. 12, 1836, payable in six months.

K. S., c. 81, \u00a7 86.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-6\">Witnessed notes secured by mortgage of real estate are barred by our statute of limitations in twenty years after they become payable, while the mortgage security is not deemed to be within any branch of the statute of limitations. The lapse of twenty years from the accruing of the indebtment is only a presumption that the mortgage had been satisfied, which may be removed by circumstances tending to produce a contrary presumption. <em>Joy </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>26 Maine, 330 (see pp. 332, 333.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-7\">The twenty years limitations in R. S., c. 81, \u00a7 86, is an absolute bar to an action upon promissory notes signed in the presence of an attesting witness, as defined in section 83 of the same chapter. <em>Brevjer </em>v. <em>Thornes, </em>28 Maine, 81, 84.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-8\">Had the legislature intended the six and the twenty years limitations mentioned in R. S., c. 81, \u00a7\u00a7 79, 83, 86, as presumptions or proof of <em>\u2022prima facie </em>payments on the contracts and causes of action named in these sections, it would have used language similar to that used in section ninety-seven relative to judgments and decrees of the court of record of the United States, or any state or of a trial justice, which, as the section reads, \u201cshall be presumed to be paid and satisfied at the expiration of twenty years after any duty or obligations accrued by virtue of such judgment or decrees.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-9\">If the plaintiff would avoid the statute bar, he must prove a new promise within twenty years next preceding the date of his writ.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b443-10\"><em>D.

J., from the opinion of the court in <em>Howe </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>38 Maine, 350. \u201cThe only limitation applicable to this note is that of twenty years. The application of that limitation, as an effectual bar, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>may be avoided by proof that would rebut \u25a0 the presumption arising from the common law after the lapse of twenty years.\u201d</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b444-4\"><em>Virgin, </em>J.</author>\n<p id=\"ACHc\">This being an \u201caction on a promissory note signed in the presence of an attesting witness,\u201d by the express terms of E. S., c. 81, \u00a7 83, none of the limitations provided in \u00a7\u00a7 79 to 83, apply to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">It is, however, subject to the general twenty years limitation of \u00a7 86, inasmuch as it is a \u201cpersonal action on a contract, not limited by any of the foregoing sections or other law of the state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Section 85, unlike \u00a7 97, (pertaining to actions on judgments of certain courts therein specified) is not founded upon a presumption of payment liable to be rebutted by evidence ; but its object, based on public policy, is to close the judicial tribunals against all contracts therein described commenced after the cause of action is twenty years old. The language is peremptory, that the action \u201cshall be commenced within twenty years after the cause of action accrues.\u201d The phrase \u201cand not afterwards\u201d found in \u00a7 79 adds nothing ; and if it were appended to \u00a7 86 would not affect its meaning j for as now expressed it is equivalent to a provision that no action shall be commenced after twenty years. In the absence of any partial payment, the twenty years begin to run from the time when the note is <em>payable; </em>but when such a payment has been made, whether indorsed or not, then, so far as the one who made the payment is concerned, the limitation re-commences at the date of that. <em>Estes </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>30 Maine, 164. <em>Howe </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>38 Maine, 350. <em>Quimby </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>28 Maine, 419. <em>Sibley </em>v. <em>Lumbert, </em>30 Maine, 253. <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>34 Maine, 33. R. S., c. 81, \u00a7 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">In an action of debt upon a judgment, to which the statute of limitations was pleaded, this court said : \u201cIf the legislature had intended the presumption should stand uncontrolled by the evidence, it would have fixed an absolute bar of twenty years, by way of limitation, as it has done by \u00a7 11, (\u00a7 86 present revision,) of the same chapter, in relation to actions on contracts, not limited by any of the other foregoing sections, or any other law of the state.\u201d <em>Brewer </em>v. <em>Thomes, </em>28 Maine, 81, 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">So in a writ of entry brought upon a mortgage of real estate, given to secure certain promissory notes, Whitman, C. J., said: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>\u201cThe defense rest upon the presumption of payment by the mort-gageors, arising from the lapse of time since the debt secured by the mortgage became payable. The notes given therefor, although witnessed, are unquestionably barred by our statute of limitations, c. 146, \u00a7 11,\u201d (\u00a7 86 present revision.) <em>Joy </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>26 Maine, 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">In <em>Howe </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>38 Maine, 352, Shepley, C. J., intimates a different view by saying : \u201cThe only limitation applicable to this note, is that of twenty years, \u00a7 11. The application of that limitation, as an effectual bar, may be avoided by proof that would rebut the presumption arising from the common law after the lapse of twenty years and he cites two cases of actions brought on judgments. Those cases could not support the proposition, however, for they gave a construction to \u00a7 97 pertaining to, actions on judgments. And the next succeeding sentence in the opinion referred to, shows that the eminent jurist who wrote it did not intend to express his deliberate judgment upon this question. At best it was a <em>dictum, </em>the question then before the court being as to the effect of a partial payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">The provision now under consideration first appeared in the statute in this state in the revision of 1841. A similar provision first appeared in Massachusetts, in the revision of the statutes of that commonwealth adopted in 1836. It was added by the legislature, after the draft of the commissioners had been submitted to the legislature by the legislative committee. <em>Von Hemert </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>11 Met. 210, 216. And whenever the provision has been before the court there, it has been considered an absolute bar. <em>Penny </em>v. <em>Eddy, </em>22 Pick. 533, 534. <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Bowden, </em>23 Pick. 282. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Swift, </em>3 Met. 390. <em>Bancroft </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>6 Cush. 493. <em>Prescott </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>8 Cush. 365, 366.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b445-7\">AppletoN, C.
