But the plaintiff did allege, substantially in the language of the statute, the doing by the defendant of the very acts for which B. S., c. 95, \u00a7 11, gives the injured party the right to recover in an action of trespass a sum equal to three times the value of the property taken ; and he alleges that these acts were done \u201cagainst the form of the statute in. such case made and provided.\u201d This was abundantly sufficient to inform the defendant of the nature and extent of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">It was not essential to conclude the declaration with the words, \u201cagainst the form\u201d &amp;c. <em>Smith </em>v. Montgomery, 52 Maine, 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">The action and statute are remedial and not penal. <em>Frohock </em>v. <em>Pattee, </em>38 Maine, 103. <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Clapp, </em>12 Cush. 278.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">Nor is the plaintiff required specifically to allege that he is entitled to treble damages for the acts complained of <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Worthington, </em>12 Pick. 571. <em>Worster </em>v. <em>Proprietors of Canal Bridge, </em>16 Pick. 541. The character of the acts charged sufficiently distinguishes the suit from one brought under \u00a7 9 of the same chapter.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-11\">Nor is it necessary under the statute to allege a <em>scienter </em>on the part of the defendant. He is bound at his peril to know that he has the consent of the owner before entering upon improved lands and taking property of this description.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-12\">The language of the statute is general and comprehensive, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>no reference is made to any particular class, such as the court thought sufficient in <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Davis et al., </em>8 Pick. 513, to relieve those differently situated from a liability to treble damages. If our legislature had designed to limit \u00a7 11 to cases of willful and malicious trespass, they would have said so. The jury having been directed to find single damages, the proper course was for the judge to order judgment for thrice the amount of the verdict. <em>Lobdell </em>v. <em>New </em>Bedford, 1 Mass. 153. <em>Quimby </em>v.
