If, however, the case shows that the commis; sioners had no jurisdiction of the particular matter, their adjudication thereon would be without the authority of law; and the party affected thereby has the right to have the record quashed on proper proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">No person is entitled to apply to the county commissioners for an abatement of his tax, unless, after due notice, he brought into the assessors a true and perfect list of his taxable estate, or makes it appear to the commissioners that he was unable to do so. R. S., c. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 65, 66. <em>Lambard </em>v. <em>Co. Commissioners, </em>53 Maine, 505, 507.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">In the case at bar, the application of the tax-payer contained no allegation of these jurisdictional facts; and there is no pretense that he did \u201cbring in\u201d his list or that he was unable to do so. If they had existed, but were omitted from the record, the commissioners could have amended the record. <em>Dresden </em>v. <em>Co. Com., </em>62 Maine, 365. Then it would appear that no defect in fact existed, and therefore that no injustice by reason thereof was suffered. <em>Writ of certiorari to issue.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b387-7\">AppletoN, C.
