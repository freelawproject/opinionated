We think it can. Such is the express language of the statute. True, the court held in <em>Sidelinger </em>v. <em>Bucklin, </em>64 Maine, 371, that the complaint might be made before a tidal justice, because a trial justice is, <em>ex officio, </em>a justice of the peace. But the court did not decide that such a complaint must be made before a trial justice; nor do we think such a decision would be correct. We think the true construction of the statute is that such a complaint may be made, and the other preliminary proceedings had, before either a justice of the peace or a trial justice,\u2014before a justice of the peace, because such is the express language of the statute, and before a trial justice, because a trial justice is, <em>ex officio, </em>a justice of the peace.
