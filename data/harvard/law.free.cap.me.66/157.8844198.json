Neither a parcel of land nor a person can be so described as to preclude inquiry.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-4\">The true test is : \u201cCan a reasonably intelligent officer find and deliver seizin of the premises without going to the county records for aid.\u201d <em>Willey </em>v. <em>Nichols.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-5\">The description is certainly as good as, and we claim even better than, that sustained by this court in <em>Willey </em>v. <em>Nichols, </em>and by the court of Massachusetts in <em>Riley </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>9 Allen, 370, and in <em>Silloway </em>v. <em>Hale, </em>8 Allen, 61. See also <em>Proprietors of Ken-nebec Purchase </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>2 Maine, 149.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-6\">In <em>Chase </em>v. <em>McLellan, </em>49 Maine, 375, this court said: \u201cThe description should be such that those entitled to redeem should know with reasonable certainty what premises are intended.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-7\">In this case the party defending is the mortgageor himself, the description of which he complains is the very same description of the premises furnished by him to the plaintiff in his mortgage deed ; so that the premises are intelligently described to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-8\"><em>Reply. </em>The point decided in <em>Proprietors of Ken. Purchase </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>is that the general issue admitted possession by the tenant (page 154); he should have demurred. 2 Maine, 149. <em>Willey </em>v. <em>Nichols, </em>59 Maine, 253, is not applicable. There is just difference enough between <em>Chase </em>v. <em>McLellan, </em>49 Maine, 375, and this case to make the illustration complete.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-9\">\u201cNow occupied,\u201d \u201cbeing the former homestead of said Carleton S. Bragg.\u201d To illustrate. \u2014 A certain lot or parcel of land, &amp;c., situate in Stetson on the easterly side of Main street, being the former homestead of Lewis Barker. As matter of fact Lewis Barker has had four former homesteads in Stetson on the easterly side of Main street. <em>Non constat </em>but Carleton S. Bragg has had two or more homesteads on the easterly side of Ohio street. Which shall the officer deliver seizin of ? Inquiry would not avail him. If the adjective \u201clate\u201d instead of \u201cformer\u201d had been used, <em>possibly </em>it might have been sufficient.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b159-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Appleton, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ahz\">This is a writ of entry to which the tenant has demurred. The demurrer was overruled and the declaration adjudged good, to which ruling the tenant has filed exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">The demandant claims to recover \u201cthe possession of a certain lot or pra\u2019cel of land with the buildings thereon, situated in said Bangor, on the easterly side of Ohio street, being the former homestead of Oarleton S. Bragg, and being part of the premises conveyed by said Oarleton S. Bragg to the Bangor Savings Bank, by deed dated July 14, 1869, and recorded in Penobscot registry of deeds, book 391, p. 32; and is the part first described in said deed, and being the same premises conveyed by said Bank to the said Bebecca N. Bragg by deed dated October 5, 1870, and recorded in book 412, page 443 of said registry, and the same conveyed to said White by said Rebecca N. Bragg, by deed dated June 5, 1872,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Eliminating the references to the registry of deeds, the description is sufficient. The town in which, and the street, and the side of the street on which the lot of land in controversy is situated, are clearly stated. It is further described as \u201cthe former homestead of said Oarleton S. Bragg,\u201d of which \u201cthe demandant ought now to be in quiet possession,\u201d but into which \u201cthe said White hath since unjustly entered, and holds the plaintiff out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The objection taken is, that the description is not sufficiently definite, that the officer could not find the premises, and that the declaration should be so clear, that the officer need not be obliged to consult the records. But if there was no reference to the records, we cannot say, that the description is so fatally defective that the officer could not deliver seizin. <em>Riley </em>v. Smith, 9 Allen, 370. The \u201cformer homestead of Oarleton S. Bragg,\u201d with a description of the street, and the side of the street, gives as much description as is necessary. If the pleader had given monuments and distances, the officer must find the monuments at his peril, as here he must find \u201cthe former homestead of Bragg;\u201d which the officer could find with as much readiness as he could stake and stones. No indefiniteness as to the former homestead appears ; for nothing discloses that Bragg had but one; and the court cannot, as the counsel for the tenant have done, presume without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>evidence ; that he had an indefinite number of former residences, thereby to render the writ defective for its indefiniteness.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">\u201cThe property sued for may be described as a \u2018tract of land containing so many acres,\u2019 or \u2018so many acres of land,\u2019 or \u2018a certain messuage,\u2019 called by a particular name, by which it is known, or with the abuttals.\u201d Stearns on Neal Actions, 151. Here, the homestead of Bragg is one part of-the description, to which more is added to prevent mistakes.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">After all, the demurrer seems rather for, and on account of the officer, rather than of the tenant. But the tenant is not the protecting guardian of the officer. If the officer cannot find the land, it will be the misfortune of the demandant, not of the tenant. If he can find it, then the declaration is sufficient. <em>Silloway </em>v. <em>Hale, </em>8 Allen, 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Whatever the description may be, however precise and definite, the officer must find the land to which it applies \u2014 the messuage, if it be one; the monuments of the lot; the homestead ,\u2022 and if he errs, he becomes a trespasser. But inquiry will enable him to solve the difficulty as readily in the present case, as in any other. The land is in possession of the tenant ; it is the former homestead of Bragg, situated on the east side of Ohio street, in Bangor. If the officer fails to find it, the tenant will receive no harm. We apprehend the fear is, that he may find it. <em>Willey </em>v. <em>Nichols, </em>59 Maine, 253. <em>The Proprietors of Kennebec Purchase </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>2 Maine, 149.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">The allegation of disseisin is sufficient. Oliver\u2019s Precedents, 628. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">\n<em>Judgment for the demandant.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b160-9\">DiokersoN, Barrows, .YirgiN, Peters and Libbey, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
