I think the indictment good. 1 should regret the giving a sanction to what the defendant has done, by declaring it no offense. Wharton\u2019s Precedents, 417. 2 Archbold\u2019s Crim.

Tbe allegations in tbe indictment deny the possession of tbe defendant to be rightful. If the evidence does not so show, be will be entitled to acquittal.
