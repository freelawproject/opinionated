Leach appeared specially under protest, and said, \u201cthat this action was entered in this court at the January term, 1874; that thereafterwards Fulton died, and his death was duly suggested upon the docket at the April term, 1874; that thereafterwards, and before the appearance or appointment of any administrator \u2022 of said Fulton, Jane Nason died,, and her death was duly suggested upon the docket at the October term, 1874.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-9\">Whereupon he says that he cannot take upon himself the defense of this action, because no action is pending, and no statute compels his appearance therein.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-10\">The presiding justice overruled the protest, and ruled that Leach appear.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AA2A\">This is an action of assumpsit. During the pendency of the suit, both the plaintiff and the defendant have deceased. After 'the death of the parties had been suggested upon the docket, the administrator of the plaintiff entered his appearance, and claimed the right to further prosecute this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-14\">At common law, by the death of the parties, the suit would have abated. But by R. S., c. 82, \u00a7 80, the death of a party being suggested, his executor or administrator may become a party, or be summoned in to become a party, at the instance of the opposing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>party, when the cause of action survives. The statute applies to plaintiff and defendant. The administrator of the plaintiff has the same right to appear after the death of a defendant, as if he were living. The death of a defendant affords no reason why the executor or administrator of the plaintiff should not become a party, and becoming a party, he may by statute summon in the executor or administrator of a deceased defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">The motion of the defendant\u2019s administrator to dismiss the suit is denied. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b447-5\">Walton, DiokeksoN, Ba brows, DaNEokth, VniGiN andLiBBEY, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
