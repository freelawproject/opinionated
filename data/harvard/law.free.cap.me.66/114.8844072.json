But all' crimes may be proved by circumstantial evidence. The situation of the respondent, his conduct, his acts, may become of the utmost importance in determining the question of his criminality. Circumstances and the situation of the accused may be of so crim-inative a character, as not merely to justify, but imperatively to require a verdict of guilty of even the highest crimes known to the law. The common seller of intoxicating liquors has no peculiar grounds for exemption from the general principles of law adopted in the investigation of crime. <em>State </em>v. <em>O\u2019 Conner, </em>49 Maine, 594.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">The evidence shows that Mrs. Kelty supplied her two children with a bottle and money to purchase liquor and that they returned with it. The children sent on this errand testified that they received the money and purchased the liquor of the respondent. True, the children testified they received the money and returned with the liquor, but the government had an unquestionable right to strengthen their testimony as to these facts. The evidence of Mrs. Kelty of itself proved nothing, but in connection with the other testimony it was of importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-10\">No other exceptions to the rulings of the presiding justice are relied upon. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b115-11\">Walton, Dickerson, Barrows, Yirgtn and Peters, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
