Estes had his settlement in Bethel where it continued till his death in the army in 1864. He married Arabella, April 12, 1857, at Hamlin\u2019s Grant plantation. The first three children named were born in wedlock; the last two were illegitimate. Arabella and her five children had their home at Hamlin\u2019s Grant at the time it was annexed, and it continued in the same place after the annexation, which was February 13, 1873, until the supplies were furnished in April after. The \u201cagreed_ statement,\u201d does not show the fact stated in the \u201cbrief statement\u201d and relied upon by the counsel that Arabella and her children had resided at Hamlin\u2019s Grant five years and more before the annexation. It was further agreed that the settlement of Arabella and children was in Bethel at the time of the annexation and continued there till the supplies were furnished, unless the act of the legislature approved February 13, 1873, annexing Hamlin\u2019s Grant plantation to Woodstock changed it. That act is silent on the subject of pauper settlements. The objection to the notice was to its first clause which ran thus : \u201cYon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>are hereby notified that Mrs. Arabella Estes and her five children inhabitants of your town having fallen into distress,\u201d etc., (not specifying names.)</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b570-4\"><em>B.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5O\">This is an action for supplies furnished by the plaintiff town for the support of Arabella Estes and her five children.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Arabella Estes was legally married to Josiah S. Estes April 12, 1857, at Hamlin\u2019s Grant plantation, at which time the settlement of the husband was in Bethel where it continued to be until his death, June 22, 1864, and where the derivative settlement of the wife was at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">On February 18, 1873, Hamlin\u2019s Grant plantation was annexed' to Woodstock, c. 269. At the time of the annexation Arabella Estes and her five children resided in Hamlin\u2019s Grant plantation and continued to reside there until April 12, 1873, when the supplies in controversy were furnished.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">It is admitted by the agreement of the parties that the settlement of Mrs. Estes and children remained in Bethel up to the time the supplies in question wore furnished unless changed by the act of the legislature annexing Hamlin\u2019s Grant to the plaintiff town.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">Two of the children of Mrs. Estes born since the death of her husband are conceded to be illegitimate.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-11\">The notice to the defendant town set forth that Arabella Estes and her five children had fallen into distress and were in need of immediate relief and that the supplies needed to relieve such distress had been furnished.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-12\">The objection is taken that the notice is not sufficiently definite. The cases relied upon to establish the invalidity of the notice are materially different from the one under consideration. In <em>Bangor </em>v. <em>Deer </em>Isle, 1 Maine, 329, a notice that \u201cS and his family\u201d or that \u201cS and several of his children\u201d were chargeable was held insufficient for indefiniteness. In <em>Dover </em>v. Paris, 5 Maine, 430, that case was re-affirmed. In <em>Embden </em>v. Augusta, 12 Mass. 307, the notice that \u201cthe family of J S\u201d had become chargeable with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>out stating the number of persons composing such family was held too uncertain, \u201cinasmuch,\u201d says Parker, C. J., \u201cas the overseers of Augusta might not know what individuals composed that family, so as to provide for their removal or support.\u201d In <em>Walpole </em>v. <em>Hopkinton, </em>4 Pick. 358, a notice that \u201cE S and her three children\u201d have become chargeable, was held bad, as to the children, she having four. To the same effect was the case of <em>New Boston </em>v. <em>Dunbarton, 12 </em>N. H. 409. <em>Northfield </em>v. <em>Taunton, </em>4 Met. 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">But these cases have been modified by subsequent decisions. In <em>Orange </em>v. <em>Sudbury, </em>10 Pick. <em>22, </em>notice that A E and wife and three children were in distress and were chargeable, there being but three, wTas held sufficient. In <em>Lynn </em>v. <em>Newburyport, </em>5 Allen, 545, the notice was Mrs. A B and three children had applied for relief, etc,. \u201cOne objection taken to the notice is,\u201d observes Metcalf, J., \u201cthat they do not mention the names of the children of the several parents. But it is not shown nor even suggested that either of the parents had more than three children. The cases of <em>Walpole </em>v. <em>Hopkinton, </em>4 Pick. 358, and <em>Northfield v. Taunton, </em>4 Met. 433, and other similar cases do not sustain the objection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Abi\">In <em>Burlington </em>v. <em>Essex, </em>19 Vt. 91, it was held that the order of removal of a pauper and his wife and four children would nbe quashed although it did not state the names of the children nor allege that they were minors. The objection was taken that the notice was defective and reliance placed upon the cases where the notice was that A B and family were chargeable, etc. \u201cBut that reason fails in this instance,\u201d remarks Royce, C. J., \u201csince the family is described as consisting of the pauper\u2019s wife and his four children. It is contended that the defect is not cured, inasmuch as the children are not alleged to be minors. But we think the want of such an averment is not fatal. For so long as it appears they were the pauper\u2019s children and living with him as part of his family, we should rather intend that they were dependent on him as a parent and subject to parental control, than that they were adult children and emancipated.\u201d Here the case shows the children were minors.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">The notice here stated truly and definitely the number of the children of Arabella Estes, unless the doctrine that a bastard is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number><em>nillius filius, </em>is to be invoked to negative the truth of th\u00e9 number of children as set forth in the notice of the plaintiff town. The statute settles that they have the settlement of the mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">This is a case of the annexation of a plantation to an existing town. It'is not a case of a division of towns. The plaintiffs\u2019 case is not within R. S., c. 24, \u00a7 1, rule 4, which relates to the division of towns, nor to rule 8, which refers exclusively to the incorporation of unincorporated places. The brief statement of the defendants alleges a residence of the paupers for more than five years in the plantation of Hamlin\u2019s Grant, but that fact is not admitted in the agreed statement, nor is it in proof. The paupers, therefore, have no settlement in the plaintiff town.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">It may not be amiss to observe that the law as to the effect of incorporation on those resident in an unincorporated place at the date of such incorporation, has been materially changed since the passage of the laws of 1821, c. 122, relating to paupers, and consequently the decisions in relation to that statute are somewhat inapplicable to the modifications and changes in subsequent revisions. <em>Judgment for plaintiffs.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b572-6\">DicKerson, Barrows, Daneorth, Yir&amp;in and Libbey, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
