No count in the indictment sufficiently describes a libel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAe\">The statute sets out specially what acts constitute the offense, and covers the whole ground of the common law, which is therefore, by necessary implication repealed, and the offense becomes purely statutory. R. S., c. 129, \u00a7 1. <em>Com. </em>v. <em>Clap, </em>4 Mass. 163, 167. <em>Bartlet </em>v. King, 12 Mass. 537, 545. <em>Towle </em>v. <em>Marrett, </em>3 Maine, 22,26. Bishop Stat. Crimes, \u00a7 389, <em>et seg. Com. </em>v. Cooley, 10 Rick. 37, 39.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b324-18\">An indictment upon a statute must state all the circumstances which constitute the definition of the offense in the act, so as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>bring the defendant precisely within it; and the description must be in the substantial words of the statute, or their equivalents in meaning. <em>State </em>v. <em>McKenzie, </em>42 Maine, 392, 393. Bishop on Crim. Pro., \u00a7 360. \"Wharton\u2019s Crim. Law, \u00a7 364.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-4\">The statute defines a libel to b.e \u201cthe malicious defamation of a living person, made public by any printing, writing, sign, picture, representation, effigy, tending,\u201d etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-5\">The indictment alleges that the defendants \u201cdid compose and publish, and cause and procure to be composed and published in a certain public newspaper called the Bockland Opinion,\u201d which phrase is not the equivalent in meaning of' any of the words set forth in the statute. <em>State </em>v. Taylor, 45 Maine, 322.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-6\">The statute further provides, in section two, for the \u201cwillful\u201d publication of a \u201cmalicious\u201d libel. Both words, therefore, are descriptive of the offense. But the indictment in each count, charges the offense to have been committed \u201cunlawfully and maliciously,\u201d which are not equivalent in meaning. <em>State </em>v. Hussey, 60 Maine, 410.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-7\">The indictment is evidently drawn under the well known common law precedents, the county attorney not reflecting that they might be inapplicable to a statutory offense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-8\">II. If the offense is sufficiently described, the indictment is bad for duplicity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-9\">It charges in each count, that the defendants \u201cdid compose and publish, and cause and procure to be composed and published\u201d the various libels recited.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-10\">At the common law it is not perfectly clear that the writer of libelous matter could be indicted, if he was not concerned in the publication. The familiar form of indictments of which this is a copy, was5 not open to the objection of duplicity, because but one offense was charged, which was proved by the publication alone, which was of the essence of the offense. 3 Grreenl. on Ev., \u00a7 169.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-11\">But under the second section of our libel act, there are two offenses created : 1. The making, composing, dictating, writing or printing a libel, or directing or procuring it to be done. 2. The willfully publishing or circulating it, or knowingly and willfully aiding in doing either.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>It is impossible to give any force or meaning to the first clause of the section without applying it expressly to one who has composed a libel, but has not been concerned in the publication; while the second clause applies to the publisher, who may or may not have been the composer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b326-4\">The statute thus in express terms, creates two distinct and substantive offenses, where it is very doubtful if more than one existed before.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b326-5\">Under this statute the formal allegation in the common law precedent \u201ccomposed, written and printed,\u201d which it was absolutely unnecessary to prove, becomes descriptive of an offense entirely distinct from the misdemeanor described in the second clause, and applicable only to a different class of offenders ; thus the old precedent, supposed to set forth a single crime, now describes two.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b326-6\">The offenses created by this statute are of the same grade as well as nature. One cannot be included or merged in the other. They were intended for different people, and while one person may be convicted, on a proper indictment for both, he may also be convicted of either, although he may not have committed the other.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b326-7\">Take the case at bar as an illustration. There are two defendants, one the editor, the other the publisher of the paper. Is it not clearly competent for the jury, under this statute, to convict Mr. Otis, the editor, of the composition of the libels, and acquit him of the publication, if it should appear that he was not concerned in that; and also convict Mr. Kobbins, the publisher, of the publication, and acquit him of the composition, if the testimony should so warrant ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b326-8\">The result would be conviction for two independent0 offenses joined in the same count. Such joinder is bad for duplicity. <em>State </em>v. Smith, 61 Maine, 386, 389.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b326-9\"><em>L. A. </em>Emery, attorney general</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Afzj\">for the state, after arguing the points raised by the exceptions, closed thus:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-10\">\u201cFormerly the rule was, that on overruling a demurrer to an indictment for felony, the judgment should be to answer over, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>while to an indictment for a misdemeanor, the judgment was final, more recently the latter rule has been adopted in all cases.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-4\">In this case the county attorney has agreed that if the \u2018demurrer is overruled by the full court,\u2019 the defendants shall have the right to plead over <em>; </em>apparently this was done without the consent of the court; it is doubted whether the county attorney had the power so to agree, and whether the judgment should not be final.\u201d</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b327-5\">Appleton, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AKH\">This is an indictment for a libel to which the defendants have demurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The indictment is upon R. S. 1871, c. 129, \u00a7 2, which is in these words: \u201cWhoever makes, composes, \"dictates, writes or prints a libel; directs or procures it to be done; willfully publishes or circulates it, or knowingly and willfully aids in doing either, shall be punished by imprisonment less than one year, and by fine not exceeding one thousand dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">The allegation in the indictment in each of the numerous counts is, that the defendants \u201cunlawfully and maliciously did compose and publish, and cause and procure to be composed and published in a certain public newspaper, called the Rockland Opinion, a certain false, scandalous, and malicious and defamatory libel of and concerning,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">I. The objection is taken that the count is double and bad on demurrer. The true rule is thus stated by Wharton in his American Crim. Law, \u00a7 390 : \u201cWhen a statute makes two or more distinct acts, connected with the same transaction, indictable, each one of which may be considered as representing a stage in the same offense, it has in many cases been ruled they may be coupled in one count.\u201d Here but one offense is charged. \u201cAn indictment,\u201d says Metcalf, J., in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Twitchell, 4 Cush. 74, \u201cwhich avers that the defendant \u2018did write and publish, and cause to be written and published,\u2019 a malicious libel, is not bad for duplicity. 2 Gabbett Crim. Law, 234. 3 Ch. Crim. L. (4th Am. ed.) 877, <em>et seq.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">II. The word \u201cunlawfully\u201d is not in the statute, but its insertion in the indictment does not vitiate it. If the fact as stated be illegal, it is unnecessary to say it is unlawful. If it be legal, the stating it to be unlawful, will not make it so. The only case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>when it may be necessary to use it, is where it is a part of a description of a statute offense; but it is not so here. It may be rejected as surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">III. It is undoubtedly the safer course to follow the language of the statute in describing the offense charged in the indictment. But it has been repeatedly held that words equivalent in their meaning to those in the statute may be used. So, the use of words of more general signification, but clearly including in their meaning all that is embraced in the language of the statute has received in repeated instances, judicial sanction. But wherever there is a change of phraseology, and a word not in the statute is substituted in the indictment for one that is, and the word thus substituted is equivalent to the word used in the statute, or is of more extensive signification than, and includes it, the indictment will be sufficient. Thus, if the word knowingly be in the statute, and the word advisedly be substituted for it in the indictment, or the word willfully in the statute, and maliciously in the indictment, the words \u201cadvisedly\u201d and \u201cmaliciously\u201d not being in the statutes respectively, the indictment would be sufficient. 1 Wharton Am. Crim. Law, \u00a7 376. <em>Rex </em>v. Fuller, 1 B. &amp; P. 180.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">The words of the statute are not used. The indictment is under that portion of the section which prohibits the willfully publishing or circulating a libel. The indictment alleges a malicious publishing, not a willful publishing of the libel in question. A man may do an act willfully, and yet be free of malice. But he cannot do an act maliciously, without at the same time doing it willfully. The malicious doing of an act includes the willful doing of it. Malice includes intent and will.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">This indictment, it should be borne in mind, is not for knowingly and willfully aiding in publishing a libel, but for willfully publishing or circulating it. <em>Demurrer overruled.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b328-7\">Walton, Diceebson, Babeows, Viegin and Petebs, JJ\\, concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
