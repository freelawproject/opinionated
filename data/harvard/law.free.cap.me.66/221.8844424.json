Also that the interest mentioned in the indorsement \u201cto Jan. 80,1873,\u201d is $262.48, and that amount was paid by C. Waite &amp; Co. on settlement of the account of that date, as interest on the note to that date.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-6\">Hall testified that two years or more after the date of the note, the plaintiff told him that he had such a note; to which he replied he thought not; that the plaintiff afterwards showed him the note; that ho requested the plaintiff to sue it; was willing himself to be sued with the principals; that the plaintiff was afraid if he sued that Waite &amp; Co. would go into bankruptcy; that he told the plaintiff that he had examined the records and knew there was property enough that could be secured; that if the plaintiff would commence a suit, he would give the plaintiff a bond to hold him harmless of all costs in any way, on account of the suit because he knew there was property enough unincumbered to pay the note; did not know that he said anything about saving him harmless from damages ; that he told the plaintiff that he would take the sheriff with him and show him the property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-7\">The defendants put in, statement of account between 0.

McNichol, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1n\">Hall, contended that the plaintiff was obliged to commence ail action when requested by Hall, under his offer of indemnity; and cited <em>Kennebec Bank </em>v. Tuckerman, 5 Maine, 130; <em>Adams Bank v. </em>Anthony, 18 Pick. 238.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-12\">Also, that the evidence showed that he postponed, an unreasonably long time, the collection of this note, which was secured by Hall\u2019s signature, in order to apply payments to other notes and indebtedness of C. Waite &amp; Co. not thus secured; and farther contended that the reception of large extra interest on past indebtedness would justify the inference that it was in consideration of future forbearance ; in any view, that it, showed a change of contract, the making of a new contract with the plaintiff, whereby he received fifteen per cent interest, when the note on its face called for but six per cent.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b223-13\"><em>E. B. Haney, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARW\">cited <em>Strafford Bank </em>v. <em>Crosby, </em>8 Maine, 191; <em>Crosby </em>v. <em>Wyatt, </em>23 Maine, 156; <em>Freeman?s Bank </em>v. <em>Hollins, </em>13 Maine, 202.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>Dickerson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">The request of a surety, to the creditor, to sue the principal, does not, in general, secure his release, at common law, if such suit is not brought. That effect, for such sole cause, follows only in cases where the statute makes provision for notice. There being no statute upon this subject in this state, the rights of the parties must be determined according to the rule of the common law. <em>Leavitt v. Savage, </em>16 Maine, 72, 73. <em>Page </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>15 Maine, 249, 256. <em>Frye </em>v. <em>Barker, </em>4 Pick. 382. <em>Halsted </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>17 Ind. 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">We do not perceive sufficient ground to relieve the surety from liability, on the facts testified to by him. No bond was given or tendered by him to the principal to save him harmless for costs that might arise on compliance with the surety\u2019s request. At most, there was the mere verbal promise of the surety to furnish such bond. We do not think that this was sufficient to require the plaintiff to proceed against the principal at the peril of discharging the defendant. The promise and liability of the surety are co-extensive with those of the principal. The plaintiff\u2019s remedy attaches alike to both principal and surety. No mere verbal request, or offer to give a bond of indemnity, for the plaintiff to sue the principal, unaccompanied by the tender of such bond, is sufficient to discharge the defendant from his suretyship.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">While it is undoubtedly true that additional time of payment given to the principal by the creditor, under a valid agreement, without the consent of the surety, discharges the surety; we do not think that the payment of extra interest by the principal to the creditor, followed by mere forbearance to sue, is, of itself, sufficient evidence to show that such payment was the consideration for the forbearance. The extra interest paid may, or may not, have been the consideration for the forbearance. The burden is upon the defendant to show that it was. Having failed to do that, he is not entitled to prevail upon this branch of the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">\n<em>A default to be entered for the amount due on the notes less seventy-two dollars and foui'teen cents.</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"b224-8\">Barrows, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5i\">There is no evidence of any contract for forbear-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>anee between the payee and the principal promisor. The payee might have paid the note and sued the principal at any time. I concur.</p>\n<judges id=\"b225-4\">Appleton, C.
