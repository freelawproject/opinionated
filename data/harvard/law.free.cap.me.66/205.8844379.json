Drinkwater, on the second Tuesday of January, 1872, and, as such, took possession and control of all his ward\u2019s estate including one-fourth of the bark \u201cAnna Walsh\u201d of Eew York. This quarter became the property of the ward as heir of his deceased father. On the 22d April, 1872, Isadora Ward, administratrix of the estate of the ward\u2019s father, conveyed this quarter by a bill of sale in usual form to said McGil-very. The purpose of the conveyance was to transfer the title from the estate of the ward\u2019s father to McGilvery as guardian of his said ward. McGilvery in his inventory of the estate of his ward has included the quarter of the bark; and, in his accounts with the estate of his ward, has charged the same with the expenses, such as insurance, &amp;c., of the quarter and credited the same with its earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-13\">The title to the quarter of the Anna Walsh was in McGilvery as guardian and in trust for his ward. The plaintiff, as guardian, may enforce his ward\u2019s rights by a bill in equity and compel a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>conveyance from the administrator of W.
