B. <em>&amp; M. L. R. R. </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>60 Maine, 561. If the agreement had been absolute, its utmost effect could only constitute him a stockholder\u2014owner of so many shares, entitling him to the rights, and. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>rendering him liable to the obligations imposed by law upon a stockholder. His subscription was to take the stock \u201cagreeably to the conditions\u201d therein expressed: one of which was \u201cno assessment whatever, . . . shall be made upon any shares so as above subscribed, . . . until the full amount be secured for its completion to Newport.\u201d This is a condition precedent; and hence before the plaintiffs can recover, it must be satisfactorily shown that it has been performed. <em>Belfast &amp; Moosehead L. R. R. </em>v. Moore, <em>sup.; Penob. &amp; Ken. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Dunn, </em>39 Maine, 588.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">From the phraseology adopted there, it would seem that the defendant\u2019s subscription was made with the understanding that the road was to be located <em>via </em>Newport, although the language literally construed does not specifically so declare. Whether or not such a construction was really intended by the parties and should now be_given, we will not now decide. The most favorable construction for the corporation, and the one which its counsel contends for, is that it has reference to the amount of subscription rather than to the route; and should be construed to mean, that no assessment should be made, until the full amount were secured for the completion of the road \u201cas far as Newport is from Belfast\u201d \u2014but to some point of intersection with the \u201cMaine Central Hail-road.\u201d Some of the town-subscriptions contained the additional words, \u201cor to any junction of the Maine Central.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">As seen, the contract, independent of the charter, contains no express or implied promise to pay any sum whatever. The defendant can be holden only under his contract taken in connection with the charter. Section 5 of the charter authorizes \u201cequal assessments from time to time on all the shares;\u201d on non-payment after the prescribed notice, a sale of the shares at auction ; and if the shares sell for less than the assessments due thereon, \u201cthe delinquent subscriber or stockholder shall be held accountable to the corporation for the balance, with the interest and cost of sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Before the defendant can \u201cbe held accountable\u201d under this provision of the charter, a legal assessment, notice, sale, and an ascertained balance must be proved. But by the express terms of the subscription as above construed, no assessment can be made against this defendant, \u201cuntil the full amount be secured for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>completion of the road as far as Newport is from Belfast.\u201d Has such an amount been subscribed even ? The burden of establishing this very material fact is upon the plaintiffs. The case discloses no evidence to sustain it. On the contrary the evidence is full and undisputed that the road was not built to Newport, but to Burnham, and \u201c$150,000 to $200,000 were saved by building to Burnham instead of Newportthat the road to Burnham actually cost \u00a7950,000 \u2014 more than the aggregate of all the subscriptions, valid, invalid and conditional, the latter sum being $935,700.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">Moreover, taking the estimate of the engineer, (who located and under whose direction and supervision the road was built; and which is the most favorable view in behalf of the plaintiffs that can be reasonably urged,) made and submitted to the board of directors before any assessments were voted, and rejecting the invalid and conditional subscriptions by the towns of Unity, Newport, Troy, and Detroit, and the plaintiffs signally fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">[Engineer\u2019s estimate, (p. 7,) $906,500</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Whole subscription, (p. 22,) $935,700</p>\n<p id=\"AzO\">Less Unity, $30,000</p>\n<p id=\"Aqz\">\u201c Newport, 25,000</p>\n<p id=\"A_s\">\u201c Troy, 10,000</p>\n<p id=\"AzZ\">\u201c Detroit, 5,000</p>\n<p id=\"AYP\">70,000</p>\n<p id=\"A5b\">-- 865,700</p>\n<p id=\"b189-17\">Less than estimate, $40,800.]</p>\n<p id=\"b189-18\">The plaintiffs\u2019 further proposition that the directors were the judges whether or not a sufficient sum had been subscribed, is not a reasonable one, especially if by that is meant that they decided the estimate of their engineer was too high. It is the special province of the engineer to ascertain by preliminary surveys and otherwise the approximate cost; and his report, although generally too low, is the foundation of ulterior proceedings. But no such absurdity is urged. Moreover, the proposition that the directors could bind the subscribers by deciding that the sum estimated by the engineer has been subscribed, is equally untenable. In the first place, there is no evidence in this case that any such decision was made, except the inference deduced from their vote to lay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>assessments. There was nothing to exercise their judgment upon, except figures. To decide upon the pecuniary \u201cresponsibility\u201d of' individual subscribers, as used in the seventeenth by-law of this corporation, (as in <em>B. &amp; M. L. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>60 Maine, 577,) the board of directors would be an appropriate tribunal, and as good as any; and good faith on their part in passing upon such a question, which is always one of much uncertainty, will bridge over any degree of <em>ignorantia </em>facti, or bad judgment short of actual fraud. But whether the aggregate amount of sundry subscription lists equals the sum estimated by the engineer is a simple mathematical question of easy solution, and not a matter requiring the judgment of a board of directors. The clerk testifies : \u201cI footed up the amount of the subscriptions and reported the sum total to the directors. . . . I laid the sum total of the subscriptions before the directors before they acted.\u201d If this was all that was done in the premises, (and the evidence stops here on this point,) the directors took no note of the particulars, such as the names whether of individuals or towns, or whether conditional or absolute, hence did not profess to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">This \u201csum total\u201d included the subscriptions of towns to the amount of $70,000. That these subscriptions were invalid is so free from doubt that the fact is admitted. Being invalid they could not be considered in the aggregate.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">This being fatal to the maintenance of this action, we have no occasion to consider the numerous questions raised by the defendant. <em>Judgment for the defendant.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b190-6\">Appleton, C.
