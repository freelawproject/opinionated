Kaahanui could not be used as evidence at his trial. The State of Hawaii appeals; it avers the circuit court erred in finding the defendant \u201cwas confused regarding his right to counsel [during interrogation] and his right to counsel at trial\u201d and in finding he \u201cdid not understand his right to have counsel present\u201d during interrogation. Reviewing the record of proceedings in the circuit court, we conclude the defendant\u2019s statements should not have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-17\">John I. Kaahanui was arrested at 10:20 p.m. on February 10, 1986 on suspicion of having been involved in a criminal episode some twenty minutes earlier at a bus stop on Kamehameha Highway in Honolulu. Upon his arrest, Kaahanui was taken to Queen\u2019s Hospital for treatment of an injury sustained in the episode. He was \u201cbooked\u201d thereafter at the Honolulu Police Station. The sus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>pect, however, was not questioned immediately. He was readmitted to the hospital at 1:20 a.m. upon the request of Detective George Chock, the arresting officer. Chock \u201cwanted [Kaahanui] to be taken back to Queen\u2019s to have a psychiatrist check him out\u201d and \u201cmake sure he was fit [to be questioned].\u201d The psychiatrist informed the detective by telephone that \u201cJohn was mentally fit.\u201d When Kaahanui was brought back to the police station, he was given a test to determine the alcoholic content of his blood. Although he had been drinking before the arrest, no alcohol was detected in his blood at 3:30 a.m. on February 11, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">At 11:00 a.m. Kaahanui was taken from his cell to an interrogation room by Chock. The detective was aware of the suspect\u2019s history of mental illness, his prior commitments to the State Hospital, his admission to the hospital on a voluntary basis shortly before the criminal episode under investigation, and his departure therefrom without authorization a few hours prior to his involvement in the suspected crime. Preliminary questions unrelated to the events of the night before also brought forth answers from the suspect that he was thirty-five years old, was a graduate of the Job Corps, and was then unemployed. Kaahanui told Chock he drank a substantial quantity of beer and smoked two \u201cjoints\u201d of marijuana after he left the hospital; he also told the detective that he received medication to alleviate a schizophrenic condition before leaving the hospital and slept only a few hours the night before. When asked how he felt, Kaahanui replied he was tired but felt \u201cokay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">At this point, Chock decided to confer with his superior. In the detective\u2019s words: \u201cI went to talk to my captain, and I told him that the defendant said he was tired. So I felt that maybe I shouldn\u2019t go on with the interview because of this .. ..\u201d But the captain directed that the interview should continue if the accused \u201cwas capable of answering.\u201d The detective returned to the interrogation room and again asked the suspect how he felt at the moment. From the response and an observation of the suspect\u2019s physical state, Chock was convinced of Kaahanui\u2019s lucidity and fitness to be questioned. The detective thus proceeded with the interrogation<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> after informing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>Kaahanui of his \u201cMiranda\u201d rights and having him execute a Honolulu Police Department Form 81 (HPD-81), on which the suspect indicated he did \u201c[not] want an attorney now.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The interrogation brought forth, <em>inter </em>alia, an admission by the suspect that he punched the female victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">A criminal complaint charging Kaahanui with Kidnapping and Assault in the Third Degree was filed thereafter. The defendant moved to suppress all statements obtained in the course of the custodial interrogation conducted by Chock. The trial court heard the testimony of the detective, studied the audio-visual recording of the interrogation, and entered an order granting the Motion to Suppress Statements. \u201cBased upon the evidence received and arguments of counsel presented, the [c]ourt ma[d]e the following findings of facts and conclusions of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-7\">1. The Defendant was lucid and able to engage in conversation intelligently and could articulate his thoughts and feelings with H.P.D. Detective George Chock when his statement was obtained by the police ... ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-8\">2. The statement of Defendant was voluntarily given and uncoerced by police;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-9\">3. However, when Defendant was advised of his constitutional rights by Detective Chock, Defendant was confused regarding his right to counsel for purposes of questioning under the guarantees of the Fifth Amendment and his right to counsel at trial under the Sixth Amendment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-10\">4. Although Detective Chock followed proper procedures utilizing H.P.D. Form 81 and did everything that a police officer should do to try to insure that Miranda warnings are given by police, Defendant did not understand his right to have counsel present during the questioning as evidenced by the . . . taped interview;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>5. Therefore, the Court finds that any waiver of Defendant\u2019s constitutional right to have counsel present during the interrogation was not done intelligently, knowingly and with an understanding of his right under the standards of <em>State v. Maluia, </em>56 Haw. 428 (1975).\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">The State\u2019s appeal followed. We begin our analysis of the issues posed on appeal by reviewing the \u201cMiranda\u201d rule adopted by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">When we first examined \u201cthe scope of the protections guaranteed by [the] Hawaii Constitution\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination\u201d in <em>State v. Santiago, </em>53 Haw. 254, 265, 492 P.2d 657, 664 (1971), we concluded \u201cthe protections which the United States Supreme Court enumerated in <em>Miranda[v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 468 (1966),] have an independent source in the Hawaii Constitution\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d <em>State v. Santiago, </em>53 Haw. at 266, 492 P.2d at 664. In order to ensure that the exercise of the constitutional privilege would be scrupulously honored, we adopted measures similar to those delineated in <em>Miranda v. Arizona, supra. </em>With respect to the issue in <em>Santiago </em>on the admissibility of statements obtained from the accused in the course of custodial interrogation, we said</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-8\">that before reference is made at trial to statements made by the accused during custodial interrogation, the prosecutor must first demonstrate that certain safeguards were taken before the accused was questioned. Unless other equally effective protections are developed, the prosecutor must show that each accused was warned that he had a right to remain silent, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>anything said could be used against him, that he had a right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he could not afford an attorney one would be appointed for him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 266, 492 P.2d at 664; <em>see also State v. Kalai, </em>56 Haw. 566, 368, 537 P.2d 8, 11 (1975). And our mandate was: \u201c[UJnless these protective measures are taken, statements made by the accused may not be used either as direct evidence in the prosecutor\u2019s case in chief or to impeach the defendant\u2019s credibility during rebuttal or cross-examination.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">When custodial interrogation occurs without the presence of counsel and a statement is obtained from the accused, the federal rule imposes \u201ca heavy burden ... on the government to demonstrate that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege against self-incrimination and his right to retained or appointed counsel.\u201d <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. at 475 (citation omitted). The standards of proof on waiver are those enunciated in <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458 (1938). <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. at 475.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">We follow the same high standards in enforcing the \u201cMiranda\u201d rights that \u201chave an independent source in the Hawaii Constitution\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d <em>State v. Santiago, </em>53 Haw. at 266, 492 P.2d at 664. After a defendant has been adequately apprised of his \u201cMiranda\u201d rights, he \u201cmay waive [effectuation of] these rights provided the waiver is made voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently.\u201d <em>State v. Amorin, </em>61 Haw. 356, 358, 604 P.2d 45, 47 (1979) (citing <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 444); <em>cf. State v. Dicks, </em>57 Haw. 46, 48, 549 P.2d 727, 729 (1976) (\u201cThe right to counsel is waivable when it is voluntarily and intelligently undertaken. <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458 (1938).\u201d). With these guideposts in mind, we turn to the task at hand of determining whether the trial court erred or not in suppressing the defendant\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">The trial court saw no reason to fault Detective Chock\u2019s decision to proceed with the interrogation of John I. Kaahanui on February 11, 1986. It found he was then \u201clucid and able to engage in conversation intelligendy and... articulate his thoughts and feelings\u201d and that his statements were \u201cvoluntarily given and uncoerced.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>Moreover, it found the detective \u201cfollowed proper procedures utilizing H.P.D. Form 81 and did everything that a police officer should do to try to insure that Miranda warnings are given by police.\u201d Yet, it concluded \u201cthat any waiver of Defendant\u2019s constitutional right to have counsel present during the interrogation was not done intelligently, knowingly and with an understanding of his right under the standards of <em>State v. Maluia, </em>56 Haw. 428 (1975).\u201d The court\u2019s application of constitutional principles to the historical facts recounted in the order of suppression cannot be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The trial court premised its conclusion that the defendant\u2019s waiver of counsel \u201cwas not done intelligendy, knowingly and with an understanding of his right\u201d on \u201cthe following portions of the taped interview:<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-6\">Q: Detective George Chock</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-7\">A: Defendant</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-8\">Q: You don\u2019t have to tell me anything.

State, </em>62 Haw. 483, 493, 616 P.2d 1376, 1382 (1980) (quoting <em>United States v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395 (1948)). For there is nothing in it or in the remainder of the record from which inferences of confusion or misapprehension regarding the right to counsel during interrogation and at trial may reasonably be drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-16\">There is no evidence \u201cthat the accused was threatened, tricked, or cajoled into a waiver[.]\u201d <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. at 476. Rather, the trial court found \u201c[t]he statement of Defendant was voluntarily given and uncoerced by police.\u201d And it further found \u201cDetective Chock followed proper procedures utilizing H.P.D. Form 81 and did everything that a police officer should do to try to insure that Miranda warnings are given by police.\u201d Were we to hold no valid waiver was demonstrated here, we would be reading our rule regarding the waiver of \u201cMiranda\u201d rights so only one calibrated to a defendant\u2019s best interests could be upheld. But like the Supreme Court\u2019s rule, ours is designed to assure the \u201cessentially voluntary and knowing nature\u201d of a waiver, not its ultimate wis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>dom. <em>Colorado v.
