A \u201cspecial management area minor permit\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was issued to Lanihau Corpora<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>tion (Lanihau) and its agent, Belt, Collins, and Associates (Belt, Collins), by the Director of the Hawaii County Planning Department (the director). Kona Old Hawaiian Trails Group (Kona Old) sought judicial review of the administrative action in the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit. The court dismissed the case for want of jurisdiction, and Kona Old appeals. Lanihau avers the controversy is moot and moves to dismiss the appeal. Although the appeal is viable, we agree with Lanihau that the circuit court could not entert\u00e1in Kona Old\u2019s request for review of the director\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">Lanihau, the owner of two parcels of real property situated within the special management area at Kailua-Kona, planned to develop and market the property. This entailed the consolidation of the two lots into one, the installation of utility lines and roadways, and the resubdivision of the property into four residential lots. To initiate the project, Belt, Collins, Lanihau\u2019s engineering consultants, submitted on Lanihau\u2019s behalf a \u201cSpecial Management Area Use Permit Assessment Application\u201d to the Hawaii County Planning Department. The application stated the planned development of the property was consistent with the objectives, policies, and special management area guidelines specified by the CZMA in that at most there would be a minimal impact upon shoreline resources.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">The planning director, upon reviewing the application, decided the development would have no significant effect upon the environment and ecology of the shoreline area and would not cost more than $65,000. He therefore issued a \u201cspecial management area minor use permit\u201d rather than a \u201cspecial management area use permit.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Lanihau was authorized thereby to construct the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>roadway and utility improvements and subdivide the property into four residential lots. But the director imposed several conditions upon the developer; Lanihau was required to have an archaeologist on hand during the construction to ensure that historical artifacts and burial remains would not be disturbed, to construct a rockwall and provide public access along the shoreline, and to obtain county endorsement of the access plan prior to the final approval of the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Kona Old, an association of Kona residents formed \u201cto protect and preserve the ancient trails and access routes along the Kona Coast,\u201d objected to the issuance of the permit. It sought judicial review of the director\u2019s action<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in order to \u201cprevent the loss of [the] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>public shoreline area and an ancient Hawaiian trail across shoreline properties near a valuable fishing and recreational area in Kona.\u201d The association claimed the director had violated the CZMA, breached the public trust, and disturbed traditional public easement rights by improvidently granting the permit. It averred that \u2022mandates of the Hawaii Administrative Procedure Act, HRS chapter 91, had not been observed, since rules governing the issuance of permits had not been promulgated. The association prayed, <em>inter alia, </em>that the permit be voided and the proposed construction be enjoined.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">The director moved to dismiss the appeal on grounds that Kona Old was neither a \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d by the director\u2019s action nor a participant in a \u201ccontested case.\u201d Lanihau and Belt, Collins joined in the motion. When the motion was heard, the movants also argued the association had not exhausted administrative remedies before seeking judicial review. The circuit court dismissed the appeal, but did not give its reason for doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Kona Old sought a stay of the order from the circuit court pending its contemplated appeal to this court. Before the circuit court acted on the request, the association filed a notice of appeal. When the circuit court subsequently denied the stay, Kona Old turned to us for an order maintaining the status quo pending disposition of the appeal. The pleadings submitted by Kona Old, however, failed to provide an adequate basis for a stay, and we denied the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">Thereafter, Lanihau consummated an agreement to sell the property. In order to prepare the land for construction, the buyer then procured a \u201cgrubbing permit\u201d from the Department of Public Works of the County of Hawaii. The permit was conditioned upon the maintenance of a forty-foot shoreline setback and the preservation of any archaeological or historical sites, and the \u201cgrubbing\u201d proceeded in conformity with these directives. When the task was finished, Lanihau submitted a Motion to Dismiss Appeal for Mootness. We decided to consider the motion conjointly with oral argument on the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">Lanihau would have us dismiss the appeal since work under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>\u201cgrubbing permit\u201d has been completed. But in our view, some of the issues posed on appeal remain viable.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">A case is moot if it has \u201clost its character as a present, live controversy of the kind that must exist if [courts] are to avoid advisory opinions on abstract propositions of law.\u201d <em>Hall v. </em>Beals, 396 U.S. 45, 48 (1969) (citations omitted). The rule is one of the prudential rules of judicial self-governance \u201cfounded in concern about the proper \u2014 and properly limited \u2014 role of the courts in a democratic society.\u201d <em>Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 498 (1975) (citations omitted); <em>see also Life of the Land v. Land Use Commission, </em>63 Haw. 166, 172, 623 P.2d 431, 438 (1981). We have said \u201cthe suit must remain alive throughout the course of litigation to the moment of final appellate disposition[]\u201d to escape the mootness bar. <em>Wong v. Board of Regents, </em>62 Haw. 391, 394, 616 P.2d 201, 203 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Kona Old\u2019s appeal, in our opinion, retains vitality. As long as all of the construction authorized under the shoreline management area minor permit is not completed, the appeal presents an adversity of interests and possibly affords the appellant an effective remedy. <em>See id. </em>at 394, 616 P.2d at 203-04. But even if all of the work sanctioned by the two permits is finished,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> a basis for the exercise of our appellate jurisdiction remains. For we recognize that in exceptional situations mootness is not an obstacle to the consideration of an appeal. In our opinion, \u201c[w]hen the question involved affects the public interest, and it is likely in the nature of things that similar questions arising in the future would likewise become moot before a needed authoritative determination by an appellate court can be <em>made,\u201d Johnston v. Ing, </em>50 Haw. 379, 381, 441 P.2d 138, 140 (1968), an exception to the rule is justified. <em>Wong v. Board of Regents, </em>62 Haw. at 395, 616 P.2d at 204. We think the situation would call for the exercise of our appellate jurisdiction even if there is no more work to be done under the minor permit. The questions posed here are of public concern and, even if they recur in the future, are of a nature that would be as likely as not to become moot before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>they could be determined on appeal. Thus, we proceed to the merits of Kona Old\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">At issue here is the CZMA, a statute embodying \u201cthe state policy to preserve, protect, and where possible, to restore the natural resources of the coastal zone of Hawaii.\u201d HRS \u00a7 205A-21. The task of implementing the policy, however, \u201chas been delegated in large part to the counties, and they are responsible for the administration of the special management area use permit procedure and requirements.\u201d <em>Mahuiki v. Planning Commission, </em>65 Haw. 506, 517, 654 P.2d 874, 881 (1982). \u201cState primacy nevertheless has been retained,\u201d and the legislature has attempted to \u201cmaintain the integrity of its declared policy by [establishing] guidelines in HRS \u00a7 205A-26 [that must] be followed by the counties in reviewing applications for [special management area] use permits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 517-18, 654 P.2d at 881-82.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>The counties are further compelled to adopt specific procedures consistent with the CZMA for the issuance of \u201cspecial management area minor permits,\u201d and these procedures must provide for \u201cjudicial review from the grant and denial thereof.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A person aggrieved by a county agency\u2019s failure to comply with the Act is also accorded a right thereunder to initiate a civil action against the non-complying agency.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, the governing statutory scheme provides two means through which judicial intervention may be sought to enforce the state policy enunciated in HRS chapter 205A.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Kona Old, purporting to invoke the circuit court\u2019s jurisdiction pursuant to HRS \u00a7\u00a7 91-14, 205A-6, and 605-21,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> sought a ruling that the director had violated the CZMA in issuing the minor permit as well as an order voiding the permit and enjoining the authorized construction. But the court dismissed the suit, obviously on jurisdictional grounds. The appellant argues this was error, since HRS \u00a7 91-14 gave it a right to seek judicial review of the administrative action. If perchance the Administrative Procedure Act did not, Kona Old maintains it was still entitled to invoke judicial intervention in the controversy pursuant to an express provision in the CZMA, namely HRS \u00a7 205A-6. We turn first to the right of judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>review encompassed by HRS \u00a7 91-14 to ascertain whether Kona Old was. entitled thereunder to invoke the circuit court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">Kona Old is \u201can unincorporated association composed of residents from the Kona area\u201d with an avowed \u201cpurpose ... to protect and preserve the ancient trails and access routes along the Kona Coast.\u201d The association\u2019s standing to invoke judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act in this instance is contingent upon a showing that it is a \u201cperson aggrieved by a final decision and order in a contested case\u201d conducted before an administrative agency. <em>See supra </em>note 4. We experience little difficulty in reaching a conclusion that Kona Old may well have been aggrieved by the director\u2019s decision to issue Lanihau a minor permit. For if the development approved thereby could result in the loss of access routes to the shoreline or the right to traverse ancient trails, the association\u2019s members probably were \u201cspecially, personally and adversely affected\u201d by the administrative decision. <em>In re Hawaiian Electric Co., </em>56 Haw. 260, 264, 535 P.2d 1102, 1105 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">Yet, \u201c[i]t is not enough that a person has been \u2018aggrieved\u2019 by agency action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He also \u201cmust have participated in [a] contested case before [an] administrative <em>agency[,]Jordan v. Hamada, </em>64 Haw. 451, 643 P.2d 73 (1982) [,]\u201d to acquire standing to challenge the decision in court. <em>Gibb v. Spiker, </em>68 Haw__,_, 718 P.2d 1076, 1078 (1986) (footnote omitted). The record in this case, however, does not reveal that Kona Old satisfied this prerequisite of entitlement to seek judicial review pursuant to HRS \u00a7 91-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-11\">A \u201ccontested case\u201d is defined by HRS \u00a7 91-1(5) as \u201ca proceeding in which the legal rights, duties, or privileges of specific parties are required by law to be determined after an opportunity for agency hearing.\u201d An \u201cagency hearing\u201d is described in turn as \u201csuch hearing held by an agency immediately prior to a judicial review of a contested case as provided in section 91-14.\u201d HRS \u00a7 91-1(6). But under the rules governing the issuance of special management area minor permits, the planning director\u2019s decision to grant a permit need not be preceded by a hearing. <em>See </em>County of Hawaii Planning Commission Rule 9-10. Thus, his decision to grant a minor permit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>could not have been \u201ca final decision or order in a contested case\u201d from which an appeal to court was possible. <em>See </em>HRS \u00a7 91-14(a).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Kona Old, however, points out the procedures adopted by the agency for processing applications for minor permits do not provide for a hearing at any stage. To hold it to the letter of section 91-14, the association argues, would be unjust, particularly when the county is mandated to \u201cprovide specific procedures .. . for the issuance of ... special management area minor permits . . . and judicial review from the grant and denial thereof.\u201d <em>See supra </em>note 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">We are convinced, however, that the procedures adopted by the county provide an opportunity for an agency hearing and meet the statutory demand for specific procedures culminating in judicial review. To be sure, these procedures are not to be found in a planning commission rule; they appear in the charter of the County of Hawaii.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The relevant charter provisions are applicable to grants or denials of special management area minor permits by the planning director, and they provide for a hearing in which the issuance of a minor permit may be contested. And since the pertinent charter provisions require the designated administrative tribunal to conduct a hearing \u201caccording to the State Administrative Procedures Act,\u201d its decision, unlike that of the director, unques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>tionably would have been appealable to the circuit court. <em>See supra </em>note 11. But Kona Old did not avail itself of this opportunity for an agency hearing; hence there is no final decision or order in a contested case which is subject to judicial review by virtue of HRS \u00a7 91-14(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">The question remaining is whether Kona Old\u2019s invocation of HRS \u00a7 205A-6, which allows \u201cany person or agency [to] commence a civil action alleging that any agency\u201d has breached the CZMA in some respect, vested the circuit court with jurisdiction over the dispute involving the director\u2019s grant of a minor permit to Lanihau. <em>See supra </em>note 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">The language of the section in question gives an appearance of permitting anyone to bring a civil action against an agency to remedy any alleged breach of the CZMA and its policies, objectives, and guidelines.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Taken at face value, section 205A-6 would sanction judicial intervention in the administrative process upon any allegation of an act inconsistent with the CZMA in any respect. Still, we are reluctant to read the language literally and say Kona Old\u2019s purported reliance on HRS \u00a7 205A-6 and allegations of the planning director\u2019s breach of the CZMA were sufficient to vest the circuit court with authority to decide the controversy. Our concern, as it was earlier, is with the timing of the request for judicial relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">As we observed, \u201cthe proper \u2014 and properly limited \u2014 role of the courts in a democratic society\u201d is always a matter of concern. <em>Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. at 498 (citations omitted). Courts have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>\u201cdeveloped two principal doctrines to enable the question of timing [of requests for judicial intervention in the administrative process] to be answered: (1) primary jurisdiction; and (2) exhaustion of administrative remedies.\u201d B. Schwartz, <em>Administrative Law </em>\u00a7 8.23, at 485 (2d ed. 1984). \u201cBoth are essentially doctrines of comity between courts and agencies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">\u201c \u2018Primary jurisdiction\u2019 ... applies where a claim is originally cognizable in the courts, and comes into play whenever enforcement of the claim requires the resolution of issues which, under a regulatory scheme, have been placed within the special competence of an administrative body[.]\u201d <em>United States v. Western Pac. R.R., </em>352 U.S. 59, 63-64 (1956). When this happens, \u201cthe judicial process is suspended pending referral of such issues to the administrative body for its views.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 64 (citation omitted). In effect, \u201c[t]he courts are divested of whatever original jurisdiction they would otherwise possess[.]\u201d B. Schwartz, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 8.24, at 488 (emphasis omitted). And \u201ceven a seemingly contrary statutory provision will yield to the overriding policy promoted by the doctrine.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">\u201cExhaustion,\u201d on the other hand, comes into play \u201cwhere a claim is cognizable in the first instance by an administrative agency alone; judicial interference is withheld until the administrative process has run its course.\u201d <em>United States v. Western Pac. R.R., </em>352 U.S. at 63. \u201cThe exhaustion principle asks simply that. .. the avenues of relief nearest and simplest should be pursued first.\u201d <em>Moore v. City of East Cleveland, </em>431 U.S. 494, 524 (1977) (Burger, C.J., dissenting). \u201cJudicial review of agency action will not be available unless the party affected has taken advantage of all the corrective procedures provided for in the administrative process.\u201d B. Schwartz, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 8.30, at 502. Under this principle, Kona Old clearly had no right to seek judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Yet in a strict sense, HRS \u00a7 205A-6 was not meant to afford judicial review as such. It affords an interested party an alternative remedy for an agency\u2019s noncompliance with the CZMA by authorizing a civil action in which a circuit court \u201cshall have jurisdiction to provide any relief as may be appropriate.\u201d HRS \u00a7 205A-6(c). The cause of action created thereby seemingly describes a claim \u201coriginally cognizable in the courts.\u201d <em>United States v. Western Pac. R.R., </em>352 U.S. at 64.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AF\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number><em>Alan T.

This is so even though the facts after they have been appraised by specialized competence serve as a premise for legal consequences to be judicially defined. Uniformity and consistency in the regulation of business entrusted to a particular agency are secured, and the limited functions of review by the judiciary are more rationally exercised, by preliminary resort for ascertaining and interpreting the circumstances underlying legal issues to agencies that are better equipped than courts by specialization, by insight gained through experience, and by more flexible procedure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-6\"><em>Far East Conference v.
