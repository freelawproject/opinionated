With the permit in hand, he went directly from the police station to a sporting goods store where he purchased a .38 caliber pistol. He fired the weapon for the first time that afternoon, engaging in target practice at a firing range. Shortly after 8:00 p.m. that night he used the gun again, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>firing four to seven shots into the Sports Page Lounge, a bar he had frequented in the past but had not visited for some time. The deadly volley of gunfire claimed two victims, and Russo was charged with \u201cintentionally or knowingly caus[ing] the death[s] of [Carl Greene and Johnny Carson] by shooting [them] with a firearm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Russo denied the charges in the indictment and proceeded to trial. The jury found him guilty of both counts of murder, and he appe\u00e1led from the trial court\u2019s judgment. He averred the jury verdict was not supported by substantial evidence, the assistance provided by counsel was ineffective, and the trial court committed a host of errors in the course of trial. Concluding from a review of the record that the court erred in admitting evidence obtained in violation of his privilege against self-incrimination and his right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, we vacated the judgment and ordered a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">At the second trial, Russo did not deny causing the deaths of Carl Greene and Johnny Carson. His counsel\u2019s efforts focused on the establishment of insanity. Counsel elicited testimony from two psychiatrists and three clinical psychologists to support the claim that the defendant was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia when he committed the homicides and could not be deemed responsible for his criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">At the close of evidence, however, counsel offered an instruction reiterating the language of HRS \u00a7 707-702(2). If given, the instruction would have directed the jury to find the defendant guilty of manslaughter rather than murder if it found he caused the deaths of Greene and Carson while \u201cunder the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance for which there is a reasonable explanation.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In light of our ruling in <em>State v. Manloloyo, </em>61 Haw. 195, 600 P.2d 1139 (1979), the trial court rejected the instruction offered by the defendant. Its instruction on insanity followed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>the language of HRS \u00a7 704-400(1) and advised the jury that a person is not responsible for his criminal conduct \u201cif at the time of the conduct as a result of physical or mental disease, disorder, or defect he lack[ed] substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">The jury found the defendant\u2019s claim of insanity was not sustained by the evidence, and Russo was again convicted of the murders of Greene and Carson. In contrast to the first appeal where counsel raised numerous claims of error, the sole issue pursued by counsel here is \u201cwhether the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury regarding the Defendant\u2019s asserted defense that he acted under the influence of an \u2018extreme emotional disturbance for which there [was] a reasonable explanation.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">A defendant in a criminal case tried before a jury undoubtedly \u201cis entitled to an instruction on every defense or theory of defense having <em>any </em>support in the evidence.\u201d <em>State v. O\u2019Daniel, </em>62 Haw. 518, 527, 616 P.2d 1383, 1390 (1980) (citations omitted) (original emphasis). But \u201cwhere evidentiary support for the asserted defense, or for any of its essential components, is clearly lacking, it would not be error for the trial court either to refuse to charge on the issue or to instruct the jury not to consider it. <em>See United States v. Gosser, </em>339 F.2d 102, 109-110 (6th Cir. 1964).\u201d <em>State v. Horn, </em>58 Haw. 252, 255, 566 P.2d 1378, 1380-81 (1977). The question then is whether or not there was evidence supporting a defense that Russo committed the homicides under the influence of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance that can be reasonably explained. A review of the record indicates there was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">Believing there would be \u201coverwhelming evidence of Patrick Russo\u2019s mental irresponsibility,\u201d defense counsel in his opening statement to the jury proclaimed that \u201con this basis ... at the close of the evidence, I\u2019ll ask you to render a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity.\u201d He subsequently affirmed in a bench confer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>ence that insanity was the only defense being raised.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But he now insists \u201cthere was more than sufficient evidence ... supporting [a] defense [of\u2018extreme mental or emotional disturbance\u2019] and .. . the trial court was thus required to instruct the jury regarding that defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">\u201cThat defense\u201d is one \u201cwhich reduces the offense [from murder] to manslaughter [if] the defendant was, at the time he caused the death of the other person, under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance for which there is a reasonable explanation.\u201d HRS \u00a7 707-702(2). Its roots are lodged in the common law where a person who \u201ckill[ed] another without malice aforethought, under the sudden impulse of passion, excited by provocation or other adequate cause, by the party killed, of a nature tending to disturb the judgment and mental faculties, and weaken the possession of self-control of the killing party, [was] not guilty of murder, but manslaughter.\u201d <em>The King v. Greenwell, </em>1 Haw. 85 [146], 87 [149] (1853). <em>See also The King v. Sherman, </em>1 Haw. 88 [150] (1853).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">The drafters of the Hawaii Penal Code, however, chose not to recommend codification of this rule. Instead of the rule that a homicidal act committed in the \u201cheat of passion\u201d upon \u201cadequate provocation\u201d was manslaughter rather than murder, they adopted a provision serving to reduce murder to manslaughter \u201cwhen mitigating mental or emotional disturbances are present.\u201d <em>See </em>HRS \u00a7 707-702 commentary. The mitigating defense is couched in the language of section 210.3 of the Model Penal Code (M.P.C.), which \u201ctreats on a parity with classic provocation cases situations where the provocative circumstance is something other than an injury inflicted by the deceased on the actor but nonetheless is an event that arouses extreme mental or emotional disturbance.\u201d M.P.C. \u00a7 210.3 comment 3. Clearly, \u201c[t]here is a larger element of subjectivity\u201d here than in the common-law rule. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe ultimate test, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>however, is objective; there must be a \u2018reasonable\u2019 explanation or excuse for the actor\u2019s disturbance.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">The language derived from the model code thus \u201cdoes not authorize mitigation on the basis of individual abnormality without any measure of the defendant against an objective standard.\u201d M.P.C. \u00a7 210.3 comment 5. For \u201c[m]ental disorder clearly does not preclude moral depravity, and there [are] cases where the actor\u2019s mental condition, although recognized as disturbed or abnormal, should be regarded as having no just bearing on his liability for intentional homicide.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We were confronted with such a case in <em>State v. Manloloyo, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">The defendant there was charged with murder and assault in the first degree. He \u201cassert[ed] the defense that he suffered from a mental disease or disorder which exclude[d] criminal responsibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 195 n.l, 600 P.2d at 1140 n.l. \u201cThe diagnosis of the physical and mental condition of [John Manloloyo, Jr.] at the time of the alleged offense . . . was . . . schizoid personality with paranoid and compulsive features (or schizoid personality; depressive neurosis).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 196 n.2, 600 P.2d at 1141 n.2. The jury, however, found the claim of insanity was not substantiated by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">The issue \u201cpresented on [the defendant\u2019s] appeal [was] whether the trial court erred in refusing to give [his] requested instruction on the offense of manslaughter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 193, 600 P.2d at 1139. The instruction would have advised the jury that manslaughter was a lesser included offense of murder and that the prosecution had to prove the defendant did not commit the homicide while \u201cunder the influence of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance for which there is a reasonable explanation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis omitted). In our view, the instruction would have been appropriate if what was offered to support the claim of insanity \u201cconstitutefd] \u2018any evidence ... that raise[d] the question whether the offense [was] murder or manslaughter . .. .\u2019 <em>\"Id. </em>at 196-97, 600 P.2d at 1141 <em>(quoting State v. Warner, </em>58 Haw. 492, 498, 573 P.2d 959, 963 (1977)). \u201cSpecifically,\u201d we said, \u201cthe question then is whether the . .. evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>mental disease or disorder [offered by John Manloloyo, Jr.] fall[s] within the scope of the provision of Section 707-702(2): \u2018while under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance for which there is a reasonable explanation.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Manloloyo, </em>61 Haw. at 197, 600 P.2d at 1141.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">We ruled the evidence fell beyond the scope of the provision because \u201c[t]he facts showfed] .. . appellant did deliberately and intentionally set out to kill and did kill the victim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Though we acknowledged the defendant\u2019s mental disease or disorder arguably \u201cdiminished\u201d his \u201cmental capacity,\u201d we dismissed the argument. \u201c[E]ven a strained construction of the provisions of Section 707-702(2),\u201d we said, \u201cwould not permit \u2018diminished mental capacity\u2019 as a defense which would reduce the offense of murder to an offense of manslaughter\u201d under such circumstances. <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">\u201cThe rule . . . that provocation [could], within narrow bounds, reduce murder to manslaughter, represented] ... a limited concession to natural human weakness.\u201d W. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, <em>Handbook on Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 76, at 582 (1972) (quoting Report of the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment 52-53 (1953)). While HRS \u00a7 707-702(2) \u201crelaxes the rigorous objectivity of the common-law doctrine,\u201d it still \u201crequire[s] that the actor\u2019s emotional distress be based on \u2018reasonable explanation or excuse.\u2019 \u201d M.P.C. \u00a7 210.3 comment 5. This key phrase \u201cpreserves the essentially objective character of the inquiry and erects a barrier against debilitating individualization of the legal standard.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">Like John Manloloyo, Jr., Patrick Russo deliberately set out to kill his victims. Granted, he may have been mentally or emotionally disturbed; but nothing Russo offered in support of his claim of insanity provided \u201ca \u2018reasonable\u2019 explanation or excuse\u201d for his conduct under any test of reasonableness. One who would coolly seek out and intentionally kill the owner and a patron of a bar he once frequented and justify the acts on grounds that habitu\u00e9s of the establishment were \u201cleaving me out\u201d of their activities and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>\u201c[t]hese guys were going to kill me unless I killed them\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> is either insane or morally depraved. A ruling that evidence of this nature also furnishes a basis for mitigating the offense of murder to manslaughter \u201cwould undermine the normative message of the criminal law\u201d communicated via HRS \u00a7\u00a7 707-701 and 707-702.
