The trial court sentenced him to a five year term of imprisonment, but suspended the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-15\">The State appeals the sentence. The State contends that the trial court lacked authority to suspend defendant\u2019s sentence. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>HRS \u00a7 134-8 (1985) prohibits, <em>inter alia, </em>the possession of dangerous weapons, such as machine guns, sawed-off shotguns, and grenades.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The last sentence of that section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-5\">Any person violating this section shall be guilty of a class C felony and shall be imprisoned for a term of five years without probation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">The general rule is that the sentencing court has the authority to suspend imposition of a sentence. HRS \u00a7 706-605 (1985).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> HRS \u00a7 134-8 clearly eliminates probation as a sentencing alternative, but there are no words specifically prohibiting the suspension of a sentence. But the words \u201cshall be imprisoned\u201d strongly suggest that imprisonment is mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">When faced with the task of interpreting and applying a statute, this court\u2019s primary duty \u201cis to ascertain the intention of the legislature and to implement that intention to the fullest degree.\u201d <em>State v. Ui, </em>66 Haw. 366, 371, 663 P.2d 630, 633 (1983) (quoting <em>Keller v. Thompson, </em>56 Haw. 183, 189, 532 P.2d 664, 669 (1975)).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">Prior to 1980, the concern of the legislature over the special danger posed by gun crimes was reflected in the provision of mandatory jail sentences to be applied for violations of HRS Chapter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>134. \u201c[S]evere penalties and incarceration\u201d were deemed necessary \u201cas the only meaningful method of stopping gun crimes.\u201d Sen. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 524, reprinted in 1971 Senate Journal at 1036. These mandatory terms of imprisonment, however, were inconsistent with the Penal Code and were not being applied by sentencing judges. Hse. Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 28-80, reprinted in 1980 House Journal at 1084; Sen. Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 30-80, reprinted in 1980 Senate Journal at 955. In view of this inconsistency, the legislature decided in 1980 to remove the mandatory penalties in Chapter 134, <em>except </em>as to \u00a7 134-8. The mandatory imprisonment provision for violating \u00a7 134-8 was retained because</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Azqe\"><em>Alexa D. M.

The manufacture, possession, sale, barter, trade, gift, transfer, or acquisition of any machine guns, submachine guns, automatic rifles, or rifles with barrel lengths less than sixteen inches, or shotguns with barrel lengths less than eighteen inches, cannon, mufflers, silencers, or devices for deadening or muffling the sound of discharged firearms, or any hand grenade, dynamite, or other explosives, blasting caps, bombs, or bombshell, or any type of ammunition, or any projectile component thereof, which is coated with teflon or any other similar coating or which is designed primarily to enhance its capability to penetrate metal or pierce protective armor, and any type of ammunition, or any projectile component thereof, designed or intended to explode or segment upon impact with its target, is prohibited. Any person violating this section shall be guilty of a class C felony and shall be imprisoned for a term of five years, without probation.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b497-11\"> In pertinent part, \u00a7 706-605 (1985) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-12\">(1) Except as provided in section 706-606 and subject to the applicable provisions of this Code, the court may suspend the imposition of sentence on a person who has been convicted of a crime[.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b497-13\"> We note that Act 314, Session Laws of Hawaii 1986, deletes suspension of sentence as a sentencing alternative. However, that Act applies to offenses committed after January 1, 1987, and is, therefore, inapplicable to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b498-12\"> In this case, the question of whether the paroling authority can establish a minimum term of imprisonment of less than five years is not before this court to decide.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
