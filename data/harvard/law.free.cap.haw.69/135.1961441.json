HOH appealed to the Circuit Court of the First Circuit, asserting the finding was erroneous and the foregoing section of the statute, on its face and as applied, was constitutionally infirm. The circuit court affirmed the Board\u2019s decision and order without considering the claims of constitutional infirmity, but we conclude the court should have heard them. Thus, we vacate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>judgment and remand the case for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">HOH Corporation is a distributor of motor vehicles manufactured by American Honda Motor Co., Inc. Its responsibilities as the Honda distributor in Hawaii include the selection of dealers and the assignment of sales territories. Brodie-Crackel, Inc. (Brodie) became a Honda dealer in 1973 when it was granted a franchise to sell Hondas in the Kaneohe area.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Dorothy and Clyde Gordon (the Gordons) were granted an exclusive, island-wide franchise to sell Honda motorcycles on Kauai in 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">In the middle of 1980, HOH sent every Honda dealer in Hawaii a \u201cRetail Dealers Agreement.\u201d The form agreement proposed to grant each of them a \u201cnon-exclusive priviledge [sic] to sell [Honda vehicles] at retail\u201d in a \u201cprimary area of responsibility.\u201d The agreements Brodie and the Gordons received, however, did not desig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>nate primary areas of responsibility. The dealers were nevertheless asked to sign and return the incomplete documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Brodie and the Gordons refused to do so, voicing objections to signing franchise agreements that did not assign sales territories. The distributor insisted \u201cthere [was] no leeway for negotiations\u201d and repeated its earlier bidding. The recalcitrant dealers continued to resist the demand despite reminders that a dealer could only operate under a \u201cRetail Dealers Agreement.\u201d The distributor, however, did not move directly to terminate the dealerships. But it allowed others to sell Honda motor vehicles in the territories that Brodie and the Gordons felt were primarily theirs.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">When the two dealers found themselves in financial straits thereafter, they ascribed their plight to the enfranchisement of other Honda dealers in their sales territories. The financially strapped dealers eventually brought their dispute with HOH to the attention of the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs of the State of Hawaii (DCCA) for possible disciplinary action against the distributor under the Motor Vehicle Industry Licensing Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">DCCA investigated the allegations of misconduct levelled at the distributor and decided there were grounds for disciplinary action. The complaint filed with the Motor Vehicle Industry Licensing Board on behalf of the two dealers charged in part that HOH violated the provisions of HRS \u00a7 437-28(b)(22) when it \u201cattempted to coerce [Brodie] and the Gordons to enter into new franchise agreements materially different from their valid existing agreements by threatening to cancel or failing to renew their franchises [in the event the dealers] fail[ed] to sign the new agreements,\u201d by \u201cthreatening to award Honda franchises to other persons,\u201d and by failing to renew their franchise agreements \u201cwithout good faith.\u201d <em>See </em>HRS \u00a7 437-28(b)(22).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">The Motor Vehicle Industry Licensing Board referred the matter to a hearings officer, who conducted a full-scale evidentiary hearing and submitted a report. In her fifty-page report to the Board, the hearings officer recounted the relevant facts in detail and set out her proposed findings and conclusions. And she recommended that the charges alleging violations of HRS \u00a7 437-28(b)(22)(A) and (B) be dismissed, that the charge of a violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>HRS \u00a7 437-28(b)(22)(C) be sustained, and that HOH be fined $2,000, the maximum imposable under the licensing law for violations of HRS \u00a7 437-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">The Board adopted the hearings officer\u2019s proposed findings and conclusions as its own and ordered HOH to pay a fine of $2,000 after considering the distributor\u2019s exceptions to the report. Invoking applicable provisions of the Hawaii Administrative Procedure Act, HRS chapter 91, HOH appealed the agency determination to the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">In the Statement of Case submitted concurrently with the designation of the record on appeal, as required by Rule 72(e) of the Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> HOH denied any statutory violation and averred for the first time that the pertinent portion of the statute regulating the conduct of motor vehicle distributors was unconstitutional, facially and as applied. DCCA\u2019s plea in response to these averments of constitutional infirmity was that HOH\u2019s failure to raise the issues before the Board precluded the court from considering them on appeal. The court agreed with HOH that the regulatory board could not have adjudicated the constitutionality of the statute from which it derived its power to act. But the court also agreed with DCCA that judicial review of the agency determination should be \u201cconfined to issues properly raised in the record of the administrative proceedings below.\u201d Inasmuch as the constitutional issues were not matters of record, the court affirmed the Board\u2019s decision and order without passing on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">The Honda distributor appeals to this court, arguing the circuit court erred in refusing to consider its constitutional claims. It urges that the state law regulating motor vehicle distributors and dealers has been preempted by federal legislation, HRS \u00a7 437-28(b)(22)(C) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>is void because its prohibitions are not clearly defined, and the section was applied to inhibit commercial free speech.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We would have to agree that when the circuit court considered the appeal from the decision and order of the Motor Vehicle Industry Licensing Board, it should have examined HOH\u2019s constitutional claims too and ruled on them if it could.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">We cannot fault the circuit court\u2019s declaration that \u201c[t]he Board [was] not empowered to adjudicate the constitutionality of its governing statute . . . . \u201d Although an administrative \u201cagency may always determine questions about its own jurisdiction [it] generally lacks power to pass upon constitutionality of a statute. The law has long been clear that agencies may not nullify statutes. <em>Public Utilities Commission v. United States, </em>355 U.S. 534, 539 (1958); <em>Oestereich v. Selective Service Board, </em>393 U.S. 233, 242 [(1968)] (Harlan, J., concurring); <em>Johnson v. Robison, </em>415 U.S. 361, 368 (1974); <em>Weinberger v. Salfi, </em>422 U.S. 749, 765 (1975); <em>Moore v. City of East Cleveland, </em>431 U.S. 494, 526 (1977) (Burger, C.J., dissenting).\u201d 4 K. Davis, <em>Administrative Law Treatise </em>\u00a7 26:6, at 434 (2d ed. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Nor do we have reason to question the pronouncement that judicial review of an agency determination must be \u201cconfined to issues properly raised in the record of the administrative proceedings below.\u201d For under the Hawaii Administrative Procedure Act, \u201c[t]he review [is] conducted by the appropriate court without a jury and [is] confined to the record[.]\u201d HRS \u00a7 91-14(f). Still, it does not necessarily follow that the constitutional issues posed by the motor vehicle distributor were not cognizable by the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">In the Statement of Case submitted to the circuit court, HOH averred that HRS \u00a7 437-28(b)(22)(C) is \u201cvague, ambiguous, and overbroad\u201d and that it was applied in violation of state and federal constitutional provisions. The appellant thus challenged the consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>tutionality of legislative, as well as administrative, action. The circuit court undoubtedly could have entertained both claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">The \u201cdelicate and difficult office [of ascertaining] whether . . . legislation is in accordance with, or in contravention of, [constitutional] provisions\u201d is confided to the courts. <em>United States v. Butler, </em>297 U.S. 1, 63 (1936). \u201c[U]nder our frame of government, no other place is provided where the citizen may be heard to urge that the law [as written by the legislature] fails to conform to the [constitutional] limits set upon the use of [governmental] power.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 67. And the several circuit courts of the State have power to decide whether a provision of the Motor Vehicle Industry Licensing Act, on its face, is unconstitutional. For they \u201chave jurisdiction, except as otherwise expressly provided by statute, of: ... [c]ivil actions and proceedings.\u201d HRS \u00a7 603-21.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">The circuit courts are vested also with authority to determine whether administrative action has transgressed constitutional limits. The Administrative Procedure Act allows a circuit court, \u201c[u]pon review of the record [to] reverse or modify the decision and order [of the agency] if the substantial rights of the [appellant] may have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, conclusions, decisions, or orders, are . .. [i]n violation of <em>constitutional </em>or statutory provisions[.]\u201d HRS \u00a7 91-14(g)(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">The circuit court chose not to exercise its jurisdiction to review the constitutionality of HRS \u00a7 437-28(b)(22)(C) as written and as applied on grounds that judicial review is \u201cconfined to issues properly raised in the record of the administrative proceedings below.\u201d We would not fault the court if the appellant\u2019s claims were only that. \u201cthe administrative findings, conclusions, decisionf], [and] order[] are . .. [c]learly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record[,] or [arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>See </em>HRS \u00a7 91-14(g)(5) and (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">But the appellant further asserted HRS \u00a7 437-28(b)(22)(C) is unconstitutional on its face and was applied in violation of constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>tional provisions. \u201cWhere the statute is attacked on its face, the agency decision will rarely aid in the ultimate judicial resolution of the [claim].\u201d B. Schwartz, <em>Administrative Law </em>\u00a7 8.37, at 519 (2d ed. 1984). Whether the statute is vague or not is a question of law which ordinarily can be resolved by examining the manifestation of legislative policy. Where the challenge is to the statute as administered, the agency\u2019s findings, conclusions, decision and order are measured against constitutional standards. And the issues must be framed within the factual context of the record made before the agency. <em>See </em>HRS \u00a7 91-14(g). \u201cWhen determination of the constitutional issue depends on factual determinations, they should be made first by the administrative officials who are especially equipped to inquire, in the first instance, into the facts.\u201d B. Schwartz, <em>supra </em>(footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Yet, constitutionality or not in the particular circumstances is a legal question originally cognizable in the circuit court. <em>See </em>HRS \u00a7\u00a7603-21.5 and 91-14(g)(1). Were it not so, there would be no judicial review of the pertinent legislative and administrative actions. The administrative agency is not empowered to pass on the validity of the statute; nor is it qualified to adjudicate the propriety of its own action.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">As we noted, HOH, as one \u201caggrieved by a final decision and order in a contested case,\u201d sought judicial review of the administrative action by filing a notice of appeal in the circuit court. <em>See </em>HRS \u00a7 91-14(a). Concurrently with the designation of appeal, the appellant filed a Statement of Case as directed by HRCP 72, urging for the first time that the administrative action as well as the supporting legislation should be invalidated on constitutional grounds. A cursory reading of HRS \u00a7 91-14(f), which mandates that \u201c[t]he review shall be conducted by the appropriate court. . . and shall be confined to the record,\u201d could leave one with the impression that the request for judicial review of the legislative action was out of order. But in our view the request, though made concomitantly with the appeal from the administrative agency, was timely and appropriate.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ar\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number><em>Randolph R. Slaton (Williams, Slaton &amp; Yantada, </em>of counsel) for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b182-9\"><em>Winfred K.T. Pong (Susan Tamura Sato </em>on the brief), Deputy Attorneys General, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">One seeking judicial review of administrative action, of course, would invoke HRS \u00a7 91-14 and the procedures outlined there and in HRCP 72. HOH did as directed, but prayed that the court subject the underlying legislation to constitutional scrutiny too. We think this was proper, since \u201cnothing in [HRS \u00a7 91-14] shall be deemed to prevent resort to other means of review, redress, [or] relief.. . provided by law.\u201d HRS \u00a7 91-14(a). That the request was coupled with another for relief expressly authorized by HRS \u00a7 91-14 should not preclude the circuit court from considering the request and affording redress or relief if warranted. <em>Cf. Head-On Collision Line, Inc. v. Kirk, </em>36 Ill. App. 3d 263, 268, 343 N.E.2d 534, 538 (1976) (\u201cConstitutional questions may be raised for the first time in a complaint for administrative review.\u201d); <em>Perez v. Webb, </em>533 S.W.2d 650, 655 (Mo. Ct. App. 1976) (\u201cThat judicial review of administrative proceedings \u2018may\u2019 include constitutional questions at the circuit court level, is no longer open to doubt.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The appellant\u2019s decision to challenge the statute\u2019s facial validity at the same time it challenged the administrative action promoted the judicious use of scarce judicial resources. Moreover, the possibility of constitutional questions being decided in a vacuum was extinguished thereby. Though we recognize \u201cthe agency decision will rarely aid in the ultimate judicial resolution\u201d of a challenge of the law as written, there are cases where even this question \u201cwill be better framed by the structure of a factual context.\u201d B. Schwartz, <em>supra </em>(footnote omitted). For example, if preemption had been properly raised in the circuit court, coverage under the challenged state statute and the related federal act would have been an issue. And the resolution of one of the constitutional questions posed for judicial determination would have been aided by facts developed in the agency hearing. <em>See W.E.B. DuBois Clubs v. Clark, </em>389 U.S. 309, 312 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">The judgment of the circuit court is vacated, and the case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b175-11\"> HRS \u00a7 437-28(b)(22)(C) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-12\">(b) Grounds for suspension, revocation, fine, or denial of issuance or renewal of a license.
