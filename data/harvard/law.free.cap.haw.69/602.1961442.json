The trial court, after hearing and briefing on the issue, denied the request for the DANC plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-21\">Defendant-Appellant Daniel Mun Chung Tom was arrested on April 2, 1987 for DUI and for failing to submit to a breath test in violation of the implied consent statute, HRS \u00a7 286-155. He en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>tered a no contest plea for the DUI charge in exchange for the State\u2019s nolle prosequi of the implied consent violation. After the trial court accepted the plea, Tom orally moved for a DANC plea. After receiving memoranda from the parties, the trial court orally denied the motion for a DANC plea. Tom\u2019s execution of sentence has been stayed pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">The grant or denial of a motion for a DANC or Deferred Acceptance of Guilty plea is within the discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed unless there has been manifest abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Karwacki, </em>1 Haw. App. 157, 159-60, 616 P.2d 226, 228 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">The trial court ruled it was beyond its discretion to grant DANC; it relied on several grounds in refusing to allow the plea. The court held that HRS \u00a7 853-4(5) indicates that a DANC plea is not available in cases involving nonprobationable offenses; that the provisions of HRS \u00a7 291-4 call for mandatory sentencing without the possibility of probation; that State <em>v. Rice, </em>66 Haw. 101, 657 P.2d 1026 (1983), supports this interpretation; and finally, that allowing a DANC plea could avoid the DUI enhanced sentencing scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">HRS \u00a7\u00a7 853-4(4) and 853-4(5) state, \u201c[t]his chapter shall not apply when:... (4) The offense charged is a class A felony; (5) The offense charged is nonprobationable.\u201d HRS \u00a7 291-4(b) provides that \u201c[a] person committing the offense of driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor shall be sentenced as follows without possibility of probation or suspension of sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">Tom argues that HRS \u00a7 853-4(5) is meant to be read in conjunction with HRS \u00a7 853-4(4), and therefore, that the restriction is upon nonprobationable class A felonies. This interpretation is without merit. HRS \u00a7 853-4 provides twenty-four exceptions to application of the statute, all separated by semicolons. Thus, there is no basis for claiming that only sections (4) and (5) are to be read conjunctively. Further, if all the sections are read together, the chapter would never be applied. Statutes must be read so as to give them effect. <em>Levy v. Kimball, </em>51 Haw. 540, 545, 465 P.2d 580, 583 (1970).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AkzF\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number><em>Christopher R. Evans </em>for defendant-appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b642-12\"><em>Arthur E. Ross, </em>Deputy Prosecuting Attorney <em>(Mary Shin, </em>Law Clerk, with him on the brief) for plaintiff-appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">In <em>State v. Rice, supra, </em>we held that a DAG plea was not available in a prostitution case. The statutory language of HRS \u00a7712-1200(4) regarding sentencing in prostitution cases states that a sentence would be imposed according to the statute \u201c[n]otwithstanding any other law to the contrary[.]\u201d The language of HRS \u00a7 291-4(b) states that a person convicted \u201cshall be sentenced as follows without possibility of probation[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Although the language of the prostitution statute is more explicit in limiting the sentence to that provided within the statute, the language of the DUI statute is sufficiently clear in mandating the sentence to be imposed. The analogy of <em>Rice </em>to the case at bar is especially apt as both statutes involve an enhanced sentencing scheme for multiple offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">The trial court also denied the plea on the basis of the sentencing scheme in the DUI statute. HRS \u00a7 853-1(b) provides that \u201c[t]he proceedings may be deferred upon any of the conditions specified by \u00a7 706-624 [conditions of suspension of sentence or probation]. The court may defer the proceedings for such period of time as the court shall direct <em>but in no case to exceed the maximum sentence allowable.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Under HRS \u00a7 291-4 the maximum sentence permitted is six months. Thus, any conditions accompanying the DANC plea could last for only six months. The DUI statute provides for an enhanced sentencing scheme for multiple offenses within a five year period. A repeat offender given a DANC plea on the first offense could thus escape enhanced sentencing under the DUI statute by committing a second offense after DANC jurisdiction had expired but within the five year period of the DUI sentencing scheme. This result would contravene the recognized serious nature of a DUI offense. <em>State v. Leatiota, </em>69 Haw._, 739 P.2d 930 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">We find no error of law by the trial court and affirm the denial of the DANC plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-10\">Affirmed and remanded for execution of sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
