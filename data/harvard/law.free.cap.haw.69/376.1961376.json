John Knodle, her father, suing on his own behalf and as the administrator of her estate, brought a multi-count tort action in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit against Murphy, Continental Air Lines, and the hotel, its owners, and its operators. After default was entered against Murphy and summary judgment was awarded to Continental Air Lines,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the negligence claims against the remaining defendants were tried before a jury. The jury, on interrogatories propounded by the trial judge, returned a special verdict finding Waikiki Gateway Hotel Associates, Hyatt Corporation, Continental-Kalakaua Hotel Corp., and Northridge Industries, Inc., the hotel\u2019s owners and operators, each \u201chad a duty to take reasonable measures to safeguard Linda Kay Knodle from the foreseeable criminal acts of third parties,\u201d but none of them \u201cbreached that duty.\u201d The plaintiff appeals from the judgment that followed, urging the trial judge erred by not permitting \u201cevidence of all reported criminal activity at and near the hotel\u201d to be admitted at trial, by improperly instructing the jury \u201con proximate causation and foreseeability,\u201d and by not granting \u201cjudgment notwithstanding the verdict or, at the least, a new trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">We are satisfied from a careful review of the record that the trial judge\u2019s rulings on the admissibility of evidence of \u201creported criminal activity at and near the hotel\u201d were correct. But after reading the court\u2019s instructions, we conclude the judge committed reversible error, as the plaintiff avers, in instructing the jury that \u201c[a]n act is reasonably foreseeable if it appears to have been ordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>nary or usual under all the circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We are convinced the judge\u2019s charge to the jury did not provide \u201csuch explanation and instruction concerning the matter ... submitted as [was] necessary to enable the jury to make its findings\u201d in other respects too. Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) 49(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Linda Knodle arrived in Honolulu on the fateful day at about 2:00 a.m. on a Continental Air Lines flight from Guam. She was not one of the attendants assigned to duty on the flight; she was \u201criding on a pass given by her employer and going back to Chicago\u201d for the Thanksgiving holiday. Shortly after the plane landed, the two flight attendants who \u201cworked\u201d the flight left the airport in a taxicab to go to the Waikiki Gateway Hotel, where Continental\u2019s flight crews were housed during \u201clayovers\u201d in Honolulu. Linda Knodle could not leave with them because she was detained in Customs. She caught a ride later with several Continental pilots and reached the hotel shortly before 5:00 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">When they arrived, the pilots carried Linda Knodle\u2019s bags into the lobby. She went to the front desk where she was greeted by the Assistant Manager and the Night Auditor, both of whom she knew from previous stays at the hotel. She then asked the Night Auditor to place a telephone call to the pilot who had been the Captain of the flight from Guam. After a half-hour conversation with the Captain, in which they talked about the possibility of having a party on his boat but decided not to, Ms. Knodle resumed her conversation with the two hotel employees. The pilots with whom she rode to the hotel were gone, having left earlier upon learning the Captain was reluctant to host a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">Ms. Knodle then started to fill out a guest registration card. But before she finished, she asked the Assistant Manager about the two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>attendants on the flight from Guam and the rooms they were occupying. Upon learning one was in a room with two beds, she asked for a key to the room, Room 1006. The Assistant Manager handed her a key to the tenth-floor room and tore up the registration card. Ms. Knodle then carried two pieces of her luggage to one of the hotel\u2019s three elevators and went back to fetch the remaining bags.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Meanwhile, George Murphy came into the lobby, walked to the elevators, and entered the one in which Ms. Knodle had placed her bags. The Assistant Manager saw this and yelled, \u201c[h]old the elevator.\u201d Murphy held the door open while Ms. Knodle picked up the rest of her luggage and entered the elevator. The door then closed, and the elevator ascended to the upper floors. The two employees at the front desk resumed what they had been doing earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">At about 6:30 a.m., the Night Auditor was informed by a guest who was checking out that there was \u201csome extra luggage [in] the elevator.\u201d The Auditor removed the bags from the elevator and took them to the front desk. When he examined the luggage tags, he realized the bags belonged to Ms. Knodle. He discussed the matter with the Assistant Manager, but they decided not to disturb her because they assumed she was asleep in her room.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">A maintenance man who came to work at 7:00 a.m. found the key to a tenth-floor guest room later on in a fourth-floor hallway. He \u201cnoticed ... the key didn\u2019t belong on that floor,\u201d asked the first guest he saw whether the guest had misplaced the key to his room, and \u201ctook the key downstairs to the clerk\u2019s counter\u201d thereafter, telling the desk clerk \u201cI found the key on the fourth floor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">Shortly after 9:00 a.m., Linda Knodle\u2019s body was discovered in a restroom adjoining the laundry room on the fourth floor. A guest came upon Ms. Knodle\u2019s inert form, assumed she was ill, and called the Manager, informing him that \u201csomeone is ill in the bathroom.\u201d The Manager responded to the call, but discovered she was dead. She had been strangled to death by George Patrick Murphy sometime between 5:15 a.m. and 9:00 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-11\">John Knodle filed suit on November 24, 1976, nearly two years after the lamentable occurrence. His first complaint named Mur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>phy, Waikiki Gateway Hotel, Inc. and John Does 1 through 20 as defendants and alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that Murphy \u201cbrutally assaulted and murdered [Linda Kay Knodle] on the premises of the Waikiki Gateway Hotel\u201d and Waikiki Gateway Hotel, Inc. and Does 1 through 5 did not \u201cprovide safe accommodations for... Linda Kay Knodle\u201d and \u201cadequate security to protect [her] from the unreasonable risk of physical harm.\u201d Continental Air Lines and the owners and operators of the hotel were identified subsequently as the origin\u00e1lly unidentifiable defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">The plaintiff proceeded to trial against the hotel\u2019s owners and operators after conducting extensive discovery and twice amending his complaint. The claims tried were: \u201c(1) That the defendants were negligent; and (2) That the defendants acted wantonly and with reckless disregard for the safety of Linda Knodle.\u201d The jury found the defendants had breached no duty owing to Linda Knodle, and John Knodle appeals from the judgment entered on the verdict returned by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Having found no merit in the plaintiffs assertion of error regarding the circuit court\u2019s evidentiary rulings at trial, we focus on the contention that the jury was improperly instructed \u201con proximate causation and foreseeability.\u201d We begin our examination of the issue with a review of HRCP 49(a), which governs when a trial court submits a case to a jury for \u201ca special written finding upon each issue of fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">When, as here, the trial court \u201crequire[s] a jury to return only a special verdict in the form of a special written finding upon each issue of fact,\u201d HRCP 49(a) compels the judge to \u201cgive to the jury such explanation and instruction concerning the matter thus submitted as may be necessary to enable the jury to make its findings upon each issue.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As aptly put by the Intermediate Court of Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>peals, the judge should \u201cexplain the law of the case, . .. point out the essentials to be proved on one side or the other, and ... bring into view the relation of the particular evidence adduced to the particular issues involved.\u201d <em>McKeague v. Talbert, </em>3 Haw. App. 646, 657, 658 P.2d 898, 906 (1983) (citing 75 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Trial </em>\u00a7 573 (1974)); <em>see DiCenzo v. Izawa, </em>68 Haw_,_, 723 P.2d 171, 178 (1986); <em>Kaeo v. Davis, </em>68 Haw_,_, 719 P.2d 387, 394 (1986). And all this must be done \u201cin such a manner that [the jury will] not be misled.\u201d <em>McKeague v. Talbert, </em>3 Haw. App. at 657, 658 P.2d at 906. This is no simple task where the claims for damages \u201crest upon the negligence concept\u201d; for there, \u201cwe find neither simplicity, crystallization of rule .. . , nor a process subject to high standardization.\u201d L. Green, <em>Rationale of Proximate Cause </em>63-64 (1927).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">The plaintiff posited theories of liability premised on allegations that the defendants negligently failed to provide \u201csafe accommodations\u201d and \u201cadequate security to protect [Linda Knodle] from the unreasonable risk of physical harm\u201d and this wanton and reckless disregard for her safety justified the assessment of punitive, as well as compensatory, damages against them.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Tersely stated, the elements of a cause of action founded on negligence are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>1.

Applegate, </em>62 Haw. 131, 137, 612 P.2d 533, 538-39 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">The existence of a duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff, \u201cthat is, \u2018whether .. . such a relation exists between the parties that the community will impose a legal obligation upon one for the benefit of the other \u2014 or, more simply, whether the interest of the plaintiff which has suffered invasion was entitled to legal protection at the hands of the defendant,\u2019 is entirely a question of law.\u201d <em>Bidar v. Amfac, Inc., </em>66 Haw. 547, 553, 669 P.2d 154, 158 (1983) (quoting W. Prosser, <em>Handbook of the Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 37, at 206 (4th ed. 1971)). Whether there was a breach of duty or not, i.e. whether there was a failure on the defendant\u2019s part to exercise reasonable care, is a question for the trier of fact. \u201cFor \u2018[u]nder the prevailing rule duty ... is bounded by the foreseeable range of danger,\u2019 and \u2018[Reasonable foreseeability of harm is the very prototype of the question a jury must pass upon in particularizing the standard of conduct in the case before it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bidar v. Amfac, Inc., </em>66 Haw. at 552-53, 669 P.2d at 159 (quoting 2 F. Harper &amp; F. James, <em>The Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 18.8, at 1059 (1956)). The presence of a reasonably close connection between the defendant\u2019s conduct and the plaintiffs injury, i.e. \u201c[w]hether the breach of duty was more likely than not a substantial factor in causing the harm complained of is normally a question for the [jury <em>too].\u201d Bidar v. Amfac, Inc., </em>66 Haw. at 553, 669 P.2d at 159 (citation omitted). And \u201cit is the court\u2019s function to direct the jury as to what items [of damages] they may consider and the jury\u2019s function to determine which of such items were actually suffered.\u201d L. Green, <em>supra, </em>at 187. \u201c[T]he proper amount of damages, [of course], is within the exclusive province of the jury, since [jurors] are the sole judges of all disputed questions of fact.\u201d <em>Dias v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number><em>Vanek, </em>67 Haw. 114, 117, 679 P.2d 133, 135 (1984) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Thus, in the trial of a negligence action, apart from \u201cdirecting the court\u2019s business in general, passing on the admissibility of evidence and the like, the judge has three well-defined major functions.\u201d L. Green, <em>supra, </em>at 66. He must decide whether \u201csuch a relation exists between the parties that the community [would] impose a legal obligation upon one for the benefit of the other,\u201d <em>Bidar v. Amfac, Inc., </em>66 Haw. at 552, 669 P.2d at 158; he must decide \u201con the whole evidence relating to a particular issue [of fact] whether more than one reasonable inference can be drawn, that is whether there is an issue for the jury\u2019s determination,\u201d L. Green, <em>supra, </em>at 67; and \u201c[i]f both of the preceding functions have been exercised favorably for [the] plaintiff . . . , then the judge must submit the [factual] issues that may have been raised to the jury with such instructions as will enable the jury to deal with them intelligently.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">\n<em>C.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">When the relation is a special one of innkeeper and guest, the former is under a duty to take reasonable action to protect the latter against unreasonable risk of physical harm. <em>See Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 314A (1965). The duty of an innkeeper or hotel operator to protect his guest \u201cextends to [unreasonable] risks arising out of [his] own conduct, or the condition of his land or chattels.\u201d <em>Id. </em>comment d; <em>see Bidar v. Amfac, Inc., </em>66 Haw. at 552, 669 P.2d at 159. \u201cIt extends also to [unreasonable] risks arising from ... the acts of third persons, whether they be innocent, negligent, intentional, or even criminal,\u201d <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts, supra, </em>comment d, though \u201c[generally, a defendant is not responsible for (that is, he has no duty to control) the behavior of a third person[.]\u201d <em>Seibel v. City </em>&amp; <em>County, </em>61 Haw. 253, 257, 602 P.2d 532, 536 (1979). The existence of \u201ca \u2018special relationship\u2019 between the defendant and either the third person who may threaten harm or the party who is the [potential] victim of the harm,\u201d however, gives the latter a right to protection from unreasonable risks arising from the acts of the third person. <em>Id. </em>(relying on <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number><em>supra, </em>\u00a7 315);<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>see also Wolsk v.

No special relationship existed under the circumstances.).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Whether the defendant had a duty to take reasonable action to protect the plaintiff from unreasonable risk of harm is, of course, a question for the judge. But what is reasonable and unreasonable and whether the defendant\u2019s conduct was reasonable in the circumstances are for the jury to decide. Put simply, perhaps simplistically, what is reasonable care on the part of the defendant is \u201cwhat a reasonable and prudent person would . . . have done under [the] circumstances.\u201d <em>Wong v. City </em>&amp; <em>County, </em>66 Haw. 389, 394-95, 665 P.2d 157, 161 (1983) (quoting <em>Martin v. Wilson, </em>23 Haw. 74, 88 (1915)).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cThe conduct of [this mythical] person will vary with the situation with which he is confronted.\u201d W.P. Keeton, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 32, at 175. For what is reasonable and prudent in the particular circumstances is marked out by the foreseeable range of danger. <em>Bidar v. Amfac, Inc., </em>66 Haw. at 552, 669 P.2d at 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Danger in this context \u201cnecessarily involves a recognizable danger, based upon some knowledge of the existing facts, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>some reasonable belief that harm may possibly follow.\u201d W.P. Keeton, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 31, at 170 (footnote omitted). The test of what is reasonably foreseeable is not one of a balance of probabilities. \u201cThat the danger will more probably than otherwise not be encountered on a particular occasion does not dispense with the exercise of care.\u201d <em>Tullgren v. Amoskeag Manufacturing Co., </em>82 N.H. 268, 276, 133 A. 4, 8 (1926). The test is whether \u201cthere is some probability of harm sufficiently serious that [a reasonable and prudent person] would take precautions to avoid it.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Griggs v. Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>513 F.2d 851, 859 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 865 (1975); <em>Moran v. Faberge, Inc., </em>273 Md. 538, 552-54, 332 A.2d 11, 20 (1975); <em>Bean v. Ross Manufacturing Co., </em>344 S.W.2d 18, 25 (Mo. 1961). \u201cAs the gravity of the possible harm increases, the apparent likelihood of its occurrence need be correspondingly less to generate a duty of precaution.\u201d W.P. Keeton, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 31, at 171 (footnote omitted).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> And \u201c[a]gainst this probability, and gravity, of the risk, must be balanced in every case the utility of the type of conduct in question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the judge\u2019s task of imparting what may be reasonable care or the converse to enable the jury to decide if a breach of duty occurred is, to say the least, difficult.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>E.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">Inasmuch as causal relation is one of fact, \u201c[i]t is [a question] for the jury, <em>except </em>when the facts are such that they will support only one reasonable inference.\u201d L. Green, <em>supra, </em>at 132 (emphasis in original). Explaining when the law deems that there is a reasonably close connection between the defendant\u2019s conduct and the plaintiffs injury as to render the defendant accountable for his conduct can be as formidable a task as the preceding one.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The difficulty may be enhanced if a third person\u2019s misconduct can be said to be an active cause of the harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">\u201cProximate cause,\u201d the term employed by many courts to characterize this legally sufficient causal relation, is \u201cin itself an unfortunate term.\u201d W.P. Keeton, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 41, at 264. It might have been apt in an earlier time; but in the complex society of the late twentieth century, a negligent tort is as likely as not to have plural or concurring causes. And it is not only the \u201cnext\u201d or \u201cnearest\u201d cause that the law considers close enough to make a defendant responsible for the injury suffered by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Some courts stepping away from literal \u201cproximate causation\u201d adopted a \u201cbut for\u201d rule. Thereunder, \u201c[t]he defendant\u2019s conduct is a cause of the event if the event would not have occurred but for that conduct; conversely, the defendant\u2019s conduct is not a cause of the event, if the event would have occurred without it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 266 (footnote omitted). The test serves to explain culpable causation in most cases. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe problem with the \u2018but for\u2019 test is that it may not cover the situation where two or more causes [can be perceived yet] none of them alone would have produced the resulting harm].\u201d 1 J. Dooley, <em>Modem Tort Law </em>\u00a7 8.02, at 227 (1982) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">The inadequacies in earlier rules or tests for determining the necessary causal connection led to a \u201cformulation [emphasizing] legal significance rather than factual quantum.\u201d W.P. Keeton, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number><em>supra, </em>\u00a7 41, at 267 (footnote omitted). Under the guidelines developed by the American Law Institute (A.L.I.) in its <em>Restatement of Torts, </em>\u201c[t]he actor\u2019s negligent conduct is a legal cause of harm to another if (a) his conduct is a substantial factor in bringing about the harm ... .\u201d <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts, supra, </em>\u00a7 431. Finding this measure of blameworthiness was \u201c[t]he best definition and the most workable test of proximate or legal cause so far suggested,\u201d we adopted it in <em>Mitchell v. Branch, </em>45 Haw. 128, 132, 363 P.2d 969, 973 (1961). In affirming a judgment in favor of the plaintiff, we said the defendant\u2019s negligence \u201cneed not have been the whole cause or the only factor [in bringing about the harm]. It was enough that his negligence was a substantial factor in causing plaintiffs injuries.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">The A.L.I. formula is not without critics; it has been criticized as not going far enough and being too general. But we are convinced \u201cthat \u2018substantial factor\u2019 is a phrase sufficiently intelligible to furnish an adequate guide in instructions to the jury, and that it is neither possible nor desirable to reduce it to any lower terms.\u201d W.P. Keeton, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 41, at 267. \u201cSubstantial factor in bringing about the harm,\u201d therefore, is still the touchstone when the issue of causal relation must be submitted to the jury. <em>See Bidar v. Amfac, Inc., </em>66 Haw. at 553, 669 P.2d at 159; <em>McKenna v.

Willis, </em>59 Haw. 319, 326, 582 P.2d 710, 715 (1978) (citations omitted), and we cannot say the error was harmless, we are compelled to vacate the judgment. Though the claim of error here is centered on an instruction in which the judge explained \u201csuperseding caiise\u201d and \u201creasonably foreseeable risk of criminal harm,\u201d in reading the instructions relating to the damage claims founded on negligence, we notice the judge plainly erred in other respects. In view of the impending retrial of the case, we discuss these errors as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">After apprising the jury that George Patrick Murphy failed to respond to the complaint and should be considered liable for the harm sustained, the judge proceeded to explain the negligence claim brought by the plaintiff against the hotel\u2019s owners and operators. The relevant instruction read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-6\">The plaintiffs first claim against the defendants is that they were negligent. In order to find that the defendants were negligent, you must find the following elements:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-7\">(1) That the defendants owed Linda Knodle a duty;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-8\">(2) That the defendants breached that duty;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-9\">(3) That Linda Knodle\u2019s death was proximately caused by that breach of duty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">The instruction thus served to delineate the elements of negligence as viewed by the judge and directed the jury to find the defendants were negligent only if they owed Linda Knodle a duty, the duty was breached, and her death was \u201cproximately caused\u201d by the breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-11\">Yet whether there is a duty or not \u201cis entirely a question of law,\u201d <em>Bidar v. Amfac, Inc., </em>66 Haw. at 552, 669 P.2d at 158, and it was error for the judge to submit that question to the jury for a finding.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We have misgivings about the reference to \u201cproximate cause\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>too. While its use in the foregoing context probably had no harmful effect, we think an avoidance of the term would have been the better part of discretion, given our acceptance of \u201csubstantial factor\u201d rather than \u201cproximate cause\u201d as the norm for finding the defendant\u2019s negligence was a legally sufficient, cause of the harm that befell Linda Knodle.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">\u201cThe \u2018proximate cause\u2019 of an injury\u201d was then defined as \u201cthat cause which in direct, unbroken sequence, produces the injury, and without which the injury would not have occurred.\u201d This was clearly a misstatement of the law. We have moved beyond the strictures of \u201cdirect, unbroken sequence\u201d in the consideration of legal causation. It was error also to speak of legal cause as that \u201cwithout which the injury would not have occurred\u201d in the face of our holding in <em>Mitchell v. Branch, </em>where in affirming a judgment against the defendant we said \u201c[i]t was enough that his negligence was a substantial factor in causing plaintiffs injuries.\u201d 45 Haw. at 132, 363 P.2d at 973. We read the trial judge\u2019s instruction as a variant of the \u201cbut for\u201d rule. An emphasis on \u201cfactual quantum\u201d rather than \u201clegal significance\u201d in the circumstances involved could well have misled the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">The judge\u2019s definition of \u201cproximate cause\u201d was followed by explanations of plural and concurring causes. We cannot fault the judge as far as these instructions are concerned. But he went on to advise the jury that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-9\">The independent acts of Mr. Murphy may be found by a preponderance of the evidence to supersede or excuse the negligence of a defendant in failing to provide adequate security at the Waikiki Gateway Hotel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-10\">However, if you find by a preponderance of the evidence that a defendant\u2019s negligence in failing to provide adequate security at the Waikiki Gateway Hotel created a reasonably fore<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>seeable risk of criminal harm to Linda K. Knodle, you are instructed that the independent acts of Mr. Murphy do not operate, excuse any defendant found by you to be negligent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-4\">An act is reasonably foreseeable if it appears to have been ordinary or usual under all the circumstances then existing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGj\">The plaintiff argued the instruction fashioned by the court was improper; and as we observed, his claim of error regarding instructions is centered on this instruction. The defendants also objected, but they now maintain the error was harmless because the jury did not reach the issue of causation. We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">To begin with, a hotel is under a duty to its guests to protect them from unreasonable risk of physical harm. <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts, supra, </em>\u00a7 314A. Because of the special relation, this duty extends \u201cto risks arising. . . from the acts of third persons, whether they be innocent, negligent, intentional, or even criminal. (See \u00a7 302B.).\u201d <em>Id. </em>comment d. George Murphy\u2019s independent acts could not have superseded or excused the defendants\u2019 negligence if such acts were reasonably foreseeable. <em>See </em>W.P. Keeton, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 44, at 305. If they were not, the defendants would not have been liable. The discussion of independent acts and superseding cause apart from foreseeability added nothing that could have aided the jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">In the paragraph following the discussion of independent acts and superseding causes, the judge instructed the jury that the independent acts of George Murphy did not excuse a defendant if its failure to exercise due care created a reasonably foreseeable risk of criminal harm to Linda Knodle. We cannot fault the judge here, but in the succeeding paragraph he informed the jury that \u201c[a]n act is reasonably foreseeable if it appears to have been ordinary or usual under all the circumstances then existing.\u201d We fail to see how murder can be \u201cordinary or usual\u201d under any circumstance. We could say the same about lightning striking at any given place or time; yet since \u201cthe possibility is there, ... it may require precautions for the protection of inflammables.\u201d <em>See supra </em>note 7. The test is whether \u201cthere is some probability of harm sufficiently serious that [a reasonable and prudent person] would take precautions to avoid it.\u201d <em>Tullgren v. Amoskeag Manufacturing Co., </em>82 N.H. at 276, 133 A. at 8. It is not whether the act or risk \u201cappears to have been ordinary or usual under all the circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AVzM\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number><em>Paul A. Lynch (Michael R. Marsh </em>and <em>Mark S. Milker </em>with him on the briefs; <em>Case &amp; Lynch, </em>of counsel) for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b432-8\"><em>Stephen B. MacDonald {Susan Oki Mollway </em>and <em>Patricia J. McHenry </em>with him on the brief; <em>Cades, Schutte, Fleming &amp; Wright, </em>of counsel) for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">The defendants argue the instruction in question was related to causation, an issue the jury did not reach. True, the jury found each of them had breached no duty owed to Linda Knodle. But the defendants overlook the fact that the instruction was read to the jurors again during deliberations in response to their pointed query: \u201cWhat is the definition of \u2018forseeable [sic] criminal acts of third parties\u2019?\u201d Whether there was a \u201c[reasonable foreseeability of harm is the very prototype of the question a jury must pass on in particularizing the standard of conduct in the case before it.\u201d 3 F. Harper, F. James, &amp; 0. Gray, <em>The Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 18.8, at 744 (2d ed. 1986). And this is done to determine whether there was a breach of duty or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The judgment of the circuit court is vacated, and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b418-10\">No error was raised on appeal with respect to the award of summary judgment to Continental Air Lines, Inc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b419-9\">Since there was reversible error and the case will have to be retried, we do not reach the third issue raised by the plaintiff, whether the trial judge erred by not granting plaintiffs motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict or for a new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b421-9\">The rule reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-10\">Special Verdicts.

The court shall give to the jury such explanation and instruction concerning the matter thus submitted as may be necessary to enable the jury to make its findings upon each issue.

For this reason, it is usually very difficult, and often simply not possible, to reduce negligence to any definite rules; it is \u201crelative to the need and the occasion,\u201d and conduct which would be proper under some circumstances becomes negligence under others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">W.P.
