Strathman, an enlisted member of the United States Navy and the owner of a motorcycle insured under a no-fault insurance policy written by Allstate Insurance Company, sustained injuries on August 21, 1982 while riding his motorcycle. He was injured when the two-wheeled vehicle skidded out of control and fell on him. Strathman sustained multiple lacerations and abrasions requiring treatment in a hospital as a result of the \u201csolo motor vehicle accident.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">The injured cyclist was hospitalized initially at Castle Memorial Hospital, a civilian medical facility. He was transferred after receiving emergency treatment to Tripler Army Medical Center. The United States subsequently reimbursed Castle Memorial for Strathman\u2019s emergency medical care, but did not seek reimburse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>ment from Strathman for the medical care he received at Castle or Tripler.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The government, however, made a claim against Allstate, his no-fault insurance carrier, \u201cfor the total cost of the medical care and treatment provided at the expense of the [United States] to . . . Strathman which amounted to a sum of $2,604.10.\u201d Allstate tendered the United States a check for $168.10, the amount the government paid Castle Memorial, but refused to pay the balance of the claim. The government rejected the tendered draft and reiterated its demand for $2,604.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">When Allstate again ignored the demand for full payment, the government filed a Complaint for Money Damages in the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii. The complaint averred the government was entided to recover from Allstate \u201cthe reasonable value of the medical care and treatment [the United States] provided to Thomas L. Strathman, an amount equal to $2,604.10,\u201d under the provisions of Hawaii\u2019s no-fault law, HRS chapter 294, as \u201can intended third-party beneficiary of . . . Strathman\u2019s insurance contract with [Allstate],\u201d and because Allstate otherwise would be unjustly enriched at the government\u2019s expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">Allstate denied the allegations of the complaint, and both parties moved thereafter for summary judgment. The district court granted Allstate\u2019s plea for judgment. <em>United States v. Allstate Insurance Co., </em>606 F. Supp. at 588. Relying on the language of HRS \u00a7 294-3(a),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the court ruled the United States was not a \u201cperson, insured under this chapter\u201d and did not suffer \u201caccidental harm.\u201d <em>United States v. Allstate Insurance Co., </em>606 F. Supp. at 590-91. Citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>our decision in <em>Jones v. Don L. Gordon Corp., </em>60 Haw. 12, 586 P.2d 1024 (1978), to support its ruling, the court held the government could not recover as a third-party beneficiary under Strathman\u2019s Basic No-Fault Endorsement policy<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> because Strathman had not \u201cintended to benefit the United States.\u201d <em>United States v. Allstate Insurance Co., </em>606 F. Supp. at 591.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The government appealed the adverse ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. A panel of the court, after reviewing the briefs submitted by the parties and hearing argument, concluded the appeal \u201craise[d] a question of Hawaii no-fault law that the Hawaii Supreme Court has not addressed.\u201d The panel thus summarized the relevant facts and framed the following query for our consideration: \u201cCan the United States recover <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>from an insured person\u2019s insurance company pursuant to [Hawaii\u2019s no-fault insurance law] the medical care costs provided the insured person ... as a result of a motor vehicle accident covered by the insurance policy?\u201d <em>See supra </em>note 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Here, the United States argues as it did earlier, asserting \u201cthe Hawaii no-fault laws provide a statutory basis for recovery,\u201d it is \u201centitled to recover as a third-party beneficiary of the insurance contract,\u201d and Allstate \u201chas received a windfall and [has] been unjusdy enriched and is, therefore,. . . liable ... for the costs of [the] health care provided.\u201d Finding the purposes and language of our motor vehicle accident reparations law provide a basis for recovery, we conclude the United States may recover the costs of the medical care received by the injured serviceman.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">The Hawaii Motor Vehicle Accident Reparations Act, HRS chapter 294, \u201can essentially restructured automobile insurance reparations system,\u201d Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 13, in 1973 House Journal, at 1219, \u201cbottomed on the compulsory coverage of all motor vehicles and operators under no-fault insurance policies and the partial abolition of tort liability,\u201d was enacted in 1973.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Barcena v. Hawaiian Insurance &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>67 Haw. 97, 102, 678 P.2d 1082, 1086 (1984); <em>see also </em>Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 4, in 1973 Senate Journal, at 635; Stand. Comm. Rep.

No. 187, in 1973 House Journal, at 836. The legislature intended thereby \u201cto create a system of reparations for accidental harm and loss arising from motor vehicle accidents, to compensate these damages without regard to fault, and to limit tort liability for these accidents.\u201d HRS \u00a7 294-1(a). Participation in this \u201csystem of no-fault insurance\u201d is mandatory because the legislature found the statutory scheme would \u201conly be truly effective ... if <em>all </em>drivers participated at least to the extent required by law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 294-l(b) (emphasis added). The legislature further provided that, \u201c[i]f the accident causing accidental harm occurs in the State, every person, insured under [HRS chapter 294] suffering loss from accidental harm arising out of the operation, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle has a right to no-fault benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 294-3(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Thus, \u201c[i]f [an] injured person has purchased the \u2018no-fault policy\u2019 required of all motor vehicle owners and operators, the insurer is obliged to compensate him for damages to the extent they fall within \u2018no-fault benefits\u2019 as defined by HRS \u00a7 294-2(10).\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Barcena v. Hawaiian Insurance &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>67 Haw. at 102, 678 P.2d at 1086. And, we have read the provisions of HRS chapter 294 consistently with \u201c[t]he legislative will . .. that \u2018every [insured] person . . . suffering loss from accidental harm arising out of the operation ... of a motor vehicle has a <em>right </em>to no-fault benefits.\u2019 HRS \u00a7 294-3.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 104, 678 P.2d at 1087 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"ArV\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The United States asserts a claim to \u201cno-fault benefits\u201d on grounds that it was a \u201cperson, insured\u201d who sustained a \u201closs from accidental harm.\u201d Allstate counters that Strathman, rather than the government, was the \u201cperson, insured\u201d who suffered the \u201closs from accidental harm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">\u201cOn superficial examination, the [language of HRS \u00a7 294-3] appears to preclude the payment of the claimed \u2018no-fault benefits.\u2019 \u201d <em>Barcena v. Hawaiian Insurance &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>67 Haw. at 103, 678 P.2d at 1086. The term \u201cperson, insured,\u201d though not separately defined in the statute,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> may be read to include only \u201cthose persons identified by name in the policy; a spouse or other relative residing in the same household with the named insured; operators, occupants, or users of the insured vehicle; and pedestrians, bicyclists or moped operators injured by the insured vehicle.\u201d <em>United States v. Allstate Insurance Co., </em>606 F. Supp. at 590. Moreover, the term \u201caccidental harm\u201d has been defined to encompass \u201cbodily injury, death, sickness, or disease caused by a motor vehicle accident to a person.\u201d HRS \u00a7 294-2(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">\u201cStill, the unavailability of benefits for [the United States] cannot be reconciled with Chapter 294\u2019s declared purpose to create a no-fault system of reparations, its limitation of tort liability, and its establishment of right to \u2018no-fault benefits\u2019 for loss from accidental harm arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle.\u201d <em>Barcena v. Hawaiian Insurance &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>67 Haw. at 103, 678 P.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>1086. A denial of benefits cannot be squared with the comprehensive scheme designed to provide \u201ca speedy, adequate and equitable reparation for those injured or otherwise victimized\u201d by motor vehicle accidents. Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 4, in 1973 Senate Journal, at 635; Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 402, in 1973 Senate Journal, at 817; Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 13, in 1973 House Journal, at 1219. <em>See supra </em>note 8. In our view the United States, under the comprehensive statutory scheme and Allstate\u2019s own reading of the provisions in question, is entitled to receive \u201cno-fault benefits.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> For the United States was victimized, in a sense, by the motorcycle accident and it was considered by Allstate a \u201cperson, insured\u201d under HRS chapter 294 who \u201csuffer[ed] loss from accidental harm.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">When the United States submitted its claim for no-fault benefits, Allstate tendered a check for $168.10 to defray the cost of medical care furnished Strathman at Castle Memorial Hospital. The injured cyclist\u2019s insurance carrier was not obliged to do so unless the claimant was indeed a \u201cperson, insured . . . suffering loss from accidental harm.\u201d But Allstate did not regard the United States as having suffered loss with respect to the remainder of the claim, though it undoubtedly had also incurred costs in treating Strathman at a government hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">The rationale for this inconsistency can only be that the United States suffered an out-of-pocket monetary loss in paying Castle Memorial but did not suffer a similar loss in treating Strathman at Tripler, inasmuch as it is obligated by statute to provide servicemen \u201cfree\u201d medical care. <em>See United States v. Allstate Insurance Co., </em>754 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>F.2d at 665; <em>United States v. Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>255 Ga. at 329, 320 S.E.2d at 166; <em>Sanner v. Government Employees Insurance Co., </em>150 N.J. Super, at 491-92, 376 A.2d at 182. <em>Cf. Masaki v. Columbia Casually Co., </em>48 Haw. 136, 146, 395 P.2d 927, 932 (1964). But even a military hospital incurs expenses it would not otherwise incur with the admission of each patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The reading of HRS \u00a7 294-3 urged by Allstate also does not comport with its practice of routinely reimbursing Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, a health maintenance organization,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> for treating members who are injured in motor vehicle accidents.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> One insured under the Kaiser plan, like a serviceman, does not pay the treating hospital when medical care is provided. <em>See Masaki v. Columbia Casualty Co., </em>48 Haw. at 140, 395 P.2d at 929. Rather, he or someone on his behalf makes \u201cbasic health services payments] ... on a periodic basis without regard to the dates health services .. . are provided,\u201d and payments are \u201cfixed without regard to the frequency, extent, or kind of health service . .. actually furnished.\u201d <em>See supra </em>note 13. If a distinction can be drawn between the situation involving a member of the Kaiser plan and a serviceman, it is in the fact that the member or his employer has paid Kaiser in advance for any medical care that may be required. \u201cCertainly neither the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Kaiser Hospital nor the Medical Group .. . perform[s] gratuitous services either for [the insured] or for the Kaiser Health Plan.\u201d <em>Masaki v. Columbia Casualty Co., </em>48 Haw. at 143-44, 395 P.2d at 931.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">But as conceded by Allstate\u2019s counsel at oral argument, the United States also does not furnish medical care gratuitously. To say that the medical care provided at Tripler is actually free would be a canard. Though the serviceman pays no one when care is rendered, what is promised and provided by law is part of his compensation for service in the armed forces. <em>See supra </em>note 4. He, like the Kaiser member whose employer pays Kaiser, is afforded prepaid medical care as part of his compensation. And if Kaiser has a right to be reimbursed as a person \u201cinsured\u201d under a no-fault policy purchased by one of its members, the United States should be treated no differently under a similar policy purchased by a member of the armed forces.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Citing <em>Wong v. Hawaiian Insurance Cos., </em>64 Haw. 189, 637 P.2d 1144 (1981), Allstate argues the United States, nonetheless, has no remedy under the statutory scheme. \u201cThe language of the pertinent statutes[,]\u201d Allstate argues, \u201cis plain and clear. The no-fault claimant who is entitled to benefits must himself or herself sustain the \u2018accidental harm\u2019 giving rise to the loss for which the claim is being made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 191, 637 P.2d at 1145. <em>Wong v. Hawaiian Insurance Cos., </em>however, is inapposite. Mrs. Wong, \u201cwho owned and operated a small business, closed her business to care for her son [who was injured in a motor vehicle accident], thereby suffering a loss of business profits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 190, 637 P.2d at 1145. She \u201cthereupon filed suit to recover the loss of profits under the no-fault coverage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We ruled that since the limit of benefits<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> under the no-fault statute is \u201cphrased as being payable to the person(s) who sustained the accidental harm, .. . the \u2018loss from accidental harm\u2019 referred to in HRS \u00a7 294-3(a) means a loss which is sustained by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>person injured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 191, 637 P.2d at 1145. The care given by Mrs. Wong to her son was gratuitous \u2014 as we observed, the care furnished Strathman was not.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AIv\"><em>Mark J.

This decision, in my opinion, strains the language of our no-fault statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>to reach a policy decision that neither the state legislature nor Congress has chosen.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">A plain reading of the language of Hawaii\u2019s no-fault statutes convinces me that the United States government is not an \u201cinsured person\u201d who suffered \u201closs from accidental harm\u201d therefore, the government should not be entided to any no-fault benefits under the contract between Strathman and Allstate.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Section 294-3(a), Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-8\">If the accident causing accidental harm occurs in this state, every person, insured under this chapter, and the person\u2019s survivors, suffering loss from accidental harm arising out of the operation, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle has a right to no-fault benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">In <em>Wong v. Hawaiian Insurance Companies, </em>64 Haw. 189, 637 P.2d 1144 (1981), this court, finding the above language to be \u201cplain and clear\u201d, stated that \u201c[t]he no-fault claimant who is entitled to benefits must himself or herself sustain the \u2018accidental harm\u2019 giving rise to the loss for which the claim is being made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 191, 637 P.2d at 1145.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">The majority concedes that the language of HRS \u00a7 294-3 appears to preclude the payment of the no-fault benefits to the government. <em>Supra </em>at 9. But the majority is of the opinion that \u201c[a] denial of benefits [to the government] cannot be squared with the comprehensive scheme\u201d of the no-fault law. <em>Supra </em>at 9. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">It is not the objective of the \u201ccomprehensive scheme\u201d of the no-fault statute to make insurers pay for all losses arising out of motor vehicle accidents. Rather, the treatment of victims injured in automobile accidents and the reduction of economic hardships to these victims are the primary public policy objectives which led to enactment of the no-fault laws. <em>See </em>Legislative Auditor, <em>A Study of Hawaii\u2019s Motor Vehicle Insurance Program, </em>8-14 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-12\">In <em>Barcena v. Hawaiian Insurance </em>&amp; <em>Guaranty Co., Ltd., </em>67 Haw. 97, 678 P.2d 1082 (1984), this court held that the physical therapy Mrs. Barcena, the accident victim, required as a result of an auto accident would be paid for either by way of public aid or no-fault <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>insurance. The primary objective recognized by this court was that Mrs. Barcena receive the necessary treatment with minimal hardship to herself. Public aid and no-fault insurance benefits were the means of fulfilling that objective. In recognizing \u201c[t]he legislative will ... that \u2018every insured person suffering loss from accidental harm arising out of the operation ... of a motor vehicle has a right to no-fault <em>benefits\u2019..id. </em>at 104, 678 P.2d at 1089, this court did not thereby hold that no-fault insurance benefits were the primary or sole means of achieving the objectives of treatment for injuries and reduction of hardships.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Regardless of the existence of our no-fault statutes, Strathman would have received, and did receive, adequate and timely medical care from the government without cost to him. Under those facts, the decision of the majority does nothing to enhance the public policy objective of affording treatment to the accident victim without economic burden to him. Further, the plain and clear language of our no-fault statute does not provide for reimbursement to the government for its cost of treating Strathman at Tripler Hospital, a government institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">Another stated goal of our no-fault statute is the reduction of motor vehicle insurance costs. <em>See Parker v. Nakaoka, </em>68 Haw_, _, 722 P.2d 1028, 1030 (1986). Since increases in the pay-out of no-fault insurance benefits will, in the long run, result in increases in the cost of no-fault insurance premiums, I find the decision to be contrary to legislative intent of reducing motor vehicle insurance costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-12\">The majority likens reimbursement to the government in this case to the practice of reimbursement to Kaiser Foundation Health Plan. The distinction is that each insured under the Kaiser plan bargains and pays for the medical care provided by Kaiser Hospital and Medical Group. <em>See Heusle v. National Mutual Insurance Co., </em>628 F.2d 833, 840 (3d Cir. 1980). On the other hand, the government, by statute, is charged with providing medical treatment to active duty military personnel. The benefit is not bargained for in the usual sense. Further, the inability of Kaiser to recoup payment for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>services from no-fault insurers would \u201cinjure\u201d the accident victim in terms of higher premiums being assessed to all members. To the contrary, failure to reimburse the government will not result in lower benefits or higher charges to the serviceman on active duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">The majority contends that a denial of reimbursement to the government would create a windfall in Allstate\u2019s favor. But I concur with the Third Circuit Court of Appeals that \u201c[t]he concept of \u2018windfall\u2019 is misleading because ultimately one large group or the other [premium payers or taxpayers] (and they overlap) must shoulder the burden.\u201d <em>Heusle, </em>628 F.2d at 838.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">It must be kept in mind that any \u201cwindfall\u201d for Allstate is not at Strathman\u2019s expense. Further, it is not as if Allstate collected a premium for a policy which provided no benefits. If Strathman obtained treatment at a hospital other than a federal one (as he did for a short period at Castle Hospital), or if the accident had injured a pedestrian or passenger, Allstate would be obligated to make payments under the policy. <em>See Sanner v. Government Employees Insurance Company, </em>150 N.J. Super. 488, 496, 376 A.2d 180, 184-85 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">If Allstate is indeed receiving a windfall because the premiums for policies covering those entitled to treatment in government facilities is too high, it is a matter for the insurance commissioner, <em>see </em>HRS \u00a7 294-13, or the legislature to address, and not this court. <em>Sanner, </em>150 N.J. Super, at 496, 376 A.2d at 184.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">Further,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-10\">Congress is free to consider . . . whether the burden of paying medical expenses should be borne by the large group of premium payers or by the large group of taxpayers. The legislative branch can best decide whether the federal government\u2019s interest outweighs the state\u2019s aim of reducing the cost of auto insurance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-11\"><em>Heusle, </em>628 F.2d at 838.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-12\">To date, Congress has chosen, as a matter of policy, to subrogate the government\u2019s claim only when liability for medical expenses for active duty servicemen flows from tort. <em>Heusle, </em>628 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>at 838. On the other hand, when government renders medical care to veterans for non-service connected disability, Congress has allowed the government to seek reimbursement from no-fault insurance carriers. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3629. <em>See also United States v. Dairyland Insurance Co., </em>644 F.Supp. 702 (N.D. Ga. 1986). It is up to Congress then, to change the policy to allow the government to seek reimbursement from no-fault insurance carriers if that is deemed to be in the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">For the reasons stated, I would answer the certified question in the negative.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
