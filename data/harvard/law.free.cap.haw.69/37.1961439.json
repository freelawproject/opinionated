The lower court by its action allowed Liberty Mutual, the workers\u2019 compensation carrier of the general contractor, to recover from UNICO, the comprehensive liability carrier of the subcontractor, all workers\u2019 compensation payments the Director of the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations ordered paid to the subcontractors\u2019 injured employee. For reasons set forth below we reverse and remand the case for entry of summary judgment in UNICO\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">The material facts of the present case are undisputed. The Napili Point Condominium Project on Maui hired Associated Masons, Ltd. (Contractor) to perform construction work. Contractor subcontracted the rough carpentry and framing part of the job to Coles Pacific, Inc. (Subcontractor). The subcontract agreement required Subcontractor to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-9\">indemnify, defend and hold harmless .. . Contractor and their agents, servants and employees from all and against all costs, losses and expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees, for or arising out of: ... (c) the failure of Subcontractor to provide insurance required hereunder; (d) any and all damages or injuries to persons or property resulting from the performance of Subcontractor\u2019s work hereunder[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">Subcontractor was also required to carry workers\u2019 compensation and comprehensive general liability insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-11\">Prior to the commencement of construction, Subcontractor purchased general comprehensive liability insurance from UNICO, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-12\">The company will pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured, by reason of contractual liability assumed by him under any written contract of the type designated in the schedule for this insurance, shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage <em>to which </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number><em>this insurance applies, </em>caused by an occurrence, and the company shall have the right and the duty to defend any suit against the insured seeking damages on account of such bodily injury or property damage[.] (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Exclusion (e) of the policy excused UNICO from <em>\u201cany obligation for which the insured or any carrier as his insurer may be held liable under any workmen\u2019s compensation </em>. . . law[.]\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Subcontractor also purchased workers\u2019 compensation coverage from Travelers Insurance Company. However, the policy expired before construction was completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">During the uninsured period, an employee of the Subcontractor, Richard Jameson, was injured when an improperly braced framing wall gave way and fell on him. Jameson brought a workers\u2019 compensation claim before the Director of the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">The Director found Jameson\u2019s injury to be work related and ordered compensation. Subcontractor\u2019s insurer, Travelers Insurance Co., denied coverage and asked that the matter be resolved before the insurance commissioner. In order to prevent delay of benefits to Jameson, the Director found Jameson to be an employee of Contractor pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 386-1 .<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He ordered Contractor or its workers\u2019 compensation carrier, Liberty Mutual, to pay Jameson\u2019s medical and disability benefits, even though Subcontractor was found to be primarily liable and Contractor/Liberty Mutual secondarily liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">Liberty Mutual then filed suit against Subcontractor seeking to recover all workers\u2019 compensation benefits paid to or on behalf of Jameson, general damages sustained by Jameson, attorney\u2019s fees and costs. Subcontractor admitted liability by default. The court then held an evidentiary hearing and found Subcontractor to be Jameson\u2019s employer and liable to Liberty Mutual for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, attorney\u2019s fees, and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>Without the ability to satisfy the judgment against Subcontractor, Liberty Mutual as Contractor\u2019s subrogee brought suit against UNICO. Liberty Mutual asserted that Subcontractor breached its contract with Contractor, and that UNICO was therefore obligated to indemnify Subcontractor. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. The court granted Liberty Mutual\u2019s motion and denied UNICO\u2019s. The court subsequently granted Liberty Mutual\u2019s motion for entry of final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">Liberty Mutual argues that UNICO\u2019s policy applies since Subcontractor is contractually obligated to indemnify Contractor for damages as a result of bodily injury. In contrast, UNICO argues that the duty to pay arose from Subcontractor\u2019s obligation under workers\u2019 compensation laws, and exclusion (e) thereby prevents application of the policy to the present case. We are thus asked to construe the contract for the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">Initially, we approach the terms of the policy \u201caccording to their plain, ordinary, and accepted sense in common speech unless it appears from the policy that a different meaning is intended.\u201d <em>First Insurance Co. of Hawaii, Inc. v. State, </em>66 Haw. 413, 424, 665 P.2d 648, 657 (1983). And while ambiguities may be resolved in the insured\u2019s favor, this court will only find ambiguity where the policy, \u201ctaken as a whole, is reasonably subject to differing interpretation[s].\u201d <em>Hawaiian Insurance &amp; Guaranty Co. v. Chief Clerk of the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number><em>First Circuit Court, </em>68 Haw._,_, 713 P.2d 427, 431 (1986) (quoting <em>Modern Construction, Inc. v. Barce, Inc., </em>556 P.2d 528, 529 (Alaska 1976) (footnote omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">We are not persuaded by Liberty Mutual\u2019s argument. We hold that Subcontractor\u2019s obligation to pay Liberty Mutual arose out of the former\u2019s obligation to pay workers\u2019 compensation benefits to Jameson. Subcontractor\u2019s obligation falls squarely within exception (e) of the policy. As a beneficiary of Subcontractor\u2019s policy, Contractor\u2019s subrogee, Liberty Mutual, is only entitled to benefits accruing to Subcontractor. It can assert no greater contractual rights under the policy than those available to the Subcontractor. <em>See Medeiros v. First Insurance Co. of Hawaii, Ltd., </em>50 Haw. 401, 404, 441 P.2d 341, 343 (1968). Liberty Mutual is therefore without recourse under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Nevertheless, Liberty Mutual argues that its suit changes the character of the obligation to a contractual one. It cites <em>CM, Inc. v. Canadian Indemnity Co., </em>635 F.2d 703 (8th Cir. 1980) to support this position. The exclusionary clause in <em>CM, Inc., </em>applied to <em>\u201cliability imposed upon the Insured.\u201d </em>The court found this exclusion did not apply to liability imposed upon a third party, for which the insured became liable. <em>Id. </em>at 707. In the instant case, exclusion (e) expressly applies to <em>\u201cany </em>obligation for which the insured or any carrier as his insurer may be held liable\u201d. (Emphasis added). Thus, the exclusion expressly provides for liability imposed by a third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">The two other cases cited by Liberty Mutual, <em>Utica Mutual Insurance Co. v. Central Vermont Railway, Inc., </em>133 Vt. 292, 336 A.2d 200 (1975), and <em>American Insurance Co. v. Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co., </em>110 N.H. 192, 270 A.2d 907 (1970), are also inapposite. Although the exclusionary language in both of these cases is similar to the present case, they involved separate negligence actions apart from workers\u2019 compensation claim. The exclusion of workers\u2019 compensation claims was thus held not to apply. Here, Liberty Mutual\u2019s claims are a direct result of the workers\u2019 compensation afforded Jameson.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">Moreover, the obligation to hold Contractor\u2019s insurer liable is consonant with the intent of HRS \u00a7 386-1. See <em>supra </em>note 1. The statute, by staggering the obligation to pay workers\u2019 compensation, places primary responsibility on the subcontractor for obtaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>appropriate coverage. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 334, in 1963 Senate Journal at 789; <em>cf. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority v. Johnson, </em>467 U.S. 925, 937 n.11, 104 S. Ct. 2827, 2834 n.11, 81 L. Ed. 2d 768, 779 n.11 (1984) (discussing similar state statutes). Extending contract insurance policies to cover workers\u2019 compensation claims would frustrate the aims of the statute as it would encourage subcontractors to rely on contractors\u2019 workers\u2019 compensation insurance.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AC\"><em>Walter Davis (Alan K.
