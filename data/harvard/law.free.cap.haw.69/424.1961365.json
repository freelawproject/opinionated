Gamulo (defendant) was convicted of promoting a dangerous drug in the third degree. For that offense, he was sentenced to 5 years of probation, commencing on February 17, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-15\">On September 10, 1986, defendant, while on probation, was convicted of theft in the first degree, a class C felony. Pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 706-625(c) (1985),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the sentencing court revoked defendant\u2019s probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-16\">After the revocation of probation, defendant was resentenced to a five-year term of probation, nunc pro tunc as of February 17, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>1984, with a special condition that he be incarcerated for a period of one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Defendant appeals the terms of his resentencing. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Defendant contends that the sentencing court abused its discretion when, upon revocation of probation, it resentenced defendant to the same term of probation, nunc pro tunc, with a special term of one-year imprisonment. We disagree.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-8\">The prescription of penalties is a legislative prerogative, but a sentencing court is nonetheless afforded wide latitude in the selection of penalties from those prescribed and in the determination of their severity. This authority is normally undisturbed on review in the absence of an apparent abuse of discretion, or unless applicable statutory and constitutional commands have not been observed. (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-9\"><em>State v. Johnson, </em>68 Haw__,_, 711 P.2d 1295, 1298, (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">There has been \u201can inclination on the part of the legislature to vest in the sentencing court the discretionary authority to apply the Hawaii Penal Code\u2019s more enlightened sentencing provisions where such application would further the penological objectives of the statute.\u201d <em>State v. Von Geldern, </em>64 Haw. 210, 214, 638 P.2d 319, 322 (1981). This inclination to vest the sentencing court with discretion is clearly reflected in the language of HRS \u00a7 706-625 (1985). In pertinent part, the statute reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-11\">(a) During a period of probation ..., the court, . . . after a hearing, may revoke the ... probation, modify the requirements imposed on the defendant, or impose further requirements authorized by section 706-624.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-12\">(d) The court may modify the requirements imposed on the defendant or impose further requirements, if it finds that such action will assist the defendant in leading a law-abiding life.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Av4\">The only limitation placed on the sentencing court\u2019s discretion is found in subsection (e) of \u00a7 706-625:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-14\">(e) When the court revokes .. . probation, it may impose on the defendant any sentence that might have been imposed originally for the crime of which he was convicted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>Defendant originally could have been sentenced to imprisonment for a maximum term of five years, HRS \u00a7 706-660 (1985),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for the offense of promoting a dangerous drug in the third degree, a class C felony, HRS \u00a7 712-1243 (1985). Alternatively, statutes permit a five-year sentence of probation, HRS \u00a7 706-623 (1985),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which may be conditioned with a one-year term of imprisonment, HRS \u00a7 706-624(3) (1985).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> .</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">One may argue that the legislative mandate revoking defendant\u2019s original probation becomes meaningless if the sentencing court could reimpose the same sentence of probation. In reading HRS \u00a7 706-625 in its entirety, we conclude that the legislature mandated revocation of probation under certain circumstances as a means of compelling the court to review the defendant\u2019s original sentence in light of new facts. Upon such review, the court is free to reimpose probation if such sentence \u201cwould further the penological objectives of the statute.\u201d <em>State v. Von Geldern, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">After revoking defendant\u2019s original probation, the sentencing court chose to reimpose a five-year probation sentence conditioned with a one-year prison term. The same sentence could have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>originally imposed for the conviction of promoting a dangerous drug in the third degree. We find that the applicable statutes have been complied with by the sentencing court. There was no abuse of discretion by the court.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Art\"><em>Melvin Wong </em>for defendant-appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b465-8\"><em>Alexa D. M. Fujise (Arthur E. Ross </em>on the brief), Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, for plaintiff-appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Defendant\u2019s other contentions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b462-17\"> In pertinent part, the statute states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-18\">The court shall revoke the... probation if the defendant... has been convicted of a felony.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b464-8\"> \u00a7 706-660 Sentence of imprisonment for class B and C felonies; ordinary terms.

The court, on application of a probation officer or of the defendant, or on its own motion, may discharge the defendant at any time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b464-13\"> The pertinent sentence of HRS \u00a7 706-624(3) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-14\">When the court sentences a person who has been convicted of a felony to be placed on probation, it may require him to serve a term of imprisonment not exceeding one year as an additional condition of its order.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
