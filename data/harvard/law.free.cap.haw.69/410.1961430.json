The sole legal question we face on this appeal is whether Plaintiffs-Appellants\u2019 wrongful death claim is barred by the applicable statute of limitations found in the Hawaii Revised Statutes (hereinafter \u201cHRS\u201d). Answering this question in the negative, we reverse the trial court\u2019s order granting Defendant-Appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">On October 7, 1977, Glynn E. L. Crawford (hereinafter \u201cDecedent\u201d) was killed in a single-car accident while riding as a passenger in a van driven by Defendant-Appellee Vhonda Lehua Post Crawford (hereinafter \u201cAppellee\u201d). Decedent was unmarried and was survived by three minor children, Plaintiffs-Appellants Glynn E. L. Crawford, Jr., age 9; Charles B. Crawford, age 8; and Kainoalani B. Crawford, age 6.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On December 20, 1977, their mother, Plaintiff-Appellant Marvelene Crawford, was appointed guardian <em>ad litem </em>with respect to their property. <em>In re Crawford, </em>G. No. 1098 (Haw. 1st Cir. Dec. 20, 1977) (order appointing guardian).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">On June 6, 1978, Decedent\u2019s mother, Gertrude Crawford, petitioned the First Circuit Court to be appointed the legal representative of the Decedent\u2019s estate and to receive no-fault insurance benefits pursuant to HRS \u00a7 294-4(l)(B). On June 29, 1978, the court granted her petition and appointed her, as Decedent\u2019s legal representative, to receive no-fault benefits. <em>In re Crawford, </em>S.P. No. 4620 (Haw. 1st Cir. June 29, 1978). On August 17, 1978, she received no-fault benefits, and, pursuant to court order, subsequently paid Decedent\u2019s outstanding medical expenses and dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>bursed the remainder to the Chief Clerk of the First Circuit Court for deposit into an account for the Decedent\u2019s surviving children.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">On October 2, 1985, Plaintiff-Appellant Marvelene Crawford filed the instant action on behalf of the three children (hereinafter collectively \u201cAppellants\u201d). Appellants\u2019 amended complaint, filed October 17, 1985, alleged that \u201c[a]s a direct and proximate result of the gross negligence of the defendant, the plaintiffs have been deprived of parental care, training, guidance, education and support of their father Glenn [sic] Eckland Crawford, Sr.\u201d On October 27, 1986, Appellee filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on the theory that Appellants\u2019 action was barred by the no-fault statute of limitations contained in HRS \u00a7 294-36(b)(2). On February 20, 1987, the trial court granted the motion and the Appellants filed this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">Under Rule 56(c) of the Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure, summary judgment is proper only when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party clearly demonstrates that he should prevail as a matter of law. <em>Bidar v. Amfac, Inc., </em>66 Haw. 547, 553, 669 P.2d 154, 159 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">The basic issue is whether Appellants\u2019 wrongful death action is barred by the statute of limitations. Accordingly, the threshold determination we face is which statute of limitations governs the present case. Although Appellee concedes that this is a wrongful death action, she nevertheless contends that the statute of limitations codified in Hawaii\u2019s No-Fault Law, HRS chapter 294,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is controlling. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The primary duty in interpreting and applying statutes is to ascertain the intention of the legislature and to implement that intention to the fullest degree. <em>Peters v. Weatherwax, </em>69 Haw__, __, 731 P.2d 157, 162 (1987); <em>Boulton v. Boulton, </em>69 Haw._, _, 730 P.2d 338, 339 (1986); <em>Gakiya v. Hallmark Properties, Inc., </em>68 Haw__,_, 722 P.2d 460, 463 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">The explicit purpose of Hawaii\u2019s No-Fault Law is \u201cto create a system of reparations for accidental harm and loss arising from motor vehicle accidents, to compensate these damages without regard to fault, and to limit tort liability for these accidents.\u201d HRS \u00a7 294-l(a) (1985).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> HRS \u00a7 294-6(a) sets forth the limitation on tort liability, which is the bedrock of Hawaii\u2019s No-Fault Law. <em>Doi v. Hawaiian Insurance &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>6 Haw. App._,_, 727 P.2d 884, 888 (1986). However, HRS \u00a7 294-6(a)(l) expressly excludes certain types of tort actions, including death, from the abolition of tort liability.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We do not believe that the legislature, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>enacting the no-fault law, intended to supercede the statutory cause of action contained in Hawaii\u2019s wrongful death statute, HRS \u00a7 663-3.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Doi, </em>6 Haw. App. at__727 P.2d at 889-91 (no-fault statute was not intended to abolish common law claim for loss of consortium).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">The no-fault statute does not create an independent tort cause' of action for motor vehicle related injuries, it merely provides an alternative scheme of expedited reparations for certain types of economic loss, including earnings loss, medical expenses, and rehabilitative expenses. <em>See </em>HRS \u00a7 294-2(10) (1985). In contrast, HRS \u00a7 663-3 permits compensation of Decedent\u2019s survivors for economic loss and deprivation of love, affection and companionship. <em>Hun v. Center Properties, </em>63 Haw. 273, 279, 626 P.2d 182, 187 (1981). Absent legislative history to the contrary, we conclude that the legislature did not intend that the no-fault law apply to Appellants\u2019 wrongful death claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">In <em>Hun, </em>63 Haw. at 276, 626 P.2d at 185 (1981), we reaffirmed the standard governing our determination of the relevant limitations period in a given case: \u201cthe relevant limitations period is determined from the nature of the claim or right based on the allegations contained in the pleadings.\u201d <em>Id,.; Au v. Au, </em>63 Haw. 210, 214, 626 P.2d 173, 177, <em>partial reconsideration denied, </em>63 Haw. 263, 626 P.2d 181 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">In this case, Appellants alleged that they were deprived of parental care, training, guidance, education and support of their father. \u201cThese allegations were precisely what the wrongful death cause of action entails. The nature of the claim in this instance is recovery for the wrongful death of [Glynn E. L. Crawford].\u201d <em>Hun, </em>63 Haw. at 279, 626 P.2d at 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">There are two further principles of construction which favor the application of the limitations period in HRS \u00a7 663-3 over HRS \u00a7 294-36. First, \u201ccourts will apply the longer limitations period when there is doubt as to which statute applies.\u201d <em>Au, </em>63 Haw. at 264, 626 P.2d at 182 (per curiam). Second, \u201c[w]henever possible, the court should apply the state limitations period governing actions founded on a liability created by statute.\u201d <em>Bill\u2019s Crane Service, Inc. v. Quisenberry, </em>545 F. Supp. 359, 361 (D. Haw. 1982). As will be discussed <em>infra, </em>application of HRS \u00a7 663-3 yields the longer limitations period in this case. Moreover, the limitations period in \u00a7 663-3 \u201cspecifically\u201d applies to actions brought under that section. <em>Cf. Bill\u2019s Crane Service, Inc., </em>545 F. Supp. at 361.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">We are constrained to point out that Appellants did not seek no-fault insurance benefits in their complaint; their claim is for the wrongful death of their father.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We therefore hold that HRS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>\u00a7 663-3 is the applicable statute of limitations in the instant case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See Hun, </em>63 Haw. at 279, 626 P.2d at 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">Having determined that HRS \u00a7 663-3 is the controlling statute of limitations in this case, we now turn to the issue of whether the limitations period is tolled by the infancy of Appellants. In <em>Hun v. Center Properties, </em>we held that the general infancy tolling provision in HRS \u00a7 657-13<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> was applicable to the wrongful death statute of limitations in HRS \u00a7 663-3. <em>Hun, </em>63 Haw. at 280-84, 626 P.2d at 187-90. We find the <em>Hun </em>rationale to be dispositive in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">In <em>Hun, </em>after noting the split in authority in this issue, we discerned a trend of cases that applied infancy tolling provisions where the limitations period affected the remedy and not the right of action. <em>Id. </em>at 280-81, 626 P.2d at 187-88. We concluded that \u201cthe two-year limitations period in HRS \u00a7 663-3 merely affects the remedy, not the right of action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 281, 626 P.2d at 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">We next turned to the legislative intent underlying HRS \u00a7 663-3. Focusing on the phrase \u201cexcept as otherwise provided,\u201d we discerned a legislative purpose, in the 1972 amendment adding the phrase, to allow the \u201cpossible application\u201d of HRS \u00a7 657-13. <em>Hun, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>63 Haw. at 281-83, 626 P.2d at 188-89.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Finally, we \u201cagree[d] that it is the role of the courts to protect the interests of minors who become parties to litigation. Such a policy is in the best interest of the child and the state.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 283, 626 P.2d at 189 (citations omitted).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Avq\"><em>Clayton C. Ikei, </em>for Plaintiffs-Appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b455-8\"><em>Harvey E. Henderson, Jr. (Paul A. L\u2019Ecuyer </em>and <em>Arnold Hobson, Jr., </em>with him on the brief; <em>Lee, Henderson, Chipchase &amp; Wong, </em>of counsel), for Defendant-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Accordingly, we hold that the two-year limitations period for each of the Appellants\u2019 wrongful death claims begins to run upon each child\u2019s eighteenth birthday. <em>See Hun, </em>63 Haw. at 283-84, 626 P.2d at 189-90; <em>Jones v. State, </em>58 Haw. 101, 102, 564 P.2d 1276, 1277 (1977) (per curiam). Given that the complaint was timely filed, the trial court committed error in granting Appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We therefore reverse the judgment and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b449-11\"> Glynn E.

CONCURRING IN THE JUDGMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">I reach the same result as the majority but based on different reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">The majority\u2019s position that the general wrongful death limitation period of HRS \u00a7 663-3 applies suggests by analogy that in an action seeking compensation for auto-related <em>personal injury </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>general personal injury tort limitation period, \u00a7 657-7, should apply. In <em>Joshua v. MTL, Inc., </em>65 Haw. 623, 656 P.2d 736 (1982), however, this court applied \u00a7 294-36(b) to just such a case. The majority attempts to distinguish wrongful death claims from personal injury claims. I see no valid reason why the two situations should be treated any differently with respect to the application of the limitation period provided in Chapter 294.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">I would hold that HRS \u00a7 294-36(b) governs this case. Section 294-36(b) applies to any \u201csuit arising out of a motor vehicle accident . . . brought in tort.\u201d Appellant\u2019s claim of wrongful death does not alter the fact that the tort action arose out of a motor vehicle accident. Chapter 294 creates a system of reparations for accidental harm and loss arising from <em>motor vehicle accidents, see </em>HRS \u00a7 294-1(a), and sets forth limitation periods to cover no-fault claims, HRS \u00a7 294-36(a), and certain residual tort actions, HRS \u00a7 294-36(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">The plain language of HRS \u00a7 294-36(b), however, does not allow for tolling. Unlike the situation in <em>Hun v. Center Properties, </em>63 Haw. 273, 626 P.2d 182 (1981), HRS \u00a7 294-36(b) does not contain the words, \u201cexcept as otherwise provided,\u201d and thus tolling cannot be incorporated as provided in HRS \u00a7 657-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">Under HRS \u00a7 294-36(b), minor children of parents killed in automobile accidents do not receive the benefits of tolling while minor children of parents killed in non-automobile accidents receive the benefits of tolling under 657-13. I find no rational basis for the disparate treatment. Although the no-fault law intended an efficient and less costly system of resolving claims arising from motor vehicle accidents, there is nothing in the legislative history to suggest that elimination of tolling the limitation period as afforded to minors under \u00a7 657-13 for residual tort claims was intended as a mean to expedite the resolution of such claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">I would hold, therefore, that the limitation period under HRS \u00a7 294-36(b) when applied to those who are minors at the time of the accident is unconstitutional as being violative of the equal protection clauses<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Constitutions of the United States and Hawaii. In view of this holding, HRS \u00a7 663-3 and HRS \u00a7 657-13 become applicable to this case.
