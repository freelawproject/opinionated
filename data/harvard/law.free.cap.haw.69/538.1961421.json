After hearing argument and reviewing the pleadings, the Stipulation Re: Agreed Facts and Admissibility of Documentary Evidence, and the exhibits and legal memoranda submitted by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>parties, the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit concluded there was \u201cno genuine issue as to any material fact[,]\u201d the \u201cDepartment of Hawaiian Home Lands .. . [was] authorized pursuant to \u00a7 204(2) of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920, as amended,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Hawaii Revised Statutes \u00a7 171-95 to issue General Lease No. 213 .. .,\u201d and the department complied with \u201capplicable procedures imposed by law\u201d in granting DOT a lease of Hawaiian Homes land situated at Kaulana Bay in Ka\u2018u, Hawaii for the construction and maintenance of a boat launching facility. The court thus awarded summary judgment to defendants-appellees. Reviewing the record on appeal, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">The lease in question covers approximately 4.3 acres within the 11,000 acre tract at Kamaoa-Puueo, Ka\u2018u, on the island of Hawaii, which assumed the status of Hawaiian home lands upon the passage of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act (HHCA or the Act) in 1920. <em>See </em>HHCA \u00a7 203(1). Though designated as \u201cavailable lands\u201d in section 203(1), the arid lands of Kamaoa-Puueo were not deemed suitable then for leasing to \u201cnative Hawaiians\u201d for the purposes delineated in section 207 of the Act. The Commission thus returned Kamaoa-Puueo to the control of the Commissioner of Public Lands (the predecessor of the Board of Land and Natural Resources), as permitted by section 212, and for many years the tract remained under the jurisdiction of the department charged with the management and administration of \u201cthe public lands of the State and the water resources and minerals thereon.\u201d <em>See </em>Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 26-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">HHC, however, chose to terminate the Land Board\u2019s authority over Kamaoa-Puueo and to assume jurisdiction in 1978. Since the lands reverted to its jurisdiction, HHC has authorized short-term use of portions thereof on a permit basis and generated income therefrom averaging $36,570 per year over the past six years. And in anticipation of developing the lands and resources at South <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>Point, Hawaii for more beneficial use, the Commission had a management plan for the area prepared in 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">But even before the Commission took this action, others had displayed interest in the Hawaiian home lands at South Point. Proposals had been advanced by private firms for the erection of windpower farms and the construction of a space satellite launching station there, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was studying the feasibility of building a new breakwater at Kaulana Bay. HHC also received a request in 1983 from the State Department of Transportation for a lease to facilitate the construction and maintenance of a boat-launching facility at Kaulana Bay. The Commission\u2019s Land Management Division (LMD) recommended approval of DOT\u2019s request;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and at its meeting of May 26, 1983, the Commission outlined conditions upon which a 55-year lease of approximately 4.3 acres of land would be approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The matter was on the agenda again for the HHC meeting of July 28, 1983, when Plaintiff William Ahia and others voiced objections to the lease, and for the meeting of August 17, 1983. The Commission authorized the issuance of a lease at the latter meeting. But the parties to the lease did not reach final agreement on some specific terms until the end of August<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and HHC\u2019s chairman signed General Lease No. 213 on October 3, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>The plaintiffs filed a multi-count suit in the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii on October 27, 198S against a host of state, federal and county officials and other unidentified defendants, seeking a declaration that the lease was invalid and an injunction preventing an effectuation of its provisions. Pursuant to an agreement reached among the parties, however, the plaintiffs dismissed with prejudice their claims against the federal defendants and three counts alleging causes of action against state and county defendants. One count alleging a cause of action against the DOT and members of the Commission was dismissed without prejudice. The remaining count against the DOT is still pending in the federal district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">The agreement among the parties further provided that the plaintiffs, the Commission, and the DOT would seek a ruling on the validity of the lease from this court upon an agreed statement of facts and that construction of a boat-launching facility would be held in abeyance pending a determination of the legal controversy by the State courts. We deemed it unwise to consider the question upon the statement presented. An issue with far-reaching implications, we felt, ought not be decided without the benefit of a fully developed factual foundation. Thus, on June 25, 1985 we dismissed the petition \u201cwithout prejudice to the institution of an appropriate proceeding in a trial court of the State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>The plaintiffs brought an action in the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit on November 3, 1986, alleging that the lease in question was issued in violation of constitutional and statutory provisions and administrative rules and that the defendants thereby breached their fiduciary obligations to the intended beneficiaries of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act. The primary relief they sought was a declaration of nullity with respect to General Lease No. 213 and injunctions against the disposition of Hawaiian Home lands by general lease to the DOT or to non-native Hawaiians until the plaintiffs and other eligible native Hawaiians were given \u201can opportunity to lease such lands under \u00a7 207(a) and \u00a7 204(2) of the [Hawaiian Homes Commission] Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">After responding to the complaint, the defendants moved for summary judgment. The motion was submitted for decision upon stipulated facts, documentary evidence offered by the parties, and written and oral argument presented by opposing counsel. The circuit court took the matter under advisement on February 6, 1987, and it awarded defendants summary judgment on March 23, 1987 after finding no genuine issue as to any material fact and concluding there was authority under \u00a7 204(2) of the Act and HRS \u00a7 171-95 for the issuance of General Lease No. 213 to the DOT and the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands complied with procedures imposed by law in issuing the lease. The plaintiffs perfected a timely appeal from the judgment, and the question we thought a trial court should consider first is before us again.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">The plaintiffs urge reversal of the judgment on grounds that the Commission acted without authority in issuing General Lease No. 213, it failed to comply with \u00a7 212 of the Act in doing so, it did not give preference to native Hawaiians in leasing Hawaiian Home lands, and it is precluded from disposing of the land in question pursuant to \u00a7 204(2) because the land is needed for leasing to native Hawaiians under \u00a7 207(a) of the Act. We begin our analysis with a review of HHCA \u00a7 204(2) and HRS \u00a7 171-95, which in the trial court\u2019s view vested the Commission with the necessary authority to issue General Lease No. 213.</p>\n<p id=\"A24q\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-3\">The pertinent portion of HHCA \u00a7 204(2) is the second paragraph, which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-4\">In the management of any retained available lands not required for leasing under section 207(a), the department may dispose of those lands to the public, including native Hawaiians, on the same terms, conditions, restrictions, and uses applicable to the disposition of public lands in chapter 171, Hawaii Revised Statutes; provided that the department may not sell or dispose of such lands in fee simple except as authorized under section 205 of this Act; provided further that the department is expressly authorized to negotiate, prior to negotiations with the general public, the disposition of a lease of Hawaiian home lands to a native Hawaiian, or organization or association owned or controlled by native Hawaiians, for commercial, industrial, or other business purposes, in accordance with the procedure set forth in section 171-59, Hawaii Revised Statutes, subject to the notice requirement of section 171-16(c), Hawaii Revised Statutes, and the lease rental limitation imposed by section I7l-l7(b), Hawaii Revised Statutes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">The paragraph is by no means esoteric. Still, an application of its provisions demands more than a cursory reading. For the language of the paragraph is meaningful only when read in conjunction with other provisions of the Act and HRS chapter 171.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">To begin, the lands subject to leasing under \u00a7 204(2) are those designated as \u201cavailable lands\u201d in HHCA \u00a7 203<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that are not required for \u201cleasing under section 207(a)\u201d which, in relevant part, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-7\">(a) The department is authorized to lease to native Hawaiians the right to the use and occupancy of a tract or tracts of Hawaiian home lands within the following acreage limits per each lessee: (1) not more than forty acres of agriculture lands or lands used for aquaculture purposes; or (2) not more than one hundred acres of irrigated pastoral lands and not more than one thousand acres of other pastoral lands; or (3) not more than one acre of any class of land to be used as a residence lot... .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>If the Commission decides \u201cany retained available lands are not required for leasing to native Hawaiians for purposes described in \u00a7 207(a),\u201d the Commission may then \u201cdispose of those lands to the public\u201d on the \u201csame terms, conditions, restrictions, and uses applicable to the disposition of public lands in chapter 171, Hawaii Revised Statutes[.]\u201d The \u201cterms, conditions, restrictions, and uses\u201d applicable in the disposition of public lands to governments and governmental agencies are set forth in HRS \u00a7 171-95(a), which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-5\">(\u0430) Notwithstanding any limitations to the contrary, the board of land and natural resources may, without public auction:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-6\">(1) Sell public lands at such price and on such other terms and conditions as the board may deem proper to governments, including the United States, city and county, counties, other governmental agencies authorized to hold lands in fee simple and public utilities;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-7\">(2) Lease to the governments, agencies, and public utilities, public lands for terms up to, but not in excess of, sixty-five years at such rental and on such other terms and conditions as the board may determine;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-8\">(3) Grant licenses and easements to the governments, agencies, and public utilities on such terms and conditions as the board may determine for road, pipeline, utility, communication cable, and other rights-of-way;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-9\">(4) Exchange public lands with the governments and agencies;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-10\">(5) Execute quitclaim deeds to the governments and agencies, with or without consideration, releasing any claim to the property involved made upon disputed legal or equitable grounds, whenever the board in its discretion deems it beneficial to the State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-11\">(\u0431) Waive or modify building and other requirements and conditions contained in deeds, patents, sales agreements, or leases held by the governments and agencies whenever such waiver or modification is beneficial to the State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-12\">And where the decision is to lease \u201cavailable lands\u201d \u201cfor commercial, industrial, or other business purposes,\u201d the Commission may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>dispose of the lease through negotiation, first with native Hawaiians, in accord with the procedure described in HRS \u00a7 171-59. But in such case, the Commission must give notice of the intended disposition in accord with HRS \u00a7 171-16(c) and determine the minimum rent pursuant to the provisions of HRS \u00a7 I7l-17(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">That the 4.3 acres covered by General Lease No. 213 are part of the \u201cretained available lands\u201d subject to management by the Commission and thus subject to disposition by lease \u201cto the public, including native Hawaiians,\u201d is not disputed. The plaintiffs, however, would have us rule a government agency \u201cis not a member of the public so as to fall within the purview of \u00a7 204(2) of the Act.\u201d We find no reason to apply \u201cthe public\u201d so narrowly.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">\u201cPublic\u201d is \u201csusceptible of various shades of meaning.\u201d <em>Territory v. Toyota, </em>19 Haw. 651, 653 (1909). In one sense it means \u201ceverybody, and accordingly the body of the people at large\u201d or \u201cthe community at large, without reference to the geographical limits of any corporation like the city, town, or county[.]\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1104 (rev. 5th ed. 1979). It is also apt in referring to \u201c[t]he whole body politic, or the aggregate of the citizens of a state, nation, or municipality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>So employed, \u201cpublic\u201d refers to \u201corganized government.\u201d <em>See The Random House Dictionary of the English Language </em>233 (2d ed. 1987). In the past this court has \u201ctake[n] the word \u2018public\u2019 to mean of or relating to Government.\u201d <em>Oahu Ry. v. Brown, </em>8 Haw. 163, 165 (1890).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">When confronted by doubleness of meaning or indistinctiveness of an expression in a statute, as we are here, our function \u201cis to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the legislature.\u201d <em>In re Hawaiian Telephone Co., </em>61 Haw. 572, 577, 608 P.2d 383, 387 (1980) (citations omitted). Parsing the lengthy sentence that comprises the paragraph with its history in mind, we are led to the ineluctable conclusion that the legislature intended \u201cthe public,\u201d as employed in \u00a7 204(2), would encompass the Government and its agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-10\">Before its amendment in 1976, the paragraph, then the third paragraph of \u00a7 204(2), read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-11\">In the management of any retained available lands not required for leasing under section 207(a), the department may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>dispose of such lands by lease or license to <em>the general public, </em>including native Hawaiians, on the same terms, conditions, restrictions and uses applicable to the disposition of public lands as provided in chapter 171; provided, that the department may not sell such lands in fee simple except as authorized under section 205 of this Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">HHCA \u00a7 204(2) (HRS 1968) (emphasis supplied). After the amendment, the paragraph read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-6\">In the management of any retained available lands not required for leasing under section 207(a), the department may dispose of such lands to <em>the public, </em>including native Hawaiians, on the same terms, conditions, restrictions and uses applicable to the disposition of public lands as provided in chapter 171; provided, that the department may not sell or dispose of such lands in fee simple except as authorized under section 205 of this Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Session Laws of Hawaii (SLH) 1976, c 24, \u00a7 1 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">A purpose of the amendment was \u201cto grant the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands full authority to manage available Hawaiian home lands not required for leasing[.]\u201d Sen. Standing Comm. Rep. No. 600-76, in 1976 Senate Journal, at 1141. The legislative committee reports accompanying the amendatory measure, however, give no reason for the deletion of \u201cthe general public\u201d and the substitution instead of \u201cthe public.\u201d Still, the legislative action can only signify the perception of a dissimilarity of meaning and an intention to effect some change in the application of the statute. In light of the stated purpose to invest the Commission with \u201cfull authority to manage retained available . . . lands,\u201d we think the amendment could only have been meant to dispel any notion that the Commission was not vested with such authority, including the power to lease to the government or its agencies \u201cavailable lands not required for leasing under section 207(a).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">The deleted term, in our view, is apt when reference is made to the people or community at large. <em>See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, supra; see also Rayor v. City of Cheyenne, </em>63 Wyo. 72, 81, 178 P.2d 115, 116 (1947) (\u201cThe general public embraces all the people.\u201d). But it would not be appropriate if the intended reference is to \u201corganized government.\u201d <em>See The Random House Dictionary of the English Lan</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number><em>guage, supra. </em>Hence, we could not logically infer the legislative intent was to prevent the issuance of leases to the Government or its agencies of available lands not needed for the purposes described by \u00a7 207(a) when the substitution of terms occurred. For the language change would not have effectuated such design.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">The subsequent amendment of \u00a7 204(2) by the Constitutional Convention of Hawaii of 1978 bolsters the conclusion that an intendment of the 1976 amendment was to render clear the Commission\u2019s authority to lease, to the Government or its agencies, lands not required for leasing under \u00a7 207(a). The constitutional assembly \u201cchanged the language in Section 204 of the Act in order to grant the department more control of their lands.\u201d Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 56, in 1 <em>Proceedings of the Constitutional Convention of Hawaii of 1978, </em>at 633 (1980) [hereinafter <em>1978 Proceedings]. </em>With respect to \u00a7 204(2), the convention \u201cadded language ... in order to [enable the Commission] to lease lands directly and preferentially to native Hawaiians for commercial, industrial or other business purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The means chosen to accomplish this was the second proviso to \u00a7 204(2), which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-7\">provided further that the department is expressly authorized to negotiate, prior to negotiations with <em>the general public, </em>the disposition of a lease of Hawaiian home lands to a native Hawaiian, or organization or association owned or controlled by native Hawaiians, for commercial, industrial, or other business purposes, in accordance with the procedure set forth in section 171-59, Hawaii Revised Statutes, subject to the notice requirement of section 171-16(c), Hawaii Revised Statutes, and the lease rental limitation imposed by section 171-17(b), Hawaii Revised Statutes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">Comm. Proposal No. 11, in <em>1978 Proceedings, </em>at 809-10 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">What is significant, of course, is that the phrase discarded in 1976 by the legislature reappears in the proviso designed to afford preferential treatment for native Hawaiians when the Commission decides to lease Hawaiian home lands for \u201ccommercial, industrial or other business purpose.\u201d As employed therein, \u201cgeneral public\u201d could only mean the public or the community at large, not the government. Significant too is the requirement that the disposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>of leases thereunder must follow the procedure set forth in HRS \u00a7 171-59 rather than in \u00a7 171-95, which governs the disposition of leases \u201cto governments, government agencies, and public utilities[.]\u201d HRS \u00a7 171-95. The constitutional assembly, like the legislature, recognized that \u201cthe public\u201d and \u201cthe general public\u201d are not necessarily synonymous and employed the latter term in authorizing a preference for native Hawaiians over the rest of the community at large when the Commission disposed of a lease of Hawaiian home lands for \u201cbusiness purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Having concluded that section 204(2) permits a lease to a government agency of \u201cretained available lands not required for leasing under section 207(a),\u201d we turn to the question of whether the Commission\u2019s action in leasing 4.3 acres of land to the DOT was consistent with other provisions of the Act and with procedures imposed by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">As we noted, the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands is authorized under \u00a7 207(a) of the Act</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-9\">to lease to native Hawaiians the right to the use and occupancy of a tract or tracts of Hawaiian home lands within the following acreage limits per each lessee: (1) not more than forty acres of agriculture lands or lands used for aquaculture purposes; or (2) not more than one hundred acres of irrigated pastoral lands and not more than one thousand acres of other pastoral lands; or (3) not more than one acre of any class of land to be used as a residence lot[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">The lands in question, the appellants urge, \u201care ... immediately needed for [the foregoing] purposes ... [and] should not have been disposed of pursuant to \u00a7 204(2) of the Act[.]\u201d They maintain the people of Ka\u2018u \u201chave had homestead applications filed with DHHL for these lands but none of the applications have been processed\u201d and \u201c[t]he Commission contracted for a Management Plan for the area with the understanding that \u2018homestead settlement on the land would be the highest priority.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>True, the lands of Kamaoa-Puueo have never been leased to native Hawaiians for any of the purposes delineated in \u00a7 207(a), but for good reason. \u201cKa\u2018u,\u201d as the Commission\u2019s chairman observed, \u201cis wide-open, unimproved, abused by non-native as well as native Hawaiians.\u201d Minutes of the meeting of the Commission conducted on July 28, 1983. \u201c[T]here is potential for the area but water is critical.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And the Commission decision to lease 4.3 acres to the DOT was founded in part on a belief that \u201c[t]he arrangement... is one that would enhance Ka\u2018u by bringing water to the area for the benefit of the Ka\u2018u residents and making it possible to start a homesteading community there.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under the circumstances, we discern no basis for holding the lands in question were not disposable by lease pursuant to \u00a7 204(2) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">The Department of Hawaiian Home Lands \u201cwas established by the Act to provide a means to rehabilitate its beneficiaries through a series of projects[.]\u201d Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 56, in <em>1978 Proceedings, </em>at 631. Unfortunately the department \u201cwas given very little financial assistance to perfect its mandate[,]\u201d and \u201cmust lease [some available lands] in order to generate revenues to support its administrative and operating budget.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, 4.3 acres of the 11,000 acre tract of unimproved lands were leased to a government agency to \u201cenhance a Homesteading Program at South Point\u201d the department hopes to establish. <em>See supra </em>note 2. We could hardly deem this less compatible with the mandate to rehabilitate native Hawaiians through a series of projects than leasing available lands to generate revenues for the department\u2019s administrative and operating budget.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">We also find no merit in the appellants\u2019 alternative position that the department was obliged, nonetheless, to give preference to native Hawaiians in the disposition of the lease. If the decision had been to lease the land in question \u201cfor commercial, industrial, or other business purposes,\u201d the second proviso in the second paragraph of section 204(2) which authorizes such preferential treatment would have applied. But we would not characterize the construction and maintenance of a boat-launching facility by a government agency as a \u201ccommercial, industrial, or other business\u201d activity. Thus, we examine the procedure followed by the department in the light of applicable statutory provisions to decide whether the requirements of law were met.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">When the disposition of Hawaiian home lands under the authority of section 204(2) of the Act is by way of a lease to a government agency, the controlling statute is HRS \u00a7 171-95, more particularly \u00a7 I7l-95(a)(2) which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-6\">(a) Notwithstanding any limitations to the contrary, the board of land and natural resources [the Commission in this instance] may, without public auction:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-7\">(2) Lease to the governments, agencies, and public utilities, public lands for terms up to, but not in excess of, sixty-five years at such rental and on such other terms and conditions as the board may determine[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">And when the use of Hawaiian home lands by a government agency \u201cdirectly benefits the department or homestead lessees,\u201d the rent may be nominal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">The lease here is for a term of fifty-five years, within the sixty-five year limitation imposed by law, and lease rent payable for the first fifteen years is set at $41,164, though the market value of such rent as determined by an independent appraiser was $10,575.

Although the basic upgrading of the facility will provide a better and safer situation for all of the general public, the presence of water, better access to South Point, the prospect of future jobs (i.e., licenses) for native Hawaiians, and the general upgrading and protection of the area is a direct benefit to the Department and its native Hawaiian beneficiaries. With respect to the Management Plan for Kamaoa-Puueo the Department is presently preparing, the proposed boat launching facility would be compatible with other uses being considered and could greatly enhance a Homesteading Program at South Point, if properly planned for. To this end, the LMD recommends approval of this request.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b579-9\"> On August 25, 1983, HHC \u201cvoted to accept the Department of Transportation\u2019s proposal as modified by the Commission.

It does not seem to me, in the circumstances of this case, that the two terms are mutually exclusive. The lease is for a boat ramp. A boat ramp serves a public purpose, in that it is used by members of the boating public. It can, and often does, also serve a commercial purpose, in that fees can be charged for the use of the ramp by members of the public. Nothing in the lease in question excludes such charges being made by the lessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Appellees say that they have the power, under the Act, to make leases to government agencies as they will, and that, because they considered that the lease in question would be of benefit to native Hawaiians, by providing improvements to tract lands, we should honor their expertise in the field, and grant deference to their determination. The Department of Hawaiian Home Lands is not, however, an ordinary government agency. As we said in <em>Ahuna v. Department of Hawaiian Home Lands, </em>64 Haw. 327, 640 P.2d 1161 (1982):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-7\">In dealing with eligible native Hawaiians collectively or individually, appellant must adhere to high fiduciary duties normally owed by a trustee to its beneficiaries.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 338. Later in that case, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-9\">One specific trust duty is the obligation to administer the trust solely in the interest of the beneficiary. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-10\">A second fundamental trust obligation is to use reasonable skill and care to make trust property productive, ... or simply to act as an ordinary and prudent person would in dealing with his own property.. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-11\">Given these two basic duties of a trustee, we now impose them on the Hawaiian Homes Commission, the individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>commissioners, and the Department to determine whether there has been a breach of fiduciary duties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\"><em>Ahuna </em>and other cases which have come before us indicate that the Department is sometimes less than perfect in executing its fiduciary duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">Appellants, in their complaint at paragraphs 1, 28, 45, 46 and 52, allege that they are native Hawaiians, willing to take the lease in question. In the answer, most of the allegations of paragraph 1 are admitted. The remaining allegations of paragraph 1 and the allegations of paragraph 28 and 52 are denied for lack of knowledge. The allegations of paragraph 45 are admitted and the allegations of paragraph 46 are denied. Therefore, the question of the willingness and ability of the appellants to accept and carry out the lease in question was at issue. Nothing in the stipulation of facts or the papers in support of the motion for summary judgment refutes their claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-10\">Moreover, there is nothing in the record to indicate that the appellees ever gave any consideration to attempting to find a lessee who was a native Hawaiian, or an organization controlled by native Hawaiians, or that granting of a lease, equivalent to General Lease No. 213, to such a lessee could not have served the purposes of the trust equally as well as granting a lease to the Department of Transportation (DOT).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-11\">I would hold that so long as the lease in question had commercial as well as public aspects to it, the appellees, as fiduciaries, had a duty under the second paragraph of \u00a7 204(2) of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act to, at least, give consideration to making the lease in question to beneficiaries of the Act and, accordingly, would reverse the summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-13\">A disposition of this case under I, above, would avoid the necessity of construing the second paragraph of \u00a7 204(2) to determine if appellees have the power, thereunder, to dispose of trust lands to other government agencies for \u201cpublic purposes.\u201d Since I am unable to persuade a majority of my brethren on the narrow trust issue, I must then deal with the construction question.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>The Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 42 Stat. 108, is a federal statute originally adopted by the Congress of the United States in 1921. Article 4 of the Hawaii Admission Act, 73 Stat. 4, gave the new State of Hawaii power to amend the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act by statute only with the consent of the United States. With respect to \u00a7 204(2) of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, the Admission Act, however, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-5\">Provided, That. .. paragraph (2) of section 204,.. . relating to the powers and duties of officers other than those charged with the administration of said Act, may be amended in the constitution, or in the manner required for State legislation[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">The lease in question was issued in 1983, but the amendment to \u00a7 204(2) by Act 271 of the Session Laws of 1965 was not approved by Congress until October 27, 1986. 100 Stat. 3143. I assume that that approval was retrospective in nature and validated the lease in question. Since the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act remains a federal statute, its proper construction is a matter of federal law, upon which we, of course, do not have the last word.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">Appellees contend that they have power under the first clause of the second paragraph \u00a7 204(2) to make the lease in question. They assert that clause gives them the same power that the Department of Land and Natural Resources (DL&amp;NR) has under HRS Chapter 171 in dealing with other public lands. They point to HRS \u00a7 171-95 as giving the DL&amp;NR the power to make leases such as General Lease No. 213. In other words, appellees argue that the phrase \u201cthe department may dispose of those lands to the public, including native Hawaiians, on the same terms, conditions, restrictions, and uses applicable to the disposition of public lands under chapter 171\u201d means that they may make dispositions (except in fee) to government agencies for public purposes as they choose.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">The first question then is whether a government agency is a part of the \u201cpublic\u201d. While a government agency is often called a public agency, nevertheless, the function of the government is to serve the public and, in common usage, the government and the public are separate. I would not, therefore, in this context, construe \u201cpublic\u201d as including the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">The second problem is with the argument that the granting of the right to the department to dispose of lands to the public in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>eludes the right to dispose of them for a \u201cpublic purpose\u201d. There is, in the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act in \u00a7 207, a specific provision dealing with dispositions of lands for a \u201cpublic purpose\u201d. Section 207(c)(1) expressly provides, in summary, as the parties to this action agree, that the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands can grant easements for railroads, telephone lines, electric power and light lines, gas mains, and the like. It further provides that the Department can grant <em>licenses </em>within a district in which lands are leased under the provisions of the Act, for, among other things, public purposes. If the provision in \u00a7 204(2) granting the Department the power to dispose of lands to the public encompasses the power to make dispositions for a \u201cpublic purpose\u201d, then the provisions of \u00a7 207(c) of the Act are mere surplusage, devoid of any effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Moreover, the \u201cpublic purpose\u201d clause in \u00a7 207(c), under the principle of <em>ejusdem generis, </em>seems to encompass uses which directly benefit the particular Hawaiian Home tract, rather than a benefit to the public at large which, as in this case, only incidentally, by virtue of the construction requirements in the lease, also benefits the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">Section 212 of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, with respect to lands returned by the Department to the DL&amp;NR, specifically provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-8\">Notwithstanding the provisions of section 171-95, Hawaii Revised Statutes, in the leasing of Hawaiian home lands by the board to a public utility or other governmental agency, where such use directly benefits the department of Hawaiian home lands or the homestead lessees, the rental may be nominal; in all other instances, the lease rental shall be no less than the value determined in accordance with section I71-17(b), Hawaii Revised Statutes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">HRS \u00a7 171-17(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-10\">Drawing or negotiation. The sale price or lease rental of lands to be disposed of by drawing or by negotiation shall be no less than the value determined by a disinterested appraiser or appraisers whose services shall be contracted for by the board, and such appraisal, and any further appraisal made at the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>quest of the purchaser and with the approval of the board, shall be at the cost of the purchaser.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The record reflects that the appraiser, under the DOT\u2019S proposal to the appellees, was directed to discount the fair rental value of the land in question and the lease, by its terms, substituted in place of some of the rent, improvements of a specified value. Moreover, the lease does not restrict the area on which those improvements may be constructed, to the area affected by the lease, but allows the appellees to require their construction anywhere within the 11,000 trust acres in Kamaoa-Puueo.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">Thus, under \u00a7 212 of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, the DL&amp;NR, exercising its powers under HRS \u00a7 171-95, could not have done what appellees have done, with respect to the lease in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">Appellees argue, however, in their brief, that \u201cdispose of those lands to the public\u201d provision in the second paragraph of \u00a7 204(2) gives them broader powers than the DL&amp;NR would have with respect to making leases of Hawaiian home lands for public purposes. This last argument of appellees is, in effect, that they have the right, unrestricted by any provision in the statutes, to lease trust lands to other government agencies for public purposes, and that, for the protection of the trust, we must rely entirely upon their word that they are, in such instances, acting for the benefit of the trust. The breadth of the argument, in the light of <em>Ahuna, </em>and past experience, points out the danger of adopting appellees\u2019 broad construction of the disposal phrase in the second paragraph of \u00a7 204(2) of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">I would read the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, as amended, as a whole. It appears to contain in its language a complete framework for dealing with the trust lands. It permits, under \u00a7 207(c) (1), the appellees to make dispositions for public utilities easements and, in certain instances, for public purposes. It permits lands, not being used and turned over to the DL&amp;NR, to be leased under HRS \u00a7 171-95 with certain very definite restrictions as spelled out in HRS \u00a7 171-17(b). It permits the Hawaiian Homes Commission, with restrictions, to make leases to the public. It does not, in my judgment, grant the appellees the unrestricted power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>they claim to make leases for public purposes to other government agencies.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Thus, on the question of power to make the lease, I would also reverse the judgment below.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b596-7\"> I realize, from the record, that the Department has frequently exercised its claimed power, and that legislative action would be necessary to validate those acts under my construction. However, if there is to be a power, in the Department, to turn over trust lands to other government agencies, it should be as a result of express language enacted by the legislature and approved by Congress with a full public debate on the desirability and the terms thereof. We owe the trust and its native Hawaiian beneficiaries no less.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
