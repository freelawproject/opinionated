The Circuit Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>the First Circuit held the pertinent regulation prevented a recovery of AFDC overpayments and \u201c[t]he failure of the Department to take [prompt] action .. . constitute^] affirmative misconduct\u201d equitably estopping the State from recovering any overpayments. We conclude from a review of the governing statutory scheme that the regulation prescribing the period within which action to recover AFDC overpayments must be commenced is directory despite its mandatory wording and that the State is not equitably estopped from recovering amounts overissued in food stamp vouchers. Thus, we reverse the circuit court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Ms. Carolyn Cudal and her minor daughter, who initially were considered members of their own household for benefit purposes, received AFDC payments and food stamps throughout 1984. They moved in with Ms. Cudal\u2019s parents on September 9, 1984, which made them ineligible fob public assistance as a separate household. Ms. Cudal suspected that living with her parents could result in a reduction of benefit payments for herself and her daughter. She therefore apprised the department of the change in her housing situation, going so far as to hand deliver a letter from her mother verifying the move, along with receipts of mortgage payments made by her parents and utility bills paid by them. Hence, as the circuit court found, \u201c[a]s of September 14, 1984, [the department] was on notice of the change in [the benefit recipient\u2019s] living circumstances.\u201d Finding of Fact No. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">Yet DSSH made no effort to prompdy adjust the benefits or recoup the overpayments. More than a month passed before Ms. Cudal was asked to submit additional information to enable a re-computation of benefits. And it was not until January 18, 1985, when she met with a social worker for a required semi-annual eligibility review, that Ms. Cudal was informed she would no longer receive food stamps. But she was assured by the social worker that the AFDC payments would not be affected by the change in circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">DSSH served Ms. Cudal with a Notice of Expiration of Food Stamps on January 25, 1985. It nevertheless sent her food stamp vouchers in February and March, which were returned promptly. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>The department finally stopped sending Ms. Cudal vouchers in April. And on May 3, 1985, despite the social worker\u2019s assurance that AFDC payments would not be diminished, Ms. Cudal was informed that there had been overpayments in AFDC benefits for her daughter and herself. The Overpayment and Repayment Action Notice stated they had been paid $210.00 more in AFDC benefits and $709.00 more in food stamps than they were eligible to receive. An amended notice restating the amount of overpaid AFDC benefits as $245.00 was sent later to Ms. Cudal.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Ms. Cudal signified her intent to contest the recovery of the allegedly excessive payments by filing a Request for Fair Hearing, recounting therein her timely efforts to apprise DSSH of the change in her situation and the department\u2019s inaction. It failed, she asserted, \u201cto adjust the benefits <em>promptly </em>as is required\u201d by federal regulations, and its tardy action \u201cestopped [it] from seeking recoupment of the overpayment.\u201d But in the opinion of the Fair Hearing Officer, \u201c[d]espite the litany of inaction by the Department to adjust the claimant\u2019s financial and food stamp benefits, there [was] no basis to dismiss the overpayment and overissuance.\u201d She also ordered \u201c[t]he Department [to] recalculate the financial overpayment to include verified utility costs and [to] properly claim and recover the financial overpayment pursuant to Administrative Rule \u00a717-626-17.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Ms. Cudal sought judicial review of the unfavorable decision, reiterating the grounds for reversal urged in the administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>proceeding. But this time, her argument did not fall on deaf ears. In ruling on the matter of AFDC benefits the circuit court concluded: \u201c45 C.F.R. \u00a7 233.20(a)(13)(i)(A) mandates that the Department take prompt action to recoup overpayments\u201d;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201c45 C.F.R. \u00a7 233,.20(a)(13)(i)(E) mandates that the Department recoup an overpayment by the end of the calendar quarter following the calendar quarter in which an overpayment is discovered\u201d;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>\u201c[t]he Department\u2019s failure to initiate recoupment within the period prescribed by [the latter provision] bars [it] from any further attempts at recoupment of the financial assistance overpayment.\u201d The court further concluded \u201c[t]he failure of the Department to take any action to recoup [the] financial and food stamps overpayments for more than eight months after [the Cudals\u2019] change in living circumstances was first reported constitutes affirmative misconduct\u201d which \u201cestopped [it] from recoupment of any portion of [the] financial or food stamps overpayments.\u201d The department now turns to this court, seeking to reinstate the administrative decision that recovery of the overpaid benefits is not foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">\u201cWhen [federal] money is spent to promote the general welfare, the concept of welfare or the opposite is shaped by Congress, not the states.\u201d <em>Rosado v. Wyman, </em>397 U.S. 397, 423 (1970) (quoting <em>Helvering v. Davis, </em>301 U.S. 619, 645 (1937)). We therefore begin our analysis of the issues posed on appeal with an overview of the AFDC program.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">The program was \u201cestablished by Title IV of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 601-613, and \u2018designed to provide financial assistance to needy dependent children and the parents or relatives who live with and care for them[.]\u2019 <em>Shea v.

Chang, </em>64 Haw. 345, 348, 641 P.2d 1321, 1324 (1982). \u201cIt is financed in large measure by the Federal Government on a matching-fund basis, and participating States must submit AFDC plans in conformity with the Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) [now the Department of Health and Human Services].\u201d <em>Shea v. Vialpando, </em>416 U.S. at 253. Although the State is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>\u201cgiven broad discretion in administering the program, noncompliance with federal requirements can result in a cut-off of matching funds.\u201d <em>Montalvo v. Chang, </em>64 Haw. at 348, 641 P.2d at 1324 (citing <em>Rosado v. Wyman, </em>397 U.S. at 420-23).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The federal requirements relating to the recovery of AFDC benefits paid in error are stated in the Code of Federal Regulations at 45 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 233.20(a)(13)(i)(A) and 233.20(a)(13)(i)(E). In order to comply with the relevant federal standard, \u201c[t]he State must take all reasonable steps necessary to promptly correct any overpayment.\u201d <em>See supra </em>note 2. And the State must either \u201c[r] eco ver the overpayment,\u201d \u201cinitiate action to locate and/or recover the overpayment,\u201d or \u201cexecute a monthly recovery agreement\u201d before \u201cthe end of the [calendar] quarter following [that] in which the overpayment is first identified.\u201d <em>See supra </em>note 3.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">The department acknowledges a failure \u201cto initiate action to recoup by the end of the [crucial] quarter.\u201d It recognizes the foregoing federal regulations are couched in mandatory terms. Yet it would have us reinstate the administrative decision because \u201cfederal law does not bar recoupment [of the AFDC benefits overpaid] in this case; in fact, [the law] requires it.\u201d We would have to agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>Granted, \u201c[i]t is difficult to conceive of anything more absolute than a time limitation.\u201d 2A <em>Sutherland on Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 57.19, at 682 (C. Sands 4th ed. 1984). Yet courts \u201cdo not always [give] mandatory effect to procedural provisions, though the .. . language .. . may be obligatory in form.\u201d <em>Perry v. Planning Commission, </em>62 Haw. 666, 675-76, 619 P.2d 95, 102 (1980). \u201cSeemingly absolute time periods for administrative action . . . are often considered mere guides for the conduct of business with dispatch and for orderly procedure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 676, 619 P.2d at 103 (citations omitted). Generally, they are \u201ccharacterized as directory, unless time is of the essence of the act required, the [governing] statute contains negative language denying the exercise of authority beyond the period prescribed for action, or a disregard of the relevant provision would injuriously affect public interests or private rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). <em>See also </em>2A <em>Sutherland on Statutory Construction, supra, </em>at 682-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">The regulation prescribing administrative action to recover overpayments \u201cby the end of the quarter following the quarter in which the overpayment is first identified\u201d was promulgated to implement a provision of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, Pub. L. No. 97-35, 95 Stat. 357 (1981).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Prior to the passage of the Act, \u201c[t]here [were] no provisions ... specifying how States [were] to treat overpayments and underpayments [of AFDC benefits]. In practice, States [were] given the option of recouping over-payments, but [were] not required to do so.\u201d S. Rep. No. 139, <em>supra, </em>at 519, <em>reprinted in </em>1981 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News at 785. The major problem, Congress noted, was with overpayments.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>\u201c[b]y requiring the correction of both overpayments and underpayments, [Congress hoped] that recipients and welfare agencies alike [would] be encouraged to take greater responsibility for assuring the accuracy of [the program\u2019s] administration.\u201d <em>Id., reprinted in </em>1981 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News at 786. The Social Security Act, as amended by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, thus mandates a State AFDC plan shall \u201cprovide that the State agency will promptly take all necessary steps to correct any overpayment or underpayment of aid under the State plan.\u201d <em>See supra </em>note 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">But Congress set no time limit for the recovery or adjustment of overpayments and underpayments. That the regulation in question reflects the congressional will not to have a \u201cstatute of limitations\u201d barring the recovery of overpayments is substantiated by the history of the regulation as recorded in the Federal Register. The departmental view reflected there is that \u201c[t]he Act requires correction of \u2018any\u2019 overpayment or underpayment.\u201d 47 Fed. Reg. 5671 (1982).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Given the general purpose of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act to \u201crestrain Federal spending,\u201d <em>see supra </em>note 5, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>lack of any indication that \u201ctime is of the essence of the act[ion] required\u201d or the administrative agency\u2019s \u201cexercise of authority beyond the period prescribed for action\u201d has been curtailed, and the fact that a \u201cdisregard of the relevant provision would [not] injuriously affect ... private rights,\u201d <em>Perry v. Planning Commission, </em>62 Haw. at 676, 619 P.2d at 102, we can only conclude the regulation in question is directory, though obligatory in form. <em>Cf. Anderson v. Commissioner of the Department of Human Services, </em>489 A.2d 1094, 1099 (Me. 1985) (Requirements in federal statute and in federal and state regulations that agencies administering AFDC program \u201cpromptly\u201d take steps to correct overpayments are directory.). It does not absolutely compel action to correct an overpayment within the quarter following that in which the overpayment is first identified and foreclose recovery thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">We turn from overpayments of direct financial assistance under the AFDC program to the question arising from the overissuance of food stamps. We begin our analysis again with a quick review of the program in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">The Food Stamp program was \u201cestablished in 1964 in an effort to alleviate hunger and malnutrition among the more needy segments of our society.\u201d <em>Department of Agriculture v. Moreno, </em>413 U.S. 528, 529 (1973) (citation omitted).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Like AFDC, it is largely financed by the Federal Government on a \u201ccost-sharing\u201d basis, <em>see </em>7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2025, and the enabling legislation requires \u201c[t]he State agency ... of each State desiring to participate in the program [to] submit for approval a plan of operation specifying the manner in which such program will be conducted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2020(d). State compliance thereafter with federal statutory and regulatory directives is enforced, as it is with the AFDC program, by withholding certain matching funds allowed by law. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2020(g) and 2025.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Like the related provisions of the Social Security Act, the statute dealing with overissuances of food stamps, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2022(a)(1), sets no time within which action to establish claims arising from erroneous issuances must be commenced.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The implementing federal regulation, however, is by no means silent in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">The perdnent regulation is 7 C.F.R. \u00a7275.18, and the State agency is obligated thereunder to take action to \u201cestablish a claim against any household that has received more food stamp benefits than it is entitled to receive.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Where \u201cadministrative error claims,\u201d i.e. claims for overissuance \u201ccaused by State agency action or failure to take action,\u201d are concerned, the agency is directed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>take action on those claims for which 12 months or less have elapsed between the month in which the error occurred and the month when it was discovered. 7 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 273.18(a)(2) and 273.18(b); <em>see supra </em>note 10. The agency \u201cmay choose to take action on those claims for which more than 12 months have [elapsed],\u201d but it \u201cshall not take action on claims for which more than six years have [elapsed] between the month [of] overissuance . . . and the month [of discovery].\u201d 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.18(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Here, the error was discovered and efforts to rectify the error were commenced within five months of the overissuances. And since the regulation states \u201cthe State agency shall take action on those claims,\u201d <em>id., </em>the inescapable conclusion is that the action was not barred. A ruling that it was would fly in the face of the plain wording of the regulation and only jeopardize the State\u2019s receipt of matching funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">The circuit court, however, premised the ruling that foreclosed the establishment of a claim for reimbursement of overissued food stamp vouchers solely on estoppel. The State\u2019s inaction, in the court\u2019s opinion, \u201cconstitute[d] affirmative misconduct\u201d which \u201ces-topped [it] from [recouping] any portion of [the] food stamps overpayments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">True, we have \u201cexplicitly maintained the validity of the notion that [the] government can be estopped.\u201d <em>Filipo v. Chanq, </em>62 Haw. 626, 635, 618 P.2d 295, 300 (1980). But at the same time, we said \u201cthe doctrine of estoppel is applicable to prevent manifest injustice to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe fact situation [in <em>Filipo v. Chang],\u201d </em>we found, was \u201cclearly necessary for its application.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The circumstances here do not cry out for an invocation of estoppel against the government as they did in <em>Filipo v. Chang.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">To begin with, Ms. Cudal suspected there might be a reduction in the assistance she was entitled to when she and her daughter became part of another household. Furthermore, that she was not entitled under the law to receive the vouchers issued to her in error also is not open to doubt. And we could not say the department\u2019s failure to act for five months was manifestly unjust for Ms. Cudal when under the federal regulation \u201c[t]he State agency may choose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>to take action on those claims for which more than 12 months have [elapsed].\u201d <em>See supra </em>note 10.

Also, the statute requires the correction of all overpayments or underpayments. We do not believe that the statute allows the flexibility to establish time limits. Also we believe that it is cost effective to attempt to recover all overpayments. If at least an attempt is not made to recover an old overpayment, it cannot be determined that the overpayment is not recoverable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-15\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b382-10\">The statutory foundation for the program is found at 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2011-2029.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b383-7\"> 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2022(a)(1), in pertinent part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-8\">The Secretary [of Agriculture] shall have the power to determine the amount of and settle and adjust any claim and to compromise or deny all or part of any such claim or claims arising under the provisions of this chapter or the regulations issued pursuant to this chapter, including, but not limited to, claims arising from fraudulent and nonfraudulent overissuances to recipients, including the power to waive claims if the Secretary determines that to do so would serve the purposes of this chapter.

The regulation says; \u201cPrompt recovery of an overpayment: A State <em>must </em>take one of the following three actions by the end of the quarter following the quarter .. . .\u201d (emphasis added). The plain and natural meaning of this provision is that if the State doesn\u2019t take action by the end of the relevant quarter, it is barred from recouping.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">I recognize that in certain cases even \u201c[s]eemingly absolute time periods for administrative action [are] considered mere guides for [conduct].\u201d <em>Perry v. Planning Commission, </em>62 Haw. 666, 675, 619 P.2d 95, 103 (1980). As the majority notes, however, such time periods are mandatory if \u201cdisregard of the relevant provision would injuriously affect public interests or private rights.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b385-12\">Here, Ms. Cudal was in no way responsible for the improper payment. To require her to pay back the benefits she received a significant time ago, and more likely than not already spent, penalizes the innocent and not the offender. Furthermore, such a harsh requirement offends the public\u2019s sense of fairness as well. To allow the state to recoup after the deadline is to encourage careless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>administration of the AFDC program. More significantly, the burden of properly administering the AFDC program is shifted onto the recipients which is not the intent of this program. In addition, the recipients must now be responsible for the administrator\u2019s stale claims of error. Finally, there are other regulations that are designed to protect the recipient from the potentially harsh consequences of recoupment. <em>See e.g., </em>45 C.F.R. \u00a7 233.20(a)(13)(i)(A)(2) (mandating that recoupment not leave the recipient with resources of less than 90% of the minimum monthly entitlement). Equitable administration of the program requires prompt recoupment of overpayments.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">The majority is correct in concluding that federal regulations do not bar recoupment of the food stamps in this case. Nevertheless, I believe recovery of the food stamps could be barred by the doctrine of equitable estoppel. The majority\u2019s reliance on the fact that Ms. Cudal was not legally entitled to the food stamps and the federal regulation does not prohibit delayed recovery is misplaced. The crucial issue underlying equitable estoppel is whether delayed recoupment of food stamps erroneously given to Ms. Cudal through no fault of her own would create a manifest injustice. <em>Cf. Filipo v. Chang, </em>62 Haw. 626, 618 P.2d 295 (1980). A strong claim of estoppel would exist, for example, if Ms. Cudal had spent the food stamps and recoupment at this time would leave her without means to purchase adequate food. The record before us and the circuit court\u2019s findings of fact, however, are not adequate to support such a conclusion. I would therefore remand for further proceedings to resolve the estoppel claim.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
