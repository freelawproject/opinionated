(\u201cOwens-Illinois\u201d). Among the errors alleged on appeal<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and cross-appeal,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we address two: whether the lower court erred in applying our modified comparative negligence statute to defeat Plaintiffs\u2019 suit because Mr. Hao was found more responsible for his injuries than all the defendants combined, and whether the lower court erred in refusing to order a new trial to determine the relative fault of Mr. Hao\u2019s employer, the United States Navy.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">We reverse the lower court as to the first ground and affirm as to the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Stephen Hao, Sr., was a Pearl Harbor shipyard worker from 1939 to 1970. While working at the shipyard Hao was exposed to asbestos dust and fibers. He was also a smoker, consuming between a pack-and-a-half and three packs of cigarettes a day. He eventually developed several different asbestos-related diseases.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">In 1979, the Haos sued numerous manufacturers and distributors of asbestos products.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They did not, however, join Mr. Hao\u2019s employer, the United States Navy. After extensive settlement discussion, the Haos settled with all Defendants, except Owens-Illinois. The case went to trial against Owens-Illinois on claims that Owens-Illinois manufactured a defective product and negligently failed to warn of the dangers associated with exposure to asbestos dust and fibers.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>At the conclusion of trial in 1985, a special verdict form was used to organize the jury verdict. It contained the names of Owens-Illinois, 22 other defendants, and Stephen Hao. The returned verdict form read in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-6\">3. [W]as Owens-Illinois\u2019 negligence [in the manufacture, distribution, sale and/or supply of asbestos products] a substantial factor in bringing about any of Mr. Hao\u2019s claimed illnesses?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-7\">. . . Yes</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-8\">5. [W]ere the products containing asbestos manufactured, distributed, sold or supplied in a defective condition?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-9\">[Yes]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-10\">6. [W]as Owens-Illinois\u2019 defective product a substantial factor in bringing about any of Mr. Hao\u2019s claimed illness?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-11\">. .. Yes</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-12\">9. Was the conduct of the United States Navy a superseding cause of Mr. Hao\u2019s claimed illnesses?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-13\">... No</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-14\">10. Was Mr. Hao negligent in smoking cigarettes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-15\">... Yes</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-16\">11. If your answer to Question 10 is \u201cyes,\u201d did the negligence of Mr. Hao in smoking cigarettes contribute as a substantial factor in bringing about any of his claimed illnesses?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-17\">... Yes</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-18\">12. If your answer to Question 11 is \u201cyes,\u201d please state with a percentage figure ... the degree of Mr. Hao\u2019s responsibility for his claimed illnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-19\">13. If you have answered \u201cyes\u201d [to questions regarding the liability of] ,any of the Defendants, then for those Defendants, please state with a percentage figure . . . the degree of responsibility of those Defendants for Mr. Hao\u2019s claimed illnesses[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-20\">Total damages were assessed at $256,000. The jury found Mr. Hao to be 51 per cent responsible for his illnesses and the combined responsibility of the Defendants to be 49 per cent. Owens-Illinois was adjudged to have been only two per cent responsible for Mr. Hao\u2019s illnesses. The trial court entered judgment for Owens-Illinois.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">The Haos allege the trial court erroneously entered judgment in favor of Owens-Illinois rather than merely reducing the Haos\u2019 award by the percentage of Mr. Hao\u2019s negligence. Citing <em>Kaneko v. Hilo Coast Processing, </em>65 Haw. 447, 654 P.2d 343 (1982), they argue that in holding that comparative negligence principles apply to products liability claims, we intended \u201cpure\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> comparative negligence principles to apply. In contrast, Owens-Illinois argues adoption of pure comparative negligence in this area is preempted by our legislature\u2019s adoption of modified comparative negligence in Hawaii Revised Statutes (\u201cHRS\u201d) \u00a7 663-31 (1985).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>We recently addressed this issue in <em>Armstrong v. Cione, </em>69 Haw. _, 738 P.2d 79 (1987). We concluded that our decision in <em>Kaneko v. Hilo Coast Processing, </em>65 Haw. at 459-64, 654 P.2d at 351-54, does not require application of our modified comparative negligence statute. <em>Armstrong, </em>69 Haw. at_, 738 P.2d at 83. We now hold that pure comparative negligence principles apply to strict products liability claims. Thus, Hao\u2019s negligence reduces but does not defeat his claim sounding in strict products liability, even though his responsibility for the damages was determined to be greater than that of the defendants.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-11\">The Haos also urge this court to \u201cremand[] for at least a partial new trial on the issue of apportionment to include the apportioning of the conduct of the United States Navy as the employer of Hao when determining ... comparative negligence.\u201d As they point out, the jury on the special verdict form found Hao\u2019s employer, the United States Navy, failed to supply a safe work place.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-12\">In <em>Espaniola v. Cawdrey Mars Joint Venture, </em>68 Haw.-, 707 P.2d 365 (1985), we reversed a grant of summary judgment to a cross-claimed employer that concluded the Hawaii Workers\u2019 Compensation Law prevented any third-party contractual liability assumed by the employer. In giving further guidance to the lower court after remand, we directed the lower court to allow determination of the \u201ccausal negligence, not liability\u201d of the absent employer. <em>Id. </em>at_, 707 P.2d at 373. In the present action, no cross-claim against the United States Navy was made. We refuse to extend to the instant case that portion of the <em>Espaniola </em>decision which permitted apportionment of the causal negligence to an absent cross-claimed employer.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AAR\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number><em>Gary O. Galiher (L. Richard DeRobertis </em>with him on the briefs; of counsel, <em>Gary Galiher &amp; Associates) </em>for Plaintiffs-Appellants/CrossAppellees Stephen K.

We remand for entry of judgment not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b271-9\"> Since we conclude the lower court erred in applying the modified comparative negligence statute, we need not reach the other issue raised by the Haos as to whether there was sufficient evidence before the jury concerning Mr. Hao\u2019s knowledge of the synergistic effect of inhaling cigarette smoke and asbestos dust and fibers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b271-10\"> On cross-appeal, Owens-Illinois attacks the lower court\u2019s order modifying the previous pre-trial orders permitting disclosure \u201cof the amount of settlement with respect to each setding defendant.\u201d The modifying court order prevented an \u201cindividual breakdown of each setding party\u2019s share,\u201d but permitted disclosure of the total amount in setdements reached. We conclude there was no abuse of discretion in modifying the earlier orders. <em>Cf. Matsushita v. Container Home Supply, Inc., </em>6 Haw. App--,_, 726 P.2d 273, 276 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b271-11\"> The Haos filed a second amended complaint on August 25, 1980.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b273-6\"> Pure comparative negligence has been explained thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-7\">In this form, a plaintiffs contributory negligence does not operate to bar his recovery altogether, but does serve to reduce his damages in proportion to his fault. The system in this form is designed to compensate an injured party for all of the harm attributable to the wrongdoing of the defendant; when multiple defendants are involved, all are liable to the plaintiff for their respective shares of the loss, even though some may have been less negligent than he. Except for West Virginia, all of the states which have adopted comparative neligence by judicial opinion have opted for the flexibility and relative simplicity of \u201cpure\u201d comparative negligence.
