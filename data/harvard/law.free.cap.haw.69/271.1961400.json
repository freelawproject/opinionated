Rutledge, its president, wherein the plaintiffs charged Rutledge and other unnamed defendants with repeated breaches of their fiduciary duties to the corporation and sought the appointment of a receiver and other relief. The circuit court concluded, <em>inter alia, </em>that the plaintiffs \u201cfailed to show ... they fairly and adequately representad] the interests of the membership of Unity House, Inc.[,]\u201d the \u201cequitable remedies requested . .. [were] not practicablef,]\u201d and \u201c[p]laintiffs [did] not request[ ] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>any remedies at law.\u201d The Intermediate Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision on grounds that the plaintiffs could not establish membership in the corporation and lacked standing to maintain a derivative suit. Upon a review of the record, however, we conclude the suit, though styled as a derivative action, was not one cognizable as such and equitable relief for the plaintiffs was not precluded. Thus, we vacate the dismissal and the affirmance and remand the case to the circuit court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">Unity House, a non-profit corporation formerly known as the Hawaii Federation of Labor Memorial Association, was granted a charter on December 24, 1951 by the Territory of Hawaii upon petition filed by Rutledge and four other persons. A primary object of the organization, as expressed in the charter, was \u201c[t]o bring together in a benevolent and fraternal organization all members, past members, and friends of the American Federation of Labor in . .. Hawaii, including the Hotel, Restaurant Employees and Bartenders Union, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, and the Transit Workers Union, Independent.\u201d Another purpose of the corporation was \u201c[t]o acquire and provide suitable quarters for the meeting, assembling, recreation, and education of members and their families.\u201d The charter also recited that \u201c[p]ersons who are members, past members, or friends of the American Federation of Labor in . . . Hawaii, including members, past members, and friends of the Hotel, Restaurant Employees and Bartenders Union, [t]he International Brotherhood of Teamsters, and the Transit Workers Union, Independent, may be admitted as members of the corporation by the affirmative vote of its Board of Directors at any meeting thereof duly called and held.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">The plaintiffs, Michael G. Chambrella, Samuel Palama, Katherine L. Roque, Richard A.T. Tam, Lucille T. Toyama, and Hajime Tsuda, though concededly qualified for membership in Unity House through active membership in local unions affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and the Hotel, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>Restaurant Employees and Bartenders Union, had not been admitted formally to membership in the non-profit corporation. But Rutledge had \u201crepeatedly represented to the members of Local 5 and Local 996, from the inception of Unity House, Inc. until at least October 1978, that the members of Local 5 and Local 996 were automatically members of Unity House, Inc.\u201d Finding of Fact No. 17, entered by the circuit court on November 5, 1985.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Claiming membership in Unity House \u201cby virtue of their membership in Locals 5 [and] 996,\u201d the plaintiffs filed suit on December 4, 1978 against Unity House, Arthur A. Rutledge, and John Does 1 through 30.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The complaint charged Rudedge and the John Doe defendants with repeated breaches of \u201ctheir fiduciary duties to the corporation by their failure to preserve the corporate assets from waste and the conversion of corporate assets to their personal use.\u201d The pleading further averred that no demand had been made \u201cupon the corporation or its purported directors to bring [the] action\u201d because \u201c[t]here ha[d] been no duly elected or appointed board of directors since at least 1961,\u201d the \u201calleged current directors [were] the <em>alter ego </em>of Defendant Rutledge who solely controlled] the corporation,\u201d and he would not have \u201cdiligently prosecuted [the] action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Rutledge and Unity House, the only defendants who were identified and served, denied that membership in Locals 5 and 996 entitled the plaintiffs to membership in Unity House, denied the allegations of violations of fiduciary duties, and raised a host of defenses ranging from the complaint\u2019s failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted to the lack of standing on plaintiffs\u2019 part to bring the suit. Hence, a primary issue in the case from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>outset was whether the plaintiffs were members of Unity House or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The defendants also filed a counterclaim, charging that the plaintiffs had maliciously brought suit without probable cause and in abuse of process to further Chambrella\u2019s campaign against Rutledge for the presidency of Local 996 and to influence the government investigation of the election for officers of Local 5 in which the plaintiff members of Local 5 had been candidates. This was only the beginning of the acrimonious legal batde punctuated by numerous skirmishes that yielded thirteen volumes of documents for the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">The case was finally heard by the circuit court in 1985 on the amended complaint filed in 1982, wherein the plaintiffs sought to buttress their claims to equitable relief with further allegations of wrongdoing on the part of Rutledge and others purportedly controlled by him and amplified their specific prayers for relief. Though the amended pleading essentially sought the removal of Rudedge as president and the ultimate dissolution of the nonprofit corporation, it also contained a general prayer requesting \u201csuch other additional relief as may seem just and equitable to the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">At the close of plaintiffs\u2019 case on September 4, 1985, the defendants successfully moved for a \u201cdirected verdict.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In its written findings entered on November 5, 1985, the trial court found, <em>inter alia, </em>that the plaintiffs were \u201cactive dues paying members\u201d of Local 5 and Local 996, Locals 5 and 996 had each \u201cpaid a monthly amount, as a conduit for its members, to Unity House, Inc.\u201d during relevant periods, these payments amounted to more than $10 for each member, a total of $1,370,329.20 had been paid by Local 5 during the period from 1952 to January 1980, and a total of $1,264,256.30 had been paid by Local 996 from April 1957 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>January 1981. The court further found Rutledge had been \u201cthe chief executive officer of Local 996 and President of Unity House, Inc. from at least 1951 to the [time of trial],\u201d he \u201crepeatedly represented to the members of Local 5 and Local 996, from the inception of Unity House, Inc. until at least October 1978, that the members of Local 5 and Local 996 were automatically members of Unity House, Inc.,\u201d \u201c[application forms for membership in Unity House, Inc. ... did not exist until February 1982,\u201d and the members of the two locals \u201cwere never informed ... that it was necessary to submit an application form to the membership committee of Unity House, Inc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Findings that there had been no annual elections of corporate officers between 1961 and 1982 and no annual meetings of members between 1961 and 1983, as required under the corporation\u2019s by-laws and the laws of the State were also rendered. And other violations of fiduciary duties were found by the trial court. The court, however, found that \u201c[a]ll of the misconduct, breach of fiduciary duties, wrongdoing and illegal acts purportedly committed by the Defendants and alleged' in the Complaint have been corrected since this action was instituted or were de minimis[.]\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court therefore concluded these breaches could \u201cnot serve as the bases for [a] derivative action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The trial court further concluded that the plaintiffs had standing to bring a derivative action when suit was commenced in 1978 and defendants were \u201cequitably estopped to deny that Plaintiffs were members of Unity House, Inc. in 1978 due to the statements of Defendant Rutledge as president of ... Unity House, Inc., and the lack of a membership application form or a membership committee until April 1982, and the acceptance of monthly payments by Unity House, Inc. from the members of Local 5 and Local 996.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">The court, however, concluded too that Chambrella and Palama could not \u201cfairly and adequately represent the membership of Local 996\u201d or the interests of shareholders and members of Unity House, the plaintiffs lacked \u201cstanding to bring this action because monthly payments... on behalf of the members of Local 5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>[were stopped] in January 1980 and [payments] on behalf of the members of Local 996 [were stopped] in January 1981,\u201d and the directors\u2019 meeting conducted in April 1982 resulted in a valid amendment of provisions of the by-laws relating to membership and could be enforced against all of the corporation\u2019s members. The court deemed the equitable remedies sought by plaintiffs impracticable; and since no remedies at law had been requested, it concluded a \u201cdirected verdict\u201d in favor of Unity House, Rutledge, and Local 996 was meet and just.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Arguing that \u201c [findings should be made only on issues necessary to the disposition of the case\u201d and objecting to the trial court\u2019s adoption of findings proposed by the plaintiffs, the defendants moved to amend the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law entered on November 5, 1985. In lieu of the fifty-eight findings and eleven conclusions therein, the defendants submitted thirty-four innocuous or self-serving findings and seventeen conclusions. The trial court entered Amended Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law on January 2,1986, deleting the bulk of the earlier findings. The new findings, for the most part, avoided references to events antedating the commencement of suit and emphasized what happened thereafter. The earlier conclusion that the plaintiffs had standing to sue in 1978 was omitted, as was the conclusion that defendants were \u201cequitably estopped to deny that Plaintiffs were members of Unity House, Inc. in 1978.\u201d And the court held that \u201c[a]t this point of the case, for the reason that no determination of the proper members of the corporation can be made upon the state of the evidence, the derivative action must fail.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiffs appealed, and the appeal was assigned to the Intermediate Court of Appeals for hearing and disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>C.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">In the appellate court\u2019s view the dispositive issue was \u201cwhether Plaintiffs, by virtue of their membership in the Hotel and Restaurant Employees\u2019 Union, Local 5, AFL-CIO (Local 5), and Hawaii Teamsters and Allied Workers\u2019 Union, Local 996 (Local 996), are members of Unity House and have standing to bring this action.\u201d <em>Chambrella v. </em>Rutledge, <em>aff'd mem. </em>(Haw. App., filed Jan. 23, 1987). The court deemed irrelevant the argument that the defendants were estopped from denying the plaintiffs were members of Unity House because membership requirements had been waived for members of Local 5 and Local 996 and membership dues had been paid on their behalf and accepted. It went on to say the corporate charter controlled the admission of members, the amended by-laws of Unity House calling for membership applications and action thereon by a committee were invalid, and plaintiffs had not satisfied charter requirements relating to membership. And the court concluded: \u201cWithout proof of compliance with the charter provision or its amendment to make persons in Plaintiffs\u2019 situation members of Unity House, Plaintiffs cannot claim such membership and cannot maintain this action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">We granted the petition seeking further review of the trial court\u2019s decision because we were troubled by the appellate court\u2019s ruling, which in essence was that equitable relief for plaintiffs was barred because of the defendants\u2019 failure to abide by a charter provision governing membership in the corporation, as well as the trial court\u2019s ruling that \u201c[t]he equitable remedies requested by Plaintiffs\u2019 [sic] are not practicablef.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">Since both courts treated the plaintiffs\u2019 suit as a derivative action and ruled the plaintiffs could not maintain the suit, we begin our analysis by examining the attributes of such actions and the procedural requisites for their maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">A derivative action is a creature of equity. <em>Yokochi v. Yoshimoto, </em>44 Haw. 297, 300, 353 P.2d 820, 823 (1960). \u201cAs business enter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>prise increasingly sought the advantages of incorporation, management became vested with almost uncontrolled discretion in handling other people\u2019s money.\u201d <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 547 (1949). But \u201c[corporate laws were lax and were not self-enforcing, and [shareholders], in face of gravest abuses, were singularly impotent in obtaining redress of abuses of trust.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 547-48. \u201cEquity came to the relief of the [shareholder], who had no standing to bring civil action at law against faithless directors and managers. Equity, however, allowed him to step into the corporation\u2019s shoes and to seek in its right the restitution he could not demand in his own.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 548.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">When the shareholder brings a derivative action, he \u201cis only a nominal plaintiff.\u201d 13 W.M. Fletcher, <em>Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations </em>\u00a7 5939, at 13 (rev. ed. 1984). \u201cThe substantive claim belongs to the corporation[,]\u201d and it is the \u201creal part[y] in interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnotes omitted). The corporation thus \u201coccupies a dual position in the litigation.\u201d H. Henn &amp; J. Alexander, <em>Laws of Corporations and Other Business Enterprises </em>\u00a7 358, at 1037 (3d ed. 1983). It is \u201cthe real party plaintiff\u2019 and \u201ca nominal party defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And \u201c[a]ny relief that is awarded ... takes the form of a judgment... that... runs in favor of the corporation.\u201d 7C C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; M. Kane, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 1821, at 4 (1986) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">\u201cWhere the basis of the action is a wrong to the corporation, redress must be sought in a \u2018derivative\u2019 action.\u201d 12B W.M. Fletcher, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 5908, at 411 (footnote omitted). \u201cIf the injury is one to the plaintiff as a [shareholder] and to him individually, and not to the corporation, as where the action is based on a contract to which he is a party, or on a right belonging severally to him, or on a fraud affecting him direcdy, it is an individual action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5911, at 420 (footnotes omitted).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But \u201ca personal action of this type . . . brought by representative [shareholders] on behalf of all of them .. . may qualify as a class action under [HRCP] 23.\u201d 7C C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; M. Kane, <em>supra, </em>at 6-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">HRCP 23.1, which follows the federal paradigm and deviates from Rule 23.1 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Fed. R. Civ. P.) in only one respect, establishes the procedures governing derivative actions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The rule requires that the complaint \u201cshall be verified and shall allege that the plaintiff was a shareholder or member at the time of the transaction of which he complains or that his share or membership thereafter devolved on him by operation of law.\u201d <em>See supra </em>note 7. This provision for \u201ccontemporaneous\u201d ownership or membership serves \u201cas a safeguard against champertous litigation by shareholders.\u201d 7C C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; M. Kane, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1828, at 61. It \u201cis not applicable in suits by [shareholders] to enforce their individual claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 72 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">HRCP 23.1 further compels the suing shareholder in a derivative action to \u201callege with particularity\u201d the efforts he made \u201cto obtain the action he desires from the directors or comparable authority and from the shareholders or members, and the reasons for his failure to obtain the action or for not making the effort.\u201d <em>See supra </em>note 7. This is, of course, consistent with the notion that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>corporation should have an opportunity to \u201cvindicate its own rights, but when . .. those who perpetrated the wrongs also were able to obstruct any remedy, equity would hear and adjudge the corporation\u2019s cause through its [shareholder] with the corporation as a defendant, albeit a rather nominal one.\u201d <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. at 548. Finally, the maintenance of a derivative action is contingent upon the plaintiffs ability to \u201cfairly and adequately represent the interests of the shareholders or members similarly situated in enforcing the right of the corporation.\u201d <em>See supra </em>note 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">That the plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint was tailored to satisfy the procedural mandates of HRCP 23.1 is undeniable. Claiming membership in Unity House at all relevant times and purporting to sue \u201cin the right of the corporation, which ha[d] failed to enforce the claims,\u201d the plaintiffs sued Unity House, Arthur A. Rutledge, and John Does 1 through 30. They stated with particularity the reasons why the grievances were not addressed to the directors of Unity House and asserted the interests of members similarly situated would be fairly and adequately represented. Still, \u201c[t]he distinction between a personal and a derivative action is not merely procedural. Rather, the distinction goes to the very substance of the claim and . .. can only be determined by a close reading of the complaint.\u201d <em>Tankersley v. Albright, </em>80 F.R.D. 441, 444 (N.D. Ill. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">The plaintiffs alleged in their original and amended complaints that Rutledge and the John Doe defendants had repeatedly breached their fiduciary duties to the corporation. They sought, <em>inter alia, </em>equitable relief by way of an injunction, the appointment of a receiver, the dissolution of the corporation, and the disbursement of its assets to members and creditors. When issue was joined, it became evident that whether the plaintiffs were members of Unity House or not was a primary issue. This was reiterated by the parties\u2019 trial memoranda. Plaintiffs averred in theirs that the evidence would show they were indeed members. They further averred Rutledge would, unless enjoined, continue to misappropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>corporate funds, use Unity House personnel for private gain, destroy records to hide past misdeeds, mismanage the corporation\u2019s election process, deny members of Local 5 and Local 996 membership benefits and the right to participate in the affairs of Unity House, and fail to follow proper corporate procedures. In substance, therefore, the plaintiffs were asserting claims personal unto themselves as much as corporate claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">The right to vote as a member of Unity House or to participate in its affairs in no sense ever belonged to the corporation, for these rights are personal to the member. \u201cIf the injury is one to the plaintiff as a [shareholder] and to him individually, and not to the corporation, as where the action is based on a contract to which he is a party, or on a right belonging severally to him, or on a fraud affecting him directly, it is an individual action.\u201d 12B W.M. Fletcher, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 5911, at 420 (footnotes omitted); <em>see also Eisenberg v. Flying Figer Line, Inc., </em>451 F.2d 267, 269-72 (2d Cir. 1971).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, the plaintiffs ultimately sought \u201cto completely effect the dissolution of the corporation (with a sale of all of the corporate non-cash assets) in accordance with the statutes and laws of this state and to disburse the resulting cash assets among the corporation\u2019s creditors and members.\u201d How relief of this nature could be melded into a judgment running in favor of the corporation, as a judgment in a derivative action must, escapes us. 7C C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; M. Kane, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1821, at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">The circuit court, however, failed to recognize that plaintiffs were seeking redress for injury to them individually as well as to the corporation. Thus, it concluded the \u201cderivative action must fail\u201d and dismissed the suit. This, in our opinion, was error. That the claims allegedly derived from the corporation could not be maintained did not divest the court of jurisdiction to provide relief on the individual claims<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u2014 a shareholder, as we have seen, may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>\u201cbring direct and derivative [claims] simultaneously.\u201d <em>See supra </em>note 6. Though we find no reason to take issue with the circuit court\u2019s conclusion that a derivative action was not maintainable under the circumstances, we conclude the court erred in dismissing the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">The circuit court premised the dismissal on conclusions that a derivative action could not be maintained, \u201ca determination of the Plaintiffs\u2019 membership in Unity House [could not] be made upon the evidence adduced by a preponderance of the evidence,\u201d \u201cno determination of the proper members of the corporation [could] be made upon the state of the evidence,\u201d and the \u201cequitable remedies requested by the Plaintiffs[ were] not practicable and, therefore, jurisdiction in equity [wasj denied.\u201d We have already noted our concurrence in the decision that <em>a </em>derivative action was not maintainable. But in our view the remaining conclusions cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">The court originally found the plaintiffs were \u201cactive dues paying members\u201d of Local 5 and Local 996, the union locals had each \u201cpaid a monthly amount\u201d to Unity House during relevant periods, the sums received by Unity House ostensibly as \u201cdues\u201d payments were substantial, and Rutledge \u201crepeatedly represented to the members of Local 5 and Local 996 ... that [they] were automatically members of Unity House, Inc.\u201d These findings are substantiated by the record; the record, however, belies the conclusion that \u201ca determination of the Plaintiffs\u2019 membership in Unity House ... cannot be made upon the evidence adduced by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">The conclusion that \u201cno determination of the proper members of [Unity House] can be made upon the state of the evidence\u201d is, of course, superfluous. In view of the plaintiffs\u2019 inability to maintain a derivative action and their failure to have a plaintiff class certified pursuant to HRCP 23, it was not incumbent upon the circuit court to decide who else besides the plaintiffs were properly members of Unity House. The court, however, was obligated under the pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>cepts of equity practice and HRCP 54(c)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to consider whether there were remedies other than those specifically requested to which plaintiffs may have been entitled before dismissing the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Granted, at common law the \u201cplaintiff could not recover anything other than the relief specifically requested in the ad damnum clause of his complaint.\u201d IOC. Wright, A. Miller &amp; M. Kane, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 2662, at 134. But \u201cin equity the general practice was for plaintiff to demand whatever special relief he desired and then to add a prayer for general relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And \u201c[i]f the court decided that the evidence did not justify an award of the specific remedy requested, it could rely on the general prayer for relief for the purpose of granting the relief to which plaintiff actually was entitled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted); <em>see Paradise Hui Hanalike v. Hawaiian Paradise Park Corp., </em>66 Haw. 362, 362, 662 P.2d 211, 211 (1983) (\u201cWhere, in an equitable action, the specific relief prayed for to enforce a particular duty is inappropriate, equity should fashion, by decree, appropriate relief.\u201d); <em>Lum v. Kwong, </em>39 Haw. 532, 542 (1952) (Even though the injunction sought cannot be granted, the chancellor may, if he finds the petitioner\u2019s allegations to be true, grant other appropriate relief under the general prayer for relief.). Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(c) and its Hawaii counterpart, HRCP 54(c), have adopted the approach of \u201cthe equity courts for all civil actions,... as long as the defendant has not defaulted.\u201d IOC. Wright, A. Miller &amp; M. Kane, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 2662, at 134. Thus, if the \u201cdefendant has ... begun defending the action, adherence to the particular legal theories ... suggested by the pleadings is subordinated to the court\u2019s duty to grant the relief to which the prevailing party is entitled, whether it has been demanded or not.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2664, at 146 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A9b\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number><em>Sean Kim (Arthur </em>F. <em>Park </em>and <em>Arlette S.

The plaintiffs\u2019 failure to pray for a declaration of membership in Unity House could hardly have prejudiced the defendants. Given the abundance of proof that Unity House had obtained large sums of money and services from members of Local 5 and Local 996 laboring under a belief induced by Rutledge\u2019s frequent representations that they were members of the corporation, equitable relief enabling the plaintiffs to exercise membership rights was in order.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As the circuit court originally found, the defendants were estopped to deny the plaintiffs were members of Unity House. <em>Godoy v.

With respect to plaintiffs\u2019 membership in Unity House, the court found instead that \u201c[a] determination of Plaintiffs\u2019 status as members of Unity House, Inc. cannot be made from the evidence adduced, for there does not appear to be any basis upon which such a determination can be made.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b313-8\">John Does 1 through 30 have not been identified.

In a derivative action brought by one or more shareholders or members to enforce a right of a corporation or of an unincorporated association, the corporation or association having failed to enforce a right which may properly be asserted by it, the complaint shall be verified and shall allege that the plaintiff was a shareholder or member at the time of the transaction of which he complains or that his share or membership thereafter devolved on him by operation of law. The complaint shall also allege with particularity the efforts made by the plaintiff to obtain the action he desires from the directors or comparable authority and from the shareholders or members, and the reasons for his failure to obtain the action or for not making the effort. The derivative action may not be maintained if it appears that the plaintiff does not fairly and adequately represent the interests of the shareholders or members similarly situated in enforcing the right of the corporation or association. The action shall not be dismissed or compromised without the approval of the court, and notice of the proposed dismissal or compromise shall be given to shareholders or members in such manner as the court directs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">The paradigmatic federal rule, Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.1, contains a requirement that the complaint \u201cshall allege... that the action is not a collusive one to confer jurisdiction on a court of the United States which it would not otherwise have.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b321-7\">A non-profit corporation, of course, has no shareholders; it has \u201cmembers\u201d who have \u201cmembership rights ... in accordance with its articles of incorporation or bylaws.\u201d HRS \u00a7 415B-2 (1985). But there is no doubt that the principles expressed here apply to members of non-profit corporations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b321-8\">The Plaintiffs could have brought a class action on behalf of all members similarly situated pursuant to HRCP 23.
