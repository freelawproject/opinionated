We conclude that the District Court has jurisdiction under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 571-41(f) and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-16\">On March 16, 1986, Defendant Peter B. Lapitan was arrested on a DUI charge in violation of HRS \u00a7 291-4. At that time, he was sixteen years old. Prior to trial, Defendant moved to dismiss the charge for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under HRS \u00a7 571-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>ll(l)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and to transfer the case to family court under HRS \u00a7 571-12.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On December 3, 1986, after hearing, the motions were denied on the ground that the Order promulgated by the Senior Judge of the Family Court regarding concurrent jurisdiction in traffic offenses includes DUI cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">On January 16, 1987, after a jury waived trial on stipulated facts, the Defendant was found guilty of Driving Under the Influence in violation of HRS \u00a7 291-4. The Defendant was sentenced on February 17, 1987 to pay a fine of $150.00 plus $5.00 for drivers\u2019 education, his license was suspended for a period of 90 days, and he was required to attend a fourteen-hour alcohol abuse program. Execution of sentence was stayed pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">Ordinarily, the family court shall have exclusive original jurisdiction over law violations by minors. HRS \u00a7 571-11(1). Except that for violations of traffic laws and ordinances, HRS \u00a7 57 l-41(f) allows the Senior Judge of the Family Court to confer concurrent jurisdiction to the district court. This section makes clear that \u201c[t]he exercise of jurisdiction over children by district courts shall, nevertheless, be considered noncriminal in procedure and result in the same manner as though the matter had been adjudicated and disposed of by a family court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">The Amended Order Conferring Concurrent Jurisdiction in Juvenile Traffic Cases (Order), filed August 4, 1977 by the Senior Judge of the Family Court, orders \u201cthat all alleged traffic violations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>not included within Title 37 (Hawaii Penal Code) committed by children are to be referred to the District Court of the First Circuit as provided herein.\u201d The order further provides that the district court may remand any case to the family court where the juvenile has an extensive record, is already under probation, or in the opinion of the district judge is exhibiting behavioral problems. Dispositions that the district court may make under this order are limited and do not include jail time.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys id=\"AbW\"><em>Melody Parker, </em>Deputy Public Defender <em>{Susan Barr, </em>Deputy Public Defender on the brief with <em>Tedson Koja, </em>Defender Intern, assisting), for defendant-appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">As this court has recently stated in <em>State v. Leatiota, </em>69 Haw._, 739 P.2d 930 (1987), \u201cDUI is clearly, by statute, a traffic offense, even though it is also a serious crime.\u201d Thus, as a traffic offense, DUI is within HRS \u00a7 57l-41(f). Under HRS \u00a7 57l-41(f), however, a DUI involving a minor in district court must be noncriminal in proceeding. Given the facts of this case, including the fact that jail time was not imposed, we conclude that the district court has jurisdiction under HRS \u00a7 57l-41(f), and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ALL\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number><em>Peter Van Name Esser (G.
