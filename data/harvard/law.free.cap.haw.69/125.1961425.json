The question in this taxpayer appeal from the Tax Appeal Court is whether the gross income of United Meat Company, Ltd., the operator of a slaughterhouse, is taxable at the rate of one-half of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>one per cent or four per cent of such income.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Like the Tax Appeal Court, we conclude the Director of Taxation\u2019s assessment of taxes against the taxpayer\u2019s gross income at the higher rate was consistent with the General Excise Tax Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">The dispositive facts are simple and, for the most part, uncontroverted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The taxpayer \u201cowns and operates the only licensed commercial slaughterhouse for hogs on the island of Oahu.\u201d It \u201cdoes not buy or raise hogs, nor does it sell pork chops and related products \u2014 it slaughters hogs under contract with its customers[, who] are engaged in the business of converting live hogs into pork chops and other cuts of meat.\u201d \u201cThe customers buy or raise hogs, and bring them to United Meat for slaughtering. United Meat takes in the live hogs, and returns gutted, halved, and inspected carcasses to the customers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">The taxpayer argues the gross income derived from slaughtering hogs and gutting and halving hog carcasses is taxable at the rate of one-half of one per cent by virtue of HRS \u00a7 237-18(d) (1985), which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-11\">Where, through the activity of a person taxable under section 237-13(6), a product has been milled, processed, or otherwise manufactured upon the order of another taxpayer who is a manufacturer taxable upon the value of the entire manufactured products, which consists in part of the value of the services taxable under section 237-13(6), so much gross income as is derived from the rendering of the services shall be subjected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>to tax on the person rendering the services at the rate of one-half of one per cent, and the value of the entire product shall be included in the measure of the tax imposed on the other taxpayer as elsewhere provided.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Inasmuch as the foregoing, subsection of HRS chapter 237 applies to gross income generated \u201cthrough the activity of a person taxable under section 237-13(6)\u201d and such a person is one \u201cengaging ... in any service business or calling not otherwise specifically taxed under the [chapter],\u201d United Meat acknowledges it is engaged in a service business.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> And since operators of hog slaughterhouses are \u201cnot otherwise specifically taxed under\u201d chapter 237,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the rate at which the taxpayer\u2019s gross income is taxable turns on whether it \u201cmilled, processed, or otherwise manufactured [a product] upon the order of another taxpayer who is a manufacturer.\u201d HRS \u00a7 237-lS(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The slaughtering of a hog and gutting and halving the carcass arguably can be characterized as processing a product for sale. But the pertinent statutory provision also requires that the product be \u201cprocessed . . . upon the order of another taxpayer who is a manufacturer taxable upon the value of the entire manufactured prod<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>uctQ.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Unfortunately for United Meat, the record does not substantiate that whatever it may have done was at the instance of a manufacturer.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">The taxpayer and the Director of Taxation agree that the bulk of the gross income upon which taxes were assessed was derived from services performed for the following customers: Island Pork Producers, Inc. (IPP), an agricultural cooperative association; Wong\u2019s Meat Market, Inc. (WMM), a wholesaler of pork, kalua pork, and roast pork; C.Q. Yee Hop, Ltd. (C.Q.), a wholesaler and retailer of pork and roast pork; and Kakazu Farm (Kakazu), a hog farm that wholesales pork to a supermarket chain. They further agree these entities \u201care representative of Taxpayer\u2019s customers in general.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A review of the customers\u2019 economic activities leads us to conclude they were not \u201cmanufacturers\u201d for purposes of taxation under the General Excise Tax Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">Island Pork Producers is a group of sixteen hog raisers incorporated as an agricultural cooperative association by authority of HRS chapter 421. United Meat received approximately 45% of its gross income during the relevant fiscal period from the \u201cco-op.\u201d The hogs raised by the association\u2019s members were slaughtered, gutted, and halved at the taxpayer\u2019s slaughterhouse. The pork was then wholesaled by the \u201cco-op\u201d in carcass form, as primal cuts of pork, or as roast pork.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> IPP also prepared and sold cooked pork and another product in which pork is a primary ingredient, lau lau. Kakazu Farm, like IPP\u2019s members, is a hog raiser. But unlike IPP, it wholesaled all of the pork it produced to a single customer in a fresh state. Kakazu delivered live hogs to the taxpayer\u2019s slaughter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>house, and United Meat delivered hog carcasses to Big-Way Supermarkets.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Wong\u2019s Meat Market, from whom United Meat obtained approximately a third of its business during the period in question, is a wholesaler of fresh and cooked pork. Most of the pork from hogs slaughtered and partly dressed by United Meat upon the order of Wong\u2019s Meat Market, however, was sold fresh in carcass form or as primal cuts. An insignificant fraction was sold as kalua or roast pork. C.Q. Yee Hop, like Wong\u2019s Meat Market, is a seller of fresh and cooked pork. C.Q. Yee Hop\u2019s operation differed slightly from Wong\u2019s in that a small part of the former\u2019s sales were at the retail level. The pork from hogs slaughtered for C.Q. Yee Hop by United Meat was sold fresh for the most part and only a fraction thereof was offered for sale as roast pork.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">Thus, United Meat\u2019s typical customers are either hog raisers or pork merchants. But the taxpayer argues they nevertheless were \u201cmanufacturers\u201d for general excise tax purposes. It reaches this conclusion through a two-step process. Initially, United Meat contends the services performed for its customers constituted \u201cmanufacturing\u201d within the meaning of HRS \u00a7 237-13(l).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It submits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>\u201cmanufacturing,\u201d as defined therein, includes \u201cprocessing, refining, or preparing for sale . .., either directly or through the activity of others, in whole or in part, any article or articles, substance or substances, commodity or commodities.\u201d Since United Meat processed or prepared hogs for sale, it claims it was engaged in manufacturing. And in its view, \u201cif United Meat [was] performing a manufacturing activity for its customers, then, <em>ipso facto, </em>the customers [were] manufacturers.\u201d This beguilingly simple reasoning is not totally without persuasive force. Yet, we find it unacceptable because its premises are not consistent with the legislative scheme of excise taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Under this scheme, \u201ca person making sales at wholesale\u201d is a \u201cwholesaler\u201d <em>{see </em>HRS \u00a7 237-4), and \u201cany person engaged in the business of raising and producing agricultural products in their natural state\u201d is a \u201cproducer\u201d <em>{see </em>HRS \u00a7 237-5). Hence, Wong\u2019s Meat Market is a \u201cwholesaler,\u201d C.Q. Yee Hop is primarily a \u201cwholesaler,\u201d the members of IPP are \u201cproducers,\u201d and Kakazu is a \u201cproducer\u201d for general excise tax purposes. The gross proceeds of their sales are taxable under HRS \u00a7 237-13(2)(A), which covers \u201cevery person engaging ... in the business of selling any tangible personal property\u201d and \u201cevery person engaging ... in the business of a producer,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and not under HRS \u00a7 237-13(1), which subjects \u201cmanufacturers\u201d to taxation.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AGL\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number><em>Ronald I.

Wakayama, </em>Deputy Attorney General, for Appellee Director of Taxation.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">Were we to read \u201cmanufacturers\u201d expansively as urged to cover United Meat because it slaughters and dresses hogs and to cover its customers because they cut and cook pork, we would have to say a restaurant is a \u201cmanufacturer\u201d too. Yet no one would urge an establishment that cooks and serves food is engaged in \u201cmanufacturing.\u201d We are, therefore, convinced from a reading of HRS chapter 237 as a whole that United Meat was correctly taxed at the four per cent rate as a person engaged in a service business who performed services upon the order of \u201cproducers,\u201d \u201cwholesalers,\u201d or \u201cretailers\u201d rather than \u201cmanufacturers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b164-12\"> Although two other issues are posed by the appellant, we find neither of them worthy of discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b164-13\"><em> </em>The recitation of facts here is drawn from the Statement of the Case in appellant\u2019s opening brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b165-7\"> HRS \u00a7 237-13(6) (1985) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-8\">Tax on service business.
