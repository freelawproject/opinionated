Appellants had sued claiming Sheraton Hotel employees had served liquor to Decedent, causing him to become so drunk that he later crashed the car he was driving, thereby sustaining fatal injuries. Appellants contend the trial court erred by dismissing their complaint for failure to state a claim because 1) a common law dram shop action is available to them under <em>Ono v. Applegate, </em>62 Haw. 131, 612 P.2d 533 (1980); and 2) even if Decedent\u2019s estate cannot maintain an action, his Survivors still possess a valid wrongful death claim. For reasons stated below, we decline to extend the applicability of <em>Ono </em>to the case at bar and therefore affirm the order of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">\n<em>Background, Facts.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">The facts are not disputed. On the evening of March 24, 1985 or the early morning of March 25, 1985, Decedent was drinking alcoholic beverages at Sheraton Hotel on Hawaii. While driving his car alone later on March 25,1985, Decedent crashed on the Queen Kaahumanu Highway in North Kona. No other persons or vehicles were involved. Decedent died on May 16, 1985 from injuries received in the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">On February 18, 1986, Bertelmann was named the Decedent\u2019s estate administrator. Thereafter on March 6, 1986, Appellants filed suit alleging, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-11\">10. That on March 24-25, 1985 the Defendant TAAS ASSOCIATES sold or furnished liquor on the licensed prem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>ises of the Sheraton Royal Waikoloa Hotel to Solomon Boyd Keliikoa at a time when Defendant knew or should have known that Solomon Boyd Keliikoa was under the influence of liquor, and knowingly permitted Solomon Boyd Keliikoa while under the influence of liquor, to be or remain in or on the licensed premises, all in violation of Section 281-78(a)(2)(B) and (b)(1) of the Hawaii Revised Statutes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-5\">11. That as a result of the wrongful acts, misconduct, negligence and violation of law by the Defendant as hereinabove noted, Solomon Boyd Keliikoa sustained severe and grave injuries and grevious [sic] pain and suffering which resulted in his continued hospitalization from March 25, 1985 until May 16, 1985, when he died as a result of the inuries [sic] he sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-6\">12. That the Defendant TAAS ASSOCIATES caused or is otherwise responsible for the death of Solomon Boyd Keliikoa.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-7\">13. That as a result of the death of Solomon Boyd Keliikoa, Plaintiffs suffered great emotional distress, pecuniary injury, including medical, hospital and burial expenses, and loss of love and affection, society, companionship, comfort, consortium, protection, parental care, training, guidance and education, as persons wholly or partly dependent upon Solomon Boyd Keliikoa, and the legal representative of Solomon Boyd Keliikoa is entitled to recover the future earnings of the decedent and the provision decedent would have made for his family and dependents during the period of time he would have lived but for the misconduct and negligence of the Defendant pursuant to Sections 663-3, 663-7 and 663-8 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>15. That on March 24-25, 1985 the Defendant TAAS ASSOCIATES intentionally and/or negligently served Solomon Boyd Keliikoa intoxicating liquor until he was visibly and clearly intoxicated, and thereafter continued to serve him intoxicating liquor when Solomon Boyd Keliikoa was visibly and clearly intoxicated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-6\">18. That the Defendant TAAS ASSOCIATES acted in a grossly negligent manner, intentionally, willfully, and with reckless, conscious and deliberate disregard for the safety and welfare of Solomon Boyd Keliikoa causing and resulting in grievous pain and suffering to and the death of Solomon Boyd Keliikoa.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Record at 10-13, 87-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">On April 23, 1986, Sheraton Hotel moved to dismiss Appellants\u2019 complaint for failure to state a claim under Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 12(b)(6). Sheraton Hotel argued neither the common law nor <em>Ono </em>allowed a liquor consumer or the consumer\u2019s estate and survivors to sue the liquor seller under a dram shop theory of liability because 1) dram shop actions traditionally permitted only innocent third parties injured by drunken liquor consumers to sue the drunken liquor consumers, as well as the persons or establishments which furnished the alcoholic beverages; 2) in some jurisdictions where the courts ruled drunken consumers could sue the liquor providers, the state legislatures promptly enacted statutes abrogating the caselaw (for example, in California, Missouri, and South Dakota);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 3) public policy was against extending the rationale of <em>Ono </em>(an innocent third party can sue the drunken consumer and the liquor provider) to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>Appellants responded that 1) Sheraton Hotel was liable for breaching the statutory duty not to sell liquor to the already intoxicated Decedent under Hawaii Revised Statutes (hereinafter \u201cHRS\u201d) \u00a7\u00a7 281-78(a)(2) and 281-78(b)(l)(1985); 2) several jurisdictions have allowed liquor consumers to sue liquor providers; and 3) Sheraton Hotel\u2019s interpretation of <em>Ono </em>was too restrictive.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">The trial court conducted a hearing on May 21, 1986, and granted Sheraton Hotel\u2019s motion to dismiss. Appellants then timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">\n<em>Common Law Dram Shop Action.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">Though pleadings should be construed liberally and not technically and a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim should rarely be granted, a complaint may be dismissed if it appears beyond a doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts entitling the plaintiff to relief. <em>Au v. Au, </em>63 Haw. 210, 626 P.2d 173, <em>aff'd, </em>63 Haw. 263 (1981). The question posed here is whether this court, after balancing the policy considerations to allow recoyery against those factors limiting liability, should rule that Sheraton Hotel owed a duty to Appellants under the guidelines established in <em>Ono. See Cootey v. Sun Investment, Inc., </em>68 Haw. _, 718 P.2d 1086 (1986); <em>First Insurance Co. of Hawaii v. International Harvester Co., </em>66 Haw. 185, 659 P.2d 64 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-11\">The facts of <em>Ono </em>are as follows. On May 19, 1973 on Maui, Samantha Scritchfield drank at the Sand Trap tavern owned by defendant H. Jon Applegate, drove away, and crashed into the car in which plaintiff Masaichi Ono was riding. Ono was injured, and Scritchfield died. Ono sued Scritchfield\u2019s estate and Applegate averring that the Sand Trap had negligently served liquor to an already intoxicated Scritchfield and had negligently allowed her to leave the premises intoxicated. The jury returned a verdict finding Scritchfield 75% at fault and the Sand Trap 25% at fault. 62 Haw. at 132-33, 612 P.2d at 536. On appeal, we affirmed ruling 1) Ono was within the class of persons protected by HRS \u00a7 281-78(a)(2)(B); and 2)-the Sand Trap\u2019s statutory violation breached the standard of care so was evidence of negligence which could be used to prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>causation. 62 Haw. at 138, 612 P.2d at 539. By establishing a common law dram shop action, a commercial liquor supplier could be held accountable for the failure to refrain from providing liquor to an intoxicated person. <em>Id. </em>at 136 n.5, 612 P.2d at 538 n.5. <em>Ono </em>emphasized the need to deter violations of HRS \u00a7 281-78(a)(2)(B), prevent the reasonable foreseeable consequences of the violations (i.e. drunk driving accidents), and compensate innocent third parties. 62 Haw. at 137-38, 612 P.2d 538-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Some confusion, however, has resulted over whether <em>Ono </em>extends the availability of a common law dram shop action to an inebriated liquor consumer. That is, \u201cto ensure that liquor licensees would honor their responsibilities to the public [not to sell alcohol to already drunken customers],\u201d do liquor consumers who are injured because of their intoxication possess a common law dram shop action against the commercial liquor sellers who violate HRS \u00a7 281-78(a)(2)(B)? Note, <em>Ono v. Applegate: Common Law Dram Shop Liability, </em>3 U. Haw. L. Rev. 149, 158 (1981). We now answer no.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">We agree with the majority of jurisdictions that have passed on this issue and emphatically reject the contention that intoxicated liquor consumers can seek recovery from the bar or tavern which sold them alcohol. Drunken persons who harm themselves are solely responsible for their voluntary intoxication and cannot prevail under a common law or statutory basis. <em>Wright v. Moffit, </em>437 A.2d 554 (Del. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">In <em>Allen v. County of Westchester, </em>109 A.D.2d 475, 492 N.Y.S.2d 772 (1985), the decedent became drunk at a community college bar, fell, and sustained fatal injuries. The trial court denied the defendant county\u2019s motion to dismiss the plaintiffs common law negligence claims. The appeals court reversed reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-9\">[N]o cause of action for decedent\u2019s conscious pain and suffering exists as against the county. <em>To allow recovery in favor of one who has voluntarily procured a quantity of liquor for his or her own consumption with full knowledge of its possible or probable results \u201cwould savor too much of allowing </em>[said] <em>person to benefit by his or her own wrongful </em>act\u201d <em>(see, Buntin v. Hutton, </em>206 Ill. App. 194, 199). A contrary holding in this case would result in a policy with far-rippling effects. The creation of such a policy, in our view, is better left to the legislative process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 480, 492 N.Y.S.2d at 776 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>The <em>Allen </em>reasoning is highly persuasive. HRS \u00a7\u00a7 281-78(a)(2) (B) and 281-78(b)(l) were created to protect the general public from drunk driving accidents, not to reward intoxicated liquor consumers for the consequences of their voluntary inebriation. <em>See Wright, </em>437 A.2d at 557. Liquor consumers are not within the class of persons for whose benefit HRS \u00a7\u00a7 281-78(a)(2)(B) and 281-78(b)(1) were enacted. Sheraton Hotel\u2019s statutory violations did not create a cause of action in favor of Appellants. <em>See Sager v. McClenden, </em>296 Or. 33, 672 P.2d 697 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">We realize a bar or tavern owes a duty to avoid affirmative acts which increase the peril to an intoxicated customer. <em>Thrasher v. Leggett, </em>373 So. 2d 494 (La. 1979). But, in the absence of harm to an innocent third party, merely serving liquor to an already intoxicated customer and allowing said customer to leave the premises, of itself, does not constitute actionable negligence. <em>Miller v. City of Portland, </em>288 Or. 271, 604 P.2d 1261 (1980).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">We also recognize that a significant minority of jurisdictions have imposed a common law duty or have interpreted their dram shop statutes to allow a suit by an injured liquor consumer against the parties who furnished the liquor. <em>See Ramsey v. Anctil, </em>106 N.H. 375, 211 A.2d 900 (1965); <em>Majors v. Brodhead Hotel, </em>416 Pa. 265, 205 A.2d 873 (1965). These jurisdictions have ruled that a tavern keeper owes a duty not to serve an already intoxicated patron more liquor where unreasonable risk caused by drunken conduct is readily foreseeable, <em>Soronen v. Olde Milford Inn, </em>84 N.J. Super. 372, 202 A.2d 208 (1964), so the causal connection between the defendants\u2019 unlawful failure to stop providing alcohol to an inebriated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>consumer and the consumer\u2019s later harm is a jury question. <em>Rappaport v. Nichols, </em>31 N.J. 188, 156 A.2d 1 (1959). The defendant can then raise the affirmative defenses of contributory negligence or assumption of the risk to reduce or negate fault. <em>Brannigan v. Raybuck, </em>136 Ariz. 513, 667 P.2d 213 (1983); <em>Bissett v. DMI, Inc., </em>_Mont___ 717 P.2d 545 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Based on a thorough review of the relevant caselaw, though, we adhere to the majority view and restrict the applicability of <em>Ono.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">\n<em>The Survivors\u2019 Cause of Action.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">Appellants assert that, even if Bertelmann, as administrator of Decedent\u2019s estate, cannot maintain an action, Decedent\u2019s Survivors can recover under an independent cause of action for wrongful death pursuant to HRS \u00a7 663-3 (1985).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This point, however, was not raised below in the pleadings, memorandum in opposition to the motion to dismiss, or in the hearing on the motion to dismiss. Appellants are thus improperly arguing a new issue on appeal for the first time.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>A judgment will not ordinarily be reversed based on a theory an appellant failed to raise at the trial level unless justice so requires. <em>Earl M. Jorgensen Co. v. Mark Construction, Inc., </em>56 Haw. 466, 540 P.2d 978 (1975). Because the existence of the Survivors\u2019 cause of action is of public importance and does not require additional facts, though, we will consider this issue. <em>See Fujioka v. Kam, </em>55 Haw. 7, 514 P.2d 568 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Appellants\u2019 proposition that Decedent\u2019s Survivors, as plaintiffs in a wrongful death action under HRS \u00a7 663-3, may recover even though Decedent\u2019s estate cannot, is clearly misplaced. The majority rule is that a plaintiff in a wrongful death action can only recover if the tortious harm the decedent suffered would have entitled the decedent to maintain an action against the defendant. <em>Anderson v. Gailey, </em>97 Idaho 813, 555 P.2d 144 (1976). That is, if the decedent\u2019s recovery was barred, so are his or her survivors\u2019 wrongful death action. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">In <em>Nolan v. Morelli, </em>154 Conn. 432, 226 A.2d 383 (1967), the decedent died after consuming too much liquor, and the plaintiff brought suit against the defendant liquor sellers. Because the decedent had no cause of action against the defendants, the Connecticut Supreme Court ruled the plaintiff, standing in the decedent\u2019s shoes, also lacked one. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">The Survivors\u2019 loss of love and affection claims under HRS \u00a7 663-3 are derivative. <em>See Hun v. Center Properties, </em>63 Haw. 273, 626 P.2d 182 (1981). As such, since Decedent had no cause of action against Sheraton Hotel, the Survivors cannot pursue their wrongful death action. <em>See Towse v. State, </em>64 Haw. 624, 647 P.2d 696 (1982), and <em>Doi v. Hawaiian Insurance &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>6 Haw. App.-, 727 P.2d 884 (1986) (if a party cannot maintain a personal injury claim, then the spouse\u2019s derivative consortium action must also fail). Accordingly, no wrongful death action accrued.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys id=\"A0T\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number><em>Ira Leitel, </em>for Plaintiffs-Appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b142-7\"><em>Kenneth A.

Sager, </em>5 Cal. 3d 153, 486 P.2d 151, 95 Cal. Rptr. 623 (1971), held an injured third party could pursue a dram shop action against the party who sold the drunken tortfeasor alcohol. Later, <em>Ewing v. Cloverleaf Bowl, </em>20 Cal. 3d 389, 572 P.2d 1155, 143 Cal. Rptr. 13 (1978), established a bar patron\u2019s right to sue the bar for alcohol poisoning caused by the patron\u2019s excessive liquor consumption. That same year, the California legislature abrogated <em>Vesely </em>and <em>Ewing. </em>Similarly, the courts in <em>Selchert v. Lien, </em>371 N.W.2d 791 (S.D. 1985), and <em>Sampson v. W.F. Enterprises, </em>611 S.W.2d 333 (Mo. App. 1980), allowed liquor consumers (or their estates and survivors) to sue the liquor providers. The state legislatures of South Dakota and Missouri then abrogated the cases in 1985.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b139-7\"> <em>Miller </em>involved the illegal sale of liquor to a minor. We do not decide in this appeal whether the sale of liquor to a minor (in violation of HRS \u00a7 281-78(a)(2)(A)) who subsequendy becomes drunk and sustains injury precludes the minor (or the estate and survivors) from suing the commercial liquor supplier. At least one jurisdiction has ruled that public policy, to prevent alcohol abuse by immature and inexperienced minors, requires those who illegally furnish liquor to minors be held legally accountable. <em>See Trujillo v. Trujillo, </em>104 N.M. 379, 721 P.2d 1310 (N.M. Ct. App.), <em>cert. denied, </em>104 N.M. 289, 720 P.2d 708 (N.M. 1986). However, the majority of cases, like <em>Miller, </em>makes no distinction between minors and adults and rules that, under common law and/or statute, neither minors nor adults who hurt themselves after becoming intoxicated possess a cause of action against whoever provided them with liquor. <em>See Sutter v. Hutchings, </em>254 Ga. 194, 327 S.E.2d <em>716, on remand, Sutter v. Turner, </em>174 Ga. App. 743, 332 S.E.2d 175 <em>(1985); Ruth v. Benvenutti, </em>114 Ill.
