Hilo Coast Processing, </em>65 Haw. 447, 654 P.2d 343 (1982), requires application of the modified comparative negligence statute, Hawaii Revised Statutes (\u201cHRS\u201d) \u00a7 663-31 (1985), to strict products liability claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-12\">We granted certiorari to review the Intermediate Court of Appeals\u2019 decision. <em>Armstrong v. Cione, </em>No. 10805 (Jan. 6, 1987). We affirm the Intermediate Court of Appeals as to the first alleged error, but vacate as to the second. Nonetheless, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s dismissal of Petitioner\u2019s strict product liability claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-14\">Petitioner was injured when his hand went through the plate glass door of a shower in the one bedroom apartment he was renting from the Respondent. The apartment was part of a larger cooperative called the Waikiki Regent that was constructed in 1959. While the other nine apartments in the building were two bedroom units, Respondent\u2019s apartment had been converted to two one-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>bedroom units. Respondent purchased the two units in 1981, and used one unit, 103-A, for office space and the other, 103-B, for storage.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Respondent eventually cleaned out unit 103-B and rented it to Tom Cesar. Cesar rented the unit until 1982 when his friend, Petitioner, took over the rental of the apartment. Petitioner was already familiar with the premises when he assumed the rental, as he had been a guest of Cesar\u2019s on several occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Petitioner was injured on April 12, 1982 while attempting to close the shower door. The door was constructed of three panes of glass, two of which fold into the shower in a V-shaped pattern, pulling the third pane out of the way to permit entry and exit. The shower was built at the time of original construction of the apartment and the panes of glass were of ordinary glass instead of safety glass. Petitioner\u2019s hand slipped off the hinged portion of the door while attempting to push the door closed. The impact shattered the glass and cut his right arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">It is unclear from the testimony at trial whether the parties inspected the apartment at the time Respondent took over the rental. However, Petitioner testified that prior to the accident, the pane of glass in question was visibly cracked. Petitioner also testified the shower door was always difficult to close, although neither tenant reported this to Respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">On April 12, 1985, Respondent moved for a directed verdict on all four of Petitioner\u2019s theories of liability: negligence, implied warranty of habitability, strict liability in tort, and products liability. <em>Armstrong, </em>slip op. at 3.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court eventually granted Respondent\u2019s motion except as to the negligence and implied warranty of habitability claims. The lower court in granting the motion with respect to the products liability claim stated, \u201cthe Court has re-examined the <em>Bidar vs. Amfac, Inc., </em>[case] and concludes as a matter of law that strict product liability and strict liability do not apply to the facts and circumstances of the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>The jury returned its verdict on the negligence and warranty of habitability claim. They found Respondent negligent but no breach of the warranty of habitability. Asked to \u201capportion the fault for Plaintiffs injuries between [the parties,]\u201d the jury assigned 67% to Petitioner and 33% to Respondent. Judgment was entered in favor of Respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">On appeal to the intermediate court, Petitioner misconstrued the circuit court, arguing it erred by ruling Respondent was exempt from application of strict products liability as an \u201coccasional seller.\u201d Respondent argued, inter alia, that strict products liability does not apply to a landlord for defects in the leased premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">The Intermediate Court of Appeals held that even if the circuit court did err, it was harmless error. The intermediate court reached this result by holding <em>Kaneko v. Hilo Coast Processing, </em>65 Haw. at 459-64, 654 P.2d at 351-54, requires application of the modified comparative negligence principles contained in HRS \u00a7 663-31 (1985).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>The <em>Kaneko </em>court does not cite HRS \u00a7 663-31; however, it is the only basis for application of the doctrine of comparative negligence in this jurisdiction and the court must have had it in mind. Therefore, effective merger of the two doctrines requires that all the provisions of HRS \u00a7 663-31 be applied to strict products liability cases, and the injured plaintiff cannot recover in such cases if the proportion of negligence attributed to him exceeds the proportion of negligence attributed to the defendant. Consequently, the jury\u2019s finding that Plaintiff was 67% negligent in causing his injuries defeats any recovery by him for strict products liability and any error by the trial court in directing a verdict on that claim was immaterial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-6\"><em>Armstrong, </em>slip op. at 6-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">After a careful review of our decision in <em>Kaneko, supra, </em>we hold that the Intermediate Court of Appeals misread and misapplied <em>Kaneko. </em>We hold that <em>Kaneko </em>applies to the instant case. Our omission of citation to HRS \u00a7 663-31 in <em>Kaneko </em>was purposive. Since the legislature has not occupied the field of law, we are free to fashion a rule of comparative negligence to suit our original purposes in adopting strict products liability. <em>See Yoshizaki v. Hilo Hospital, </em>50 Haw. 150, 155 &amp; n.7, 433 P.2d 220, 224 &amp; n.7 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">The plain meaning of the words of the statute itself indicates the legislature has not intended to reach this area of law. <em>See </em>note 2, <em>supra; Wong v. Hawaiian Scenic Tours, Ltd., </em>64 Haw. 401, 405, 642 P.2d 930, 933 (1982). Nonetheless, Respondent argues HRS \u00a7 663-31 applies given the continued viability of our modified comparative negligence statute in the face of this court\u2019s adoption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>of comparative negligence principles to strict products liability, and the failure of the legislature to modify the statute to specifically except products liability from its application. Respondent does not cite, and our research has not revealed, any indication the legislature intended to enter this area of the tort law. <em>See </em>Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 21-76, in 1976 Senate Journal, at 848 (\u201cthe degree of <em>negligence </em>of the injured person ... should be compared against the aggregate <em>negligence </em>of the defendants[.]\u201d) (emphasis added); Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 26, in 1976 House Journal, at 1132 (same); Sen. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 489, in 1975 Senate Journal, at 1020 (purpose of amendment to provide recovery where <em>negligence </em>of plaintiff equal to that of defendant); Hse. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 722, in 1975 House Journal, at 1309 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Indeed, the legislative history indicates a desire to prevent application of the doctrine of contributory negligence to defeat plaintiffs\u2019 common law negligence claim. <em>Wong v. Hawaiian Scenic Tours, </em>64 Haw. at 405, 642 P.2d at 933; Hse. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 397, in 1969 House Journal, at 778 (contributory negligence \u201cseems to be unfair and in opposition to the average person\u2019s concept of justice\u201d); Sen. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 849, in 1969 Senate Journal, at 1194. We therefore reject the reasoning of those jurisdictions that have construed the term \u201cnegligence\u201d in their respective statutory scheme to apply to strict products liability.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Such a construction is not only unjustified in light of the legislative history of HRS \u00a7 663-31, but runs counter to the principles that led to our adoption of strict products liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">In <em>Stewart v. Budget Rent-A-Car Corp., </em>52 Haw. 71, 470 P.2d 240 (1970), we adopted strict products liability in this jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>There we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-6\">[T]he public interest in human life and safety requires the maximum possible protection that the law can muster against dangerous defects in products; that by placing the goods on the market the maker and those in the chain of distribution represent to the public that the products are suitable and safe for use; and that the burden of accidental injuries caused by defective chattels should be placed upon those in the chain of distribution as a cost of doing business and as an incentive to guard against such defects. (Footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-7\"><em>Stewart, </em>52 Haw. at 74-75, 470 P.2d at 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">Our desire to protect consumers and hold manufacturers and distributors accountable for placing unsafe goods in the market is best served by insuring that application of comparative negligence principles does not inadvertently create an \u201call or nothing\u201d bar to plaintiffs\u2019 recovery. <em>See Kaneko, </em>62 Haw. at 464, 654 P.2d at 354; <em>Mulherin v. Ingersoll-Rand Co., </em>628 P.2d 1301, 1303-04 (Utah 1981); V. Schwartz, Comparative Negligence \u00a7 12.5 (2d ed. 1986). <em>See also </em>4 F. Harper, F. James &amp; O. Gray, The Law of Torts \u00a7\u00a7 22.7, at 317 n.44 (2d ed. 1986). Employing modified comparative negligence principles in the strict products liability context would create such a bar by \u201c\u00e1llowing a defendant to escape liability which the jury has allocated to him, irrespective of the responsibility allocated to the plaintiff. <em>See Murray v. Fairbanks Morse, </em>610 F.2d 149, 162 (3d Cir. 1979).\u201d <em>Duncan v. Cessna Aircraft Co., </em>665 S.W.2d 414, 429 (Tex. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">Moreover, our desire to create economic incentives for safer products is best served by preventing the creation of a complete bar to plaintiffs\u2019 recovery where the manufacturer or distributor is partially responsible for the injuries sustained. Such a bar would result in inefficient economic incentives to produce safe products. <em>See Murray, </em>610 F.2d at 161; <em>Duncan, </em>665 S.W.2d at 428. Obviously, this would significantly reduce the incentives for creating safer products that are often or easily misused or altered by consumers and for placing the cost for partially unsafe products on the consumer. <em>See Mulherin, </em>628 P.2d at 1303, V. Schwartz, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 12.7, at 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">Petitioner\u2019s strict liability claim is not defeated merely because he was found to be 67% negligent and Respondent to be 33% <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>liable. Accordingly it was error to find harmless the grant of di- . rected verdict on grounds that modified comparative negligence applies to actions sounding in strict products liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Although Petitioner\u2019s claim was not defeated merely by the jury finding him more negligent than the defendant, the circuit court correctly found insufficient the strict products liability claim. The shower door was not a \u201cproduct\u201d for purposes of a strict products liability cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">We first approached the issue of defining the term \u201cproduct\u201d for purposes of strict products liability in <em>Kaneko, </em>65 Haw. at 452-58, 654 P.2d at 347-50. There we adopted a \u201ccase-by-case\u201d approach to the issue, taking into consideration the policies that led us to adopt strict products liability. <em>Id. </em>at 455,654 P.2d at 349.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Kaneko </em>concluded that because a prefabricated building is assembled from component parts without substantial change or appropriate warnings, and since the manufacturer is best able to distribute the loss resulting from harm incurred while assembling the structure, it is a \u201cproduct\u201d for purposes of strict products liability. <em>See id. </em>at 457-58, 654 P.2d at 350 (adopting in part the reasoning of <em>Lantis v. Astec Industries, Inc., </em>648 F.2d 1118 (7th Cir. 1981)).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>However, more recently, we refused to hold a \u201cportion of leased premises\u201d to be a product for purposes of strict products liability. <em>Bidar v. Amfac, Inc., </em>66 Haw. 547, 556-57, 669 P.2d 154, 161 (1983). In <em>Bidar, </em>plaintiff was injured when a towel bar in a hotel room\u2019s bathroom tore loose from the wall as she attempted to use it to pull herself up. We construed the previous ruling in <em>Kaneko </em>to be limited to \u201ca prefabricated building that must be assembled,\u201d and perceived \u201cno good reason here to lend a more expansive meaning to \u2018product\u2019 than we did in <em>Kaneko.\u201d Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Similarly, the Intermediate Court of Appeals has construed this portion of <em>Kaneko </em>to prevent application of strict products liability to a metal panel torn loose during a rainstorm striking plaintiff while working on the roof of a building. <em>Messier v. Ass\u2019n of Apartment Owners of Mt. Terrace, </em>6 Haw. App. _, 735 P.2d 939 (1987). Looking to underlying policy considerations, the court determined that \u201c[w]itholding the rule will not measurably depreciate [plaintiffs] chances of obtaining compensation for his injuries,\u201d and \u201c[h]e does not face the kind of difficulty in proving [defendants\u2019] negligence ... as is faced by plaintiffs in other cases where the doctrine of strict products liability has been applied.\u201d <em>Messier, </em>6 Haw. App. at _, 735 P.2d at 947-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">These same considerations weigh against application of strict products liability here. The problems of proof that led to our adoption of strict products liability are not present. <em>Cf. Stewart v. Budget Rent-A-Car Corp., </em>52 Haw. at 75, 470 P.2d at 243, <em>American Broadcasting v. Kenai Air of Hawaii, </em>67 Haw. 219, 227, 668 P.2d 1, 6 (1984); <em>Beerman v. Toro Manufacturing Corp., </em>1 Haw. App. 111, 115, 615 P.2d 749, 753 (1980), and traditional remedies for landlord\u2019s failure to adequately equip or maintain the premises still apply. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number><em>Livingston v. Begay, </em>98 N.M. 712, 717, 652 P.2d 734, 739 (1982). Further, unlike other sellers of consumer products, the landlord owning used property cannot adjust the costs of protecting the consumer up the chain of distribution. \u201cHe may only do it, at best, <em>down </em>the chain of \u2018distribution,\u2019 namely by charging more to his tenants.\u201d <em>Becker v. IRM Corp., </em>38 Cal. 3d 454, 486, 213 Cal. Rptr. 213, 234, 698 P.2d 116, 137 (Lucas, J., dissenting in part) (1985) (emphasis in original). The same economic incentives for creating safer products through an enduring commercial relationship between the manufacturer and its distributors are not present in the case of the residential landlord. <em>See Livingston v. Begay, </em>98 N.M. at 716, 652 P.2d at 738; <em>Dwyer v. Skyline Apartments, Inc., </em>123 N.J. Super. 48, 55, 301 A.2d 463, 467, <em>aff'g obiter dictum, </em>63 N.J. 577, 311 A.2d 1 (1973) (per curiam).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-5\">Such a landlord is not engaged in mass production whereby he places his product \u2014 the apartment \u2014 in a stream of commerce exposing it to a large number of consumers. He has not created the product with a defect which is preventable by greater care at the time of manufacture or assembly. He does not have the expertise to know and correct the condition so as to be saddled with responsibility for a defect regardless of negligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-6\">An apartment involves several rooms with many facilities constructed by many artisans with differing types of expertise, and subject to constant use and deterioration from many causes. It is a commodity wholly unlike a product which is expected to leave the manufacturer\u2019s hands in a safe condition with an implied representation upon which the consumer justifiably relies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-7\">The tenant may expect that at the time of the letting there are no hidden dangerous defects known to the landlord and of which the tenant has not been warned. But he does not expect that all will be perfect in his apartment for all the years of his occupancy with the result that his landlord will be strictly liable for all consequences of any deficiency regardless of fault. He expects only that in the event anything goes wrong with the accommodations or the equipment therein, the landlord will repair it when he knows or should know of its existence; and that if injury results liability will attach.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-8\"><em>Dwyer, </em>123 N.J.

App. 10, 17, 625 P.2d 384, 389-90 (1981), permits the tenant to sue the landlord for defective products within the home. <em>Boudreau </em>is inapposite to the present factual circumstances in that the landlord installed the new washer/dryer which exploded and injured plaintiff. The appliance was separate from the structure itself,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and installed by the landlord.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In the instant case, the shower and its door were an integral part of the structure of the apartment building and there was no evidence adduced that Respondent installed the shower during or after renovation. <em>See Livingston v.

As to the cost of the injury, it is unclear that the Respondent is in a better position to guard against such injuries where the premises are occupied by another party.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b224-11\"> <em>Cf. Fakhuory v. Magnet, </em>25 Cal. App. 3d 58, 63, 101 Cal. Rptr. 473, 476 (1972) (\u201c[w]e conclude that... the doctrine of strict liability does apply to the landlord, not as lessor of real property, but as lessor of the furniture.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b224-12\"> <em>Cf.

IRM Corp., </em>38 Cal. 3d 454, 213 Cal. Rptr. 213, 698 P.2d 116 (1985). There the court permitted plaintiffs suit against the landlord on the theory of strict liability reasoning that the same policy reasons for applying strict liability apply as in <em>Greeman v. Yuba Power Products, Inc., </em>59 Cal. 2d 57, 27 Cal. Rptr. 697, 377 P.2d 897 (1963), and other cases. We are unpersuaded by the court\u2019s arguments. <em>See Becker v.
