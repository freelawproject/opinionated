Zator\u2019s attorney and State Farm Insurance Co. (the insurer of the alleged driver) exchanged letters establishing that Zator\u2019s personal injury claims would be settled for $25,000 leaving open his claim for no-fault benefits. On September 23, 1981, Rosemary Leary was appointed by a Hawaii state court as guardian of Zator\u2019s property. The letter of guardianship expressly authorized Leary to settle the $25,000 personal injury claim. Shortly thereafter, Leary settled the $25,000 personal injury claim on Zator\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">Leary took no action to pursue the no-fault claim. However, on July 6, 1984, Zator\u2019s attorney wrote a letter to State Farm requesting payment of the no-fault benefits. On August 7, 1985, Walter Zator \u2014 Zator\u2019s father \u2014 filed suit in U.S. District Court as next friend of Alan Zator. Walter Zator sought a declaratory judgment that Zator was entitled to $15,000 in no-fault benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">State Farm filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that the suit had not been filed within the two-year statute of limitation period provided in the Hawaii no-fault chapter, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 294-36.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Walter Zator filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. He noted that HRS \u00a7 657-13, a provision in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>the Hawaii chapter on statutes of limitation, tolls the running of the limitation period if at the time a cause of action accrues the person entided to bring the action is insane.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He then argued that HRS \u00a7 657-13 applies to the no-fault limitadon period set forth in HRS \u00a7 294-36, and thus operated to toll the running of the statute of limitation on Zator\u2019s no-fault claim because of Zator\u2019s disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">The district court agreed with Walter Zator\u2019s argument that the tolling provision in HRS \u00a7 657-13 applies to the no-fault limitation period.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">Nevertheless, the court granted State Farm\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The district court held that the letter of guardianship gave Leary the power to prosecute Zator\u2019s no-fault claim, notwithstanding Walter Zator\u2019s argument that Leary only had authority to pursue the $25,000 personal injury claim. The court stated that HRS \u00a7 560:5-424(c)(24) grants the guardian of a disabled person\u2019s property the power to prosecute claims for the protection of estate assets unless otherwise limited. The court found that Leary had not been limited from pursuing Zator\u2019s no-fault claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">The court then held that the Hawaii tolling provision ceased to apply when Leary obtained the right of action over the no-fault claim. Thus, the two-year statute of limitation began to run when Leary was appointed guardian over Zator\u2019s property. The court concluded that because Zator\u2019s no-fault claim had been brought more than two years after Leary\u2019s appointment, the claim was barred by the statute of limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">The certified questions as posed to this court read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-11\">1) Does the tolling provision of HRS \u00a7 657-13 apply to toll the running of the two-year statute of limitation period prescribed by HRS \u00a7 294-36?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>2) Did the statute of limitation on Zator\u2019s no-fault claim begin to run when Leary was appointed as guardian of Zator\u2019s property?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Our answer to the first question is yes. The no-fault statute of limitations set forth in HRS \u00a7 294-36 bars the bringing of a suit for no-fault benefits more than two years from the date of the motor vehicle accident. However, the statute is silent as to whether it is tolled if the person entitled to bring the suit is rendered insane on account of the accident. The general tolling provision for statutes of limitations set forth in HRS \u00a7 657-13 provides for tolling of the statute in cases of insanity. Therefore, the two statutes obviously create an ambiguity in the law which requires this court to determine whether the tolling provision of HRS \u00a7 657-13 applies to toll HRS \u00a7 294-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">\u201cLaws in <em>pari materia, or upon the same subject matter, </em>shall be construed with reference to each other....\u201d HRS \u00a7 1-16 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">Where statutory language is unclear, we may look to the policies behind the enactment of the statutory provisions to ascertain legislative intent. <em>State v. Taylor, </em>49 Haw. 624, 425 P.2d 1014 (1967). State Farm asserts that the policy behind the no-fault chapter favors prompt compensation of claims and dictates strict compliance with its two-year limitations period. Walter Zator argues that such policy favors liberal construction of the statute to achieve the beneficial purpose of the chapter.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">State Farm\u2019s position fails because we are unable to discern a legislative policy which supports a legislative intent to allow for tolling of general statutes of limitations for those unable, for reasons of insanity, to assert their claims, but to disallow for such tolling under the no-fault statute of limitations. We cannot presume that the legislature intended a discriminatory and illogical policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">In <em>Hun v. Center Properties, </em>63 Haw. 273, 626 P.2d 182, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>63 Haw. 676 (1981), we held that the tolling provision of HRS \u00a7 657-13 applies to toll the two-year limitations period set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>forth in HRS \u00a7 663-3 under the wrongful death statute. We stated that the two-year limitations period merely affects the remedy and not the right of action. We are guided by <em>Hun </em>and see no reason to depart from its reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">We also choose to follow those cases holding that the no-fault limitations period is tolled by the State\u2019s general tolling statute. <em>See Lemmons v. Ransom, </em>670 S.W.2d 478 (Ky. 1984); <em>Jessica H. v. Allstate Insurance Co., </em>155 Cal. App. 3d 590, 202 Cal. Rptr. 239 (1984); <em>Rawlins v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Division, </em>92 Mich. App. 268, 284 N.W.2d 782 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">Our answer to the second question is yes. Having held that the no-fault statute of limitations is tolled because the claimant is mentally incompetent at the time the cause of action accrued, the question remains as to whether this statute begins to run once a guardian is appointed over the incompetent person\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">State Farm contends that as the guardian of Zator\u2019s property, Leary was empowered to prosecute all claims for the protection of his estate, including his claim for no-fault benefits; thus the statute began to run from the date of her appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">Walter Zator argues that because Leary was appointed for handling only Zator\u2019s personal injury claim, her appointment did not trigger the running of the statute of limitations on Zator\u2019s no-fault claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-11\">A guardian of the property of a disabled person has the power to prosecute claims for the protection of assets unless otherwise limited. HRS \u00a7 560:5-424(c)(24).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, such limitations must be expressly endorsed upon the guardian\u2019s letters of guardianship. HRS \u00a7 560:5-426.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Leary\u2019s letters of guardianship authorized her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>to compromise Zator\u2019s bodily injury claims and contained no express limitations impairing her ability to seek no-fault benefits for Zator. Absent such limitations, Leary\u2019s appointment gave her the right of action to bring Zator\u2019s no-fault claim. Consequently, we hold that the statute of limitations commenced running upon her appointment. Leary\u2019s failure to bring a claim for no-fault benefits within the statute of limitations period bars her recovery of these benefits on Zator\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ATx\"><em>Dennis K.
