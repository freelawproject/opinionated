Asing </em>dicta and of the cases it cites as authority are wrong.\u201d <em>Murakami v. County of Maui, </em>6 Haw. App. 516, 522, 730 P.2d 342, 346 (1986), first sentence (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">While we agree with the ICA that in the circumstances of this case, the giving of the instruction based upon <em>Sherry v. Asing, </em>56 Haw. 135, 152, 531 P.2d 648 (1975), was error, we do not agree that the statement of this court in <em>Sherry </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-12\">[i]n the absence of eyewitness testimony or physical evidence, or both, to the contrary, a person who suffers from retrograde amnesia as a result of an accident and is, therefore, unable to testify to the events of the accident is entitled to an instruction stating that he is presumed to have been exercising due care at the time of the accident and is not held to a high degree of proof as would be a plaintiff who could describe the occurrence himself[.]</blockquote>\n<attorneys id=\"Aon\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number><em>James Krueger </em>and <em>Timothy P.
