Since appeals in civil matters are allowed from \u201call final judgments, orders, or decrees ..., except as otherwise provided by law,\u201d Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 641-1, and HRS \u00a7 658-15 expressly provides \u201can appeal may be taken from an order vacating an award, or from a judgment entered upon an award,\u201d we agree with FSIC that we lack \u201cjurisdiction to hear the appeal at this time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">Mrs. Salud was injured on April 4, 1982 when an automobile in which she was a passenger veered off the highway. The accident occurred when the driver, Maria Guerrero, lost control of the motor vehicle while attempting to avoid a head-on collision with an unidentified vehicle. Subsequently, Mrs. Salud and her husband each received $25,000 from Mrs. Guerrero\u2019s liability insurance carrier, the sum paid Flores Salud representing damages for loss of consortium. Mr. and Mrs. Salud then sought additional sums from FSIC under the uninsured motorist provisions of their own automobile insurance policy. FSIC disputed their claims of damages in excess of the amounts already paid by Mrs. Guerrero\u2019s carrier, and the dispute was submitted to an arbitrator for resolution as stipulated in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">The arbitrator conducted a hearing on the claims and found \u201cthe $25,000 [Mrs. Salud] received [was] sufficient to compensate her fully for [her] injuries\u201d and \u201cthe $25,000 [Mr. Salud] received\u201d was reasonable compensation for any loss of consortium. Thus, the claimants were awarded nothing in the arbitration decision rendered on January 9, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>Invoking HRS chapter 658,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Saluds prompdy sought a circuit court review of the decision. The court denied their motion to vacate the award, and an order of denial was entered on April 23, 1987. The Saluds noted an appeal from the order on May 6, 1987. FSIC moved to dismiss the appeal on August 31, 1987, arguing \u201cthe Hawaii Appellate Courts lack jurisdiction over the instant appeal\u201d because \u201cthere has been no entry of final judgment confirming the Arbitrator\u2019s award.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">\u201cThe right of appeal is purely statutory and exists only when given by some Constitutional or statutory provision.\u201d <em>Chambers v. Leavey, </em>60 Haw. 52, 57, 587 P.2d 807, 810 (1978) (citations omitted). \u201cAppeals [are] allowed in civil matters from all final judgments, orders, or decrees of circuit... courts ... to the supreme court or to the intermediate appellate court, except as otherwise provided by law.\u201d HRS \u00a7 641-l(a). The order from which an appeal has been taken here appears to have conclusively determined the matter presented to the circuit court. Yet, a seemingly \u201cfinal\u201d order is not an appealable order if the law provides otherwise. And in our view the statutory provisions governing judicial review of arbitration awards preclude an appeal from an order of the circuit court <em>denying </em>a motion to vacate an award.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">By virtue of HRS \u00a7 658-8, any party to an arbitration \u201c[a]t any time within one year after the award is made and served, . .. may apply to [a] circuit court... for an order confirming the award.\u201d Upon such application \u201cthe court shall grant [the] order,\u201d unless it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>finds the award should be \u201cvacated, modified, or corrected\u201d for any of the reasons delineated in HRS \u00a7\u00a7 658-9 and 658-10.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> HRS \u00a7 658-8. One who seeks to vacate an award, however, must do so within ten days after the award is made and served. <em>See supra </em>note 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">When \u201can orderf] confirming, modifying, or correcting an award\u201d is granted, the relevant statute directs that \u201cthe same shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the circuit court and this shall constitute the entry of judgment.\u201d HRS \u00a7 658-12.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> And \u201c[a]n ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>peal may be taken from such judgment as . . . set forth [thereafter in chapter 658].\u201d <em>Id. </em>But nothing set forth thereafter allows an appeal from an order <em>denying </em>a motion to vacate an award; HRS \u00a7 658-15 proclaims instead in unmistakable terms that \u201can appeal may be taken from an order vacating an award, or from a judgment entered upon an award, . .. otherwise no appeal may be had.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys id=\"AfJ\"><em>Lisa K.Y. Pang (Robert P. Richards </em>with her on the motion; <em>Davis, Reid Richards, </em>of counsel) for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b469-9\"><em>Thomas Raster (Erlinda Dominguez </em>with him on opposing memorandum; <em>Erlinda Dominguez, </em>Attorney-at-Law, of counsel) for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Still, this does not mean that the <em>denial </em>of a motion to vacate an award by the circuit court necessarily forecloses an appeal sanctioned by HRS \u00a7 658-15. The unsuccessful movant\u2019s recourse would then be a motion to confirm the award. Since the circuit court has already reviewed the award and decided no grounds exist for vacating it, a confirmation should follow. The movant could then perfect an appeal and obtain appellate review of the order confirming the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The foregoing procedure would also make it possible for someone whose motion for modification or correction of an arbitrator\u2019s award has been denied to seek appellate review of the circuit court\u2019s ruling. And where confirmation of the award is sought to facilitate an appeal in either situation, the movant would not, of course, be estopped from urging the vacation, modification, or correction of the award on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">The instant appeal, having been taken from an order denying a motion to vacate an award, is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b467-8\"> HRS \u00a7658-11 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-9\">Notice of a motion to vacate, modify, or correct an award, shall be served, in the manner prescribed for service of notice of a motion in an action, upon the adverse party or the adverse party\u2019s attorney within ten days after the award is made and served.
