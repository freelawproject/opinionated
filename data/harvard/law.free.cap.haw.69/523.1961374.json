After reviewing the facts recounted in the certification and in <em>Hayes v. Rewald (In re </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number><em>Bishop, Baldwin, Rewald, Dillingham </em>&amp; <em>Wong, Inc.), </em>779 F.2d 471 (9th Cir. 1985), and the relevant provisions of Hawaii law, we conclude the Bank is not liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Bishop, Baldwin, Rewald, Dillingham &amp; Wong, Inc. (Bishop) held itself out as \u201cone of Hawaii\u2019s oldest and largest privately-held international investment and consulting firms\u201d dealing only in \u201csecured, safe, non-risk\u201d investments.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Bishop\u2019s advertising represented that funds deposited with the firm were \u201cfully accessible without charge, cost, penalties, time deposits or restrictions\u201d and that investors were guaranteed a minimum twenty percent annual return on investments. It gathered more than twenty million dollars in five years, but invested only a fraction of what was taken in. Actually, Bishop was operating a pyramid scheme where earlier investors were paid with money obtained from later investors, as its unfortunate clients discovered after five creditors filed a petition for involuntary bankruptcy on the ground that Bishop had not been paying its debts as they became due.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">While the scheme was in operation, Rewald purchased a home in Honolulu from Edwin Nova Thomas for $950,000. The agreement of sale called for the payment of $50,000 of the purchase price in cash and the remainder in monthly installments. Rewald met his obligations under the agreement with money withdrawn from Bishop\u2019s bank account. He and his secretary drew a total of thirty-five checks, for more than $350,000, and transmitted them to the Bank of Hawaii, where the sums were deposited in a real estate collection account the Bank had established. The sums received by the Bank as the holder of the collection account were credited thereafter to the seller\u2019s checking account pursuant to the agreement of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">The trustee in bankruptcy brought suit to recover the money paid out of the collection account to the seller, alleging a violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>by the Bank of HRS \u00a7 556-4.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The statute, which is patterned after section 5 of the Uniform Fiduciaries Act (UFA), provides in part that when a check is drawn by a fiduciary \u201cin any transaction known by the payee to be for the personal benefit of the fiduciary, the creditor or other payee is liable to the principal if the fiduciary in fact commits a breach of the fiduciary\u2019s obligation as fiduciary in delivering or drawing the instrument.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">The Trustee and the Bank both moved for summary judgment; the district court denied the Trustee\u2019s motion but granted the Bank\u2019s motion. Reading HRS \u00a7 556-4 in conjunction with HRS \u00a7 556-8,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Hawaii counterpart of section 9 of the UFA, the district court, sitting as the Bankruptcy Court for the District of Ha<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>waii, concluded the Bank \u201cwas merely the depository of the escrow funds,\u201d was under \u201cno duty to inquire as to possible misappropriations,\u201d \u201creceived no significant financial benefit from the transaction,\u201d and, therefore, was \u201cnot to be held to the obligations imposed by [HRS \u00a7 556-4]\u201d upon creditors and other payees. <em>Graulty v. Bank of Hawaii (In re Bishop, Baldwin, Rewald, Dillingham </em>&amp; <em>Wong, Inc.), </em>60 Bankr. 670, 675 (D. Haw. 1986). And since the Trustee did not controvert the statement in the affidavit submitted by the Bank that it had no \u00e1ctual knowledge of Rewald\u2019s breach of fiduciary duty, the court said the Bank also would not be liable under what it deemed the more lenient provisions of HRS \u00a7 556-8 governing bank deposits in the name of trustees. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">The Trustee appealed from the order granting summary judgment to the Bank. Noting the lack of precedent interpreting HRS \u00a7\u00a7 556-4 and 556-8, the federal appellate court certified a legal question for our response. We begin our analysis by reviewing the history of the pertinent statutory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">The provisions in question were enacted in 1945 as part of the Hawaii Uniform Fiduciaries Act,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which \u201ccodif[ied] the law relating to obligations of banks, transfer agents and other persons dealing with trustees, guardians and other fiduciaries, with particular reference to the degree of responsibility in case of violations by fiduciaries of their trusts.\u201d Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 249, in 1945 Senate Journal, at 687-88; Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 683, in 1945 House Journal, at 1676. As its title implies, the Hawaii law \u201cincorporate[d] the \u2018Uniform Fiduciaries [Act],\u2019 which has been adopted by many of the states.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>Prior to the advent of the Uniform Fiduciaries Act (UFA), \u201cthe common law imposed on banks dealing with fiduciaries the duty of properly applying fiduciary funds to the account of the principal.\u201d <em>Research-Planning, Inc. v. Bank of Utah, </em>690 P.2d 1130, 1132 (Utah 1984) (citation omitted). \u201cThe [A]ct has for [a] purpose the facilitation of commercial transactions in negotiable instruments.\u201d <em>Colby v. Riggs National Bank, </em>92 F.2d 183, 198 (D.C. Cir. 1937). To that end, it \u201crelax[es] the harshness of the rule requiring [of banks] the highest degree of vigilance in detecting a fiduciary\u2019s wrongdoing.\u201d <em>Research-Planning, Inc. v. Bank of Utah, </em>690 P.2d at 1133 (citing <em>Johnson v. Citizens National Bank, </em>30 Ill. App. 3d 1066, 1070, 334 N.E.2d 295, 298 (1975)).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Sections 4, 5, and 6 of the uniform act \u201cdeal with holders of negotiable paper drawn or indorsed by fiduciaries.\u201d 7A Uniform Laws Annotated 410 (1985).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Section 5, from which HRS \u00a7 556-4 is derived, covers \u201c[c]ases where an instrument is drawn or made by the fiduciary on behalf of the principal or is drawn by the fiduciary as such, and payable to a personal creditor of the fiduciary and delivered to the creditor in payment of or as security for a personal debt of the fiduciary[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 411. Thereunder, a drawee bank would be liable to the principal if it paid the check with actual knowledge that the fiduciary committed a breach of his fiduciary duty in drawing the check, or with knowledge of such facts that its action in paying the check amounted to bad faith. <em>Downey v. Duquesne City Bank, </em>146 Pa. Super. 289, 292, 22 A.2d 124, 127 (1941). And where a check payable to a personal creditor of the fiduciary \u201cis drawn and delivered in any transaction known by the payee to be for the personal benefit of the fiduciary, the creditor or other payee [would be] liable to the principal if the fiduciary in fact commit[ted] a breach of [his] obligation as fiduciary in drawing or delivering the instrument.\u201d UFA \u00a7 5, HRS \u00a7 556-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>Sections 7, 8, and 9 of the uniform act, from which HRS \u00a7\u00a7 556-6, 556-7, and 556-8 are derived, \u201cdeal with depositories of fiduciary funds.\u201d 7A Uniform Laws Annotated, at 417. The purpose of these sections is \u201cto facilitate banking transactions by relieving a depository, acting honesdy, of the duty of inquiry as to the right of its depositors, even though fiduciaries, to check out their accounts.\u201d <em>Transport Trucking Co. v. First National Bank, </em>61 N.M. 320, 325, 300 P.2d 476, 479 (1956). The drafters meant thereby \u201cto lay down a definite rule, making the bank, where it acts solely as a depository, liable only if it has actual knowledge of the fiduciary\u2019s breach of duty or if it acts in bad faith[.]\u201d 7A Uniform Laws Annotated, at 418. Where the bank is a creditor, however, the drafters intended it would be \u201cliable to the same extent as other creditors are made liable.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">The Bank of Hawaii, however, was not the drawee bank of the checks written by Rewald or his personal creditor; nor was it the actual payee of the funds the Trustee is seeking to recover. It received the checks as an escrow agent and \u201ctransferred the funds in good faith and did not know that Rewald took the funds in breach of his fiduciary duties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">The uniform act was not designed so the loss resulting from the acts of a faithless fiduciary shall fall on \u201cone who was a mere conduit to transmit the fund[s].\u201d <em>Wysowatcky v. Denver-Willys, Inc., </em>131 Colo. 266, 270, 281 P.2d 165, 167 (1955) (quoting <em>Union Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Girard Trust Co., </em>307 Pa. 488, 504, 161 A. 865, 870 (1932)). Where evidence is lacking that a bank received checks drawn by a fiduciary as his personal creditor, or that it transferred the funds received with actual knowledge of the fiduciary\u2019s breach of his obligation as fiduciary, or that the transfers were made in bad faith, HRS \u00a7\u00a7 556-4 and 556-8 do not render the bank liable to the principal. <em>Cf. Southern Agency Co. v. Hampton Bank of St. Louis, </em>452 S.W.2d 100, 106 (Mo. 1970) (Bank was not liable to principal for misappropriation by fiduciary where there was no evidence that it acted dishonestly, or with actual knowledge of a breach of fiduciary duty, or that its receipt of deposits and issuance of cashier\u2019s checks were in bad faith).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AhL\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number><em>James A.
