Upon reconsideration, a court of the Third Circuit modified this sentence. under HRS Chapter 706 and put Appellant on probation, with a condition of probation being entering and completing a drug rehabilitation program at Habilitat. On May 13, 1982, Appellant entered the program. On October 22, 1984, after approximately two years and five months in the program, Appellant voluntarily violated the terms of probation by leaving Habilitat without permission.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s probation was revoked on February 26, 1986 with the circuit court reimposing the original sentence of ten years and five years to be served concurrently. Appellant moved to have this sentence reduced by the amount of time spent in Habilitat under HRS \u00a7 706-671(2). On January 7, 1987, the circuit court issued its findings of fact and conclusions of law and denied Appellant\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">HRS \u00a7 706-671(2) reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-8\">\n<em>Credit fot time of detention prior to sentence; credit for imprisonment under earlier sentence for same crime.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-9\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-10\">(2) When a judgment of conviction or a sentence is vacated and a new sentence is thereafter imposed upon the defendant for the same crime, the period of detention and imprisonment theretofore served shall be deducted from the minimum and maximum terms of the new sentence. The officer having custody of the defendant shall furnish a certificate to the court. . . showing the period of imprisonment served under the original sentence[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-11\">As we read HRS \u00a7 706-671(2), after the vacation of a sentence and upon the reimposition of a new sentence for the same crime, a person may only be given a deduction in the length of the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>sentence for the period of time spent in \u201cdetention and imprisonment\u201d while serving the first sentence. This is what the language of the statute requires. In the instant case, Appellant was sentenced to probation and not imprisonment. Therefore, HRS \u00a7 706-671(2) is inapplicable to him.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A7H\"><em>Ame T. Henricks </em>for Defendant-Appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b447-8\"><em>Charlene Y. Iboshi, </em>Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, for PlaintiffAppellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Appellant argues that when read in conjunction with HRS \u00a7 706-671(1),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the statute as a whole requires that he be given credit for time in Habilitat because that facility comes within the definition of \u201cother institution.\u201d We disagree. We do not look to this first section of HRS \u00a7 706-671 to interpret the meaning of the second section of the statute on appeal. HRS \u00a7 706-671(2) states that \u2018[t]he officer having custody of the defendant shall furnish a certificate . .. showing the period of imprisonment served under the original sentence.. ..\u201d This clearly indicates that the time spent imprisoned during the previous sentence is the only time to be considered when reducing the length of the subsequent sentence for the same crime.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As stated above, Appellant was not originally sentenced to imprisonment, and therefore can receive no reduction of his reimposed sentence under HRS \u00a7 706-671(2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">The order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b446-12\"> Appellant was subsequently placed in another rehabilitation program as a condition of a subsequent resentencing. Appellant broke the rules of this program and was also convicted of Negligent Homicide in the Second Degree under HRS \u00a7 707-704.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b447-9\"> HRS \u00a7 706-671(1) reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-10\"><em>Credit for time of detention prior to sentence; credit for imprisonment under earlier sentence for same crime. </em>(1) When a defendant who is sentenced to imprisonment has previously been detained in any State or local correctional or other institution following his arrest for the crime for which sentence is imposed, such period of detention following his arrest shall be deducted from the minimum and maximum terms of such sentence.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b447-11\"> A careful reading of HRS \u00a7 706-671 reveals that a similar provision is also included in the first section of the statute. Therefore, Appellant\u2019s argument is further weakened because although detention is required for the post-arrest and pre-sentence period, imprisonment is clearly required under HRS \u00a7 706-671(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b447-12\"><em> </em>Although Appellant relies on several Alaska cases to support his position, these cases interpret an Alaska statute which uses the term \u201ccustody,\u201d whereas the Hawaii statute in question uses the term \u201cimprisonment.\u201d Therefore, these case are not dispositive.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
