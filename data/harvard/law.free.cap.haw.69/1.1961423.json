On appeal, Defendant-Appellant James Boulton (\u201cHusband\u201d) argues that the family court misapplied HRS \u00a7 580-56(d) in dismissing the action, and as so construed violates his right to due process.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b40-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-19\">In May of 1982, Plaintiff-Appellee Cynthia Boulton (\u201cWife\u201d), filed a divorce suit. At that time, the couple owned a house in Makawao, Maui, Hawaii (\u201cMakawao property\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>In January 1984, Wife moved for a decree of absolute divorce. The court granted the decree, but retained jurisdiction to resolve the division of property issue. Thereafter, the litigants attempted to resolve the property issue, resulting in the exchange of some of the properties held by each of them, but the issue remained unresolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">The case then lay dormant for over a year, until Husband served a request for production of documents on the Wife. Wife responded with a motion to dismiss the case from the family court based <em>inter alia </em>on HRS \u00a7 580-56(d). The lower court expressed uncertainty as to the precise meaning of the term \u201cpersonal estate\u201d in \u00a7 580-56(d), but eventually construed the statute\u2019s design as to divest the family court of jurisdiction. It dismissed the case on grounds that \u00a7 580-56(d) divested the court of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">II.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-7\">The statutory provision central to this dispute reads:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq\">Following the entry of a decree of divorce, or the entry of a decree or order finally dividing the property of the parties to a matrimonial action if the same is reserved in the decree of divorce, or the elapse of one year after entry of a decree or order reserving the final division of property of the party, <em>a divorced spouse shall not be entitled to </em>dower or curtesy in the former spouse\u2019s real estate, or any part thereof, nor to <em>any share of the former spouse\u2019s personal estate. </em>(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">HRS \u00a7 580-56(d). In construing this provision, we are mindful that our \u201cprimary duty ... in interpreting statutes is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the legislature which, in the absence of a clearly contrary expression is conclusively obtained by the language of the statute itself.\u201d <em>Stop H-3 Ass\u2019n v. State Department of Transportation, </em>68 Haw. _, _, 706 P.2d 446, 451 (1985). <em>Kaiama v. Aguilar, </em>67 Haw. 549,_, 696 P.2d 839, 842 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-11\">Husband argues that the phrase \u201cdower or curtesy\u201d applies to both the \u201cformer spouse\u2019s real estate\u201d and \u201cformer spouse\u2019s personal estate.\u201d We disagree. The parallel wording of the phrases \u201cto any dower or curtesy in the former spouse\u2019s real estate\u201d and \u201cto any share of the former spouse\u2019s personal estate\u201d indicates that each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>modifies the previous portion of the sentence requiring resolution within one year. Thus, we read the plain wording of the statute to be, \u201c[following . . . the elapse of one year after entry of a decree or order reserving the final division of property of the party, a divorced spouse shall not be entitled ... to any share of the former spouse\u2019s personal estate.\u201d This accords with the construction given to the statute by our appellate court. <em>Amii v. Amii, </em>5 Haw. App. 385,_, 695 P.2d 1194, 1198 (1985) (dictum).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Having determined the one year limitation applies to all entitlements to the former spouse\u2019s personal estate, we turn to the issue of whether the term \u201cpersonal estate\u201d encompasses the Makawao property. Husband argues that the term \u201cpersonal estate\u201d only refers to a deceased person\u2019s hereditament, rather than a living person\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">Initially, we note that personal estate is nowhere defined in HRS Chapter 580, and presents us with some ambiguity.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>legislative history to guide us in our inquiry,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we turn to our own common law. Our court has construed the term \u201cpersonal estate\u201d in the context of a divorce action to include the property of living persons. <em>Carter v. Mutual Life Insurance Co., </em>10 Haw. 562, 568-69 (1896). <em>See also Linson v. Linson, </em>1 Haw. App. 272, 278, 618 P.2d 748, 751 (1980) (construing the term \u201cestate of the parties\u201d to include anything of present or prospective value); <em>Cain v. Cain, </em>59 Haw. 32, 37, 575 P.2d 468, 473 (1978); <em>Takara v. Takara, </em>4 Haw. App. 68, 71, 660 P.2d 529, 532 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">We conclude therefore that HRS \u00a7 580-56(d) divested the family court of jurisdiction over the Makawao property.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">Husband also contends that the statute violates state and federal protections of due process. In order to prevail, he must overcome the presumptive constitutionality of the statute. <em>See Washington v. Fireman's Fund Insurance Co., </em>68 Haw__,_, 708 P.2d 129, 134 (1985), <em>cert. </em>denied,_U.S___ 106 S. Ct. 2890 (1986). Husband has not shown that the statute imposes an unreasonable procedural requirement on the adjudication of his claim. <em>See Walters v. National Association of Radiation Survivors, </em>473 U.S. 305, _, 105 S. Ct. 3180, 3192 (1985); <em>Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., </em>455 U.S. 422, 437, 102 S. Ct. 1148, 1158 (1982); <em>Ramil v. Keller, </em>68 Haw___ __ 726 P.2d 254, 260 (1986).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Aa\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number><em>William J. Eggers, III, </em>for Defendant-Appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b44-8\"><em>Edward F. Mason, </em>for Plaintiff-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"Aoi\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Dissolution of a marriage involves weighing the interests of a number of persons before absolute divorce is granted. <em>See </em>Hawaii Family Court Rules, Rule 41(e); <em>Kiakona v. Kiakona, </em>35 Haw. 849, 852-53 (1941). Once the marriage is terminated, however, there is no just reason for delay in the resolution of property issues outstanding between the parties. <em>See </em>HRS \u00a7 580-56(a); <em>DeMello v. De-Mello, </em>3 Haw. App. 165, 168, 646 P.2d 409, 411 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">The decision of the lower court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b40-20\"> Husband also argues HRS \u00a7 580-56(d) is unconstitutionally vague and violates his right to equal protection of the laws. We find these arguments to be without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b42-9\"> Moreover, this interpretation also accords with proposed, but unenacted changes in this subsection. The House and Senate Conference Committee approved changes to HRS \u00a7 580-56(b) and (c) but decided not to change subsection (d).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-10\">The measure also proposes to amend the time limit to resolve the deferred issue of property division from one year to six months, after which time the divorced spouse loses entitlement to dower, curtesy, or any share in the spouse\u2019s property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-11\">Your Committee upon further consideration has amended the bill by declining to decrease the time period to determine the reserved issue of property division from one year to six months because it finds that six months is too short a period for the Family Court to resolve property issues.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-12\">Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 10, in 1983 House Journal, at 774.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b42-13\"> However, the term is used in several other sections of Chapter 580; HRS \u00a7 580-13 (1976) permits the court to sequester a party\u2019s \u201cpersonal estate\u201d to provide for maintenance and alimony; HRS \u00a7 580-25 (1976) permits illegitimate children to inherit from the \u201cpersonal estate\u201d of both parents; and HRS \u00a7 580-56(c) (Supp. 1984) denies a new spouse right to a former spouse\u2019s \u201cpersonal estate.\u201d Thus, the term is sometimes used to denote an hereditament and other times a present property interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b43-15\"> Section 1332 of the Civil Code of 1859 was a predecessor to the current section. The 1859 statute provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-16\">A wife divorced for adultery or other offense amounting thereto, shall not be entitled to dower in her husband\u2019s real estate, or any part thereof, nor to any share of his personal estate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-17\">This language remained virtually unchanged until 1955 when the language of \u201cadultery or other offense amounting thereto\u201d was dropped. Revised Laws of Hawaii \u00a7 324-45 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-18\">The character of the statute was changed significantly in 1973 by Act 192. The legislature amended the statute to its current language. Act 192, \u00a7 1, 1973 Haw. Sess. Laws 333. Nothing in the legislative history indicates the intended meaning of the term personal estate. <em>See </em>Hse. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 618, in 1973 House Journal, at 1045.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<p id=\"b44-9\">DISSENTING OPINION OF WAKATSUKI, J.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-10\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-11\">Although the majority\u2019s construction of HRS \u00a7 580-56(d) fits with the grammatical structure of the provision, the legislative history clearly indicates that the \u201cdower or curtesy\u201d limitation in HRS \u00a7 580-56(d) applies to both the \u201cformer spouse\u2019s real estate\u201d and the \u201cformer spouse\u2019s personal estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-12\">The one-year cut-off provision was first introduced in the 1973 amendment to Rev. Laws Haw. \u00a7 324-45 (1955), the predecessor of HRS \u00a7 580-56(d). Section \u00a7 324-45 was entitled \u201cForfeiture of dower\u201d and read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-13\">A wife divorced shall not be entitled to dower in her husband\u2019s real estate, or any part thereof, nor to any share of his personal estate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-14\">In 1973, the provision was amended to its present form and the bill\u2019s standing committee reports stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-15\">The purpose of this bill is to establish rights of divorced persons to dower and curtesy in their former spouse\u2019s estates when the divorce decree does not finally divide the property of the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-16\">.. .The divisible divorce, that is where the marriage is dissolved but the other rights of the parties have not been adjudicated, is quite common. Under present law, in the event one party to that divorce were to die before the division of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>property was completed, intervening rights of a new spouse could have attached. This hiatus should be eliminated by statutory enactment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-5\">The proposed language reserves to a former spouse rights to dower and curtesy presently granted by Hawaii Revised Statutes until the entry of a Decree which finally divides the property of the parties to the former marriage. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-6\">.. . The bill clearly indicates that this right to dower or curtesy will extend only for a period of one year of the entry of a decree or order reserving the final division of property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">Sen. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 852, in 1973 Senate Journal, at 967-68; <em>see </em>Hse. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 618, in 1973 House Journal, at 1045.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">It is clear, therefore, that the 1973 amendment was directed only at preserving <em>dower and curtesy rights </em>in the former spouse prior to property division, and that the one-year period was intended as an outside time limit on those <em>dower and curtesy rights </em>only. The time limit was not intended to prevent the former spouse from gaining a share of the other spouse\u2019s property in a subsequent division of property. The fact that the title of the pre-1973 statute is \u201cForfeiture of dower\u201d lends further support to this view.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">The majority\u2019s application of the \u201cdower or curtesy\u201d phrase to only real estate and not personal estate means that under the pre1973 statute a wife could not share in any of her husband\u2019s property after a divorce decree was entered. In other words, the majority\u2019s construction would make property division after the dissolution of the marriage impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">Therefore, the one-year cut-off should apply only to dower and curtesy rights in the real and personal estate of the former spouse. Because neither dower nor curtesy is involved here, the lower court improperly dismissed the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-11\">I would reverse and remand.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
