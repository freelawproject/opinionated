The question in this appeal is whether a putative tortfeasor may evade the statutory lien established by Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 346-37 by agreeing with the injured person that their settlement agreement only covers general damages. The Circuit Court of the First Circuit ruled the State \u201cdoes not have a valid claim\u201d under the circumstances. In our view the State\u2019s subrogation right is not subject to defeasance with such ease; and we vacate the ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">The controversy at bar stems from an accident where an automobile in which Charles Peters, III was a passenger veered off a public highway and struck a roadside object. Charles was seriously injured in the mishap, and he and his parents applied for public assistance to defray his medical expenses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> DSSH found the applicants qualified for assistance and paid the accident victim\u2019s medical expenses as they accrued. Thereafter, Charles Peters, III and his parents instituted an action in the circuit court against the driver of the errant vehicle, Ruth Weatherwax, and her parents, averring Ruth\u2019s negligent operation of the vehicle caused the harm sustained by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Invoking HRS \u00a7 346-37<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and asserting a right to intercede by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>virtue of Rule 24 of the Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the State moved \u201cto intervene in [the] action as a party plaintiff. . . to establish a first lien [to the extent of the medical assistance provided Charles in] the amount of any judgment or settlement in favor of the Plaintiffs[.]\u201d The circuit court, offering no explanation for its ruling, denied the motion. The State promptly moved for reconsideration, arguing a settlement of the suit without the State\u2019s presence would \u201cresult[] in severe and substantial prejudice to the Department of Social Services and Housing and wholly impair[] the [State\u2019s] right to enforce its lien against plaintiffs\u2019 recovery.\u201d The circuit court, however, did not act on the State\u2019s motion for several months. When the court belatedly reversed itself, the State filed an Intervenor\u2019s Complaint, praying that \u201cif any judgment or settlement be entered ... for and on behalf of the Plaintiffs, that the State .. . have judgment against the Defendants for the final and total amount of medical payments furnished or to be furnished in the future to or for Plaintiff Charles Peters, III[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">But in the interim between the hearing on the motion for reconsideration and the issuance of the order granting the motion, while the State\u2019s right to intercede in the proceedings was in limbo, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>what it feared had come to pass. The parties to the suit reached a settlement and executed a Release and Indemnity Agreement whereby the defendants were released, without an admission of liability, \u201cfrom and on account of any and all claims\u201d arising out of the automobile accident, in consideration of the payment to the plaintiffs of $255,000, said sum \u201crepresent[ing] GENERAL DAMAGES only.\u201d The plaintiffs then filed a document purporting to dismiss their suit with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The State continued to press for the recovery of public funds expended on behalf of Charles Peters, III. Though the State\u2019s motion for reconsideration had been decided by the circuit court, the plaintiffs sought an administrative resolution of the State\u2019s claim, requesting a hearing before a DSSH hearings officer pursuant to HRS \u00a7 346-37(g)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to determine the State\u2019s lien rights, if any. The hearings officer concluded that since HRS \u00a7 346-37(c) \u201climits [DSSH] liens to monies received for special damages\u201d and \u201cthe settlement monies are determined to be for general damages[ only, t]here are no special damages for the DSSH lien to attach to and no recovery can be made.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although DSSH, she went on to say, \u201cdid have a statutory right to intervene in this case prior to the settlement they chose not to and must now accept the consequences.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>Relying on the purported dismissal of the suit by the plaintiffs and the ruling of the hearings officer, the defendants then moved for dismissal of the intervenor\u2019s complaint. The circuit court, however, denied the motion and ordered the defendants to respond to the complaint. After the submission of a responsive pleading, the State sought a partial summary judgment, praying for an order adjudging that it had \u201ca claim for special damages against Defendants.\u201d The court denied the motion, holding instead that the State had none. The ruling effectively disposed of the only outstanding claim in the case, and the intervenor perfected a timely appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Since the task at hand calls for an interpretation and application of a statutory provision, we begin our analysis there, mindful as ever that our \u201cprimary duty ... in interpreting statutes is to ascertain arid give effect to the intention of the legislature[.]\u201d <em>Stop H-3 Association v. Department of Transportation, </em>68 Haw._,_, 706 P.2d 446, 451 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-11\">The statute in question, HRS \u00a7 346-37, declares that \u201c[i]f the department has provided medical assistance ... to [someone] who was injured . . . under circumstances creating a tort . . . liability against [a] third person, [it] shall have a right to recover from the third person an amount not to exceed [such] assistance . . . .\u201d <em>See supra </em>note 2. The statute further states \u201c[t]he department shall as to this right be subrogated to any right or claim that a claimant. . . has against [the] third person for special damages to the extent of the amount of medical assistance .. . furnished or to be furnished by the department.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b64-12\">Reading the language of HRS \u00a7 346-37 throughout, we are led ineluctably to a conclusion that the key to our search for meaning lies in \u201csubrogated,\u201d a word employed without definition, either in the section or elsewhere in the relevant chapter of Hawaii Revised Statutes. But since it is an oft-used legal term whose antecedents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>are traceable to the common law,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we turn thereto for guidance. \u201cFor in the absence of anything to the contrary it is fair to assume that [the legislature] used [\u201csubrogated\u201d] in the statute in its common-law sense.\u201d <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>370 U.S. 650, 655 (1962). Or as put by the author of a highly regarded treatise, \u201c[t]he interpretation of well-defined words and phrases in the common law carries over to statutes dealing with the same or similar subject matter.\u201d 2A <em>Sutherland on Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 50.03, at 435 (4th ed. C. Sands ed. 1984) (footnote omitted). Moreover, \u201ccommon-law meanings are assumed to apply even in statutes dealing with new and different subject matter, to the extent that they appear fitting and in the absence of evidence to indicate contrary meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Subrogation is a venerable creature of equity jurisprudence, \u201cso administered as to secure real and essential justice without regard to form[.]\u201d H. Sheldon, <em>The Law of Subrogation </em>\u00a7 1, at 2 (1882) (footnote omitted). \u201cIt is broad enough to include every instance in which one party pays a debt for which another is primarily answerable, and which, in equity and good conscience, should have been discharged by the latter[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted). It \u201cis defined by Sheldon to be \u2018the substitution of another person in the place of a creditor, so that the person in whose favor it is exercised succeeds to the rights of the creditor in relation to the debt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kapena v. Kaleleonalani, </em>6 Haw. 579, 583 (1885). When subrogation occurs, \u201c[t]he substitute is put in all respects in the place of the party to whose rights he is subrogated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In effect, he \u201csteps into the shoes\u201d of the party. <em>See Putnam v. Commissioner, </em>352 U.S. 82, 85 (1956); A. Windt, <em>Insurance Claims and Disputes </em>\u00a7 10.05, at 409 (1982); <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1279 (5th ed. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>That the legislature contemplated the State would \u201cstep into the shoes\u201d of one on whose behalf it pays medical expenses cannot be doubted. For the statute expressly permits DSSH to \u201cintervene or join in any action or proceeding brought by [the injured party] against the third person who is liable.\u201d HRS \u00a7 346-37(c). And \u201c[i]f such action or proceeding is not commenced within six months after the first day on which medical assistance ... is furnished .. ., the department may institute and prosecute legal proceedings against the third person ... , in a state court, either alone (in its own name or in the name of the claimant) or in conjunction with the [injured party].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">Despite this unmistakable legislative intent to establish a statutory right to recovery when DSSH defrays the medical expenses of an accident victim who seeks public assistance, the circuit court decided the State had no claim for special damages. The defendants urge an affirmance of the decision on grounds that Charles Peters, III \u201cwaived his right to claim special damages\u201d and DSSH was denied \u201creimbursement for medical expenses\u201d in the administrative hearing conducted at the plaintiffs\u2019 request. But we would not be performing our duty to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the legislature if we permitted the modicum of ingenuity displayed here to set legislative purpose to naught.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">Upon application for assistance made by Charles Peters, III and his parents, DSSH paid approximately $15,000 in public funds to various health care providers. In doing so, it \u201cstepped into the shoes\u201d of the accident victim and acquired a right to assert a claim against the person responsible for the accident to recover what it paid. Though Charles Peters, III may have \u201cwaived his right to claim special damages\u201d by agreeing to dismiss his action against the defendants in exchange for the payment of $255,000 in general damages, the right to recover medical expenses was not his to waive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>\u2014 the State had been substituted by statute in place of himself and his parents as far as that right is concerned. Furthermore, \u201c[a]l-though, as between debtor and creditor, the debt may be extinguished, yet, as between the person who has paid the debt and the other parties, the debt is kept alive [by the doctrine of subrogation], so far as may be necessary to preserve the securities.\u201d H. Sheldon, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 11, at 10 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">When \u201cthe legislature enacts into statute law a common law concept, . .. that is a clue that the courts are to interpret [and apply] the statute with the freedom with which they would construe and apply a common law principle[.]\u201d Posner, <em>Statutory Interpretation \u2014 in the Classroom and in the Courtroom, </em>50 U. Chi. L. Rev. 800, 818 (1983). Under the concept borrowed from the common law here, a court \u201cmay give restitution ... and prevent the unjust enrichment of the defendant, where the plaintiffs property has been used in discharging an obligation owed by the defendant[.]\u201d <em>Restatement of Restitution </em>\u00a7 162 comment a (1937).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Unjust enrichment in this instance could only be prevented if the State is allowed to assert its claim for special damages. Otherwise, the defendants may have discharged their tort liability for less than what was just in the circumstances at the expense of the State; and it would then be unjust for them to retain the benefit of the State\u2019s assumption of the obligation to pay the accident victim\u2019s medical bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">Turning finally to the alternative ground for affirmance urged by the defendants, we note the plaintiffs invoked HRS \u00a7 346-37(g) in seeking an administrative hearing. The subsection allows an accident wictim whose medical expenses have been paid by DSSH to request a hearing if \u201cthere is a dispute between the claimant, the claimant\u2019s agent, or the claimant\u2019s attorney, and the department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>concerning the existence of a lien or the amount of the lien.\u201d <em>See supra </em>note 4. What was heard administratively at the request of the plaintiffs was the dispute between themselves and the State regarding the possible existence of a lien on the stipulated sum designated by the parties to the settlement as \u201cgeneral damages.\u201d The subrogated claim for special damages and its validity and amount are matters for the circuit court, not the hearings officer, to pass on.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ad\"><em>Steven K.

We therefore vacate the order denying the State\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b61-8\"> DSSH is charged by law to \u201c[a]dminister, establish programs and standards, and promulgate rules as deemed necessary for all public assistance, including payments for medical care[.]\u201d HRS \u00a7 346-14(1) (1985); <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 346-1 (public assistance includes \u201cpayments to or on behalf of... persons for medical care\u201d).
