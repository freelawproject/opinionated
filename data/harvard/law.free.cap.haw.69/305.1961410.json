The initial pleading filed on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>their behalf averred she \u201cunderwent surgery at Queen\u2019s Medical Center\u201d on October 20, 1983, and during the surgical procedure \u201ca piece of a tissue retractor .. . broke off and became lodged in [her] body.\u201d The pleading further alleged the procedure \u201cwas completed without the ... fragment being removed,\u201d Mrs. Tobosa therefore \u201cdid not make a satisfactory recovery from the surgery,\u201d she \u201cexperienced severe and continual intense pain\u201d as a consequence, and on December 8, 1983 \u201cshe underwent a second operation to have the retractor fragment removed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">\u201cDoe Defendants 1-50,\u201d the complaint averred, \u201care persons, corporations, partnerships, [and] hospitals [who] performed some act in a negligent or .. . tortious manner and/or designed, tested, inspected, produced, manufactured, distributed, supplied and/or sold the retractor ... or are persons or entities who cannot be named as Defendants at this time because the Medical Claim Conciliation process has not yet been completed.\u201d Patricia Tobosa, the complaint stated, \u201chas been unable to identify [the Doe Defendants] to date\u201d despite \u201cdiligent efforts to determine [their] true names and identities\u201d and \u201chas sued said Defendants with fictitious names pursuant to Rule 17(d) of the Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure.\u201d Leave to amend the complaint to reflect the true names, identities, capacities, acts, and omissions of the defendants upon confirmation thereof was also requested. \u201cThe Doe Defendants who participated in the [surgery performed on Mrs. Tobosa] on.. . October 20, 1983,\u201d the complaint further alleged, \u201cwere negligent\u201d and the retractor they used \u201ccontained design and/or manufacturing defects\u201d and also \u201cdid not contain adequate warnings of dangers and/or defects associated with its use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">The defendants were charged with liability for damages based on negligence, strict liability, breaches of express and implied warranties, and unfair and/or deceptive practices in violation of HRS \u00a7 480-2. Loss of consortium on account of the injuries sustained by Patricia Tobosa was claimed on behalf of Edward Tobosa. The pleading prayed that Patricia Tobosa be awarded \u201c[g]eneral damages in an amount . . . not less than $750,000.00,\u201d \u201c[s]pecial damages in an amount to be proved at trial,\u201d and \u201c[t]reble damages pursuant to [HRS] \u00a7 480-13.\u201d And \u201c[g]eneral damages in an amount ... not less than $100,000.00,\u201d \u201c[s]pecial damages,\u201d and \u201c[t]reble damages\u201d were sought on behalf of Edward Tobosa.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">On September 6, 1985, notwithstanding averments in the complaint filed two days earlier that the defendants were being sued under fictitious names because their true names and identities could not be determined, the plaintiffs submitted the medical tort claim to a medical claim conciliation panel, naming The Queen\u2019s Medical Center, Dr. Thomas C. Owens, Dr. John Bellatti, and Dr. Clifford Hornback as the health care providers responsible for Mrs. Tobosa\u2019s injuries. On March 12, 1986, the panel to which the claim was referred for hearing found actionable negligence in the care and treatment Queen\u2019s afforded Mrs. Tobosa.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But its advisory decision was rejected by Queen\u2019s Medical Center.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">On April 28, 1986 the plaintiffs moved to identify Dr. Owens as John Doe 1, Dr. Bellatti as John Doe 2, Dr. Hornback as John Doe 3, and The Queen\u2019s Medical Center as John Doe 4. The ex parte motion was granted, the foregoing persons and entity were made party defendants, and the circuit court further ordered that they \u201cbe served with a copy of the Complaint and Summons as is by law provided.\u201d But on the following day, since no one had been served within six months of the commencement of the action, a Notice of Proposed Dismissal for want of a diligent effort to promptly effect service of the complaint as demanded by the rules of the circuit courts, was served on plaintiffs\u2019 attorney.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Upon objection made by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>counsel, however, the court withdrew the proposal on condition that service be effected within ninety days. Queen\u2019s was served with a copy of the complaint on August 6, 1986, and Dr. Owens was served on August 19, 1986. Neither Dr. Bellatli nor Dr. Hornback was served within the period allowed by the court, and the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed them from the case on September 2, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Queen\u2019s then moved for dismissal of the claims against it or, alternatively, for reconsideration of the order granting the plaintiffs\u2019 ex parte motion for identification of John Doe Defendants 1 through 4. Dismissal was urged on the ground that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims because suit was filed before they were submitted to a conciliation panel and the panel\u2019s decision was rejected by Queen\u2019s and also on the ground that the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint prayed for a specific amount in damages. Queen\u2019s sought reconsideration of the order granting the motion to identify John Doe Defendants 1 through 4 on the ground that HRCP 17(d) had been misused \u201cto avoid a jurisdictional bar to filing a lawsuit against known parties.\u201d Dr. Owens followed with his motion seeking similar relief on similar grounds. The motions were heard separately, but both were granted. The plaintiffs appeal from the orders of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">The plaintiffs argue the orders dismissing their claims must be vacated because there was substantial compliance with the requirements of HRS \u00a7 671-12, there was no violation of HRCP 17(d), and the assertion of claims premised on strict tort liability, breach of warranty, and unfair or deceptive trade practices against the unknown manufacturer justified the specification of what was being sought in damages. We begin our consideration of the issues by examining the statutes the plaintiffs purportedly evaded and the procedural rule they allegedly abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">The perception of a \u201ccrisis in the area of medical malpractice\u201d caused the enactment of the statutory provisions now codified in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>HRS chapter 671. Session Laws of Hawaii (SLH) 1976, c 219, \u00a7 1. Among other objectives, the legislature sought thereby to \u201c[stabilize the medical malpractice insurance situation by reintroducing some principles of predictability and spreading of risk\u201d and \u201c[d]ecrease the costs of the legal system and improve the efficiency of its procedures to the end that awards are more rationally connected to actual damages.\u201d <em>Id. A </em>significant aspect of the legislative effort to make the system less costly and more efficient was the creation of \u201cmedical claim conciliation panels [to] review and render findings and advisory opinions on the issues of liability and damages in medical tort claims against health care providers.\u201d HRS \u00a7 671-11(a). The panels undoubtedly were established \u201cto encourage early setdement of claims and to weed out unmeritorious claims.\u201d Hse. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 417, in 1976 House Journal, at 1460. Thus, \u201cany person or the person\u2019s representative claiming that a medical tort has been committed [must now] submit the claim to [a] medical claim conciliation panel before a suit based on the claim may be commenced in any court of this State.\u201d HRS \u00a7 671-12. And \u201c[t]he claimant may institute litigation based upon the claim in an appropriate court only after a party to a ... panel hearing rejects the decision of the panel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 671-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The claimant\u2019s right to seek redress for a medical tort through litigation has been conditioned also upon the omission of a traditional \u201cad damnum\u201d clause from his complaint. By reason of HRS \u00a7 671-4, the complaint cannot \u201cspecify the amount of damages prayed for but shall contain a prayer for general relief, including a statement that the amount of damages is within the minimum jurisdictional limits of the court in which the action is brought.\u201d <em>See supra </em>note 4. These provisions, the legislature felt, would \u201cprovide protection against serious embarrassment and possible damage to the reputation of the health care provider merely upon the filing of a claim.\u201d Hse. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 571, in 1976 House Journal, at 1539.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">The procedural rule in question, HRCP 17(d), renders it possible for actions to be commenced against defendants whose identities have yet to be ascertained. A primary purpose of the rule is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>\u201ctoll the statute of limitations with respect to Doe defendants who cannot be identified prior to the running of the statute.\u201d <em>Wakuya v. Oahu Plumbing &amp; Sheet Metal, Ltd., </em>65 Haw. 592, 596, 656 P.2d 84, 88 (1982). One described as a presently unidentifiable defendant in accord with the requirements of HRCP 17(d)(1) is thereafter deemed \u201ca party defendant to the action, as having notice of the institution of the action against him, and as sufficiently described for all purposes, including service of process, and the action shall proceed against him.\u201d HRCP 17(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">A plaintiff who would make an unidentified person a party defendant is required in accord with the criteria of HRCP 11 to \u201cset forth in a pleading the person\u2019s interest in the action, so much of his name as is known ..., and shall set forth with specificity all actions already undertaken in a diligent and good-faith effort to ascertain the person\u2019s full name and identity.\u201d <em>See supra </em>note 5. The relevant criteria of HRCP 11 are that \u201c[t]he signature of an attorney [affixed to a pleading] constitutes a certificate by him that he has read the pleading; that to the best of his knowledge, information, and belief there is good ground to support it; and that it is not interposed for delay.\u201d Inasmuch as the unidentified person is thereby made a party defendant without actual notice of the action, the demands of due process compel strict observance of the requisites of HRCP 17(d) and the criteria of HRCP 11 with regard to pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">The plaintiffs assert there was substantial compliance with HRS \u00a7 671-12. The requirements of section 671-12, they say, were satisfied \u201cby filing a Doe allegation complaint and not naming the health care providers until after the [panel] decision was rejected.\u201d This, in their view, was consistent with the statute\u2019s \u201cpurpose of screening frivolous claims against health care providers and encouraging settlement.\u201d They maintain the complaint \u201cwas filed only to preserve the statute of limitations against the manufacturer and avoid duplicative litigation.\u201d Otherwise, they claim, the statute of limitations may have run in favor of the unknown manufacturer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>or they would have had to file two lawsuits. Yet, it was not the bringing of multiple lawsuits against different defendants on different claims arising out of the same transaction that was interdicted by HRS \u00a7\u00a7 671-12 and 671-16 \u2014 it is the commencement of a lawsuit against health care providers before a panel decision and a party\u2019s rejection of the advisory finding that is enjoined.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">True, our rules of civil procedure are meant \u201cto promote judicial efficiency and economy,\u201d <em>Espaniola v. Cawdrey Mars Joint Venture, </em>68 Haw._,_, 707 P.2d 365, 371 (1985); and the rules encourage a plaintiff to join in one action as defendants all persons who may be jointly or severally liable for damages arising out of the same transaction, occurrence or series of transactions or occurrences. <em>See </em>HRCP 20. Still, the legislature has declared the submission of the claim to a conciliation panel and the rejection of the panel\u2019s decision by a party to the panel hearing are prerequisites to a suit for damages premised on alleged malpractice, <em>see </em>HRS \u00a7\u00a7671-12 and 671-16, and plaintiffs filed suit before submitting their claims to a conciliation panel. We certainly could not say there was compliance with the letter of the law; whether there was substantial compliance with the spirit of the law is problematic. Nevertheless, we are reluctant to affirm the dismissal of the action on the ground that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction over the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">We are mindful, of course, that the several circuit courts \u201chave jurisdiction, except as otherwise expressly provided by statute,\u201d of civil actions and proceedings, HRS \u00a7 603-21.5, and the legislature has expressly provided by statute that a medical malpractice claim must be processed by a conciliation panel before suit is filed. Yet it can be said with some justification that the legislative purpose in enacting the statute was served despite the premature filing. The required hearing was held, the claim against Queen\u2019s was deemed meritorious by the advisory body, and the health care providers had an opportunity to avoid litigation, all before they were named as defendants in the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">Our reluctance to affirm the circuit court here, however, carries no suggestion that litigants will be able in the future to sidestep with impunity the requirements of HRS \u00a7\u00a7 671-12 and 671-16. The procedures outlined there are jurisdictional prerequisites to suit, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>and they will be enforced. Here, there was substantial compliance with the statute. We hesitate to apply the statute strictly and deprive the plaintiffs of an opportunity to have their claims heard in court since there was no prior intimation that the provisions would be so applied. We have no doubt about the reasonableness of the temporary barrier to suit erected by the legislature. \u201c[E]very civil litigant [is not entitled] to a hearing on the merits in every case. The State may erect reasonable procedural requirements for triggering the right to an adjudication .. ..\u201d <em>Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., </em>455 U.S. 422, 437 (1982). Still, we are not in the habit of lightly regarding an injured person\u2019s right to redress in a court of law. Where, as here, the defendants do not appear to have been unduly prejudiced by a hasty and ill-advised anonymous (as far as the defendants were concerned) pleading and a statute conditioning a common-law right is being expounded for the first time, the termination of ostensibly actionable claims without forewarning hardly seems consistent with our common-law traditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">With respect to their breach of HRS \u00a7 671-4, the plaintiffs rationalize the inclusion of more than a simple prayer for general relief in their original pleading on grounds that it \u201calleged not only medical malpractice, but also product liability, breach of warranty and unfair and/or deceptive trade practices.\u201d But the unequivocal legislative command is: \u201cNo complaint... in an action for medical tort shall specify the amount of damages prayed for but shall contain a prayer for general relief....\u201d HRS \u00a7 671-4. And we reiterate, the legislature did not prohibit the bringing of multiple suits against multiple defendants on different claims arising from the same transaction; it proscribed the specification of damages in a complaint charging medical malpractice.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">However, we do not view the prohibition in section 671-4 in the same light as the directives of sections 671-12 and 671-16. The latter are jurisdictional hurdles \u2014 the former is something less. We could not affirm a dismissal premised on a violation of section 671-4. But a court has other means at its disposal to deal with the problem of the errant or recalcitrant pleader. <em>See </em>HRS \u00a7 603-21.9(6).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A-H\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Turning, finally, to the alleged abuse of the rule of civil procedure, we note plaintiffs concede knowledge of \u201cthe identity of Defendants-Appellees Queen\u2019s, Owens and the other health care providers\u201d prior to the commencement of their action. But they claim a lack of knowledge of \u201cthe facts giving them a cause of action against each health care provider.\u201d And they maintain they \u201cwere not in a position to name either the manufacturer or the health care provider Defendants\u201d until the panel hearing was concluded. They argue there was no abuse of HRCP 17(d) because the rule may be used when a litigant \u201cknows the defendant\u2019s identity, but does not know the facts giving him a cause of action against the person (or is unaware that the law gives him a cause of action against the person).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">A reading of the complaint leaves us with an impression that, while the plaintiffs may not have known the identity of the manufacturer, they had more than sufficient knowledge of the facts giving rise to a cause of action against Queen\u2019s and Dr. Owens, at least. Moreover, we are struck by the anomaly of the argument, since a purpose of the mandated informal hearing is to furnish a prospective plaintiff with sufficient knowledge to assess the claim, to settle it if this be wise, and to file suit only if necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">Unlike most of the Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 17(d) is not patterned after a federal rule; it was drafted by our Committee on Civil Rules, and what little has been said in writing about it is inapplicable here. Yet if anything is clear about its application, it is the need for scrupulous observance of its procedures and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>criteria for pleadings established by HRCP ll.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In this case, we cannot say there was, particularly where Rule 11 is concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Under Rule 11, \u201c[t]he signature of an attorney constitutes a certificate by him that he has read the pleading [and] that to the best of his knowledge, information, and belief there is good ground to support it....\u201d <em>See supra </em>note 10. This places \u201ca moral obligation upon the attorney to satisfy himself that there are good grounds for the action or defense.\u201d 5 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 1333, at 499 (1969) (footnote omitted). \u201cIf a pleading is ... signed with intent to defeat the purpose of [the] rule, it may be stricken as sham and false .. ..\u201d <em>See supra </em>note 10. \u201cFor a wilful violation ... an attorney may be subjected to appropriate disciplinary action.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Though the attorney\u2019s obligation thereunder may be a moral one, a pleader who has knowledge of the identities of defendants yet files a John Doe complaint undoubtedly commits a wilful violation of the rule.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The circuit court, of course, may strike the false pleading, but this would serve no constructive purpose in the circumstances. A better course of action, in our opinion, would be to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>hold counsel personally liable for the excess in costs and fees engendered by the violation.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AA2\"><em>Prescilla Mills (David C.

Every pleading of a party represented by an attorney shall be signed by at least one attorney of record in his individual name, whose address shall be stated. A party who is not represented by an attorney shall sign his pleading and state his address. Except when ex parte relief is sought upon a pleading or when otherwise specifically provided by rule, pleadings need not be verified or accompanied by affidavit. The rule in equity that the averments of an answer under oath must be overcome by the testimony of two witnesses or of one witness sustained by corroborating circumstances is abolished. The signature of an attorney constitutes a certificate by him that he has read the pleading; that to the best of his knowledge, information, and belief there is good ground to support it; and that it is not interposed for delay. If a pleading is not signed or is signed with intent to defeat the purpose of this rule, it may be stricken as sham and false and the action may proceed as though the pleading had not been served. For a wilful violation of this rule an attorney may be subjected to appropriate disciplinary action. Similar action may be taken if scandalous or indecent matter is inserted.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b355-9\"> Wright and Miller\u2019s discussion of possible disciplinary action for violations of former Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, from which HRCP 11 was derived, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-10\">Rule 11 does not specify what types of disciplinary action may be taken for an attorney\u2019s willful violation of the rule. Several possible sanctions seem appropriate. The Advisory Committee\u2019s Note to Rule 11 states that Section 1927 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>Judicial Code, which permits the court to hold a counsel personally liable when he has multiplied the proceedings so as to increase costs unreasonably and vexatiously, is unaffected by the rule. Presumably, the court could assess any excess costs caused by a failure to sign or by a disregard of the good faith obligation imposed on the signer against the defaulting attorney. Conceivably, the lawyer might be cited for contempt, or, in an extreme situation, disbarment proceedings may be instituted. However, there is litde evidence of frequent use of sanctions for the violation of Rule 11.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">C. Wright &amp; A.
