Appellants-Appellants Roland Mahiai, et al. (collectively \u201cRanchers\u201d) contend: 1) the Board lacked authority to implement the program; 2) the hearing officer improperly imposed the burden of proof upon Ranchers; and 3) the Board\u2019s action violated Ranchers\u2019 equal pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>tection rights. Appellees-Appellees Jack K. Suwa, Chairman of the Board of Agriculture, and Calvin W. S. Lum, State Veterinarian and Director of the Division of Animal Industry, assert that all of the issues raised on appeal are moot because the cattle have been destroyed. We find merit in none of these contentions and affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">The record reveals the following uncontested facts concerning the nature of bovine tuberculosis and the bacterium which causes it. Bovine tuberculosis is caused by <em>mycobacterium bovis (\u201cm. bovis\u201d), </em>a minute organism capable of floating in the air for indefinite periods. <em>M. bovis </em>can remain dormant and undetected for years in the tissues of an exposed animal, and later become active in the animal or its offspring. The bacterium is capable of surviving up to eight months in the outside environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">Exposure to bovine tuberculosis occurs in a number of ways: by ingestion of <em>m. bovis, </em>by contamination of open wounds or breaks in the skin, or by placental transmission, or by inhalation (\u201caerosol transmission\u201d). Thus, the disease can be transmitted without direct physical contact between animals.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">Cattle are the primary host of <em>m. bovis. </em>The disease has existed in cattle on all of the major Hawaiian islands since at least 1933. At the time of the proceedings below, the entire island of Molokai had been quarantined since 1975, and cattle were exported by permit only.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The rate of positive reactors to the tuberculin test in Molokai cattle was 6.6% in 1985, compared to the national rate of .02% for the same year.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-12\">On September 6, 1985, the Hawaii Department of Agriculture (\u201cDepartment\u201d) informed all cattle ranchers on Molokai that it had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>obtained funds from the United States Department of Agriculture (\u201cUSDA\u201d) for the slaughter of all cattle on the island in an effort to eradicate bovine tuberculosis. The Department expressed its intention to \u201cbegin immediately to identify and appraise all cattle on Molokai\u201d and \u201cto accomplish the depopulation within the next six months.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Ranchers filed suit in United States District Court and obtained a preliminary injunction halting the program. However, they subsequently dismissed the action when the Department agreed to hold administrative hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Following twenty-one days of extensive hearings, the hearing officer on June 30, 1986 issued a forty-page document outlining proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. The hearing officer found that the Department had \u201cpresented evidence which showed that each owner\u2019s herd had been exposed to cattle infected with bovine tuberculosis,\u201d and concluded that, \u201cfrom an epidemiological standpoint, all domestic cattle on the Island are exposed and an analysis of the contacts of each of the rancher-owners shows some degree of exposure.\u201d The hearing officer recommended that the Board proceed with the program. Both parties filed exceptions to the hearing officer\u2019s recommended decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">After reviewing the record and hearing argument by counsel, the Board adopted virtually all of the hearing officer\u2019s proposed findings and conclusions. In its Final Decision and Order, the Board concluded that all cattle on the island of Molokai had been exposed to bovine tuberculosis, that the extermination of the cattle was \u201cnecessary to prevent the spread of the disease,\u201d and that a two-year ranching moratorium was \u201cnecessary to disinfect the premises where the disease may have existed and to prevent the spread of the disease.\u201d It ordered immediate compliance with the terms and conditions of the eradication program.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">The eradication program ordered by the Board was composed of two phases. First, the cattle were appraised and slaughtered, and the owners received indemnity payments from the USDA. Second, all ranching operations were suspended for a two-year period following the slaughter. The wild animals in the exotic animal park located on Molokai Ranch were exempted from the program on the condition that the ranch construct a double fence to prevent contact with domestic animals.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>Ranchers filed appeals in circuit court. Following argument by counsel, the court affirmed the Board\u2019s decision. The court subsequently denied Ranchers\u2019 request for a stay of execution pending this appeal. At present, all of the cattle on Molokai have been slaughtered and the two-year ban on ranching remains in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">By asking this court \u201cto strike down the Board of Agriculture\u2019s Decision so they may resume ranching on Molokai immediately,\u201d Ranchers have assumed the \u201cheavy burden of making a convincing showing that [the decision] is invalid.\u201d <em>In re Hawaiian Electric Light Co., </em>60 Haw. 625, 630, 594 P.2d 612, 617 (1979). Ranchers vigorously challenge the statutory authorization and practical necessity for the slaughter. However, they have not challenged 1) the factual findings or lack of them, concerning the necessity of the two-year moratorium following the slaughter, 2) the adequacy of federal indemnity payments for the slaughtered herds, 3) the compensation, or lack of it, for the moratorium period, or 4) the Board\u2019s apparent failure to promulgate rules and regulations in accordance with the plenary power vested in it by the legislature pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (\u201cHRS\u201d) \u00a7 142-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">Because of Ranchers\u2019 evident acquiescence to these matters, we hold that they have waived or abandoned any challenge to them. <em>Bambico v. Perez, </em>2 Haw. App. 298, 300, 631 P.2d 592, 594 (1981). <em>See also Quality Furniture, Inc. v. Hay, </em>61 Haw. 89, 92 n.4, 595 P.2d 1066, 1068 n.4 (1979). We turn now to the allegations of error which are properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">Appellees ask us to dismiss this appeal as moot because the cattle have already been slaughtered. But we believe Ranchers\u2019 appeal retains vitality.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">\u201cThe [mootness] doctrine [is] appropriate where events subsequent to the judgment of the trial court have so affected the relations between the parties that the two conditions for justiciability relevant on appeal \u2014 adverse interest and effective remedy \u2014 have been compromised.\u201d <em>Wong v. Board of Regents, </em>62 Haw. 391, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>394, 616 P.2d 201, 203-04 (1980). \u201cA case is moot if it has \u2018lost its character as a present, live controversy of the kind that must exist if [courts] are to avoid advisory opinions on abstract propositions of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kona Old Hawaiian Trails Group v. Lyman, </em>69 Haw__,_, 734 P.2d 161, 165 (1987) (brackets in original) (quoting <em>Hall v. Beals, </em>396 U.S. 45, 48 (1969)).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">We are mindful that \u201c[t]he duty of this court, as of every other judicial tribunal, is to decide actual controversies by a judgment which can be carried into effect, and not to give opinions upon moot questions or abstract propositions, or to declare principles or rules of law which cannot affect the matter in issue in the case before it.\u201d <em>Wong v. Board of Regents, </em>62 Haw. at 394-95, 616 P.2d at 204. \u201c[Historically the objection to deciding moot cases was that the judgment of the court could not be carried into effect, or that relief was impossible to grant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 395, 616 P.2d at 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">But these principles do not preclude our consideration of the issues raised here. The court below affirmed the Board\u2019s decision to implement a \u201cbovine tuberculosis eradication program\u201d which entailed mandatory herd depopulation <em>and </em>a two-year suspension of ranching operations following the slaughter.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Ranchers\u2019 purpose in asserting this appeal is to obtain a ruling from this court nullifying the entire eradication program.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>The first component of the program, depopulation, has been completed. Thus the issues concerning the propriety of the slaughter do not represent a present, live controversy. However, we choose to address the questions posed here because they are of great public import and it is as likely as not that similar questions arising in the future would become moot before an authoritative determination by an appellate court could be made. <em>See Kona Old Hawaiian Trails, </em>69 Haw. at_, 734 P.2d at 165-66; <em>Wong, </em>62 Haw. at 395, 616 P.2d at 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">Moreover, Ranchers presently are prohibited from resuming normal ranching operations. As long as this element of the program authorized by the lower court\u2019s ruling remains in effect, \u201cthe appeal presents an adversity of interests and possibly affords the appellants] an effective remedy.\u201d <em>Kona Old Hawaiian Trails, </em>69 Haw. at_, 734 P.2d at 165. Having found the mootness doctrine inapplicable, we proceed to the merits of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-12\">Ranchers assert: 1) HRS \u00a7 142-6 does not apply in this case because it was superseded by HRS \u00a7\u00a7 142-18; and 2) even if HRS \u00a7 142-6 is applicable in the present circumstances, the Board lacked authority to order the slaughter because the cattle were not <em>known </em>to be exposed to bovine tuberculosis within the meaning of HRS \u00a7 142-6. We reject both assertions.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-13\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-14\">Ranchers contend the general powers conferred upon the Department pursuant to HRS \u00a7 142-6 were superseded by the more specific terms of HRS \u00a7 142-18 mandating the slaughter of cattle which react positively to the tuberculin test. A plain reading of the relevant statutory provisions defeats this assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-15\">We are mindful of the principle of statutory construction that where there is a \u201cplainly irreconcilable\u201d conflict between a general and a specific statute concerning the same subject matter, the specific will be favored. <em>State v. Spencer, </em>68 Haw__,_, 725 P.2d 799, 800 (1986); <em>State v. Kuuku, </em>61 Haw. 79, 82, 595 P.2d 291, 294 (1979). However, where the statutes simply overlap in their appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>cation, effect will be given to both if possible, as repeal by implication is disfavored. <em>Spencer, </em>68 Haw. at_, 725 P.2d at 800; <em>Kuuku, </em>61 Haw. at 82, 595 P.2d at 294.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">While \u00a7\u00a7 142-6 and 142-18 overlap to the extent that they discuss procedures concerning diseased animals, we discern no \u201cplainly irreconcilable\u201d conflict. Rather, the cited statutes are complementary.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">Section 142-6 grants to the Department broad authority to destroy any domestic animals known to be infected or exposed to any communicable disease.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 142-18 is a procedural statute addressed to cattle owners. It requires them to deliver for slaughter all cattle which have reacted positively to the tuberculin test.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nothing in section 142-18 evinces legislative intent to divest the Department of its section 142-6 power to destroy cattle known to be exposed to communicable disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">Ranchers contend in the alternative, even assuming HRS \u00a7 142-6 is applicable under the present circumstances, the Department failed to establish that their cattle were <em>known </em>to be exposed to bovine tuberculosis. The record belies this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">As we have previously noted, HRS \u00a7 142-6 empowers the Department to quarantine and destroy domestic animals solely on the basis of exposure to any communicable disease. In addition, Administrative Rule \u00a7 4-16-20(b) of the Department of Agriculture, Division of Animal Industry provides that \u201c[a]ll herds of cattle that have been in contact with herds in which tuberculin test reactors of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>tuberculous animals have been found shall be designated as exposed herds and shall be quarantined.\u201d Subsection (c) of the rule requires owners of exposed cattle to \u201clift the quarantine through either complete herd depopulation via slaughter or through testing procedures, as prescribed by the state veterinarian.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">We reject Ranchers\u2019 threshold argument that the term \u201ccontact\u201d as it is used in Rule \u00a7 4-16-20 must be defined as \u201cactual physical contact.\u201d The general principles of construction which apply to statutes also apply to administrative rules. <em>IBEW, Local 1357 v. Hawaiian Telephone Co., </em>68 Haw. __, _, 713 P.2d 943, 950 (1986). Our primary objective in interpreting and applying the relevant administrative rule is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Department. <em>See Stop H-3 Ass\u2019n v. State Department of Transportation, </em>68 Haw._,_, 706 P.2d 446, 451 (1985) (interpreting statute). The obvious purpose of the rule is to facilitate the eradication of bovine tuberculosis. The record conclusively establishes that exposure to bovine tuberculosis can be accomplished indirectly, for example, by aerosol transmission. To accord the term \u201ccontact\u201d the limited meaning urged by Ranchers would lead to an absurd result. This we may not permit. <em>See State v. Lee, </em>67 Haw. 307, 314, 686 P.2d 816, 820 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">We turn next to Ranchers\u2019 contention that the record fails to support the Board\u2019s determination that all of the cattle on Molokai were known to be exposed to bovine tuberculosis. The Board found that the Department \u201cpresented evidence which showed that each owner\u2019s herd had been exposed to cattle infected with bovine tuberculosis.\u201d A reviewing court will not disturb an agency\u2019s findings of fact unless they are shown to be \u201cclearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record.\u201d <em>Dedman v. Board of Land and Natural Resources, </em>69 Haw. _, _, 740 P.2d 28, 35 (1987) (quoting HRS \u00a7 91-14(g)(5) (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-13\">The record in this case overwhelmingly supports the finding of known exposure. The Board catalogued numerous types of contact establishing exposure generally,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and documented in a detailed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>exhibit the basis for its determination that each individual rancher\u2019s herd had been exposed to the disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">\u201c[C]ourts decline to consider the weight of the evidence to ascertain whether it weighs in favor of the administrative findings, or to review the agency\u2019s findings of fact by passing upon the credibility of witnesses or conflicts in testimony, especially the findings of an expert agency dealing with a specialized field.\u201d <em>In re Kaanapali Water Corp., </em>5 Haw. App. 71, 78, 678 P.2d 584, 589 (1984) (citations omitted). Because they are supported by rehable, probative and substantial evidence, the Board\u2019s factual findings must be upheld. <em>See Dedman, </em>69 Haw. at_, 740 P.2d at 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Ranchers contend the hearing officer improperly required Ranchers, rather than the Department, to bear the burden of proof.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But nothing in the record indicates that the hearing officer did in fact place the burden upon Ranchers except the hearing officer\u2019s explicit statement that \u201cnone of the rulings have rested upon the failure of the rancher-owners to meet a burden of proof.\u201d We are constrained to reverse or modify an agency\u2019s decision only where \u201csubstantial rights of the petitioners may have been prejudiced.\u201d HRS \u00a7 91-14(g) (1985). We find that the error, if any, was harmless in this case. <em>See In re Wind Power Pacific Investors-III, </em>67 Haw. 342, 343, 686 P.2d 831, 832-33 (1984) (agency\u2019s procedural irregularities did not prejudice appellant\u2019s substantial rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">Finally, we consider Rancher\u2019s equal protection claim. As we have said, HRS \u00a7 142-6 grants to the Department the discretion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>quarantine and destroy animals and to disinfect the premises.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Ranchers do not challenge the statute itself on equal protection grounds. Rather, they claim to be the victims of impermissible selective treatment by the Board. Ranchers argue that the Board\u2019s decision to limit the depopulation program to cattle and to exempt captive wildlife violates equal protection principles. We disagree.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">The essence of the equal protection guarantee embodied in the federal and state constitutions is that \u201call persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Shibuya v. Architects Hawaii, Ltd., </em>65 Haw. 26, 35, 647 P.2d 276, 283 (1982) (quoting <em>F.S. Royster Guano Co. v. Virginia, </em>253 U.S. 412, 415 (1920)). <em>See also State v. Bloss, </em>62 Haw. 147, 157, 613 P.2d 354, 360 (1980). A law, neutral on its face, but so administered as to unjustly discriminate between persons in similar circumstances, may deny equal protection. <em>Yick Wo. v. Hopkins, </em>118 U.S. 356 (1886).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">In <em>State v. Kailua Auto Wreckers, Inc., </em>62 Haw. 222, 615 P.2d 730 (1980), we recognized the defense of discriminatory enforcement in the context of a criminal prosecution. There we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-8\">The burden of proving discriminatory enforcement of the law rests upon the party raising the defense. That party must present sufficient evidence to establish the existence of intentional or purposeful discrimination, that is \u201cdeliberately based upon an unjustifiable standard such as race, religion or other arbitrary classification.\u201d It is insufficient to show merely that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>other offenders have not been prosecuted, or that there has been laxity of enforcement, or that there has been some conscious selectivity in prosecution. Recognition of the defense will not permit the guilty to go free simply by showing that other violators exist.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 226-27, 615 P.2d at 734-35 (quoting <em>Oyler v. Boles, </em>368 U.S. 448, 456 (1962) (citations omitted). <em>See also State v. Tookes, </em>67 Haw. 608, 615, 699 P.2d 983, 988 (1985).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Although the case at bar does not involve a criminal prosecution, we find the case law pertaining to allegations of discriminatory prosecution instructive. <em>See Henson v. Department of Law Enforcement, </em>107 Idaho 19, 23 n.3, 684 P.2d 996, 1000 n.3 (1984) (allegation of selective enforcement in revocation of retail liquor license).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">To substantiate a claim of discriminatory enforcement, Ranchers must satisfy a two-part test. First, they must demonstrate that the Department generally has not enforced section 142-6 against others similarly situated. <em>See Kuzinich v. County of Santa Clara, </em>689 F.2d 1345, 1349 (9th Cir. 1982). Second, Ranchers must establish that their selection was \u201cdeliberately based upon an unjustifiable standard such as race, religion or other arbitrary classification.\u201d <em>State v. Kailua Auto Wreckers, Inc., </em>62 Haw. at 227, 615 P.2d at 734-35 (quoting <em>Oyler v. Boles, </em>368 U.S. at 456). If Ranchers do not satisfy both parts of this test, their equal protection claim fails. For that reason, the claim fails here.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Molokai Ranch, in addition to operating a cattle ranch, owns and operates the exotic animal park located on its property. We note at the outset that all <em>cattle </em>owners were treated alike; although the park animals were exempted from the depopulation program, cattle belonging to Molokai Ranch were included in the program.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">By sparing park wildlife from the eradication program, the Board clearly treated cattle owners and park owners differently. However, Ranchers have failed to satisfy the threshold requirement of demonstrating that cattle owners and park owners are \u201csimilarly circumstanced.\u201d Rather, the evidence underscores the dissimilarity between the two groups.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AAy\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number><em>Karen M.

Among them were: common use of contaminated equipment; use of a common import/export pen at the sole dock facility on the island; interbreeding among herds; and pasturing cattle of different owners in a single herd. These practices obviously were not utilized in the operation of the animal park. Prior to entering the state, park wildlife was thoroughly tested for disease, including bovine tuberculosis. The park is required to augment the existing ten-foot barrier by constructing a double fence.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">We find the remaining assertions of error without merit.
