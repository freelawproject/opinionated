We have jurisdiction ancillary to our jurisdiction over Mikhel\u2019s direct appeal and pursuant to our authority to \u201cregulate practice in a particular case [before us] in any manner consistent with federal law.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 47(b); see <em>Daccarett-Ghia v. Comm\u2019r, </em>70 F.3d 621, 623 (D.C.Cir.1995) (\u201c[A] court\u2019s authority to control its own proceedings ... is both an inherent power and, in the federal circuit courts, embodied in Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 47\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-4\">Mikhel asks us to lift all restrictions imposed pursuant to 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 501.3 on his communications with his appellate counsel, the Federal Public Defender for the Central District of California. He contends that these restrictions, known as Special Administrative Measures or \u201cSAMs,\u201d violate the Due Process Clause and his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of appellate counsel. After reviewing the pleadings and the declarations filed by the parties, we order as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">1. Special Administrative Measure 2(b)(i). The SAM order currently in effect prohibits the Federal Public Defender from utilizing the services of a translator when meeting with Mikhel, a foreign national, except when \u201cabsolutely necessary where the inmate does not speak a common language with the attorney.\u201d <em>See </em>SAM 2(b)(i) (May 20, 2008). The Government asserts that Mikhel \u201cis proficient in English\u201d and therefore is not entitled to a translator during any meeting with his attorneys, even if that translator meets the other restrictions imposed by the SAM including the requirements that the translator be pre-cleared by the FBI and the United States Attorney for the Central District of California and that the translator never be in contact with Mikhel outside the physical presence of Mikhel\u2019s attorneys, who have also been pre-cleared by the Government. <em>See </em>Govt.\u2019s Response at 14. The Public Defender asserts that, because Mikhel is not \u201ca native English speaker, ... his word selection is, at times, not precise ... [and] his English is deteriorating somewhat ... given his extreme isolation as a result of the SAM.\u201d Deck of Sean Bolser at \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-7\">We recognize the Government\u2019s legitimate interest in ensuring that Mikhel does not surreptitiously use a translator\u2019s services to plan an escape from prison, as he has attempted to do in the past. However, \u201c[n]umerous courts have [also] recognized that the presence of an interpreter who provides accurate and complete translations may be necessary to protect the defendant\u2019s ... rights.\u201d <em>Chacon v. Wood, </em>36 F.3d 1459, 1464 (9th Cir.1994). Other than the use of a translator, there are no sufficient \u201calternative means of exercising [Mikhel\u2019s] right\u201d to communicate fully with his counsel. <em>Casey v. Lewis, </em>4 F.3d 1516, 1520 (9th Cir.1993). We hold that SAM provision 2(b)(i) as applied \u201cis an \u2018exaggerated response\u2019 to prison concerns\u201d and places an unacceptable burden on Mikhel\u2019s due process and Sixth Amendment rights. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Turner v. Safley, </em>482 U.S. 78, 89-90, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987)). The Government\u2019s requirements that any translator assisting the Public Defender be \u201csuccessfully ... cleared by the FBI and USA/CDCA\u201d after \u201csubmitting] to a background check\u201d and that the \u201cuse of a translator by the attorney shall be in the physical and immediate presence of the attorney\u201d at all times are adequate to achieve the Government\u2019s asserted security interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-8\">Accordingly, we order that in this case SAM 2(b)(i) be modified so as to parallel SAM 1(d)(1), which governs the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 own use of translators when communicating with Mikhel. Specifically, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>order that SAM 2(b)(i) be amended to state that \u201cMikhel\u2019s attorney(s) may use Department of Justice(DOJ)-approved translators as necessary for the purpose of facilitating communication with the inmate. Any translator shall be pre-cleared under the ordinary process (see SAM footnote 2).\u201d A sworn declaration by Mikhel\u2019s attorney provided to the appropriate representatives of the Government explaining that a translator is necessary for the purpose of facilitating communication with the inmate will be sufficient to satisfy the \u201cnecessity\u201d component of the revised SAM provision. Accommodation of Mikhel\u2019s right in this fashion will not impose any additional burden on the Government, as the screening procedures are already mandated by and detailed in the existing SAM order. <em>Cf. Casey, </em>4 F.3d at 1520.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-3\">2. Special Administrative Measure 2(d). The SAM order also provides that the \u201cinmate\u2019s attorney may disseminate the contents of the inmate\u2019s communication to third parties for the sole purpose of preparing the inmate\u2019s post-sentencing proceedings ... on the understanding that any such dissemination shall be made solely by the inmate\u2019s attorney, and not by the attorney\u2019s staff.\u201d SAM 2(d) (May 20, 2008). The Government has indicated that it \u201cdoes not oppose ... modifying the SAM restrictions to allow the two investigators working on behalf of Mikhel\u2019s counsel ... to disseminate the contents of Mikhel\u2019s communication to third parties\u201d consistent with the requirement that \u201cthey do so for the sole purpose of preparing his post-sentencing proceedings.\u201d Govt.\u2019s Response at 2-3. Accordingly, the SAM restrictions are modified to reflect the Government\u2019s proposed amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">3. Special Administrative Measure 2(e). The SAM order also provides that \u201c[a]n investigator ... may not meet alone with the inmate.\u201d SAM 2(e) (May 20, 2008). \u201c[A]n indigent defendant has a constitutional right to investigative services ... when some need is demonstrated,\u201d which is invariably the case in complex capital cases. <em>Williams v. Stewart, </em>441 F.3d 1030, 1053 (9th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Smith v. Enomoto, </em>615 F.2d 1251, 1252 (9th Cir.1980)). In order to be effective in providing investigative services, an investigator often needs to meet with the client. However, Mikhel is confined in Terre Haute, Indiana, which is 2,000 miles away from the Public Defender\u2019s office in Los Angeles. Given this substantial distance, the arbitrary requirement that an attorney or paralegal from the Public Defender\u2019s office accompany an investigator from that same office for every meeting with Mikhel imposes a significant burden on the defendant with respect to the availability of necessary investigative services.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-6\">The same SAM provision that prohibits a defense investigator from meeting alone with Mikhel provides that \u201c[t]he inmate\u2019s pre-cleared paralegal(s) <em>may </em>meet with the inmate without the necessity of the inmate\u2019s attorney being present.\u201d SAM 2(e) (May 20, 2008) (emphasis added). We do not see, nor has the Government provided, any \u201cvalid, rational\u201d justification for distinguishing between paralegals and investigators employed by the office of the Federal Public Defender. <em>Casey, 4 </em>F.3d at 1520. Altering SAM 2(e) so as to allow Federal Public Defender staff investigators who have satisfied the Government\u2019s pre-clearance requirements to meet with Mikhel in the absence of his attorney will not impose any additional burden on the Government or otherwise adversely \u201cimpact ... guards, ... other inmates, or ... the allocation of prison resources.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We modify SAM Restriction 2(e) to state that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANv\">The inmate\u2019s attorney\u2019s pre-cleared paralegal(s) and pre-cleared investigators in the regular full-time employment of the attorney may meet with the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>mate without the necessity of the inmate\u2019s attorney being present. A translator may not meet alone with the inmate. These meetings may be contact or non-contact, at the discretion of the USMS/BOP/DF.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">It is hereby ORDERED that the modifications set forth above are incorporated into the SAM order. With those modifications, the defendant\u2019s motion to lift all SAM Restrictions is DENIED. We express no opinion as to the constitutionality of Mikhel\u2019s conditions of confinement except to the extent those conditions relate to his right to effective assistance of counsel in the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">The stay <em>of </em>proceedings is lifted. The opening brief is due March 31, 2009. The answering brief is due May 29, 2009. The reply brief is due June 30, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-7\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
