SCHEINDLIN, District Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b356-19\">I. INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b356-20\">Stolt Tank Containers BV and StoltNielsen USA, Inc. (hereinafter collectively, \u201cStolt\u201d) brings this action against BASF SE, amongst others, seeking contribution, indemnification, and a determination of direct liability. BASF SE now moves to dismiss all claims for lack of personal jurisdiction pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (\u201cRule\u201d) 12(b)(2), insufficient process pursuant to Rule 12(b)(4), and insufficient service of process pursuant to Rule 12(b)(5). For the reasons set forth below, BASF SE\u2019s motion is GRANTED and the claims are dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-21\">II. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b356-22\">A. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b356-23\">This action arises out of a July 2012 fire aboard the M/V MSC Flaminia while the vessel was crossing the Atlantic Ocean during its voyage from Louisiana to Germany. The owner and operator of the vessel jointly filed a Complaint for Exoner<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>ation from or Limitation of Liability (the \u201cLimitation Action\u201d) and subsequently filed cross-claims against Stolt, alleging that Stolt produced, shipped, owned, sold, and/or bought a chemical that was responsible for the explosion and fire that occurred and all of the resulting damage and losses. In July 2014, Stolt filed cross-claims against BASF SE, a European chemical company based in Germany, and BASF Corp., its North American affiliate based in New Jersey. The claims sounded in contribution, indemnification, and direct liability, alleging that a chemical that BASF SE purchased from BASF Corp. was stored aboard the vessel in the same hold as Stolt\u2019s chemical \u2014 where the fire purportedly originated \u2014 and that BASF\u2019s chemical caused or contributed to the fire and/or explosion aboard the ship.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">1. Stolt (Cross-claim Plaintiffs)</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Stolt Tank Containers BV and StoltNielsen USA are corporations that store and distribute large quantities of liquids. Stolt Tank Containers BV is incorporated in The Netherlands with its principal place of business in Rotterdam, The Netherlands.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Stolt-Nielsen USA Inc. is a Delaware corporation with a place of business in Norwalk, Connecticut.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">2. BASF SE and BASF Corp. (Cross-claim Defendants)</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">BASF SE is a world leader in the production and distribution of chemicals.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> BASF SE is a publicly traded German corporation with its principal place of business in Ludwigshafen, Germany.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Stolt claims that BASF SE maintains several bank accounts in New York, that BASF SE derives a substantial amount of revenue in sales to New York entities, and that BASF SE\u2019s American Depository Receipts are available for purchase in New York.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As discussed further below, Stolt also asserts that BASF Corp.\u2019s New York contacts can be imputed to BASF SE under an agency theory.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-16\">BASF Corp., the largest affiliate of BASF SE, produces and markets chemicals in North America.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> BASF Corp. is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Florham Park, New Jersey.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The company has three offices in New York with at least one hundred employees each.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-17\">Stolt asserts that BASF Corp. is BASF SE\u2019s domestic subsidiary, that the entities have \u201can ongoing business and/or contractual relationship,\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and that BASF Corp. regularly loans BASF SE money.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Stolt further claims that BASF SE would likely need to establish offices in New York and in the United States if BASF Corp. did not exist.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-18\">B. BASF SE\u2019s Motion to Dismiss</p>\n<p id=\"b357-19\">BASF SE moves to dismiss all claims, arguing that (1) the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over BASF SE because BASF <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>SE does not have the requisite contacts with New York, nor did BASF SE consent to jurisdiction or waive the defense, (2) Stolt\u2019s process was insufficient because Stolt should have brought a third-party complaint \u2014 not a cross-claim \u2014 against BASF SE, and (3) Stolt\u2019s service of process was improper. Stolt opposes each motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">III. LEGAL STANDARD</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">A plaintiff has the burden of proving personal jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> When assessed on written submissions, \u201ca plaintiff need only allege facts constituting a prima facie showing of personal jurisdiction to survive a Rule 12(b)(2) motion.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The plaintiff may make such a showing with \u201can averment of facts that, if credited, would suffice to establish jurisdiction over the defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In this posture, the court must construe all allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and resolve all doubts in the plaintiffs favor.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> However, \u201ca plaintiff may not rely on \u2018conclusory non-fact-specific jurisdictional allegations\u2019 to overcome a motion to dismiss.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-12\">IV. APPLICABLE LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b358-13\">\u201cFederal courts are to apply the personal jurisdiction rules of the forum state.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> A court must undertake a \u201ctwo-step inquiry\u201d to determine if it can exercise personal jurisdiction over a foreign defendant.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> \u201cFirst, we determine whether the defendant is subject to jurisdiction under' the law of the forum state-here, New York. Second, we consider whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction over the defendant comports with the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution.\u201d <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Additionally, there are two types of personal jurisdiction: \u201cgener\u00e1l or all-purpose jurisdiction, and specific or case-linked jurisdiction.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> However, because Stolt has not alleged any facts to support a prima facie showing of specific jurisdiction, and the alleged facts do not appear to indicate that such jurisdiction exists, there is no need to address specific jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-14\">\u2022 [7,8]. In addition to the merits of a personal jurisdiction challenge, a court must also consider the timeliness of the objection.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> -According to Rule 12(h)(1), a \u201cdefense of lack of jurisdiction ... is waived if it is neither made by motion ... nor included in a responsive pleading or an amendment thereof permitted by Rule 15(a).\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>A. General Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">There are two grounds for general jurisdiction under New York law that are in dispute here. <em>First, </em>under section 301 of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules (\u201cCPLR\u201d), New York courts may assert general jurisdiction over a foreign corporation if the corporation is \u201cdoing business\u201d in the State. Under this test, a foreign corporation is amenable to suit in New York if it \u201c \u2018has engaged in such a continuous and systematic course of \u2018doing business\u2019 [in- New York] that a finding of its \u2018presence\u2019 [in New York] is warranted.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark>. However, general jurisdiction only comports with due process \u201cwhen a corporation\u2019s contacts with a state are \u2018so continuous and systematic as to render [it] essentially at home in the forum State.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>25</footnotemark> \u201c[0]nly a limited set of affiliations with a forum will render a defendant\u201d \u201cat home\u201d such that jurisdiction is appropriate.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The paradigm instances of when a corporate defendant is \u201cat .home\u201d- are in its place of incorporation and principal place \u25a0 of business.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Generally, \u201ca company\u2019s \u2018engage[ment] in a substantial, continuous, and systematic course of business\u2019 is alone insufficient to render it at home in a forum.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> It is possible that \u201ca corporation\u2019s operations in a forum other than its formal place of incorporation or principal place of business may- be so substantial and of such a nature as to render the corporation at home in that State,\u201d but this would be an \u201cexceptional case.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-15\"><em>Second, </em>New York courts may assert general jurisdiction over a foreign company based on the actions of its instate domestic affiliate in situations where the relationship between the foreign parent and its subsidiary \u201cvalidly suggests the existence of an agency relationship or the parent controls the subsidiary so completely that the subsidiary may be said to be simply a department of the parent.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> However, if imputing the in-state contacts of the domestic affiliate to the foreign parent does not render the foreign parent \u201cat home\u201d in the state, then there is no basis to subject the foreign parent to general jurisdiction in the state.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-16\">B. Jurisdiction Under Rule 4(k)(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b359-17\">Absent general jurisdiction as determined by state law, federal courts may exert jurisdiction over a foreign defendant pursuant to Rule 4(k)(2), which provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>for jurisdiction if (1) the claim ... arises under federal law, (2) the defendant is not subject to jurisdiction in any state\u2019s courts of general jurisdiction, and (3) exercising jurisdiction is consistent with the United, States Constitution and laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">V. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">A. General Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Subjecting BASF SE to jurisdiction in New York under the \u201cdoing business\u201d standard or under an agency theory would not comport with due process. Even if BASF SE satisfies the \u201cdoing business\u201d standard, Stolt has not alleged that BASF SE\u2019s operations in New York are \u201cso substantial and of such a nature as to render the corporation at home in that State\u201d to make this one of the \u201cexceptional case[s]\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> alluded to in <em>Daimler AG v. Bauman. </em>Stolt\u2019s agency theory similarly fails. To support personal jurisdiction under an agency theory, Stolt alleges that (1) BASF Corp. is a domestic subsidiary of BASF SE,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> (2) BASF SE regularly borrows money from BASF Corp.,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> (3) BASF SE regularly contracts with BASF Corp.,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> and (4) \u201cBASF SE would presumably have to establish its own offices in New York and the United States\u201d if BASF Corp. did not exist.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> BASF SE contends that this agency theory is analogous to the Ninth Circuit\u2019s approach in <em>Daimler </em>that the Supreme Court ultimately rejected.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> I agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-13\">In <em>Daimler, </em>the Supreme Court considered whether imputing the in-state contacts of a subsidiary corporation to its foreign corporate parent would render the foreign entity \u201cat home\u201d in the forum state. There, the subsidiary\u2019s place of incorporation and principal place of business were both outside the forum state.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> However, the subsidiary had multiple offices throughout the forum state and its sales in the forum state accounted for 2.4% of the foreign parent\u2019s worldwide sales.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The Court held that even assuming that the subsidiary is at home in the forum state and that the subsidiary\u2019s contacts can be imputed to the foreign parent, \u201cthere would still be no basis to subject [the foreign corporate parent] to general jurisdiction\u201d in the forum state, thereby rejecting the Ninth Circuit\u2019s determination that jurisdiction existed under a broad view of agency theory.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-14\">The same rationale can be applied here. BASF SE alleges that its New York sales constitute only 0.07% of its worldwide sales<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> and that imputing BASF Corp.\u2019s annual New York sales from 2011 through 2014 \u201cwould still amount to less than 0.87% of BASF SE\u2019s worldwide sales,\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> which is less than the percentage that the Supreme Court rejected as inadequate to render the foreign parent \u201cat home\u201d in <em>Daimler. </em>Stolt does not dispute these calculations. Thus, even assuming that BASF Corp. is \u201cat home\u201d in New York and that its New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>York contacts can be imputed to BASF SE, BASF SE\u2019s minimal contacts with New York do not render it \u201cat home\u201d here. Further, <em>Daimler </em>\u201cexpressed doubts as to the usefulness of an agency analysis ... that focuses on a forum-state- affiliate\u2019s importance to the defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> In light of these considerations, BASF SE and BASF Corp.\u2019s combined activities in the forum state are insufficient to overcome the due process concerns posed by haling a foreign company into an American court.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">Stolt further contends that jurisdictional discovery should be permitted concerning BASF SE\u2019s contacts with New York and its relationship with BASF Corp.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Because \u201cit is hard to see why much in the way of discovery would be needed to determine where a corporation is at home,\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> and further discovery into the relationship between the two BASF entities would not affect the ratio of BASF\u2019s New York sales to BASF SE\u2019s worldwide sales, Stolt\u2019s request for jurisdictional discovery is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">B. Jurisdiction by Waiver</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">I next address the timeliness of BASF SE\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. \u201c[I]n determining whether waiver or forfeiture of objections to personal jurisdiction has occurred, \u2018we consider all of the relevant circumstances.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Stolt claims that- BASF SE has waived its right to contest personal jurisdiction by fading to assert any Rule 12 jurisdictional defenses in its first responsive pleading and by filing a claim in the Limitation Action.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Stolt further contends that BASF SE failed to raise any Rule 12 jurisdictional defenses in its prior motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> In response to these contentions, BASF SE alleges that it did not voluntarily submit to jurisdiction because the responsive pleading, claim, and motion upon which Stolt relies were filed in BASF SE\u2019s name by Hill Rivkins LLP, counsel for BASF SE\u2019s subrogated cargo insurer Basler Sachversicherungs-Aktiengesellschaft (\u201cBasler\u201d), without notifying or obtaining authorization from BASF SE.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Stolt claims that by choosing to bring its subrogation action in BASF SE\u2019s name, Basler was actually appearing as BASF SE.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-13\">Stolt\u2019s claim, however, is not persuasive. <em>First, </em>the parties have stipulated that BASF SE shall be substituted with \u201cBasler Saehversicherungs-Aktiengesellschaft as subrogee of BASF SE\u201d in the pleadings and claims filed in the Limita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>tion Action by Hill Rivkins LLP in BASF SE\u2019s name.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> This stipulation makes clear that the subrogated insurer, Basler, is distinct from the insured, BASF SE. Second, although a court may impute an insured\u2019s actions to the insurer when the insurer has paid the insured for a loss,<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> it does not follow that the actions of an insurer can be imputed to the insured.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark>\u2019 \u201cSubrogation is the principle by which an insurer, having paid losses of its insured, is placed in the position of its insured so that it may recover from the third party legally responsible for the loss.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> This is because the insurer retains an interest in any action taken by the insured to recover for the loss. The converse is not true. Where, as here, the insurer pays the insured for a loss and subsequently files suit against the third party \"legally responsible for the loss, the insured has no interest in the claim filed by its insurer. Thus, under the facts presented here, it would be inequitable to find that Basler\u2019s appearance in BASF SE\u2019s name constitutes an appearance by BASF SE.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">Stolt-also asserts that BASF SE has consented to \u25a0 personal jurisdiction through its delay in filing the instant motion.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> However, \u201cthe passage of time alone is generally not sufficient to indicate forfeiture of a procedural right.\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> Typically there must also be some reasonable indication based on the defendant\u2019s conduct that the defendant will defend or resolve the dispute on the merits.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> No such indication exists here. As such, Stolt\u2019s claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">C. Rule 4(k)(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">In the alternative, Stolt claims that the Court has jurisdiction over BASF SE pursuant to Rule 4(k)(2)., As the Limitation Action is. based in admiralty and maritime law, it arises under federal law. However, Stolt has not certified that BASF SE is not subject to jurisdiction in any other state.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> Moreover, the facts as alleged suggest that personal jurisdiction may exist elsewhere in the United States, such as in Louisiana, given that BASF SE <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>took delivery of the chemical at issue from a BASF Corp. plant in Geismar, Louisiana, and arranged transportation of the chemical from Louisiana to Germany.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> Accordingly, Stolt has not alleged all of the elements required for the exercise of personal jurisdiction under Rule 4(k)(2).<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Stolt\u2019s request for jurisdictional discovery concerning BASF SE\u2019s contacts with th\u00e9 United States as a whole is also denied.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> \u201cAlthough the District Court has the discretion to authorize jurisdictional discovery, discovery is not warranted where [the] plaintiff has failed to make a prima facie showing of jurisdiction.\u201d<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">For the reasons set forth above,. BASF SE\u2019s motion to dismiss is GRANTED.
