Those applications alleged first use on December 15, 1949. Alford Manufacturing\u2019s application, which alleges first use by December 1946, was filed on July 5, 1960, making Alfred the senior party.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-20\">The board held that Alford Manufacturing is entitled to the registration for which it has made application and stated that Alfred\u2019s registrations will be can-celled in due course.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-21\">Both parties filed testimony and documentary exhibits. The evidence of Alford Manufacturing is dealt with in the board\u2019s opinion, from which, in view of its thoroughness and accuracy on that point, we quote at length:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b961-22\">\u201cAccording to testimony adduced in behalf of the junior party, \u2018AL<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>FORD\u2019 is the surname of Andrew Alford, the president of Alford Manufacturing Company and the owner of a majority of the stock of said company. Andrew Alford is a well known, nationally recognized authority and inventor in the television and FM-AM broadcasting antenna field and is the sole or joint owner of some one hundred patents primarily related to antennas and related wave guide devices, including a hyperbolic navigation system and antennas used to transmit signals in station broadcasts to aircraft, a number of which have been known and referred to as \u2018Alford Loops\u2019. In September 1945, while working part-time at the Radio Research Laboratory at Harvard University, Alford started his own business, a sole proprietorship, under the name, Andrew Alford Consulting Engineers, to engage in rendering consulting engineering services and the broadcasting antenna field. Alford terminated all connections with the Radio Research Laboratory on December 31, 1945 and from January 1946 on, he devoted all his time to his business. Andrew Alford Consulting Engineers first conducted business from Alford\u2019s apartment and shortly afterwards from a place in Somerville, Massachusetts. In September 1947, Alford moved to Boston, Massachu-etts from which address he has continued to conduct his business. During the years from 1946 through 1948, Andrew Alford Consulting Engineers designed and developed transmitting and receiving antennas and associated equipment for use on aircraft, buses, and the like as well as antennas for color television tests, directional antenna, and similar devices to which were attached nameplates bearing the legend \u2018Contractor, Andrew Alford Consulting Engineers\u2019 or \u2018Contractor, Andrew Alford\u2019.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b962-4\">\u201cOn October 15, 1948, Alford organized the junior party, Alford Manufacturing Company, as a Massachusetts corporation doing business in Boston, Massachusetts at the same address as Andrew Alford Consulting Engineers. The junior party, shortly after its creation, adopted and began using a trademark including the letters \u2018AMC\u2019 or \u2018AMCF on the background of what is referred to as a \u2018Smith Chart\u2019. This mark was prominently displayed on every name plate and catalog employed by the junior party. Beginning at least as early as November or December 1948, when it shipped a television diplex-ing filter from Boston to the Columbia Broadcasting System in New York City, the name plates affixed by the junior party to its goods have also displayed its corporate name \u2018Alford Manufacturing Co.\u2019 in block lettering above the address \u2018Boston, Mass.\u2019; and since about July 1955, \u2018Alford\u2019 has been prominently displayed on the nameplates and in advertising catalogs above the words \u2018Manufacturing Co.\u2019, and in a size much more readily discernible than the remaining portion of its corporate name. The junior party, with the exception of two years during the Korean War when its activities which were primarily concerned with commercial needs were curtailed, has been a going concern since its incorporation in the latter part of 1948. It has, since about 1953 or 1954 distributed catalogs describing its equipment to customers and prospective customers, it has advertised its equipment in various trade publications, and it has displayed its products at various conventions and shows, including, the IRE National Convention, the Wes-con Show, the National Electronics Conference, and the convention of the National Association of Broadcasters. \u2018Alford\u2019 has been promi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>nently and distinctively featured on all of this material and displays. In addition, its equipment is referred to in invoices by the designation \u2018Alford\u2019 and sales contracts refer to \u2018Alford Equipment\u2019 and the like. The junior party expends about forty-eight thousand dollars a year in advertising its products, which includes the cost of attending and displaying such goods at conventions and shows. Sales of products by the junior party, which have been made for the most part through Manufacturers\u2019 representatives in the United States and abroad, amounted to sixty-three and one half thousand dollars in 1949 and over six hundred thousand dollars in 1960.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b963-4\">\u201cAndrew Alford Consulting Engineers and Alford Manufacturing Company have over the years existed as two distinctly different legal entities, the former, a sole proprietorship and the latter, a corpora-ion. Andrew Alford owns the controlling interest in the junior party, and Andrew Alford Consulting Engineers or, in fact, Andrew Alford, owns most of the facilities used by the junior party and does the actual manufacturing both for his own customers, and also as a subcontractor for the junior party. Andrew Alford Consulting Engineers is engaged primarily in electronic engineering consultation and development work for the government. The junior party manufactures and sells two principal lines of goods intended primarily for commercial as distinguished from governmental users, one line comprising television transmitting antennas and diplexers, vestigial side brand filters, hybrid diplexers, and miscellaneous hardware that goes with the radiating system of television or FM \u2014 AM broadcasting systems, and the other line comprising instruments, components, and allied items for radio frequency measurements and systems. The junior party has also from time to time made and sold special equipment in the same field or fields engaged in by Andrew Alford Consulting Engineers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">The board rejected the claim of Alford Manufacturing that use of \u201cALFORD\u201d by Andrew Alford or Andrew Alford Consulting Engineers inures to its benefit to give it use since December 1946. On the basis that Alford Manufacturing can rely on such use of \u201cALFORD\u201d as it has made in its own behalf, the board found use of \u201cALFORD\u201d \u201cas the distinguishing feature of its trade name since about November or December 1948 and in the manner of a trademark since about July 1955.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b963-7\">The board also dealt in detail with the evidence for Alfred, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b963-8\">\u201cThe senior party\u2019s record discloses that in about 1937 or 1938 two high school friends, Albert Y. Jew and Frederick W. Kruse, formed a partnership under the name of Palo Alto Sound Service, to engage in servicing, building, and selling electronic equipment such as modulators, amplifiers, oscillators, disc recorders, and public address systems. The operations of the partnership were conducted first in their respective parent\u2019s garages and later, when they build their own homes, in their adjacent garages. In about 1948, the partnership began to branch more and more into engineering and manufacturing electronic products with less emphasis on the servicing end of the business. At this time, another company was founded by a friend under the name, Palo Alto Radio Service, which was devoted entirely to servicing radio and television sets. In order to better re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>fleet the changed character of its business and to avoid any possible confusion with Palo Alto Radio Service, the partners decided to rename their partnership, Alfred Electronics, the prefix \u2018Al\u2019 being taken from the first name of Albert Y. Jew and the latter portion \u2018Fred\u2019 from the first name of the other partner, Frederick W. Kruse. The change of partnership name was effected after a gradual changeover sometime in 1949. The earliest date exhibit of record reflecting the completed change-over to Alfred Electronics is a copy of a seller\u2019s permit issued to Alfred Electronics under the California Sales and Use Tax Laws on December 5, 1949. Subsequently, the parties changed the name on the bank account, ordered new stationery forms and stamps, and otherwise conducted business as Alfred Electronics. The business of the new partnership continued along substantially the same lines as the old partnership including television servicing until 1952 when the servicing was discontinued. From 1952 to 1954, the partnership manufactured a large number of medical devices called \u2018defibrillators\u2019 and various microwave devices. In or about 1954 or 1955, the partnership decided to change its activities from special product manufacturing to manufacturing catalog or standard items. Subsequently, it developed and manufactured ionization gauge controls or amplifiers, vacuum power control panels, and other electronic equipment. Starting in late 1949, all products manufactured and sold by the partnership were stamped with the designation:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b964-4\">\u2018Alfred Electronics Palo Alto, Calif. U. S. A.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b964-5\">In late 1955, the partnership began to use the notation \u2018Alfred\u2019, per se, in association with its products on data or catalog sheets distributed to customers and prospective customers ; and in or before the middle of 1956 it applied \u2018Alfred\u2019, per se, as a trademark on the product nameplates in such a manner as \u2018Alfred Regulated Power Supply\u2019, \u2018Alfred Microwave Amplifier\u2019 and the like. Such use has since been continuous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b964-7\">\u201cIn June 1957, the partnership being conducted under the name, Alfred Electronics, was incorporated as the senior party, Alfred Electronics, a California corporation, and the assets of the partnership including \u2018its name and goodwill\u2019 were transferred to the corporation, the outstanding stock thereof being owned by the former members of the partnership. The corporation is predominately involved in manufacturing and selling broad band microwave instruments and power supplies including sweeping oscillators, sweeping signal generators, microwave levelers, microwave amplifiers and high voltage power supplies (99% of the amplifiers and oscillators sold by the senior party assertedly operate above 1000 megacycles). The business of the corporation has steadily increased. From 1950 through 1955, the senior party\u2019s sales totaled seventy thousand dollars and since 1956, such sales have approximated five million dollars. The senior party\u2019s products are sold throughout the United States and abroad by manufacturers\u2019 representatives who are permitted to carry complementary but not competitive lines of electronic equipment. The senior party has also exhibited its products at the Wescon Show annually since 1956 and at the IRE Show since 1959; and, in addition, it has promoted such goods by distributing catalogs and data sheets and by advertising in trade journals, including, \u2018Electronics, Design\u2019, \u2018Proceedings of the IRE\u2019, and \u2018Microwave Journal\u2019. The senior party\u2019s suppliers and customers have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>also referred to or pictured its products in their advertisements. The senior party\u2019s total advertising expenditures from 1957 through 1961 approximated one hundred and fifty thousand dollars.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b965-4\">From that evidence, the board concluded that the earliest date supported by the record for use of \u201cALFRED\u201d is December 5, 1949, which use was only as a trade name. The earliest trademark use of \u201cALFRED\u201d was found to be no earlier than the latter part of 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">More specifically, the board found that trademark use of \u201cALFORD\u201d resulted in July 1955 from Alford Manufacturing starting, at that time, to display \u201cALFORD\u201d on the nameplates for its goods in a style of lettering larger than the other portion of its trade name and in such a way as to create a separate and independent impression. In connection with that point, the board cited its previous decision in Lytle Engineering &amp; Mfg. Co., 125 U.S.P.Q. 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">Appellant questions that ruling, relying particularly on Minn. Mining &amp; Mfg. Co. v. Minn. Linseed Oil Paint Co., etc., 229 F.2d 448, 43 CCPA 746, and In re Hillerich &amp; Bradsby Co., 204 F.2d 287, 40 CCPA 990. However, the former case is readily distinguished from the present since it does not appear that \u201cMinnesota\u201d was accentuated in the corporate name therein. The Hillerich case is an <em>ex parte </em>one where the appellant sought registration of an oval in which the trademark \u201cLouisville Slugger\u201d was used and the registration was refused in the absence of proof that the public attached trademark meaning to the mere oval. The larger lettering and clear emphasis on \u201cALFORD\u201d in Alford Manufacturing\u2019s use since about July of 1955 appears to us to substantiate the board\u2019s conclusion that trademark use of the term commenced at about that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-7\">The board further noted the close similarity between \u201cALFRED\u201d and \u201cALFORD\u201d and the goods of the two parties and concluded that purchasers are likely to attribute \u201cALFRED\u201d and \u201cALFORD\u201d equipment to a common producer.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-9\">Alfred classifies the goods of Alford Manufacturing as constituting two different lines, designated as an \u201cAntenna Line (television broadcasting equipment)\u201d and a \u201cCoaxial Component Line (instruments and components).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b965-10\">It urges in particular that the antenna line, which was involved in Alford Manufacturing\u2019s earliest sales, so differs from Alfred\u2019s products as to make confusion unlikely. It also points to evidence that Alford Manufacturing selected certain sales representatives already handling Alfred\u2019s goods to carry what Alfred terms the coaxial component line and takes the position such evidence is entitled to great weight as an indication that confusion is improbable. Alfred further points to the record as showing that the average prices of products from Alford Manufacturing\u2019s antenna and coaxial component lines are $50,000 and $200, respectively, and its own products range from $1,000 to $9,000 with an average of about $2,000. It urges that those facts, along with the considerations that the goods are not competing and are purchased by discriminating engineers, demonstrate there is no likelihood of confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-11\">However, we think that, in view of the similarity in \u201cALFRED\u201d and \u201cALFORD\u201d and the obviously close relationship of Alfred\u2019s goods to both lines of Alford Manufacturing\u2019s product, the board\u2019s conclusion as to likelihood of confusion is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-12\">The board specifically concluded that, \u201csince the junior party [Alford] was the first to adopt its notation and has since continuously used it as the distinguishing feature of its trade name and/or as a trademark, the junior party possesses rights in \u2018ALFORD\u2019 superior to those which the senior party may assert in \u2018ALFRED.\u2019 \u201d It further considered it \u201cwell established that the use of a nota<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>tion as the salient feature of a trade name creates rights in the user sufficient to preclude the registration by a subsequent user of the same or a similar designation, whether or not the later party\u2019s use is that of a trademark,\u201d citing Section 2(d) <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the Trade-Mark Act and certain decisions<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of tribunals of the Patent Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">Alfred takes the position that use of a trade name which is inherently non-distinctive creates no rights in the user until it becomes distinctive. It further urges that Alford Manufacturing is not entitled to an award of priority here because \u201cALFORD,\u201d which is a surname is inherently nondistinctive, has not been shown to have acquired a secondary meaning prior to Alfred\u2019s entry into the field and because Alfred\u2019s entry in the field before such meaning was acquired precludes the term from subsequently acquiring such secondary meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">Under Section 2(d), a trademark is not entitled to registration where it so resembles a mark or <em>trade name </em>previously used by another as to be likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive. That section does not specify that a trade name must be inherently distinctive or that it must have acquired a secondary meaning to be effective as a bar to registration and we find no basis for adopting an interpretation imposing such a requirement. We therefore find no error in the board\u2019s ruling that Alford Manufacturing\u2019s prior use of \u201cALFORD\u201d in its trade name bars valid registration of \u201cALFRED.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b966-10\">Alfred\u2019s argument regarding absence of proof of secondary meaning of \u201cALFORD\u201d as a trademark raises the further question whether Alfred is entitled to an adjudication in this interference whether Alford Manufacturing has shown the secondary meaning necessary to entitle it to registration. The board pointed out that Trade-Mark Rule 2.96 in effect during the proceeding and at the time of final hearing therein read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b966-11\">\u201c* * * The issue in an interference between applications shall be the respective rights of the parties to registration [of the applications, on the basis of <em>priority of adoption and use.] </em>The issue in an interference between an application and a registration shall be the same, including, in the case of the registrant, the right to maintain the registration on the same basis, and if the final judgment is adverse to the registrant, the registration will be canceled unless good and sufficient reasons are presented for other action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b966-13\">(Emphasis provided by the board)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b966-14\">It ruled that in the absence of a pleading to enlarge the scope of the interference as permitted by Trade-Mark Rule 2.97,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the primary issue is which of the parties was the first to adopt and use its mark and that whether or not a particular designation, including a surname such as \u201cALFORD,\u201d has acquired a secondary meaning \u201cis of no moment herein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b966-15\">Not only did Alfred not act under Rule 2.97 to raise the issue whether Alford <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>Manufacturing is barred from obtaining registration for failure to show secondary meaning, but he additionally failed to move to dissolve the interference under Rule 2.94 <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> on the ground that Alford Manufacturing\u2019s mark is not registrable.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-4\">It seems to us that the language of Rule 2.96 as it read when applicable to the present proceedings does not require that the matter of secondary meaning of \u201cALFORD\u201d be considered in the absence of it being raised under the other rules. Neither do we regard such consideration to be required by the Lanham Act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We thus conclude there is no reversible error in the board\u2019s action declining to consider the question of secondary meaning for Alford under the present circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">Our conclusion, however, is not to be construed as ruling that \u201cALFORD\u201d has been shown to have acquired a secondary meaning entitling Alford Manufacturing to the registration sought here. Neither is it to be construed as barring the examiner from giving <em>ex parte </em>consideration to the question of secondary meaning or as barring Alfred from raising the question in any proceeding in which it might otherwise have the right to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">Since we find no reversible error in the board\u2019s decision, that decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b963-9\">. The board recommended that, should Alford Manufacturing ultimately prevail in the present interference, the Examiner of Trademarks require an amendment to the application of said party correcting the date of first use alleged and eliminating reference in the application to the use by Andrew Alford.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b966-6\">. Section 2 sets forth as a reason for refusing a mark that it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b966-7\">\u201c(cl) Consists of or comprises a mark which so resembles a mark registered in the Patent Office or a mark or trade name previously used in the United States by another and not abandoned, as to be likely, when applied to the goods of the applicant, to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive: * *</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b966-8\">.

There are also obvious differences. Like the marks VULCAN and VULKENE in the General Electric case, one mark, Alfred, is very common as a given name but Alford is relatively uncommon. It immediately strikes the consciousness as distinctly different for that very reason. Compare LUX and SHUX in Lever Brothers Co. v.
