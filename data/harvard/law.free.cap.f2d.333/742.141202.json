On appeal, petitioner insists that the Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent decision in Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963), requires a hearing <em>de novo </em>in the federal habeas court, and urges us to remand the case for this purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-17\">After examining the record, we have concluded that a federal hearing was not required-, and we affirm. As is customary with most contested proceedings, the evidence presented to the state court was not without its contradictions. Biit the state factual determination, made by Judge Joyce, was fully supported by the record as a whole. Thus, four contemporaneous writings\u2014 the back of the indictment, the district attorney\u2019s work sheet, the clerk\u2019s minutes, and a probation report \u2014 all indicated that Abair had, in fact, been assisted by court-appointed counsel. In short, the state\u2019s determination which we find reliable, was entered only after a full and fair hearing; Townsend requires no more. In the words of that opinion, when the District Court \u201cconcludes that the habeas applicant was afforded a full and fair hearing by the state court resulting in reliable findings, he may, and ordinarily should, accept the facts as found in the [state] hearing.\u201d 372 U.S. at 318, 83 S.Ct. at 760. Especially where, as here, the petitioner has failed to indicate that a federal hearing might develop material facts which were not revealed in the state proeeed-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>ings, the denial of an evidentiary hearing is plainly within the discretion of the District Judge. United States ex rel. McNerlin v. Denno, 324 F.2d 46 (2d Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b791-15\">. Abair was convicted in 1927 on a plea of guilty to robbery in the second degree, and in 1936, of attempting to carry a dangerous weapon after a prior conviction. These two felony convictions form the basis of Ms present third-offender sentence, imposed in 1954. If his challenge to the 1927 conviction were upheld, not only would that conviction be unavailable as a predicate for multiple felony offender treatment, but the 1936 weapons charge would be reduced to a misdemeanor. Abair might then be re-sentenced as a first felony offender on the 1954 robbery conviction, for which the maximum sentence is ten years.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
