However, the officials who have thus far considered their case do not have the legal authority to consider this problem. Our affirmance of the denial of the writ of habeas corpus does not prevent their making such representation thereabout hereafter as they may consider appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-17\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b356-13\">. If an entry had actually been made a different type of administrative proceeding would have been available to the aliens, since they would then be subject to \u201cexpulsion\u201d proceedings rather than \u201cexclusion\u201d proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
