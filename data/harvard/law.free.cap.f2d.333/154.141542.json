He sought recovery of $300,000 actual damages and $300,000 punitive damages for an alleged libel against him by defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-22\">The trial court granted defendants\u2019 motions to strike the complaint and dismiss the action and denied plaintiff\u2019s subsequent motion to vacate and set aside its order of dismissal. Plaintiff appeals from orders of the trial court dismissing the action and refusing to vacate and set aside the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-23\">Defendant Time, Incorporated owns and publishes a magazine of national circulation known as Sports Illustrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-24\">Defendant Marjorie Everett is alleged to be the chief stockholder and owner of a controlling interest in Chicago Thoroughbred Enterprizes, Inc., a corporation, which owns three race tracks in the Chicago, Illinois area, viz.: Arlington Park, Washington Park and Balmoral. She was said to wield great influence in racing circles in the United States and to have been the subject of frequent articles in newspapers and periodicals as an important influence in the sport of racing.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>In the August 20, 1962 issue of Sports Illustrated there appeared an article entitled \u201cThe Racing Lady of Chicago.\u201d This was a comprehensive report on Mrs. Everett\u2019s life and activities as the \u201cboss\u201d of three major Chicago race tracks. She was characterized as an aggressive and imaginative person who had become a controversial figure in the racing field.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">Th&amp; subtitle of the article reads: \u201cHer pace is furious and her manner brusque, but Marjorie Lindheimer Everett is bringing new vitality to her sport in the Midwest. She has spent millions to see that her patrons get the best, and now she offers the richest race of them all.\u201d Whitney Tower is the author of the article.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">The complaint quotes the following paragraph from such article:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-6\">\u201c \u2018The TRPB [Thoroughbred Racing Protective Bureau] says they keep gangster elements out of tracks,\u2019 says Mrs. Everett. \u2018Well, they don\u2019t.\u2019 She tells of once pointing out a big Chicago bookmaker to TRPB men who had overlooked him in her own Post and Paddock Club. She now has her own track police. This costs her $100,000 a year more than it used to, but it is claimed to be more effective. \u2018It better be!\u2019 says Mrs. Everett. <em>\u2018We\u2019ve thrown out dozens of undesirables,\u2019 </em>she adds, <em>\u2018including a bookmaking relative of mine who is racing right now in New Jersey.\u2019\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AcL\">Plaintiff rests his entire case on the single sentence, emphasized in the foregoing quotation, viz.: \u201c \u2018We\u2019ve thrown out dozens of undesirables,\u2019 she adds, \u2018including a bookmaking relative of mine who is racing right now in New Jersey.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Acu\">Plaintiff claims this statement is false and was known to be so when Mrs. Everett made it to the reporter for Sports Illustrated. He charges she made it \u201cwilfully and maliciously with the intent to damage and injure the person referred to, namely the plaintiff in this cause.\u201d He asserts he is thereby falsely charged with being a bookmaker.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">Plaintiff Budd Lepman is nowhere identified by name or picture within the entire article. He points to the foregoing excerpt as the sole reference to him therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">Plaintiff seeks to establish his identity with the foregoing statement through allegations in his complaint totally extrinsic to the article, that (1) his name is Budd Lepman; (2) he is Mrs. Everett\u2019s first cousin; (3) his occupation is training horses; (4) he was in New Jersey when the article appeared; (5) he was training horses in New Jersey at that time; and (6) he was the only relative of Mrs. Everett then \u201cengaged in racing\u201d in New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">The motions to dismiss were grounded on failure of the complaint to state a claim. They charged that the language complained of is not libelous <em>per se, </em>is not libelous <em>per quod, </em>is not of and concerning the plaintiff, is not defamatory in any sense whatsoever and that the complaint fails to plead special damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-12\">The primary issue before us is whether the assailed language in Sports Illustrated raises a submissible jury question as to whether it was \u201cof and concerning\u201d the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-13\">It is agreed by the parties that Illinois law governs here.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The result to be reached is controlled by the recent decision of the Supreme Court of Illinois filed January 23, 1962, reported as John v. Tribune Company, 24 Ill.2d 437, 181 N.E.2d 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-14\">In John, Chicago police raided a brothel in an apartment above the one in which plaintiff resided at the same address. Plaintiff\u2019s landlady and several other women were arrested and charged with immoral activities. Plaintiff was in no manner involved in the raid. In two news stories, The Tribune reported that a woman known by several aliases, including plaintiff\u2019s name, had been ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>rested in the raid by the vice squad in an apartment at plaintiff\u2019s address. Plaintiff\u2019s landlady was the only person identified in the articles. Her name was given as Dorothy Clark, alias Dolores Reising, Eve Spiro and Eve John. She was reported to be the friend of a gangster. Plaintiff\u2019s maiden name had been Eve Spiro and her name at the time was Eve John. She was the only person with such name at that address.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">The court held that \u201cwhether an article is susceptible of the construction for which a plaintiff claims is a question of law for the court, to be resolved by reading the offending language stripped of innuendo. * * * [Citing cases].\u201d 24 I11.2d at 440-441, 181 N.E.2d at 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">The court further held that the articles were capable of being read as \u201cof and concerning\u201d a woman other than plaintiff, and necessarily must be so read. 24 I11.2d at 441, 181 N.E.2d at 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">It was held in John, applying the \u201cinnocent construction rule\u201d to the subject language, that the publications were not libelous of plaintiff as a matter of law. \u201cThat rule holds that the article is to be read as a whole and the words given their' natural and obvious meaning, and requires that words allegedly libelous that are capable of being read innocently must be so read and declared nonactionable as a matter of law. * * * [Citing cases].\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 24 Ill.2d at 442, 181 N.E. 2d at 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">In Crosby v. Time, Incorporated, 7 Cir., 254 F.2d 927 (1958), relying upon Illinois law, we followed the general principles reestablished and made final in John. We noted with approval the statement of the Illinois innocent construction rule: \u201cThe language must receive an innocent construction when susceptible of such interpretation and cannot by innuendo be extended beyond a reasonable construction.\u201d 254 F.2d at 930. See Porcella v. Time, Inc., 7 Cir., 300 F.2d 162, 167 (1962) and Brewer v. Hearst Pub. Co., 7 Cir., 185 F.2d 846, 850 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">Plaintiff seeks to distinguish John, Crosby and other cases cited by defendants. We reject any such distinction. If there be any question as to the continuing vitality of these applicable general principles in Illinois, reference is made to the action of the Appellate Court of Illinois on May 6, 1964, in No. 49358, 199 N.E.2d 73, when it overruled its prior decision in Proesel v. Myers Publishing Company, 24 Ill.App.2d 501, 165 N.E.2d 352 (1960), one of the cases relied upon by plaintiff in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-12\">In the instant case, we find the article containing the assailed language is concerned solely with the racing background and activities of defendant Marjorie Everett. The allegedly libelous statement attributed to her was a passing comment concerning her activities in keeping bookmakers out of her race tracks in Chicago. Nowhere in the article is there any identification of plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-13\">As we said in Crosby, 254 F.2d at 929: \u201cOn the face of the article under attack, it is not discernible how the ordinary reader (we have read the article many times) would have any reason to believe that plaintiff had any part in the corrupt activities attributed to others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-14\">Applying the principles in John and Crosby, reaffirmed by us in Porcella, we hold the district court correctly ruled the charged defamatory statement not to be libelous. The district court did not err in striking the complaint as stating no cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-15\">Such being our conclusion, we deem it unnecessary to comment on the numerous libel cases called to our attention. Further, we do not reach the question whether the complaint fails to properly plead special damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-16\">We have considered plaintiff\u2019s procedural objections relating to the de-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>cisi\u00f3n of the case by the trial court before <em>defendants\u2019 </em>reply brief was filed and without hearing oral argument. We find them to be without merit. Further, plaintiff was not harmed by any denial of opportunity to amend his complaint. He made no timely request to do so and has never indicated the nature of any amendments he proposes to make.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">The judgment of the district court appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b203-7\">. See Wheeler v. Dell Publishing Co., 7 Cir., 300 F.2d 372, 375 (1962); Crosby v. Time, Incorporated, 7 Cir., 254 F.2d 927, 929 (1958).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b204-17\">. The court cites numerous Illinois cases and includes Crosby v. Time, Incorporated, 7 Cir., 254 F.2d 927 (1958) and Schy v. Hearst Pub. Co., 7 Cir., 205 F.2d 750 (1953).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
