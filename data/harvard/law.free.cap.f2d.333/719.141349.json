Fed.R.Civ.P. 56. The court granted the motion, rendered summary judgment for the defendants,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and held that the alleged active fraudulent concealment by the defendants of their acts of price discrimination did not suspend the running of the 4-year statute of limitations provided by Section 4B of the Clayton Act. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15b.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">The parties filed a written stipulation in which it was agreed that if active concealment by the defendants of the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action was not legally sufficient to suspend or toll the running of the 4-year statute of limitations as provided by the Act, the plaintiff\u2019s alleged cause of action would be considered to be barred in its entirety. It was further stipulated that the plaintiff was not making claim for injury or damage sustained during the 4-year period prior to the filing of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-11\"> This is a proper case for summary judgment. We disagree with the conclusion reached by the trial court. Subsequent to the submission of the case to the trial court, a number of decisions have been rendered with respect to the extensive litigation instituted as a result of criminal proceedings against a number of large electrical companies in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> These decisions leave no doubt that fraudulent concealment does toll the statute in question. On this day this Court has released its opinion in General Electric Company, et al. v. City of San Antonio, et al., 5 Cir., 334 F.2d 480, which is dispositive of this ease. The holding of the trial court is in conflict with our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-12\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b767-13\">. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-14\">\u201cAny person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor in any district court of the United States in the district in which the defendant resides or is found or has an agent, without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b767-15\">.
