The ultimate dehydrated form is the crystalline anhydrous alumina known as alpha-alumina. The alumina hydrates or \u2018precursors\u2019 of the aluminas are prepared by first forming an aqueous sol of hydrous alumina (aluminum hydroxide) from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>aluminum metal or a salt of aluminum. The sol is coagulated to precipitate from solution the hydroxide or hydrate in the form of a gel. Depending upon the conditions employed, alumina monohydrates or trihydrates may be formed in the gelatinous mass. The gel then may be dried and calcined at elevated temperature (800\u00b0 to 1000\u00b0F.) to obtain a highly porous adsorbent alumina of high surface area having value as a support in heterogeneous catalysis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-5\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-6\">\u201cEta-alumina was first so-named in an article published * * * in July of 1950 * * *. The article reviewed the thermal decomposition of four alumina hydrates, namely, alpha-alumina trihydrate (gibbsite), beta alumina trihydrate (bayerite), alpha-alumina monohydrate (boehm-ite) and beta-alumina monohyd-rate). <em>Eta-alumina appeared as a phase in the dehydration of the be-tatrihydrate.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-7\">\u201cThe authors described use of x-ray diffraction analysis to distinguish seven phase transformations [footnote omitted] in the thermal decomposition of these hydrates and thereby identify a series of distinct x-ray diffraction patterns [one of which is for eta-alumina] in the region which previously had been designated loosely as gamma-alumina.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">Appellant Standard\u2019s case for priority is predicated on activities of the inventor, Heard, in 1949-50 wherein Heard allegedly made catalysts of platinum on eta-alumina, although he did not at the time know or identify the alumina as <em>eta-type.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Such catalysts were used in pilot plant reforming processes and found to be effective. Standard asserts that notwithstanding the fact Heard did not know in 1949-50 that the alumina of his catalyst support was eia-alumina, this is not fatal to his ease since the support material he did make was reproducible and <em>in fact </em>contained eta-alumina, though such fact was established after Burton et al.\u2019s filing date.</p>\n<p id=\"ArP\">Appellees\u2019 position is that appellant\u2019s evidence of activity in 1949-50 fails to prove conception and reduction to practice since appellant never knew he had eia-alumina as catalyst support and, indeed, did not appreciate that he had a <em>new form </em>of alumina, by whatever name called. Further, appellees argue that tests made after appellees\u2019 filing date to establish the presence of eia-alumina in samples made in 1949-50 are of no moment since conception and reduction to practice cannot be established <em>nunc pro tunc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b289-15\">Before considering the merits of appellant\u2019s arguments regarding conception and reduction to practice, we are faced with a threshold issue of whether appellant\u2019s notebook records of 1949-50 are-admissible as evidence under the so-called \u201cdecedent\u2019s exception\u201d to the hearsay-rule. Heard died in 1957 before the-declaration of this interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-16\">Appellant argues that \u201ca long-established exception to the hearsay rule exists, in favor of the decedent Heard\u2019s records made in the course of business\u201d; that such exception is \u201cnot to be confused with the so-called \u2018shop book\u2019 rule.\u201d' Appellees contend there is no \u201cdecedent\u2019s, exception\u201d recognized in evidentiary in-, terf erence law; that appellant must comply with the usual requirements of corroboration notwithstanding the death of\" Heard; and that in any event appellant\u2019s, notebook records do not qualify as entries made \u201cin the course of business.\u201d We find it unnecessary to consider this, issue since, assuming arguendo all of appellant\u2019s evidence is admissible and probative, he cannot prevail for reasons-, hereinafter set out.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-17\">We turn to consideration of the chronology of events relied on by Standard to \u2022 establish Heard\u2019s conception and reduc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>tion to practice. Heard was working in 1949-50 on synthesizing platinum-alumina compositions with a view to finding improved catalysts for naphtha reforming. His work included making compositions by adding a solution of platinum compound to an alumina sol, drying the mixture and calcining the composite to form porous alumina mass on which platinum is finely distributed.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">While preparing catalyst of alumina and platinum by a method described in the prior art, Heard in 1949 accidently made what he described as \u201cammonia aged\u201d catalyst which was subsequently tested and found effective in reforming naphtha. Apparently such \u201cammonia aged\u201d catalyst contained eta-alumina, although Heard concededly did not know it at the time. In fact, there is nothing of record to indicate that Heard considered such catalyst to be anything other than what the prior art taught \u2014 gamma-alumina and platinum, even though it was considered an \u201ceffective catalyst.\u201d After several reforming runs on naphtha, the catalyst was stored in a locked cage along with spent catalysts.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">In 1954, almost 2 years after appellees\u2019 filing date, research personnel at Standard had reason to suspect that the \u201cammonia aged\u201d catalyst of 1949 contained eta-alumina. A sample was removed from storage, subjected to x-ray diffraction analysis, and the presence of eta-alumina was confirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">In 1950, Heard made other catalysts by \u201cammonia aging.\u201d The record shows that such catalysts, in the preparatory stage, contained beta trihydrate alumina (bayerite), a precursor of eta-alumina. Appellant alleges that upon calcination of bayerite, eta-alumina formed so that his 1950 catalysts <em>inherently </em>contained eta-alumina. As with the 1949 catalyst, the record shows that Heard was not aware that he had made a <em>new form </em>of alumina, much less eta-alumina, notwithstanding that the catalyst was analyzed for surface area, pore structure, and platinum and fluorine content. See footnote 1, supra. In reforming tests, the catalysts proved highly effective and were reported as \u201cone of the most active reforming catalysts prepared to date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">X-ray diffraction tests made in 1961, some 9 years after appellees\u2019 filing date, established that samples of the 1950 catalyst contained eta-alumina.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">Still other catalysts were made in 1950, some of which, on X-ray diffraction analysis after appellees\u2019 filing date, were found to contain eta-alumina. But in no instance did Heard appreciate in 1950 that his catalysts contained a new form of alumina. In fact one witness, Dr. Ehrhardt, pointed out, as the board noted, that \u201cin the period 1949 to 1951, <em>no attempt was made to distinguish the different forms of alumina which were reported as gamma </em>* * *; that the X-ray procedures in this period were <em>not adapted to detect eta-alumina </em>* * (Emphasis ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">Based on Heard\u2019s 1949-50 activities the board concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-12\">\u201cTo prove conception, Heard must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he was in possession of the invention of the count prior to his opponent\u2019s record date. This means that Heard must satisfactorily prove that he was in possession of the eta-alumina limitation of the count, inter alia, prior to Burton <em>et al\u2019s </em>record date. As pointed out above, the eta-alumina limitation of the count is its vitalizing feature and cannot be disregarded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-13\">\u201cThe record, as briefly reviewed above, makes it abundantly clear that not only Heard but also no one else in Standard\u2019s employ knew, prior to Burton <em>et al\u2019s. </em>record date, that the above mentioned \u201cammonia-aged\u201d catalysts contained eta-alumina. Since Heard did not know or realize until late 1953, long after Burton <em>et al\u2019s. </em>filing date, that eta-alumina was necessary to carry out the process of the count, he did not have a prior conception of the invention herein and this is fatal to his case for priority; Jacobs et al. v. Buxton, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>30 CCPA 987, 135 F.2d 237, 553 OG 178, 57 USPQ 302.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-5\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-6\">\u201cIn the instant case, in 1949-1950, there was no identification of eta-alumina in the catalysts but only gamma-alumina or Boehmite or Bay-erite. Eta-alumina in the catalysts was not known to Heard and his associates until long after Burton <em>et al\u2019s. </em>filing date. This knowledge came too late.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-8\">\u201cCounsel for Heard contends that since eta-alumina was not known until the article * * * [of July, 1950] appeared, that excuses the lack of analysis for eta-alumina. The argument falls of its own weight since such an analysis could have been made anytime prior to Burton <em>et al\u2019s. </em>filing date. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-9\">\u201cTo summarize at this point, the foregoing discussion amply and clearly demonstrates that Heard had no conception of the invention of the count prior to Burton <em>et al\u2019s </em>record date. On this ground alone Heard cannot prevail in this proceeding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">Appellant argues that the board erred in requiring that for conception Heard must have known his catalyst contained, <em>by name, </em>eta-alumina; that Heard had in fact a \u201ccomplete concept * * * of an effective operative means, namely, an ammonia-aged alumina * * * which he found had beneficial value as a support for platinum in naphtha reforming\u201d; that \u201cThe only thing lacking was mere \u2018name\u2019 \u201d; and that \u201cthe skilled in the art would have had no difficulty in recognizing the identity of the catalyst made by Heard through the method by which it was prepared.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-11\">Notwithstanding appellant\u2019s arguments, we sustain the board since we are not convinced Heard had such a \u201cdefinite and permanent idea of the complete and operative invention\u201d (see Townsend v. Smith, 36 F.2d 292, 17 CCPA 647), as to constitute conception within the meaning of the patent law. We agree with appel-lees\u2019 statement in their brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-12\">\u201cFor appellant to show that he had an invention in 1950, it must be proved that Dr. Heard knew (i) he had a <em>better </em>catalyst carrier than gamma alumina, (ii) the improved catalyst carrier contained a crystalline form of alumina <em>different from gamma alumina, </em>and (iii) it was the other crystalline species (whether alone or mixed with gamma) which was <em>responsible for the improvement </em>he claimed to have found.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-13\">We agree with appellant that it is irrelevant that Heard never referred to or appreciated the support material to be <em>eta-alumina, </em>or to contain eto-alumina <em>by that name. </em>Nor do we interpret the board\u2019s opinion as so requiring. However, we consider it fatal to appellant\u2019s case that not until after appellees' filing date did Heard recognize that his \u201cammonia-aged\u201d catalyst, as appellees put it, <em>\u201ccontained any different form of alumina at all l\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b291-14\">We point out, as does appellees\u2019 brief, that the count calls for a <em>particular </em>form of alumina and we think that appellant\u2019s failure to recognize that he had produced a new form, regardless of what he called it, is indicative that he never conceived the invention prior to appellees\u2019 filing date.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-15\">It is not enough that, viewed after the fact, appellant\u2019s catalyst compositions were \u201creproducible.\u201d Appellant never appreciated what he had, viz., a new form of alumina, a conclusion bolstered by the fact that appellant relegated the spent catalysts to storage cages where they would no doubt have remained but for Standard\u2019s renewed interest after appel-lees\u2019 filing date.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-16\">We agree with appellees that this case is controlled by the precedents holding <em>nunc pro tunc </em>reduction to practice to be defective. As appellees say in their brief, \u201cThe <em>nunc pro tunc </em>reduction to practice doctrine is such a well established part of our patent law as to require no citation of authority. * * * This doctrine is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>controlling here. In the present case it is the <em>recognition </em>and <em>appreciation </em>of the invention which was lacking to Dr. Heard prior to April 23, 1952 [appellees\u2019 filing date], and which Heard attempts now to provide by his later tests and acts after that date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">To sum up: appellant has proved neither conception nor reduction to practice prior to appellees\u2019 filing date. Priority was properly awarded to appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b289-9\">. It appears from the record that the only way eta-alumina is identifiable, is by its x-ray diffraction pattern.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
