This suit was brought by the plaintiff-buyer against the defendant-seller for damages arising out of breach of those contracts; and the defendant counterclaimed for an unpaid balance on the purchase price. The court below gave judgment for the plaintiff on its claim in the amount of $3,936.34 and dismissed the counterclaim. The defendant appeals from both parts of the judgment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-16\">The issue before us arises out of the defendant\u2019s claimed error in the trial court\u2019s award of $3,936.34 to the plaintiff as damages representing what the plaintiff had to pay over and above the contract price to put the machines in working order. One of the machines, the tooling apparatus, tardily delivered by the defendant, was defective and did not conform to the specifications of the contracts; the plaintiff had the machines put in operational condition by a third party, Combined Welder &amp; Machine Corp. The purchase price of the machines was $14,747. The plaintiff made down payments to the defendant in the amount of $9,100 and had to pay $9,583.34 to Combined Welder &amp; Machine Corp. to have the machines made workable. Thus the plaintiff paid $3,936.34 in excess of the purchase price for properly operational machines. The defendant contends, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>ever, that a limitation of liability clause<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> contained in the contracts afforded the plaintiff the sole remedy of returning the machines for a refund of the purchase price and that, since the plaintiff kept the machines, it waived the breach and now owes the unpaid balance of the purchase price.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">The court below discussed waiver but confined its consideration almost entirely to waiver of the limitation on consequential damages in connection with its dismissal of the plaintiff\u2019s claim for lost profits and expenses. The plaintiff claimed $20,202.31 as damages incurred when it had to purchase in the open market reinforcing material at a cost greater than the cost at which the machines, promptly delivered and in good operating condition, could have manufactured it. The court below held that these damages were \u201cconsequential damages\u201d as contemplated by the limitation of liability clause. It also held that the defendant had not waived, either expressly or impliedly, that portion of the limitation clause which barred such consequential damages and therefore, dismissed the claim. This part of the trial court\u2019s ruling has not been appealed, and we mention it here only because of our affirmance of the judgment below which, in effect, concludes that by their conduct the parties altered their relative rights and duties under other portions of the limitation of liability clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-11\">By the terms of the contract the defendant had agreed to deliver the two machines by the end of June, 1957. The welder was delivered August 2,1957, but, by itself, was useless and constituted only half of the machinery necessary to do the job; the tooling apparatus, being manufactured by a sub-contractor, Imag-ineering Unlimited, Inc., in New Jersey, and not yet delivered, was the other half. The defendant was plainly in default under the terms of the agreement relating to delivery, and consequently the plaintiff could have insisted on its accepting return of the welder and refunding all payments. On September 24, 1957 the plaintiff sent the defendant a telegram <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> offering to return the welder and accept a refund of the portion paid on the purchase price or take delivery of the tooling apparatus.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-12\">The trial court said of this proposal: \u201cWhat plaintiff at first demanded by its nite letter, dated September 24, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>1957, in which plaintiff expressed its dissatisfaction with the delivery of the tooling apparatus was in accord with the provisions of the contracts and defendant should then have accepted plaintiff\u2019s offer to return the tooling apparatus and welder and should have refunded to plaintiff the $9,100 plaintiff had paid on account of their purchase price.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">But the defendant declined to make the refund required by the contract and, though still in default, took up plaintiff\u2019s alternative proposal which we read as being that defendant have its New York City representative see to it that the tooling equipment was promptly secured from New Jersey and be made operational at plaintiff\u2019s plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">When the tooling equipment was finally delivered by Imagineering Unlimited on October 11, 1957, at the plaintiff\u2019s plant, it proved to be defective and unable to perform the work for which it was designed. The defendant sent its engineers and new parts and over a period of weeks tried to make it operate satisfactorily but could not do so. The court below concluded that the equipment was too light and \u201cunsuitable for the heavy work it was intended to do.\u201d The plaintiff gave the defendant more than a reasonable period of time within which to effect the repairs and make the equipment work. On January 10,1958, the plaintiff notified the defendant that it could give the defendant no longer than February 1, 1958 to put the equipment in operating order. The defendant did not do so, but on February 6th demanded that the plaintiff return the equipment to the defendant\u2019s Chicago plant so that the defendant could work on it further. After having warned the defendant on February 9th that it intended to do so, the plaintiff, on February 13, 1958, contracted with a third party, Combined Welder and Machine Corp., to make the necessary repairs to the equipment. The cost of these repairs added to the payments made by the plaintiff to the defendant on account of the purchase price exceeded the purchase price by $3,936.34, which is a proper measure of the damage and is the amount awarded the plaintiff in the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">The defendant on this appeal asserts that there was no basis on which the trial court could award any damages to the plaintiff because there had at no time taken place any change in the relative rights and duties of the parties under the limitation of liability clause of the contract. This is another way of claiming that, in spite of the defendant\u2019s breach of the contract, the plaintiff on September 24, 1957 gave the defendant indefinite additional time, extended to upwards of four months, to try to make the equipment operational, that the plaintiff got nothing in return for this but continued bound by all of its duties under the contract with its rights to recover for the breach still restricted by the limitation of liability clause, so that at a time eight months after the contract was originally to have been performed by the defendant, and still not performed, plaintiff was required to give defendant a still further opportunity to fix the equipment, sending it to Chicago at plaintiff\u2019s own expense and, if that failed, to get a refund. On the other hand, if the plaintiff retained the equipment, as it did, the defendant, as a seller in serious default, both as to the time of delivery and as to the quality of the goods, would have nevertheless recovered one hundred per cent of the purchase price of $14,747, although the buyer had been obliged to spend more than one-half that amount, $9,583.34, \u2014 which has never been claimed to be excessive \u2014 to make the equipment work.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">The trial court did not find that the plaintiff was under any such duty or restricted to such limited recovery but, on the contrary, ruled that the plaintiff had the right to have the equipment made operational by a third party and to recover ordinary damages from the defendant. It held that, while the defendant had not waived the limitation of liability for consequential damages, and the very arrangement by which the defendant was afforded the time by the plaintiff to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>tinue to work on the equipment from October 11,1957 to early February, 1958, prevented the accrual of consequential damage, the plaintiff could recover ordinary damage measured by such excess of its cost of repair; and that it was not limited to giving the defendant, now eight months in default in its obligation to furnish workable equipment, a chance to do still further work in Chicago, and, if this should prove ineffective, to obtain a refund. This is a just and fair conclusion in the circumstances of the case. The conduct of the parties from September 24, 1957, when the plaintiff sent its telegram to the defendant, through January, 1958, demonstrates that the terms of the limitation of liability clause as originally framed to cover ordinary damages, were no longer applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">After the defendant refused on September 24, 1957 to follow the breach of warranty provisions of the agreement, the parties embarked on a post-default course not specifically covered by the contract: the equipment remained at plaintiff\u2019s plant and the defendant was afforded an extended opportunity to repair it there with no duty on the part of the plaintiff to return it to Chicago. By its judgment the lower court concluded that when the defendant again defaulted in early February, 1958, the defendant could not invoke the limitation of liability clause, as it applied to ordinary damages, and that the plaintiff could contract with a third person for the repairs and hold the defendant liable for the excess of their cost over the purchase price.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">Indeed, defendant\u2019s own conduct in February, 1958, shows it was not relying on the limitation of liability clause. The ninety days had expired in mid-January and if defendant thought the clause still applicable it had only to stand upon that portion which provided \u201cthe Company\u2019s warranty herein expressed shall, in all events, expire ninety days after shipment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\"> Although, following September 24, 1957, the parties entered into no formal agreement, their conduct from then to February, 1958, shows that in return for the plaintiff\u2019s forbearing to exercise its rights upon the default by the defendant and for giving the defendant additional time to make repairs, the defendant gave up its right to insist on the clause relating to the return of the tooling equipment to Chicago. These were ample considerations for the modification of the written contract. See Corbin on Contracts, \u00a7 139; In Re Stafford\u2019s Estate, 264 App.Div. 774, 34 N.Y.S.2d 946 (App.Div.2d Dept.1942), aff\u2019d 289 N.Y. 790, 47 N.E.2d 47, (1943) ; and In Re All Star Feature Corp., 232 F. 1004 (D.C. S.D.N.Y.1916). Moreover, by the first of February, 1958, the course of conduct, which constituted a modification of the written contract, was fully executed so that the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover is not barred by \u00a7 33-c of the Personal Property Law of the State of New York, McKinney\u2019s Consol.Laws, c. 41 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which prohibits the change of a written agreement by an oral executory agreement, where the written agreement contains a provision against oral change- \u2014 even if we should assume that the provision here related to anything more than oral changes prior to the formation of a contract. Einzig v. Aulisio, 286 App.Div. 1127, 146 N.Y.S.2d 410 (3rd Dept.1955) ; Alcon v. Kinton Realty, 2 A.D.2d 454, 156 N.Y.

That issue is not before this court and we are not called upon to say <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>anything about the correctness or incorrectness of that ruling, but what the trial court had to say in support of the position it took in denying consequential damages is not a reason for finding that it was in error in granting the plaintiff ordinary damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">After the defendant defaulted a second time the plaintiff had the right to have the necessary repairs made by a third party and to invoke that portion of the New York Personal Property Law, \u00a7 150, subd. 1(b), which allows a buyer, at his election, to \u201caccept or keep the goods and maintain an action against the seller for breach of warranty.\u201d Prygelski v.

The following limitation of liability clause was contained in both the contracts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\">\u201cFor a period of ninety days from the time of shipment of each item of the equipment, the Company warrants that such item shall be of the kind and quality described in the specifications and shall be suitable for performing the work therein described.

If a substantial defect is established which the Company is unable to correct after it has been given an opportunity to do so, the Company will, upon the Purchaser\u2019s request and upon return of the equipment f. o. b. the Company\u2019s plant, Chicago, Illinois, refund tbe price to tbe Purchaser. . . .

The Section, 33-e(l) of the Personal Property Law, has been redesignated as \u00a7 15-301(1) of the General Obligations Law, effective September 27, 1964.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b58-6\">HAYS, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A_Y\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">In dashing to the rescue of the plaintiff corporation as if it were a maiden in distress the majority has trampled on the facts as found by the lower court and on some well established propositions of law. The majority opinion absolves the plaintiff from a clause providing for limitation of liability which plaintiff accepted in a signed contract. And this in a situation involving two corporations dealing with each other at arm\u2019s length where there is no reason to believe that either of the parties had any particular advantage in bargaining. Far from being a case demanding a sympathetic effort to correct an inequity born of unequal bargaining power, the widowed mother and the slick book salesman, or the simple farmer buying the lightning rods, this is the case of a corporation with a plant in New York and a subsidiary in Alabama ordering to its own specifications a machine to be made especially for its use and costing nearly $15,000. Surely parties who are so evenly matched can be left to make their own contracts without the help of the judges of the Second Circuit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b58-14\">There is no public policy either national or state against the inclusion in a contract of a clause limiting liability. There is nothing shocking or outrageous about the clause to which the plaintiff agreed in the present case. A manufacturer making a machine for a special purpose to a buyer\u2019s specifications may quite properly believe that he requires protection against unforeseen aspects of possible liability. There is nothing in the law as it has been applied in the past which would prevent such a manufacturer from limiting liability to return of the purchase price.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-15\">The majority attempts to extricate the plaintiff from the position into which it got itself by making a new finding of oral modification. On September 24, 1957, when delivery was already long overdue, the plaintiff telegraphed to the defendant saying, in effect, \u201cEither deliver my tooling machine or I\u2019ll send back the welder and get my money back.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant replied by saying it would expedite delivery of the tooling machine. It is in this exchange that the majority professes to find a modification of the original signed contract, although obviously all that happened was that defendant asked plaintiff to waive for the time being its right to return the welding machine and get its money back. And this is exactly what plaintiff did.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-16\">To make out an oral modification of the written agreement the majority finds that there was an exchange of promises by the parties. In the first place, says the majority, the plaintiff\u2019s telegram was an offer of a promise to forbear returning the welding machine if the defendant would promptly deliver the tooling ma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>chine and make it operational at plaintiff\u2019s plant. Not only is this analysis of plaintiff\u2019s telegram the most transparent fiction but of course if the plaintiff\u2019s \u201coffer\u201d were accepted according to its own terms, plaintiff\u2019s promise would be unenforceable because the defendant would not be required to do anything he was not already under an obligation to do. Ripley v. International Rys. of Cent. America, 8 N.Y.2d 430, 441, 209 N.Y.S.2d 289, 295, 171 N.E.2d 443, 447 (1960); Pershall v. Elliott, 249 N.Y. 183, 163 N.E. 544 (1928); 1 Williston, Contracts \u00a7 142 (Jaeger 3d ed. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">The chief objection to the oral modification theory is that the exchange of promises never occurred in fact. The plaintiff\u2019s telegram was not a promise or even an offer. There is not the slightest ground for stating that defendant ever promised to repair the tooling machine at plaintiff\u2019s plant. Indeed plaintiff never made any claim of such a promise in its complaint, in its testimony, as that testimony is reflected in the court\u2019s opinion, or in its brief. The promise which plaintiff claimed it relied on was that: \u201c[defendant] would expedite delivery of the tooling equipment and apparatus, and that it would have the said equipment completed and functioning at the plaintiff\u2019s place of business within a reasonable time thereafter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-13\">Even as to this promise, which would be clearly insufficient to support a coun-terpromise to refrain from resorting to the remedy provided by the contract, the lower court found as a fact that, if made at all,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it was made by a representative of defendant who \u201chad no authority to amend the contract or any of the provisions of the conditions of sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-14\">The \u201cconditions of sale\u201d in the contract provide that: \u201cNo change in or deviation from the terms, provisions or conditions of this quotation shall have any effect unless such change or deviation shall have been approved in writing by an officer of the Company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-15\">The trial court found that: \u201cNo written approval by any officer of defendant was given for any such change.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-16\">Section 15-301, subdivision 1, of the New York General Obligations Law, McKinney\u2019s Consol.Law, c. 24-A provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-17\">\u201cA written agreement or other written instrument which contains a provision to the effect that it can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>not be changed orally, cannot be changed by an executory agreement unless such executory agreement is in writing and signed by the party against whom enforcement of the change is sought or by his agent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">The case against an oral modification which had the effect of eliminating the limitation on liability is, then, in summary:</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">(1) There is nothing whatever to support the majority\u2019s conclusion that the defendant made an enforceable promise which would constitute a modification of the written contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">! (2) If any promise at all was made it was made by a representative of defendant who was not authorized to agree to any modification of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">(3) In any event an oral modification of the agreement would have been wholly without effect under the New York statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">This court should reverse the decision below and order the entry of judgment for the defendant on both plaintiff\u2019s claim and defendant\u2019s counterclaim.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b58-8\">. The fact that a later letter from plaintiff to defendant, referring to the contract, was apparently, according to the trial court, \u201ceither dictated or approved\u201d by plaintiff\u2019s attorney may suggest a further reason wby plaintiff does not need the protection of this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b58-19\">. For the exact text of the telegram, see footnote 2 to the majority opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b59-6\">. The trial court found that even if there was such an agreement as plaintiff alleged, it constituted no waiver either express or implied of \u201cany of the printed conditions of sale.\u201d In the light of this conclusion the court did not consider it necessary to make a definitive finding as to whether there was, in fact, such an agreement. The court does say, however:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHe\">\u201cThe alleged waiver is not mentioned in any of the written communications from plaintiff to defendant. The McQuil-lan letter of January 10, 1958 (Ex. 35) does not mention any waiver of any of the conditions of sale. It does not allege any new agreement.\u201d * 3: * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-8\">\u201cNor was there any mention of any alleged new agreement or of any waiver of the conditions of sale, in Exhibit 39, plaintiff\u2019s letter of February 4, 1958. If there had been any new agreement between the parties involving any waiver by defendant of the conditions of sale it would have been mentioned. Apparently plaintiff\u2019s attorney either dictated or approved that letter before it was sent. A line at the end of the letter would so indicate. The only contracts mentioned in the letter dated February 4, 1958 (Ex. 39) are those based on defendant\u2019s quotations and plaintiff\u2019s orders of January 1957. No new contract is claimed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-19\">This language is equivalent to a finding of fact that there was no such agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-20\">The existence of such an agreement was a factual question depending on the statements and representations of the parties in their conversations and written correspondence. Judge Eeibell\u2019s opinion states that the testimony was in conflict:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ5\">\u201cThe alleged agreement set forth in paragraph Tenth of the amended complaint according to plaintiff\u2019s contention was made by defendant\u2019s Mr. Spolian-sky, in a telephone conversation between him and plaintiff\u2019s Mr. McQuil-lan. Defendant denies that any such agreement was made * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-21\">The majority has no ground whatsoever for disregarding the trial court\u2019s findings and making new findings on this issue.
