After considering the present motion on its merits, the court determined that the defendant was entitled to no relief under either Rule 35 or 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 and denied the motion, This appeal followed,</p>\n<p id=\"AI4\">Defendant, represented by counsel of his own choosing, entered a voluntary piea of guilty to counts two to seveil) inclusive, of an indictment against him. Count one was dismissed. His plea of guilty was accepted by the court. On May 2o, 1955, defendant was sentenced to a term of five years upon each of the six counts upon which he stood convicted, the sentences to run consecutively. He took no appeal. Defendant here makes no at-ta&lt;* upon f118 conviction and sentence with respect to counts four and seven of the indictment and hence no discussion of suc coun 8 18 re&lt;luired-</p>\n<p id=\"A25\">Defendant attacks his conviction on counts three and six, which charged sales of narcotics in violation of 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4705(a), upon the grounds that such counts are fatally defective in that they failed to name the purchaser of the narcotics. Section 4705(a) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Alb\">\u201cGeneral requirement. \u2014 It shall be unlawful for any person to sell, barter, exchange, or give away narcotic d\u2122FS except in pursuance of a written order of the person to whom such article is sold, bartered, ex-,____, . . ! , changed, or given, on a form to be . ,, , , issued m blank for that purpose by the Secretary or his dele2'ate-\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUhh\">We have repeatedly held that the failure to name the purchaser of narcotics in an indictment is not a fatal defect vulnerable to a \u00a7 2255 attack. Taylor v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>United States, 8 Cir., 332 F.2d 918; Adams v. United States, 8 Cir., 333 F.2d 766; Jackson v. United States, 8 Cir., 325 F.2d 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">Defendant further contends that counts three and six are fatally defective in that they fail to state after the word \u201cSecretary\u201d the additional words of the statute above quoted \u201cor his delegate.\u201d The trial court rejected such contention, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-5\">\u201cThe failure to include \u2018or his delegate\u2019 is not fatal. The elements of the offense are set out in the indictment and the failure to include \u2018or his delegate\u2019 where it is set out that the sale was not made in pursuance of a written order on the form provided by the Secretary of the Treasury does not render the indictment defective.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">We fully agree. Any form issued by an authorized delegate of the Seer\u00e9tary of the Treasury could properly be considered a form used by the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">With respect to counts two and five, the defendant contends such counts are fatally defective because they contain no allegation that the drugs were illegally imported into the United States. Each of said counts charges that the defendant did \u201cunlawfully, wilfully, knowingly and fraudulently facilitate the transportation, concealment and sale of a narcotic drug [drug described], knowing the same to have been imported into the United States of America contrary to law, in violation of Section 174, Title 21, United States Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">We agree with the trial court\u2019s \u25a0determination that the indictment adequately charges the drugs were illegally imported. In United States v. Glass, 7 Cir., 277 F.2d 566, 568, an indictment .substantially similar to the one before us is set out. The court, in rejecting \u25a0defendant\u2019s contention that the indictment failed to charge unlawful transportation, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-9\">\u201cAs the Court said in Brown v. United States, 9 Cir., 1955, 222 F.2d 293, 296:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-10\">\u201c \u2018In logic it would appear that if defendants knew the drugs were imported contrary to law, the fact that they actually were imported contrary to law is inherent therein.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b816-11\">The trial court properly denied defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"ArTQ\">. Defendant\u2019s motion asserts that it is filed pursuant to Rule 35, Fed.R.Crim.P. There is no question but what the sentence imposed is valid if the conviction is valid. Rule 35 does not apply. The court by treating the motion as a \u00a7 2255 motion reached defendant\u2019s contentions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AqYA\">.
