They were convicted and sentenced to die. Mitchell County is a small county in rural Georgia.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> No Negro has ever served on a grand jury or on a petit jury in Mitchell County. The attorneys for the petitioners were fully aware of this fact. They were also fully aware of the hostility that an attack on the all-white jury system would generate in a community already stirred up over the killing. Without consulting the defendants, the attorneys decided not to object, in the trial or on appeal, to the systematic exclusion of Negroes from either jury. Later, in this habeas corpus proceeding, the federal district court held that the attorneys\u2019 non-assertion in the state court of a timely objection to the composition of the juries was an effectual waiver of that objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-12\">Many constitutional rights may be waived. And, in the interests of legal economy and the integrity of orderly procedure in state courts, a defendant\u2019s non-assertion of certain constitutional rights before a trial or in the early stages of a trial has been treated as a \u201cwaiver\u201d of those rights. This handy rule applies, for example, to the right to be tried by a jury or the right to counsel. It does not fit this case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-13\">The core of this ease is the lack of remedy in the state courts. The petitioners and their attorneys had no desire to give up their right to be tried by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>jury chosen without regard to the race of the jurors. It was not to their interest to do so \u2014 except as a choice of evils. A choice of evils was indeed the only state remedy open to them. The petitioners could choose to be prejudiced by the hostility an attack on the all-white jury system would stir up. Or they could choose to be prejudiced by being deprived of a trial by a jury of their peers selected impartially from a cross-section of the community. This is the \u201cgrisly\u201d,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> hard, Hobson\u2019s choice the State puts to Negro defendants when it systematically excludes Negroes from juries; white defendants are not subjected to this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The constitutional vice is not just the exclusion of Negroes from juries.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is also the State\u2019s requiring Negro defendants to choose between an unfairly constituted jury and a prejudiced jury. We hold that this discrimination violates both the equal protection and the due process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">Simplifying the facts, the homicide occurred November 15, 1959, when Leon Davis, one of the petitioners, killed a respected white farmer after an altercation between the two precipitated by each causing his automobile to bump into-the other\u2019s automobile. Phil Whitus and two other Negroes were in Davis\u2019s automobile and were at the scene of the killing. All four were indicted for murder. The attorneys for the defendants decided against requesting a change of venue.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> January 13, 1960, the jury found Davis and Whitus guilty as charged.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Under Georgia law, since the jury withheld a recommendation of mercy, the verdict carried the sentence of death by electrocution.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-15\">The petitioners filed unsuccessful motions for new trials, appeals to the Supreme Court of Georgia, and petitions for certiorari to the United States Supreme-Court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Davis contended that the trial court erred in admitting in evidence an allegedly coerced confession and in making an erroneous charge to the jury on insanity. Whitus contended that he did not participate in the killing in any way; that there was no conspiracy to commit any crime; and that whatever assistance he gave to Davis he gave unwillingly at. the point of Davis\u2019s gun. In the state court proceedings petitioners did not. refer to the composition of the juries, except for a vague allusion in the petition for certiorari to the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"ASUg\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>The attorneys first presented the issue now before this Court in a petition for habeas corpus in the United States District Court. That court denied the petition on the ground, among others, that a state remedy through habeas corpus was still available. We affirmed. Whitus v. Balkcom, 5 Cir. 1962, 299 F.2d 844. The Supreme Court, <em>per curiam, </em>vacated the judgment and remanded the case. Whitus v. Balkcom, 1962, 370 U.S. 728, 82 S.Ct. 1575, 8 L.Ed.2d 803. Again the district court dismissed the petition.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The petitioners are before us on their appeal from that order of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">The factual question of the existence of the custom of systematic exclusion of Negroes from the Mitchell County juries is not at issue. The appellee relies solely on the doctrine of waiver. The appellee\u2019s brief states: \u201cRather than argue the substantive issue of systematic exclusion of Negroes from the juries of Mitchell County and thereby attempt to overcome this Court\u2019s decision in United States ex rel. Seals v. Wiman, 5 Cir. 1962, 304 F.2d 53, cert. den\u2019d, 1963, 372 U.S. 924, 83 S.Ct. 741, 9 L.Ed.2d 729, appellee will admit for the purposes of this Appeal that the present case is adversely covered by such decision.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The classic, Johnson v. Zerbst definition of waiver is \u201can intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.\u201d <footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The general principles governing \u201cwaiver\u201d of constitutional rights, as that doctrine is applied in federal habeas corpus post-conviction proceedings, are succinctly stated in Mr. Justice Frankfurter\u2019s separate opinion in Brown v. Allen, 1953, 344 U.S. 443, 503, 73 S.Ct. 397, 444, 97 L.Ed. 469:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-11\">\u201cOf course, nothing we have said suggests that the federal habeas corpus jurisdiction can displace a State\u2019s procedural rule requiring that certain errors be raised on appeal. Normally rights under the Federal Constitution may be waived at the trial, and may likewise be waived by failure to assert such errors on appeal. When a State insists that a defendant be held to his choice of trial strategy and not be allowed to try a different tack on State habeas corpus, he may be deemed to have waived his claim and thus have no right to assert on federal habeas corpus. Such considerations of orderly appellate procedure give rise to the conventional statement that habeas corpus should not do service for an appeal. <em>However, this does not touch one of those extraordinary cases in which a substantial claim goes to the very foundation of a proceeding.\u201d </em>(Citations omitted. Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-12\">The Supreme Court has recently expressed itself on the subject of waiver in Fay v. Noia, 1963, 372 U.S. 391, 83 S.Ct. 822, 9 L.Ed.2d 837, a case pertinent here on the facts. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-13\">\u201cIf a habeas applicant, after consultation with competent counsel or otherwise, understandingly and knowingly forewent the privilege of seeking to vindicate his federal claims in the state courts, whether for strategic, tactical, or any other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>reasons that can fairly be described as the deliberate by-passing of state procedures, then it is open to the federal court on habeas to deny him all relief * * *. At all events we wish it clearly understood that the standard here put forth depends on the considered choice of the petitioner. Cf. Carnley v. Cochran, 369 U.S. 506, 513-517 [82 S.Ct. 884, 8 L.Ed. 2d 70]; Moore v. Michigan, 355 U.S. 155, 162-165 [78 S.Ct. 191, 2 L.Ed.2d 167]. <em>A choice made by counsel not participated in by the petitioner does not automatically bar relief. </em>Nor does a state court\u2019s finding of waiver bar independent determination of the question by the federal courts on habeas, for waiver affecting federal rights is a federal question. E. g., Rice v. Olson, 324 U.S. 786 [65 S.Ct. 989, 89 L.Ed. 1367.]\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">In addition to its holding on waiver,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Fay v. Noia makes it clear that to invoke the Great Writ a petitioner need exhaust only the state remedies available to him <em>at the time he files his petition-</em>As to the applicability of the doctrine of \u201can adequate and independent state law ground\u201d, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-7\">\u201c[T]he doctrine under which state procedural defaults are held to constitute an adequate and independent state law ground barring direct Supreme Court review is not to be extended to limit the power granted the federal courts under the federal habeas statute.\u201d 372 U.S. at 399, 83 S.Ct. at 827.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-15\">Two recent decisions of this Court deal with waiver in systematic exclusion cases: United States ex rel. Goldsby v. Harpole, 5 Cir. 1959, 263 F.2d 71, cert. den\u2019d 1959, 361 U.S. 838, 80 S.Ct. 58, 4 L.Ed.2d 78 and United States ex rel. Seals v. Wiman, 5 Cir. 1962, 304 F.2d 53, cert. den\u2019d 1963, 372 U.S. 924, 83 S.Ct. 741, 9 L.Ed.2d 729. Judge Rives was the author of both opinions; the author of this opinion was on both panels. In each ease the attorneys for the Negro defendant did not make a timely objection to the composition of the jury. In spite of this non-compliance with the state rule requiring such an objection to be made in the early stages of a trial,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> this Court held that there was no waiver. In Goldsby \u201cwe held that the conduct of Goldsby\u2019s counsel without consultation with his client did not bind Goldsby to a waiver of his constitutional right to object to the systematic exclusion of members of his race from the trial jury.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> With regard to the grand jury,' Judge Rives observed that systematic exclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>of Negroes from a grand jury involves consequences less serious than the consequences of their exclusion from a trial jury. The Court held that the petitioner had waived any objection to the grand jury. In discussing this case in Seals, however, Judge Rives pointed out: \u201c[In Goldsby] the evidence to support objections to the composition of the jury was entirely unknown to the defendant Seals, who was at no time even consulted by his attorney on this subject. Further, that evidence was not known to the attorney who defended Seals. Finally, that evidence was not \u2018easily ascertainable\u2019 \u201d. 304 F.2d at 69. In Seals, therefore, the Court held that there was no-waiver of the constitutional objection to the composition of either the petit jury or the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">We approve of the holdings in Goldsby and Seals. The important fact in each case was that the attorney for the Negro defendant did not consult his client with regard to his decision to refrain from making an attack on the jury system; and in Seals the evidence relating to systematic exclusion of Negroes from the juries was unknown to the defendant\u2019s attorney. Goldsby has been construed as holding that in a capital case \u201cbefore a defendant will be deemed to have waived his objection to trial by a petit jury infected by an unconstitutional exclusion for race, the record must show that the&gt; defendant, not just his counsel, took the action, deliberately and after advice\u201d.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>, Adams v. United States, 5 Cir. 1962, 302 F.2d 307, 314 (dissenting opinion). Goldsby, however, does not go that far.. The opinion makes this significant reservation :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-10\">\u201cIn ordinary procedural matters, the-defendant in a criminal case is-bound by the acts or nonaction of' his counsel. * * * It might extend to such a waiver even in capital: cases, where the record affirmatively shows that the particular jury was. desired by defendant\u2019s counsel after-conscientious consideration of that, course of action which would be best, for the client\u2019s cause.\u201d 263 F.2d 71 at 83.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">The unusual example \u2014 for an exclusion case \u2014 which Judge Rives gives is-the only type of exclusion situation where-there is a possibility of a true waiver-based on a free option.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> When a defendant\u2019s attorney prefers a particular-jury, there is \u201ca voluntary choice between-two meaningful alternatives\u201d.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Absent: this preference, there is no voluntary choice to relinquish the right to a fairly-constituted jury when the right <em>must </em>be-relinquished in order not to imperil the-defense.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Even in a situation where a. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>defendant\u2019s attorney has a considered preference for a particular jury, under the decisions the attorney must consult \u25a0with his client and the defendant must \u201cunderstandingly and knowingly\u201d forego his federal claims before a waiver would be established. But if the defendant lacks the capacity \u201cunderstandingly and knowingly\u201d to waive his right, it is an empty gesture to require consultation and it is meaningless to speak of waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">To return to the case before us, \u25a0here the attorneys for the petitioners are \u2022able, conscientious, experienced, court-appointed white lawyers.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The petitioners are ignorant Negroes whose frame of reference could not have included any comprehension of the traditional constitutional rights incident to a fair trial. Davis is illiterate and Whitus semi-illiterate. The Attorney General for the State, in his brief, makes a point of this in order to further his contention that the defendants are bound by the fictitious waiver of their attorneys:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-6\">\u201cIt is evident from the record that defendants were men of lesser intelligence at least in their understanding of 'the law and were com'pletely dependent upon their attorneys for a proper defense. * * * 'The testimony of. the appellant, Leon Davis, at the first hearing before the District Court for the Southern ' District of Georgi\u00e1 lucidly points \u2022out that he does' not comprehend the nature or meaning of the Constitution or the rights provided thereunder and is, in fact, entirely dependent on counsel for his defense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"agu-dedup-0\">In these circumstances, it is unrealistic .\u2022for the Court to attach significance to the- presence or absence of consultation ,of the attorneys with the defendants and the presence or absence of express consent by the defendants to the so-called waiver., For the petitioners in this case, these protections are simply not adequate safeguards against forfeiture of constitutional rights. The defendants would have been no better off after consultation, than before; had they been consulted and had they given instructions contrary to the attorneys\u2019 advice, they would have been worse off. As the Supreme Court of Georgia said in Cobb v. State, 1962, 218 Ga. 10,126 S.E.2d 231, cert. den\u2019d 1963, 371 U.S. 948, 83 S.Ct. 499, 9 L.Ed.2d 497:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-10\">\u201cWhere, as here, the defendant knows nothing of his rights or whether it would be strategically wise to waive them in certain situations, <em>it would be to require a vain \u25a0and useless thing that he personally consent to such waiver. </em>If appointed counsel had been compelled to consult and be controlled by the directions given him by his client, who was only fifteen years old, and according to his own insistence, knew nothing of law, courts or legal procedure, his usefulness would have been destroyed and the defendant would not have been represented by counsel within the meaning of Article I, Sec. I, Par. V of the Georgia Constitution (Code Ann. \u00a7 2-105).\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-11\">Cobb involved facts very similar to the facts in the instant case. The futility of requiring an express waiver from the fifteen year old Negro defendant led the Georgia Supreme Court to conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>\u201cthe waiver may be made on his behalf by counsel appointed by the court to defend him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">Here, as in Cobb, the evidence showed no consultation between the attorneys and the petitioners on waiver and here too the petitioners lacked the comprehension to make an intelligent waiver. If, notwithstanding, the State may treat the attorneys\u2019 inaction as implied \u201cwaiver\u201d, it is because the State, for its purposes, may establish a ground rule that orderly procedures compel a client to be bound by his lawyer\u2019s action and inaction <footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and require also that objections to juries be urged in the early stages of a trial, otherwise, state procedures would be circumvented.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-12\"> Such a state rule, so reasonable on its face, is an \u201cindependent and adequate state ground\u201d,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> which Federal courts generally should respect. But, as stated in Fay v. Noia, \u201cFederal courts have <em>power </em>under the federal habeas corpus statute to grant relief despite the applicant\u2019s failure to have pursued a state remedy not available to him at the time he applies.\u201d 372 U.S. at 398, 83 S.Ct. at 826.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number> The overriding duty of a fed&lt;eral court to protect the federally guaranteed rights of the individual \u2022citizen impels the court to inquire into \"the reasonableness, the constitutionality, of the state rule. \u201cReasonable consequences attached by the states to a failure to comply with reasonable rules must accordingly be respected. * * * But this assuredly does not mean that every last technicality of state law must be sacrosanct.\u201d Hart, Foreword: Time Chart for the Justices, 73 Harv.L.Rev. 84, 118 (1959). Professor Hart\u2019s comments on a state rule that the escape of a prisoner nullifies his motion for a new trial<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> are apt here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-6\">\u201cThe reasonableness of the state rule and, even more, the reasonableness of its application in the particular circumstances of the case cried aloud for questioning. Life was at stake. The constitutional rights which the prisoner asserted went to the very jugular of a system of ordered liberty \u2014 the right to be judged in an orderly trial before an unprejudiced tribunal rather than by the whipped-up emotions of the community. States may punish an escape as a crime. But surely not all rights to a fair trial can become forfeit because of it. Especially are doubts stirred when the escape in question can be viewed as a form of self-protection from the very community hostility against which the prisoner had previously protested in vain by lawful means. These considerations called for close scrutiny of the opposing considerations advanced by the state to show that the forfeiture it had decreed was necessary for the due enforcement of law.\u201d 73 Harv. L.Rev. at 116.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">This case is \u201cone of those extraordinary cases\u201d Mr. Justice Frankfurter may have had in mind in the caveat to his discussion of waiver in Brown v. Allen: \u2022the federal \u201cclaim goes to the very foundation of [the] proceeding\u201d. When Negroes are systematically excluded from juries, the fictitious waiver rule puts Negro defendants, and only Negro defendants, to a choice of evils that deprives them of an effective remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-11\">A. We know what happens when the attorney\u2019s inaction is treated as a waiver of the exclusion issue: the Negro defendant loses the benefits of a trial by his peers. We quote two sentences on the subject from a Supreme Court opinion in 1879:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-12\">\u201cThe very idea of a jury is a body of men composed of the peers or equals of the person whose rights it is selected or summoned to determine; that is, of his neighbors, fellows, associates, persons having the same legal status in society as that which he holds. * * * [Compelling a colored man to submit to a trial for his life by a jury drawn from a panel from which the State has expressly excluded every man of his race, because of color alone, however well qualified in other respects, is * * * a denial to him of equal protection of the law.\u201d Strauder v. West Virginia, 1879, 100 U.S. 303, 309, 25 L.Ed. 664.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-14\">B. We believe that we know what happens when a white attorney for a Negro defendant raises the exclusion issue in a county dominated by segregation patterns and practices: both the defendant and his attorney will suffer from community hostility.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-15\">The burden of making hard decisions is one that attorneys are used to carrying. But the burden is exceptionally heavy when the life and liberty of an accused depend on the weight to be given something as imponderable as the extent of the additional anti-Negro reaction that would be engendered by attacking the all-white jury system. As if this were not sufficiently difficult, there is the intolerable complication that the reaction against an attorney who raises the exclusion issue may stretch from persiflage to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>ostracism. The intensity of the reaction will depend on how bad racial relations are in the particular county, the standing of the defendant\u2019s attorney at the bar and in his community, the happening of unpredictable local events, and coincidental accidents of history. The reprisals may be real or chimerical; if chimerical, they may seem real to any particular attorney. All of this adds up to pressures which may, consciously or subconseiously, affect an attorney s measured evaluation of which evil is the lesser evil in this Hobson s choice of evils.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Later, should there be a post-conviction habeas corpus proceeding, the attorney\u2019s knowledge that his integrity may be questioned and his professional skill second-guessed in an antagonistic atmosphere may cause him to slant his explanation for making the wrong guess, The exposure of a Negro on trial for his life to these factors destructive of justice and federally protected rights and-harmful to the public policy of encouraging adequate legal representation of indigents is a monstrous price to pay for the convenience to the state of the procedural rule euphemistically termed \u201cwaiver\u201d.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"afx-dedup-0\">c&lt; We turn now to the bases in the decision-making process for judicial consideration- of these matters,</p>\n<p id=\"A5H\">(1) We gtart with <em>fa\u00a1r inference. </em>Jf thg segregation poiicy in a county is so strong that Negroes are systematically excluded from the jury system, community hostility would be generated against, any \u201ctrouble-maker\u201d who would attempt to upset the all-white make-up of the jury system. Such hostility would directly af-feet the Negro defendant. It would carry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>-over and affect the defendant\u2019s attorney. Whether horrendous or merely - embarrassing, the prospect of social extra-legal pressures distorting an attorney\u2019s judg.ment is a burden only Negro defendants bear.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">(2) In Goldsby we took <em>judicial notice </em>-of the fact that in some areas in the deep \u2022South lawyers almost never raised the \u2022exclusion issue.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-6\">\u201cMoreover, the very prejudice which causes the dominant race to exclude members of what it may assume to be an inferior race from jury service operates with multiplied .intensity against one who resists \u2022such exclusion. * * . * Such \u2022courageous and unselfish lawyers as .find it essential for their clients\u2019 projection to fight against the systematic exclusion of Negroes from juries sometimes do so at the risk \u2022of personal sacrifice which may extend to loss of practice and social ostracism, jf As Judges of a Circuit comprising six states of the deep South, we think that it is <em>our duty to take judicial notice </em>that lawyers residing in many southern jurisdictions rarely, almost to the point of never, raise the issue of systematic \u2022exclusion of Negroes from juries.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 263 F.2d at 82.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">'The effect will, of course, be accentuated if the case is one involving the murder of a white man by a Negro or the rape of a white woman by a Negro or if the timing of a trial should happen to coincide with fevers running high because of bad racial relations.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-12\">(3) The fact, standing alone, that no Negro has ever served on a jury in the particular county where his case is tried strongly indicates, if it does not create a presumption, that there was a tacit agreement by the bar of that county not to raise the constitutional issue. In such case the Negro would have no adequate remedy, either because of the powerful environmental factors infecting the jury system or because of ineffective representation by counsel. At the very least, that fact alone <em>establishes a prima facie case </em>putting the burden of going forward on the State to show that there was a true waiver; that the non-assertion of the defendant\u2019s constitutional right was not caused by environmental pressures or ineffective representation by the defendant\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-14\">(4) This case is a doubly strong one for the defendant because, unlike Golds-by,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> we have the benefit of <em>specific testimony from Whitus\u2019s trial attorney </em>on the motivation for his non-action. As we noted in Goldsby, \u201cConscientious southern lawyers often reason that the prejudicial effects on their client of raising the issue far outweigh any practical protection in the particular case.\u201d 263 F.2d at 82. Here, Mr. Walter Jones, attorney for Whitus, testified that he had hopes for an acquittal of his client on the charge of murder, whatever other offense he might have committed. In the habeas corpus hearing Mr. Jones testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-15\">\u201cQ.

In Fay v. Noia the defendant was-ajg0 confronted with a \u201cgrisly\u201d choice.. in that case a defendant was convicted', 0f murder. Years later, long after his-time for appeal had expired, he applied for habeas corpus on the ground that he\u2019 had been convicted on the basis of a coerced confession. The Supreme Court, held that the petitioner\u2019s failure to ap~ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>peal in the state court was not a waiver of his rights and did not bar habeas corpus relief. The Court first eliminated the possibility of any express waiver: \u201cA choice made by counsel not participated in by the petitioner does not automatically bar relief.\u201d Mr. Justice Brennan, for the majority, then explained why Noia\u2019s choice not to appeal was not a matter of trial strategy or a deliberate attempt to by-pass state procedures:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-5\">\u201cUnder no reasonable view can the State\u2019s version of Noia\u2019s reason for not appealing support an inference of deliberate by-passing of the state court system. For Noia to have appealed in 1942 would have been to run a substantial risk of electrocution. His was the <em>grisly choice whether to sit content with life imprisonment or to travel the uncertain avenue of appeal which, if successful, might well have led to a retrial and death sentence. </em>See, e. g., Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319 [58 S.Ct. 149, 82 L.Ed. 288]. He declined to play Russian roulette in this fashion. This was a choice by Noia not to appeal, but under the circumstances it cannot realistically be deemed a merely tactical or strategic litigation step, or in any way a deliberate circumvention of state procedures.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Recently a commentator has observed the analogy between the defendant\u2019s situation in the Noia case and the defendant\u2019s position in the instant case \u201cin that here he must choose whether to assert his constitutional right with a possibility of forfeiting his chances for an unprejudiced trial, or remain silent and gamble on the outcome of the trial with the possibility of raising the question later if the outcome proves unsatisfactory\u201d. Note, 16 Ala.L.Rev. 117 (1963).<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The instant case, however, is a stronger case than Fay v. Noia for habeas corpus relief. Noia could have exercised his right to appeal without suffering any constitutional deprivation. But here, in order for the petitioners to exercise their right to a jury from which Negroes were not excluded, the petitioners had to compromise their right to a fair trial on the merits of their defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">We summarize. Taking waiver as the \u201cintentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege\u201d, the facts show that the petitioners made no \u201cdeliberate\u201d, meaningful waiver of their objection to systematic exclusion of Negroes from the juries in Mitchell County. Taking \u201cwaiver\u201d as a formula standing for the rule that non-assertion of an objection to state procedures vitiates the objection, we hold: under Fay v. Noia, in a federal habeas corpus proceeding the court cannot permit a state ground rule to frustrate the federally guaranteed right to a fair trial before a fairly constituted jury. We do not say that \u201cno waiver can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>\u2022be effective if some adverse consequences might reasonably be expected to follow the exercise of that right.\u201d <footnotemark>30</footnotemark> We say that the doctrine of fictitious waiver is .unacceptable when the state compels an .accused person to choose between an unfairly constituted jury and a prejudiced .jury. In short, while giving full effect <em>\u2022to </em>the holding of the majority in Fay v. Noia the Court has attempted to answer the basic question Mr. Justice Harlan \u2022asked in his dissenting opinion: \u201cWhether the choice made by the defendant is \u2022one that the State could constitutionally require.\u201d <footnotemark>31</footnotemark> We hold that the State could not constitutionally require the petition-ers to make a guess and a gamble between two evils. This burden, which only Negro defendants bear, violates the requirements of due process and equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the .Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">* *</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">As in Goldsby and Seals, the Court expresses its present opinion that a period of eight months from and after the entry of this judgment or its final test by certiorari, or otherwise, will be sufficient to afford the State an opportunity to take the necessary steps to reindict and retry the petitioners. Any such reindictment must of course be by a grand jury from which Negroes have not been systematically excluded, and any such retrial must be before a jury from which Negroes have not been systematically excluded, or before some court or tribunal so constituted as not to violate the petitioners\u2019 constitutional rights. For the guidance of the parties, the Court expresses the present opinion that if petitioners are reindicted and retried and if any question should arise as to the legality or constitutionality of such indictment or trial, that should be decided not upon the present petition but in the regular course by the Courts of the State of Georgia, subject to possible review by the Supreme Court of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">The judgment of the district court is reversed, judgment here rendered in accordance with the holdings of this opinion, and the cause remanded for any further proceedings which may be found necessary or proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">Reversed, rendered, and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b546-7\">.

If exhaustion is interpreted to include presently unavailable remedies, it would appear that the waiver and adequate-state-ground rules are merely semantic variants of the exhaustion requirement. Application of these principles to a given set of facts produces identical results. Thus, * * * a habeas court could hold that by failing to exhaust a remedy no longer available, petitioner has waived his procedural rights and has created an adequate and independent state ground for his continued detention. No matter which theory is used, petitioner is denied habeas corpus relief for failure to employ a presently unavailable remedy. Once it is decided, however, that the exhaustion requirement applies only to presently available remedies, an applicant would not he penalized under that theory for failing to appeal if he could no longer do so. But such an interpretation of the exhaustion requirement would be rendered nugatory if failure to appeal were to result in a forfeiture under the theories of waiver or adequate state ground. The danger in regarding the doctrines separately is this possibility of antithetical application.\u201d Sofaer, supra, Note 1, 39 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 78, 82.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b549-17\">.

(\u201cAn abortive-state proceeding has occurred when a-state criminal defendant, at some time in the past, had an opportunity to present to-his own state\u2019s courts any question relavant to the power of the state to hold; him in custody but lost that opportunity can no longer seek any relief there.\u201d) \u201cThe most that was waived was the right: to review in the state Supreme Court. It takes some additional extrapolation to-make that equivalent to waiver of the-underlying federal right.\u201d Reitz, supra, note 1, 74 Harv.L.Rev. 1335. See also Moyers v.

Noia, 372 U.S. 391, 429-432, 83 S.Ct. 822, 844, 9 L.Ed.2d 837, the Court commented: \u201cThe fatal weakness of this contention is its failure to recognize that the adequate state-ground rule is a function of the limitations of <em>appellate </em>review. * * * And so we have held that the adequate state-ground rule is a consequence of the Court\u2019s obligation to refrain from rendering advisory opinions or passing upon moot questions. If But while our appellate function is concerned only with the judgments or decrees of state courts, the ha-beas corpus jurisdiction of the lower federal courts is not so confined. The jurisdictional prerequisite is not the judgment of a state court but detention <em>simpUeiter. </em>The entire course of decisions in this Court elaborating the rule of exhaustion-of state remedies is wholly incompatible with the proposition that a state court <em>judgment </em>is required to confer federal habeas jurisdiction. And the broad power of the federal courts under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243 summarily to hear the application and to \u2018determine the facts, and dispose of the matter as law and justice require,\u2019 is hardly characteristic of an appellate jurisdiction. Habeas lies to enforce the right of personal liberty; when that right is denied and a person confined, the federal court has the power to release him. Indeed, it has no other power; it cannot revise the state court judgment; it can act only on the body of the petitioner. * * * In Noia\u2019s case the only relevant substantive law is federal\u2014 the Fourteenth Amendment. State law appears only in the procedural framework for adjudicating the substantive federal question. The paramount interest is federal. Cf. Dice v. Akron, C. &amp; Y. R. Co., 342 U.S. 359 [72 S.Ct. 312, 96 L.Ed. 398]. That is not to say that the States have not a substantial interest in exacting compliance with their procedural rules from criminal defendants asserting federal defenses. Of course orderly criminal procedure is a desideratum, and of course there must be sanctions for the flouting of such procedure. But that state interest \u2018competes * * * against an ideal * * * [the] ideal of fair procedure.\u2019 Schaefer, Federalism and State Criminal Procedure, 70 Harv.L.Rev. 1, 5 (1956). And the only concrete impact the assumption of federal habeas jurisdiction in the face of a procedural default has on the state interest we have described, is that it prevents the State from closing oE the convicted defendant\u2019s last opportunity to vindicate his constitutional rights, thereby punishing him for his default and deterring others who might commit similar defaults in the future.\u201d Cf.

The attorney\u2019s failure to raise the issue and the lack of any explanation could give rise to tbe inference that the trial counsel was not acting in the best interests of his client. In Goldsby, however, we said as we do here, that sometimes raising the issue may cause more prejudice than it is worth. The necessity for the attorney making this choice, not just the composition of the jury, is the constitutional vice.

In his dissenting opinion, Chief Justice Duckworth said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aok-dedup-0\">\u201cIn full recognition of the established rule of law that holds those parties to a criminal conspiracy or enterprise, who commit no overt act, equally guilty with those who commit the overt acts, I am, nevertheless, simply unable to find any basis either in law or common reason for holding this defendant guilty of murder where all the evidence excludes any possibility of conspiracy among the four, who included this defendant and the person who did the killing. They had planned no robbery, theft or other crime, and indeed had no reason to expect to see the deceased before he went to them. Thereafter, this defendant had no dealings, words or feelings with or toward the deceased. Why should he want <em>to </em>harm the deceased? There is positively a complete absence of even a suspicion of any motive. The slayer committed every criminal act that caused the death. He needed no help from this accused other than pushing the car and racing the motor, both of which were done at his command while he held the gun with which he later shot the deceased, who had already been knocked unconscious by the killer. To say that this was not enough to cause a reasonable person to-fear that a refusal to obey would endanger his life, is to ignore realities and human nature. No act of his harmed a hair of the deceased. Even if he was. cowardly and foolish in obeying the murderer who held a gun, this would not show his guilt of criminal desire or intent. Human life should not be taken by-the State with such total lack of evidence of either act or intent as this reeord shows. Unless he is saved by the-clemency of the Pardon and Parole Board, his life will be forfeited for a crime be-never committed and had no cause for wanting it <em>committed. </em>If this decision fixes the law, then every person stands-in danger of being electrocuted if a murder is committed by someone of his associates even though he had no knowledge-that it was going to be done.\u201d Whitus v. State, 116 S.E.2d at 207.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b557-7\">. The note is on Ex parte Aaron, Ala., S.Ct. 1963, 155 So.2d 334. On the authority of Seals v. State, 1961, 271 Ala. 622, 126 So.2d 474, cert. den\u2019d 1961, 366 U.S. 954, 81 S.Ct. 1909, 6 L.Ed.2d 1246, the Court held that the defendant, a Negro indicted for the rape of a white woman, had waived the systematic exclusion issue. At arraignment, in answer to a question from the trial judge, the defendant\u2019s attorney stated that they did not intend to attack either the grand jury or the petit jury venire because of \u201cthe racial make-up of such grand jury or petit jury venire\u201d. The note concludes, \u201cThus, the Alabama court has yet to recognize the principle advanced in the Noia case \u2014 that even a knowing failure to assert this particular constitutional right does not constitute a waiver, or, more concisely, that there can <em>be </em>no waiver at the present time of this constitutional right. * * * Would it not be better to align [Alabama\u2019s] concept of waiver with that set out in the Noia ease, thereby enabling defendants, by coram nobis in state courts, to assert the right for the first time, rather than forcing an unsuccessful defendant into the federal courts on habeas corpus when the obvious result will be a federal decision overturning a decision of our highest state court, with the chafing effect it will undoubtedly have on federal-state relations?\u201d Note, 16 Ala.L.Jour. 117, 123 (1963).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b558-6\">.
