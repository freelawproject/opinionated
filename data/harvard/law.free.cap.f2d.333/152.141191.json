Wright, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b200-20\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b200-21\">The will of Jacob Voronoff, which was-admitted to probate February 8, 1963,. contained this sentence, \u201cIt is my intention not to make any provision in my Will for my stepdaughter, Edna Epstein.\u201d Within the six-month period permitted by \u00a7 19-309, D.C.Code (1961), Mrs. Epstein filed a caveat alleging she was Voronoff\u2019s daughter and praying\" that the probate of the will be revoked. The executrix moved to dismiss the caveat on the ground that the caveator was not a \u201cperson in interest\u201d who may file a caveat under that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-22\">In answer to interrogatories propounded by the caveatee, Mrs. Epstein stated she was Voronoff\u2019s daughter by adoption, although she said, \u201cThere were-no court proceedings of adoption, to the-best of my knowledge.\u201d She deposed that the testator treated her as his daughter, that in the school records of the District of Columbia he was listed as-her \u201cparent or guardian,\u201d that in the-1920 census she was listed as \u201cEdna Voronoff, Daughter, Age 11, enumerated' in the family of Jacob and Fannie Voronoff,\u201d that in 1927 the local news<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>papers announced \u201cthe engagement of Miss Edna Voronoff, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Jacob Voronoff,\u201d and that her wedding was arranged and paid for by Voronoff.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">From this Mrs. Epstein argued that, under the doctrine of equitable adoption, she was the adopted daughter of the decedent. The District Court held, however, that the statutes relative to the subject create an exclusive method for the legal adoption of children, found that Mrs. Epstein had never been legally adopted, and consequently dismissed the \u2022caveat. She appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">The only domestic authority cited by the appellant is an unreported decision of the District Court in Estate of Linnie G. Finney, Administration No. 81,052 (1954). There it was held that, as the prospective adoptive parents had contracted with a foundling home in 1892 <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to adopt the child, had taken him into</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">their iousehold and treated him as a member of the family, he should be treated as though he had been adopted, even though formal adoption was never consummated.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">We need not and do not decide whether the statutory method of adoption is exclusive, or whether the doctrine of equitable adoption also prevails in the District of Columbia, because under either, Mrs. Epstein must fail: there was no promise or contract to adopt which would support her equitable adoption theory and, admittedly, there was no statutory adoption. Being a stepdaughter only, she was not a person \u201cwho would be entitled to or interested in the estate of the testator in case such will had not been executed * * *.\u201d \u00a7 19-301, D.C. Code (1961). Hence, she was not a \u201cperson in interest\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 309.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b201-11\">. There was no adoption statute in the District of Columbia at that time.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
