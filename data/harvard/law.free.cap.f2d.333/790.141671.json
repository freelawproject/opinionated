The Board\u2019s decision and order are reported at 142 N.L.R.B. No. 117.- The Board, adopting its Trial Examiner\u2019s findings and recommended order, found that respondent had violated \u00a7\u00a7 8(a) (3) and (1) of the Act by discharging eleven employees for engaging in union activities. It also found that respondent had violated \u00a7 8(a) (1) of the Act by interrogating and threatening its employees with respect to union activity. The Board\u2019s order, of which enforcement is requested, requires respondent to cease and desist from the unfair practices found and from in any other manner interfering with the rights of its employees under the Act. Affirmatively, the order requires reinstatement of the employees named in the complaint, the restoration of seniority and all other rights and privileges to those already re-employed, the reimbursement of back pay plus interest at the rate of 6% per annum, and the posting of appropriate notices.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>Respondent objects to the petition for an enforcement order on the grounds that there is no substantial evidence in the record justifying it and further asks that it be denied because of claimed prejudicial errors committed by the Trial Examiner and approved by the Board whereby respondent was denied due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">The record indicates that respondent is a Delaware corporation conducting an interstate utility business in Louisiana, Arkansas, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas and other locations where it is engaged in the sale and distribution of natural gas. It also owns and operates non-utility enterprises through wholly owned subsidiaries. During the year preceding the issuance of the complaint herein respondent received gross revenue of more than $100,-000,000. No jurisdictional issues are present.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">As part of its business operations respondent maintains a trucking terminal on 15th Street in Little Rock, Arkansas. In May 1962 there were 17 truck drivers employed at such terminal. As early as March of 1962 the drivers at the 15th Street terminal learned of management\u2019s plan to change the method by which wages were computed. After several attempts to meet and persuade management not to effect this change, the employees sought to form a union. Between April 20th and May 8th ten of the 17 drivers signed application cards with Local 878 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America. Between May 11 and May 14, 1962, respondent discharged all but four of its truck drivers working at the 15th Street terminal, doing so suddenly and without warning. None of the four retained drivers had signed a union card. Circumstances surrounding the various discharges are fairly summarized from the record as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">On May 11th, Jenkins, the dispatcher who ran the trucking terminal and who was held by the Board to be a company supervisor, came into the yard at the trucking terminal and stopped Creed, who was about to take a truck to St. Louis. Jenkins said, \u201cThey have just fired the whole bunch. * * * They have just fired every truck driver down here.\u201d Jenkins and Creed spoke to Garage Foreman Lafferty, who told them that he had received instructions by telephone from Lindsey Hatchett, respondent\u2019s vice president, to lay off each driver as he arrived at the terminal. Upon Jenkins\u2019 protest that he had several runs scheduled at that time, Lafferty stated that Hat-chett had told him to keep drivers Ford, Younts, Ware and Roberts. None of these four had signed union cards. Laf-ferty explained that he was instructed by Hatchett that this was an \u201ceconomic layoff, and we were just going to have to tighten our belts.\u201d Jenkins told Creed and another driver, Lowery, that he had so many trips scheduled he did not know what he was going to do for men to drive the trucks.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">Later that afternoon in Jenkins\u2019 office driver McEuen, who was among those discharged, remarked to Creed, who was the leader in union activity, that, \u201c * * it looks like I cut my own throat. I did not want to sign one of these cards because I thought I was going to the office, * * * and I would not be allowed to vote when the Union voted. * * * Now, I have messed around and I have no protection at all. I did not sign a card and you boys did, and you have protection, and I haven\u2019t.\u201d Jenkins broke in and asked, \u201cYou did not sign a card?\u201d McEuen turned to Creed for confirmation of this fact, and Creed agreed that Mc-Euen had not signed a card. The next day McEuen was rehired by respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-10\">That evening Jenkins informed driver Ballard that the latter was among those discharged. Jenkins asked Ballard whether he had joined the union. Ballard replied that he was not a member and Jenkins said, \u201cWell, Creed and some of the guys seem to think that is the reason for the lay off, and if it was, I think I can get you back on.\u201d Ballard was rehired by the respondent on September 3, 1962, but with loss of vacation pay and with no seniority.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>On May 14th Ballard and three other \u00abdrivers went to Jenkins\u2019 office. Jenkins \"told then that a new driver, Jones, had \"been hired that morning and that the \u25a0company was transferring in extra driv\u25a0ers from its home office at Shreveport.</p>\n<p id=\"aef-dedup-0\">With reference to interference, re;straint and coercion, it is established in \u2022the record that W. K. Stephens is pres.ident of the respondent corporation, and that Albert Stephens, a stockholder and brother of respondent\u2019s president, had \"been instrumental in the original hiring \u2022of a number of respondent\u2019s drivers. Drivers Harper and Lowery had obtained \u2022employment applications from Albert Stephens and after filling them out returned them to him. During the course \u2022of an interview with Lowery, Albert Stephens questioned Lowery about his feelings toward the union. Lowery re\u25a0plied that unions were all right in their place, that he had worked on jobs that \u2022were union and ones that were not. At the end of the interview, Stephens told \"him that respondent would hire him. 'Three weeks later respondent notified Lowery to report to. work. Albert Stephens also offered to hire driver Kauffman for a job with respondent, Kauffman filled out and returned the application blank given to him by Albert ^Stephens and thereafter was interviewed \u2022at the latter\u2019s home. Stephens told him that he had put his \u201co. k.\u201d on the appli\u2022cation and that Kauffman would hear from respondent in a few days. Albert 'Stephens said \u201cWhen I put my O. K. on things, they generally stay fixed.\u201d He -also asked Kauffman, \u201cYou know what to \u2022do about the union?\u201d Kauffman said, \u201cYes, I do.\u201d About three weeks thereafter Kauffman began working for the \u25a0company.</p>\n<p id=\"AEBf\">Driver Newsom filled out an application for employment which he took to Albert ^Stephens, who put his \u201co. k.\u201d on it. Sub:sequently, at Albert Stephens\u2019 request, Newsom interviewed him at the Stephens Lome. Albert Stephens told him that Le had his application and asked if he wanted to go to work for the gas company. Albert Stephens then said, \u201cYou know how the Gas Company operates. It is against the Union.\u201d Stephens asked him if he was for the union and was told that Newsom wasn\u2019t. Later Albert Stephens called him and told him to report to the 15th Street office.</p>\n<p id=\"AWD\">Driver Harrington, who was a second cousin of the Stephens brothers, filed his application directly with respondent, About two months later Albert Stephens called him out to his home and told him, \u201c * * * that he had a job for me if Jack York did not take the job.\u201d Albert Stephens also asked how Harrington felt about the union and Harrington replied that he did not like the union. The next day Albert Stephens told him to report to Vice President Hatchett. Harrington did so and began working the following day. Without more, this is an indication of the activities of Albert Stephens insofar as <em>employment </em>of the truck drivers and inquiries as to their union sympathies is concerned,</p>\n<p id=\"AIo3\">A few days'after the May 11th discharges, Albert Stephens went to driver Kauffman\u2019s home, where he questioned him concerning the dismissals and the union activity of the drivers. Later four of the discharged drivers went to Albert Stephens\u2019 home at his request. Albert Stephens told them he wanted \u201cstraight\u201d answers to his questions and demanded that they tell him \u201cwho started this Union activity\u201d. Albert Stephens said he was not a representative of the company but that if they gave him the information he wanted, he would guarantee their jobs back. Creed questioned Stephens about the validity of any guarantee he could give if he did not represent the company and Stephens replied, \u201cHow did you get your jobs to start with?\u201d He then told the men to talk it over among themselves and then come back and give ^im some \u201cstraight answers\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"a6j-dedup-0\">It is the Board\u2019s contention that (1) substantial evidence, considering the record as a whole, supports its finding that respondent violated \u00a7\u00a7 8(a) (3) and 8(a) (1) of the Act by discriminatorily discharging employees to discourage membership and activity in the union; (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>substantial evidence supports its findings that Albert Stephens was an agent of the respondent and that through, him respondent violated \u00a7 8(a) (1) of the Act by interrogating and coercing employees concerning their union activity; and (3) its order directing back pay with interest is valid and proper.</p>\n<p id=\"axj-dedup-0\">Respondent contends, first, that the Board failed to establish that it, respondent, had any knowledge of any union activity by the employees before the layoff. However, an examination of the record as a whole discloses substantial evidence of knowledge. In March preceding the May 1962 discharges the drivers indicated their dissatisfaction with the company\u2019s proposed change of its wage structure, arranged meetings with Transportation Superintendent Crawford, with Virgil Creed acting as their spokesman. Superintendent Crawford was subsequently relieved of his duties and replaced by Lindsey Hatchett, a vice president. A meeting was requested with Hatchett, who said he would \u201clook into it\u201d. Subsequently, about April 15th, Lowery and some of the other drivers were talking with Jenkins. Lowery testified \u2022</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGa\">\u201cQ. Tell us what was said ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGLM\">\u201cA. ^ We were talking about our conditions and it seemed like something had to be done, and we could not talk to anybody. I said that it seemed like the Union was our answer, and some were inclined to agree, and Mr. Jenkins said 'yes, it looked like something had to be done,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aikl\">\u201cQ. Mr. Lowery, how did you apply for your job with the Gas Company?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"af7-dedup-0\">\u201cA. Through Mr. Albert Stephens.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEvn\">\u201cQ. When was this, approximate-jy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ayz-dedup-2\">... . _ _ f ,, ., \u201e . A. Along about the middle of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AE76\">August, 1961.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"art-dedup-1\">Albert Stephens stated he had heard about \u201cthe union\u201d on the streets in Sheridan. (Sheridan is the county seat of Grant County wherein both Albert, Stephens and his brother W. R. Stephens, president of the company, reside.) We believe it would take a considerable amount of naivete to conclude-from this record that the respondent, had no knowledge of the union activity of its drivers before their discharge im Ma^ 1962' We find tbe Board\u2019s concluS10n tbereon to be amPfr supported,</p>\n<p id=\"AXo9\">It is next contended by the respondent that the Board failed to establish that W. R. Stephens, Albert Stephens^ his brother, or Royce Jenkins did, as-agents and supervisors of the respondent, interrogate the employees concerning' their union membership activities or desires. By 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 160(e) Congress; provided that in a petition to this court, for an enforcement order</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajsn\">\u00ab-\u00bb * * The findings of the Board with respect to questions of fact if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as ai whole shall be conclusive.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"am7-dedup-0\">,In afsessmg the flndmgs\u2019 we are &amp;uidedl <em>by the Monition </em>of the Supreme Court in Universal Camera Corp. v.

He also served as a link between management and the drivers, arranging meetings for them 'with the Company officials. In the \u2022 administrative hierarchy at the time \u2022of the layoff, 17 employee drivers .reported directly to him, and he him\u25a0self reported to a vice president in \u2022charge of the entire transportation \u2022 department of the Company. And it 'was Jenkins, again on his own initiative, who was at least instrumental in securing the reinstatement of McEuen. Under these circumstanc- \u2022 es, with no evidence adduced to the \u25a0 contrary by the Respondent, we hold, \u2022 as did the Trial Examiner, that Jenkins was a supervisor within the meaning of Section 2(11) of the Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b843-13\">With reference to Albert Stephens, the 'Board, after referring to the testimony \u2022as summarized supra, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-14\">\u201c -* * * These incidents, together with those cited by the Trial Examiner, convince us that Albert \u2022Stephens was an agent of the Respondent and that, because of his interrogation of the employees regarding their union sympathies and the leadership of the organizational movement, the Respondent violated Section 8(a) (1) of the Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b843-16\">In determining responsibility for union activities, the principles of agency and its establishment are to be \u25a0construed liberally. The Supreme Court \u2022made reference thereto in International Ass\u2019n of Machinists, etc. v. Labor Board, 1940, 311 U.S. 72, 80, 61 S.Ct. 83, 85 L.Ed. 50, wherein, speaking through Mr. Justice Douglas, it said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-18\">\u201cThe employer, however, may be held to have assisted the formation of a union even though the acts of the so-called agents were not expressly authorized or might not be attributable to him on strict application of the rules of <em>respondeat superior. </em>We are dealing here not with private rights (Amalgamated Utility Workers v. Consolidated Edison Co., 309 U.S. 261 [60 S.Ct. 561, 84 L.Ed. 738]) nor with technical concepts pertinent to an employer\u2019s legal responsibility to third persons for acts of his servants, but with a clear legislative policy to free the collective bargaining process from all taint of an employer\u2019s compulsion, domination, or influence. The existence of that' interference must.' be determined by careful scrutiny of all the factors, often subtle, which restrain the employees\u2019 choice and for which the employer may fairly be said to be responsible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b843-20\">See, also, H. J. Heinz Co. v. Labor Board, 1941, 311 U.S. 514, 520, 521, 61 S.Ct. 320, 85 L.Ed. 309, and N. L. R. B. v. Link-Belt Co., 1941, 311 U.S. 584, 599, 61 S.Ct. 358, 85 L.Ed. 368. It is the respondent\u2019s contention that the Supreme Court\u2019s holdings in the cases supra are no longer authority, having been announced prior to the amendment of the present Act. Nevertheless, the present Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 152(13) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-22\">\u201cIn determining whether any person is acting as an \u2018agent\u2019 of another person so as to make such other person responsible for his acts, the question of whether the specific acts performed were actually authorized or subsequently ratified shall not be controlling.\u201d (61 Stat. 139)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"awz-dedup-0\">Subsequent holdings of this and other courts indicate clearly that the doctrine announced by the Supreme Court in International Ass\u2019n of Machinists, etc. v. Labor Board, supra, continues to be followed. N. L. R. B. v. Champa Linen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>Service Co., 10 Cir., 1963, 324 F.2d 28, 30; N. L. R. B. v. Des Moines Foods, Inc., 8 Cir., 1961, 296 F.2d 285, 287; N. L. R. B. v. Birmingham Publishing Co., 5 Cir., 1959, 262 F.2d 2, 8; N. L. R. B. v. Solo Cup Co., 8 Cir., 1956, 237 F.2d 521, 523-524; N. L. R. B. v. Mississippi Products, Inc., 5 Cir., 1954, 213 F.2d 670, 672-673; N. L. R. B. v. Geigy Co., 9 Cir., 1954, 211 F.2d 553, 557; N. L. R. B. v. Howell Chevrolet Co., 9 Cir., 1953, 204 F.2d 79, 84, aff\u2019d on other grounds 346 U.S. 482, 74 S.Ct. 214, 98 L.Ed. 215 (1953). In discussing this same question, the court in Local 636, etc., Plumbing &amp; Pipe Fit. Ind. of United States v. N. L. R. B., 1961, 109 U.S.App.D.C. 315, 287 F.2d 354, 359, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-4\">\u201cWe know of nothing in the Act of 1947 or in the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 401 et seq., which affects the vitality of * * * [the doctrine embodied in I. A. of M.].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">In interpreting 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 152(13), quoted supra, the courts have held that strict principles of agency are not required to be applied in determining an employer\u2019s responsibility for the union activities of its supervisory employees. See, e. g., Local 636, etc., Plumbing &amp; Pipe Fit. Ind. of United States v. N. L. R. B., supra, and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">We think the record justified the Board\u2019s conclusion that respondent knew of, approved and ratified the actions of Albert Stephens in connection with the employment, in the first instance, of a number of respondent\u2019s drivers and in, subsequent to the discharge, interrogating them with reference to union activity. Albert Stephens, the brother of respondent\u2019s president, distributed respondent\u2019s blank employment application forms, received back the forms after they were filled out by applicants for employment, interviewed prospective employees, reported the results of those interviews to respondent, informed applicants whether they could work for respondent and informed them when, where and to whom to report for work. Applicants approved by Albert Stephens who reported at the appointed time and place were given work by the respondent. In one instance an applicant who had applied for a position directly with the company was subsequently called by Albert Stephens and told to see him for an interview. Upon receiving Albert Stephens\u2019 approval, this applicant was given work by respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">We conclude from the foregoing and without further reference to detailed evidence in the record that the Board\u2019s, findings that Jenkins was a supervisor and Albert Stephens was an agent of the respondent for whose activities respondent became responsible are supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole and may not be set aside here.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">We further hold that there is substantial evidence in the record from which the Board was fully justified in finding that the drivers herein were discharged because of their union activity and that such discharges were in violation of \u00a7 8(a) (3) of the Act. The timing and manner of discharges were compellingly significant. Following unsatisfactory and inconclusive meetings with respondent\u2019s executives over wage computation methods, the drivers began union organizational activities. Between April 20 and May 8, 1962, ten drivers of the 17 employed at this terminal signed union application cards. Between May 11 and May 14, 1962, all drivers who had thus signed cards were, without previous warning, laid off and terminated. Only four drivers of the 17 were retained. None of the four had signed a union card. Another driver, upon telling Jenkins that he had not signed a union card, was promptly rehired. These discharges were made in the face of apparent driver shortage, were accompanied by efforts to get replacements from the respondent\u2019s plants elsewhere and were made without regard to seniority ratings or consideration of accident records and efficiency classifications based thereon. The common factor among the discharged drivers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>was the signing or carrying of a union application card.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\">It may also be noted that the employees were told in the first instance that this was an \u201ceconomic layoff and we were just going to have to tighten our belts\u201d. Respondent\u2019s utter failure to introduce any evidence to justify such a conclusion plus the fact that the discharges left them shorthanded is a complete and sufficient refutation of respondent\u2019s contention that the discharges were for economic reasons and because of lack of work.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">We find the Board\u2019s conclusions are fully justified by the record considered as a whole, including that which \u201cfairly detracts from its weight\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\"> Respondent contends that certain prejudicial errors were committed by the Trial Examiner and adopted by the Board. Among other things, it claims that it was not permitted by the Examiner to show when it hired driver William Jones that it intended for him to work as a pipeline spacer on construction work, a job which, at the time of Jones\u2019 hire, was not yet in existence. The ruling of which respondent complains is not before us in the printed record. Respondent has accordingly failed to comply v/ith our Rule 10(b) which provides, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cIf the appellant or petitioner in his brief challenges rulings upon evidence, such evidence, the objections interposed thereto, and the rulings questioned shall be quoted in the printed record, * * Failure to comply with Rule 10(b) would justify this court in refusing to consider respondent\u2019s contention. Zitserman v. F. T. C., 8 Cir., 1952, 200 F.2d 519, 521. The Board has, however, seen fit to attempt to refute respondent\u2019s contention in its brief. It points out, and we agree, that the evidence fully supports the conclusion that respondent hired Jones to work as a truck driver. Supervisor Jenkins advised the discharged drivers that Jones had been hired for that purpose and it is undisputed that'before coming to work for respondent Jones took a physical examination to qualify him as a truck driver pursuant to the requirements of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Supervisor Jenkins told the discharged drivers he had gotten some help from Shreveport and that as to Jones, \u201cYes, we hired him this morning, [shortly after the discharges] and he is going to take his physical now. If he passes, he will go out on a trip this evening.\u201d If. any error was committed in connection with refusing respondent\u2019s attempt to make a further showing, if it did so attempt, then we find the error to be without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">We likewise hold that the Trial Examiner\u2019s exclusion of respondent\u2019s proffered evidence that it had amicable relations with other unions to be without prejudice. Cf. Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. v. N. L. R. B., 1941, 313 U.S. 146, 158, 61 S.Ct. 908, 85 L.Ed. 1251; National Airlines, Inc. v. C. A. B., 1963, 116 U.S.App.D.C. 114, 321 F.2d 380, 383.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-10\">Respondent\u2019s further claim is that it was improperly denied the right to inspect pre-trial statements of the general counsel\u2019s witnesses. A number of witnesses had been called by the general counsel, examined, cross-examined and excused. The witness Marvin Younts (one of the retained drivers who had not signed a union card) was then called. During the direct examination of Younts it appeared that he had given a written statement during the investigation but on the witness stand claimed that he had been drinking during that time and could not remember what had been said. Counsel for the respondent then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-11\">\u201cNow, Mr. Examiner, at this time, I would like to ask that Counsel for the General Counsel furnish us with a copy of that statement and all other statements which he has taken from his witnesses, which he has used or may use hereafter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b845-13\">Further examination of the witness Younts failed to identify the statement, whereupon the general counsel asked that the witness be declared hostile. The request was not granted but the Trial Examiner suggested that the witness be withdrawn. This was done and all of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>testimony was stricken. Counsel for respondent renewed his request for a copy of the statements \u201cthat Counsel has used in examining other witnesses he has put on the stand.\u201d The Examiner ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-4\">\u201cI just have this to say, that you are untimely in your request for statements of previous witnesses. The witnesses have been excused, and the request is untimely.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">The Board\u2019s rules promulgated after Jencks v. United States, 1957, 353 U.S. 657, 77 S.Ct. 1007, 1 L.Ed.2d 1103, provide in pertinent part as follows: 29 U.S.C.A.App.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-6\">\u201c\u00a7 <em>102.118 Same; Board employees prohibited from producing files, records, etc., pursuant to subpena ad testificandum or subpena duces tecum, prohibited from testifying in regard thereto</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-8\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-9\">\u201c * * * <em>Provided, </em>After a witness called by the general counsel has testified in a hearing upon a complaint under section 10 (c) of the act, the respondent may move for the production of any statement of such witness in possession of the general \u25a0counsel, if such statement has been reduced to writing and signed or \u25a0otherwise approved or adopted by the witness. Such motion shall be granted by the trial examiner. If the general counsel declines to furnish the statement, the testimony of the witness shall be stricken: * * *\u00bb</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b846-12\">Under the foregoing rule, it is perfectly clear that the statement of the witness Younts need not have been produced after his testimony had been stricken. We further conclude that the Trial Examiner\u2019s ruling that the request as to the other statements of witnesses who had been excused was untimely is likewise correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-13\">As to the respondent\u2019s contention that the Board is without authority to award interest on back pay, this court has previously approved the Board\u2019s practice of adding 6% interest to back pay awards. See Marshfield Steel Co. v. N. L. R. B., 8 Cir., 1963, 324 F.2d 333, 337-339; N. L. R. B. v. Byrds Mfg. Co., 8 Cir., 1963, 324 F.2d 329, 333.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-15\">We have examined all of the respondent\u2019s claimed errors and find none of them to be of substantial merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-16\">An order of enforcement will be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
