Its resolution requires a determination of whether the differences between the claimed subject matter and the prior art were such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made. The problem in this case is complicated, however, by the highly specialized, technical nature of the claimed subject matter and by the failure of the specification so to disclose the subject matter that we might determine precisely what appellant has invented. A further complication arises from an apparent disagreement between the position taken by appellant\u2019s present attorney and that taken by appellant when the application was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-21\">The application<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in issue is entitled \u201cComposition of Matter and Process.\u201d The invention is said to relate \u201cto novel neomycin derivatives and to novel methods for making them,\u201d and further,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-22\">\u201c * * * to novel methods of recovering neomycin derivatives from aqueous media containing compounds of the neomycin complex, i. e., neo-mycin and neamine, and to methods for converting said derivatives to neomycin and neamine in isolated and purified form.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-23\">Prior to appellant\u2019s invention neomycin was known to occur in the fermentation beers obtained by the cultivation of <em>Streptomyces fradiae. </em>While, technically, neomycin may occur in several forms, the specification states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-24\">\u201c * * * The term \u2018neomycin\u2019 as used in this application refers to either of the isomeric compounds or to mixtures of them, and the term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>\u2018neomycin complex compound\u2019 refers to one of the neomycins as defined above, neamine, or mixtures thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">With the foregoing as general background, we pass to appellant\u2019s statement in the specification that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-9\">\u201cThe novel derivatives of this invention are Schiff\u2019s bases which possess valuable inhibitory properties against pathogenic organisms and are hence useful in human and veterinary medicine. They also yield the parent neomycin or neamine compound upon treatment with acid, and are hence useful as intermediates in the preparation of purified neomycin, especially the recovery of neomycin compounds from fermentation beers or other such liquors, including the recovery of neamine from methan-olysis or hydrolysis reaction media.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">The specification also contains a general statement concerning how such assertedly novel derivatives are produced:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq8\">\u201cRecovery from the beers or other aqueous liquors according to the invention is generally as follows. The liquor is made alkaline and at least five moles of an aromatic aldehyde is added, based on neomycin content, preferably with vigorous stirring. The resulting precipitate is the Schiff\u2019s base, which can be separated from the reaction mixture by filtration. The Sehiff\u2019s base can be further purified, if desired, and used as such or it can be treated with acid to recover the neomycin compound which will be neomycin, i. e., Neomycin B, Neomycin C, or mixtures; or neamine, and will represent substantially the neomycin or neamine content of the original liquor. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">Thus the invention concerns an intermediate product, which is a Schiff\u2019s base<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> formed by reaction of neomycin in a fermentation beer or other aqueous solution with an aromatic aldehyde. The end product, a salt of neomycin and an acid, was old prior to appellant\u2019s invention. The intermediate product, the neo-mycin Schiff\u2019s base, is described in the specification as being \u201ccharacterized by biological activity comparable to that of neomycin or neamine products commercially available.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-12\">The claims on appeal (reproduced as an appendix to this opinion) are said to fall into four broad groups. The first deals with a process for recovering neo-mycin from fermentation brews which involves adjusting the pH of the beer, adding a specified aromatic aldehyde in order to precipitate the neomycin as a Schiff\u2019s base and then recovering the precipitated Schiff\u2019s base of neomycin from the fermentation beer (Cl. 24). When it is desired to recover the neo-mycin as an acid addition salt, the Schiff\u2019s base is treated with a mineral acid to regenerate the neomycin and the aromatic aldehyde, and the neomycin is recovered from the reaction mixture in the form of its acid addition salt (Cl. 25).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-13\">In the second group, appellant claims the neomycin Schiff\u2019s bases. Claims 1 and 32 define a neomycin Schiff\u2019s base in which the aldehyde may be selected from a class defined by a general formula. Claims 2 and 33-37 define a neomycin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>Schiff\u2019s base in which the aldehyde is specified. [E. g., salicylaldehyde (Cl. 2); benzaldehyde (Cl. 34).]</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">The third group of claims defines the process for malting the neomycin Schiff\u2019s bases (rather than recovering the neo-mycin from the fermentation brew). These are claims 10 and 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The fourth group of claims is characterized by appellant as defining a process for making neomycin salts. These are claims 13 and 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The examiner rejected all the claims on the basis of a single reference, Janot.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Janot is concerned with the antibiotic framyeetin, which is derived from a strain of bacteria identified as <em>Strep-tomyces T 59 </em>and is indicated as having a spectrum with points in common with the antibiotic spectra of streptomycin and neomycin. The article discusses the hydrolysis of framyeetin and reports on studies of the hydrolysis products which are identified as fractions A, B, C and D. Derivatives of fraction A, including the crystallized salicylidene thereof, are compared with the corresponding derivatives of neamine, and the molecular weight of the salicylidene is found to compare with the tetra-salicyli-dene of neamine, from which it is concluded \u201cthat fraction A is identical with neamine.\u201d The article indicates that the salicylidene derivative was prepared by reacting the base fraction A dissolved in water with salicylaldehyde to form a thick yellow precipitate which was then extracted and recrystallized from hot methyl alcohol in the form of brilliant yellow flakes. Analysis of the product indicated a molecular weight and percentage atomic composition corresponding to the tetra-salicylidene of neamine and that the amine base fraction A has the empirical formula C12H26O6N4, which is that of neamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">In summary, the Janot reference discloses a treatment of <em>neamine </em>which is comparable to appellant\u2019s process for producing <em>neomycin </em>Schiff\u2019s bases. The Janot process forms a Schiff\u2019s base of neamine in an aqueous solution as an intermediate product, precipitates that base, and crystallizes a salt of neamine as the end product. Thus the principal difference is that Janot is concerned with neamine rather than neomycin. This difference loses much of its significance, however, when the following excerpt from appellant\u2019s specification is considered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-11\">\u201c * * * The product is further characterized by low water solubility and solubility in acetone and low molecular weight alcohols. On treating the novel Schiff\u2019s base of neomycin * * * with a strong mineral acid, e. g., sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydriodic acid, phosphoric acid, and the like, the corresponding acid salt of neomycin * * * is obtained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-14\">In each instance, the omitted words (indicated by asterisks) are \u201cor neamine.\u201d Thus, when the application was filed, it appears to have been appellant\u2019s position that the invention pertained equally to neomycin or neamine.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is only after neamine compounds are shown to be old by the Janot reference that we find appellant shifting to the position here asserted, i. e., that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-15\">\u201c * * * there is no such art recognized similarity between neamine and neomycin that it can be properly held that it would have been obvious to one skilled in the art at the time the invention was made that neomycin could be substituted for neamine in the Janot process. The general principle of law that the application of an old process to a new and analogous material is not invention, or more aptly under the new Code \u2018is not unobvious\u2019, is inappo-site because it has not been established by the Patent Office that neo-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>mycin is an analogous compound to neamine. The contrary in fact is established by the great difference in structural characteristics and the difference m biological characteristics between neomycin and nea-mine. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Anx\">TTr ... We see no merit m this position. The application establishes that appellant rec-ogmzed the similarity of neomycin and \u2022 neamine with respect to: 1) their ability to form Schifrs bases m aqueous solutions, 2) the low water solubility of such bases, 3) their solubility in acetone or low molecular weight alcohols, and 4) treating the Schiff\u2019s base with a strong mineral acid to form the corresponding acid salt.</p>\n<p id=\"amv-dedup-0\">\u201e , , \u201e , , Whde the record before us does not contain the office actions an winch the Janot reference was first cited, it appears that, despite the arguments advanced m certain of the remarks appended to several amendments which are reproduced in the record, the examiner in the final action of September 26, 1960, considered at least partially the above quoted portions of the specification when he stated-</p>\n<blockquote id=\"az_-dedup-0\">\u201cClaims 1, 2 and 32 are again rejected as fully met by Janot for the reasons fully of record. These claims are drawn to a neomycin Schiff\u2019s base and as previously pointed out the instant disclosure appears to employ the term neomycin as in-eluding neamine. Note pages 1-4 of the disclosure. Applicant urged and submits exhibits seeking to show that the term neomycin does not in-elude neamine. The fact remains that the instant disclosure appears to employ the term neomycin as in-eluding neamine. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"afk-dedup-1\">\u201cClaims 10, 13-15, 24, 25 and 33-37 are again rejected as unpatentable over Janot for the reasons fully of record. It is again pointed out that no invention is involved in making the Schiff\u2019s base with neomycin in view of the Janot teaching of employing neamine. The specific reaction conditions etc. as recited in some of the claims are obvious to one skilled in the art.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4P\">It is appeiiant\u2019s contention, as stated in his brief that.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1F\">\u201cHe has provided a novel process for making his novel neomycin SchifFs baseg. Th\u00a1s process differg from that of Janot both in bei plied to a non.anaiogous material and invoIying different process con_ ditions \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"a4u-dedup-0\">Thus appellant\u2019s position appears to be 1) Hmf Janot\u2019s treatment of neamine produces a product _ which is neither chemically nor biologically closely related to neomycin and 2) that Janot does not disclose the recovery of neamine from a fermentation beer or any suggestion that it could be recovered by treating such a beer with salieyIa]dehyde. We shall consider thege itiong in the order s^a^ed</p>\n<p id=\"ApY\">fn affirming the examiner\u2019s rejection, board noted that the specification and claims as originally filed in the case at bar aPPlied appellant\u2019s process to both neamine and neomycin. After referring to this statement, appellant\u2019s brief asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"As-5\">\u201e, . , m. , , , ... This statement on its face is reversible error in view of In re et 'ab\u2019 P-2d CCPA (Patents) 1037, 18 U.S.P.Q. 340. In 7iew In re ,et a ' aPPeHant 18 entltled to have his invention appraised by what is tau^ht in the Pnor art&gt; not is found in his own discl\u00b0sure-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"At5\">As we view the matter, appellant\u2019s position is not warranted by the Ruff decisi\u00f3n. The facts here bring this case within the decision of In re McKee, 75 F.2d 635, 22 CCPA 1010. Here, as in Ruff case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"apf-dedup-0\">\u201cIt will be illuminating, perhaps, to contrast In re McKee with the present case. The invention there claimed was a method of slicing meat by first freezing it. The application <em>defined </em>\u2018slicing\u2019 as including sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>dividing \u2018in whatever manner may be employed, as for instance, by means of a knife, chopping tool, or saw.\u2019 The thus defined term \u2018slicing\u2019 was employed in the claims and the applicant himself had determined what it was to mean. The first thing to note is that the court fully agreed with the board that the claims, so written, <em>were fully met by the references because </em>the applicant had so broadened the meaning of \u2018slicing\u2019 as to read on chopping and sawing, which the references showed. When it was argued that claims specifically limited to the use- of a knife blade cutter should be allowed this court said,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-4\">\u201c \u2018The difficulty with this position is that the appellant, by his definition of the meaning of \u201cslicing,\u201d * * * considers a knife, a chopping tool, and a saw as equivalents. If he so considers and treats them, then he can claim no patentable distinction between them upon this application.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The problem in the present case is to get at the technical facts. As stated in Ruff:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-6\">\u201c * * * When a man, or a witness, or an applicant for a patent, without knowing how it is going to affect his interest, makes a statement which he later attempts to deny when he has found it is against his interest, he will not be believed unless he produces convincing proof of his later assertion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Here, arrayed against the statements of the examiner and the board and the disclosures of appellant in his application, we have only the unsupported statements of appellant\u2019s counsel in amendments and in the brief herein that neomycin and neamine are not so related chemically and biologically that a prior art teaching of forming a Schiff\u2019s base of neamine would make obvious to one of ordinary skill in this art the formation of a Schiff\u2019s base of neomycin. We do not consider such statement to constitute the \u201cconvincing proof\u201d to which reference is made in the Ruff decision. Indeed, we think the facts in the present case warrant us in here restating the following portion of the Ruff decision :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-9\">\u201cThe following cases might be cited for the proposition that an applicant\u2019s own showing of equivalence <em>may </em>be used as the basis for rejecting a claim, and the list is but exemplary. In re McKee, supra, the meat slicing case; In re Hartung, 121 F.2d 529, 28 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1364, disclosing a homologous series of catechols having 4 to 8 carbon atoms where the six carbon atom member was in the prior art; In re Lobdell, 167 F.2d 634, 35 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1091, showing brazing as the known equivalent of silver soldering to hold the cutting tips in tool shanks; In re Switzer [et al.], 166 F.2d 827, 35 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1013, carbon black and titanium dioxide as known equivalent inert fillers or pigments in a coating; In re Withington, 104 F.2d 192, 26 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1290, intaglio as the equivalent of cameo brand markings on a wooden handle; In re Lindberg, 194 F.2d 732, 39 C.C.P.A., Patents, 866, a hydraulic drive for the agitator in a tank versus a chain and pulley drive; In re Stewart, 222 F.2d 747, 42 C.C.P.A., Patents, 937, removing a film with a swab or with a spray of air and water. Some of these cases were cited by the board to support the Borcherdt doctrine and others were cited in the Borcherdt case [197 F.2d 550, 39 C.C.P.A. 1045] to support its dictum that the applicant\u2019s own disclosure of equivalence might be enough. There are many others, some more complex in their facts, but the principle running through these cases is basically the same in each. Even though a reference is not produced to show an equivalence <em>which is in fact art-recognized or obvious, </em>the applicant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>own express recognition of it maybe a sufficient basis on which to refute his subsequent argument that equivalence does not exist. We see nothing wrong with the \u2018Borcherdt doctrine\u2019 if it is kept within this limitation. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">In the present case, appellant\u2019s specification refers to neomycin and neamine as being known, commercially available substances at the time the alleged invention was made. The examiner stated that the fermentation beer, in addition to two forms of neomycin, also contains neamine; the following statement in appellant\u2019s brief bears this out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-6\">\u201cNeomycin is a product of fermentation. When the micro-organism, <em>Streptomyces fradiae, </em>is cultivated under suitable conditions, as is well known in the art, the fermentation beer contains neomycin B and neomycin C. Neamine is also sometimes formed in fermentation beers concomitantly with neomycin.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">In addition, the specification contains many statements, some of which we have quoted earlier in this opinion, which indicate an extremely close relationship between neomycin and neamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">Thus, we are inclined to view with suspicion appellant\u2019s present contention that neamine and neomycin are non-analogous materials. Appellant has made no showing of fact which rebuts the contrary statements made in his specification and the contrary findings of the examiner. We think these statements disclose such a close relationship between neomycin and neamine that it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art that the two substances were equivalent materials with respect to Schiff\u2019s bases and salts thereof, especially since both appellant\u2019s specification and Janot involve the formation of a Schiff\u2019s base formed by reaction of an aromatic aldehyde with a compound containing a primary amino group.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">With respect to recovery of neomycin from fermentation beers, it would seem to have been obvious to apply the techniques Janot used with neamine, which formed the unsoluble Sehiff\u2019s base precipitate. Therefore, appealed process claims 24 and 25, drawn to the method of recovering neomycin from a fermentation beer containing neomycin in aqueous solution, cover but an obvious use of the Janot process. Janot teaches that the analogous substance neamine forms an <em>insoluble </em>Sehiff\u2019s base precipitate when reacted with an aromatic aldehyde in an aqueous reaction medium. This clearly suggests the claimed method for recovering the analogous neomycin from any aqueous solution or medium in which it occurs, including the claimed fermentation beer. Consequently, the examiner and the board properly concluded that claims 24 and 25 would be obvious to one skilled in the art in view of the teachings in the Janot article.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-11\">In contending for the patentability of the process claims over the prior art, appellant states that he is unable \u201cto discern anything in the disclosure of the reference which is relevant to the recovery of neomycin from a fermentation beer.\u201d Since Janot refers to crystalline substances, appellant inquires how one could obtain crystalline neomycin since is it a non-crystalline material, and adds that there would be no way of knowing from Janot whether salicylidene neomy-cin would precipitate. He urges further that there is no suggestion in Janot of adding salieylaldehyde directly to the fermentation beer at a pH of 8.5 to 12; and that Janot employs a highly concentrated solution as compared with a fermentation beer. He also challenges and refuses to admit the board\u2019s statement that the hydrolysis of a Schiff\u2019s base is well known in the art and contends that even if this is true, the claimed combination is not obvious. However, for the reasons detailed at length above, insofar as this record establishes, neamine and neomycin are clearly analogous and closely related materials. Since the Janot article teaches that a Schiff\u2019s base of neamine is insoluble in an aqueous medium, it would seem obvious that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>Schiff\u2019s base of neomycin would also be insoluble in an aqueous medium \u2014 including that of a fermentation beer \u2014 and that neomycin could readily be precipitated therefrom as a Schiff\u2019s base.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">The appellant refers to the court\u2019s recent decision in In re Papesch, 315 F. 2d 381, 50 CCPA 1084; in an \u201cAddendum\u201d to his brief, as holding that the question of obviousness cannot be determined without considering both the structure and the properties of a chemical compound. He contends, therefore, that the rejection of the claimed compounds was error since the Patent Office allegedly ignored their properties and \u201cbased its holding exclusively on structural and process considerations.\u201d We do not agree with appellant\u2019s statement of the Patent Office position. Such a statement ignores what seems to be the fact- \u2014 that the prior art Janot process and product were in effect included in appellant's disclosure. Thus it was unnecessary to predicate the decisions below on the technical aspects of \u201cstructural and process considerations.\u201d It is this fact which readily distinguishes Papesch from the case at bar. Papesch involved claimed compounds which were, rejected on the bare disclosure of a prior art homologue, and this was done in the presence of an affidavit showing comparative testing of the prior art compound and the claimed compounds. The facts in the present case are entirely different. There is no comparative showing in the record, and the involved application, if it means anything, must be said to concede that there are substantially no biological differences between the claimed neomycin Schiff\u2019s bases and the known neomycin of the prior art. As appellant points out in his specification:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-5\">\u201c * * * The Schiff\u2019s base product obtained in this manner is characterized by biological activity comparable to that of neomycin or neamine products commercially available. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Thus appellant has acknowledged that neomycin retains its biological properties as a Schiff\u2019s base, and the record is devoid of any factual showing to the contrary with respect to neamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">While there are recitals in certain of the appealed claims of specific reactants and specific process conditions not found in Janot, it was the position of the examiner, affirmed by the board, that such reactants and process conditions would involve no unexpected result. Thus, as to claims 33-37, we agree with the board that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-9\">\u201c * * * we find nothing unobvious for one skilled in the art in that different compounds are formed (as to the tetra- and hexa- compounds) according to the aldehyde reacted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-10\">We also agree with the board:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-11\">\u201cIn order to form the aldehyde reaction product of neomycin, it would appear obvious for one skilled in the art to react the free base rather than the salt with the aldehyde. As appellant points out, the pH range of appellant\u2019s claims 10, 13, 14, 15, 24 and 25 embraces that of free neomycin. We agree with the Examiner that the proportion of aldehyde would be within the skill of the art. In re Swain et al., 33 CCPA 1250, 593 O.G. 3, 156 F.(2d) 239, 70 USPQ 412.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-12\">Appellant has urged the unobviousness of regenerating the neomycin from the Schiff\u2019s base and recovering neomycin from the reaction mixture in the form of its acid addition salt as claimed in claims 13, 15 and 31. As pointed out by the board:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-13\">\u201c * * * ii js we]j known in the art to hydrolyze a Schiff\u2019s base with acid to the carbonyl compound and the amine, thus forming the acid addition salt of the amine, in this case of the neomycin.
