We think the findings are justified and the order should be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">The Board found that the Company violated \u00a7 8(a) (1) of the Act through the following threats, during the Union organizational drive, of Personnel Manager Schroer: to Augustine, in the presence of other employees, that he, Augustine, knew how the Company felt about unions, and that employees at Bedford-Nugent<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> had lost time because of strikes and \u201cwe wouldn\u2019t want that to happen to us;\u201d to Barton, that employees had better think it over or be unemployed if the Union \u201cgot in\u201d because the president couldn\u2019t pay the wages the Union would set up and would sell the Company ; to Henrietta English, that the president would sell the Company before he would let the Union in; and to Welch, that he knew a \u201cfellow that was about 50 years old\u201d who went out on strike at Bed-ford-Nugent and that all the \u201cold man\u201d could do now was walk a picket line and that if the Union got in \u201cmore than likely we would all be out of a job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The Board found further violations of \u00a7 8(a) (1) through the following inquiries by Company supervisors which amounted to \u201cunlawful interrogation\u201d: Schroer\u2019s inquiry if Augustine had heard of any Union activities and if the employees had told him they had been contacted; and Store Manager Nunn\u2019s questions to employee Thiry whether a Union representative had visited him in his home, and later, if the Union man had returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\"> We think the Board could reasonably adopt the Examiner\u2019s crediting of the employees in what conflicts there were between their testimony and that of Schroer and Nunn. The Examiner was not required to infer that Nunn\u2019s inquiry was a \u201cspontaneous response\u201d as in N. L. R. B. v. Larry Faul Oldsmobile Co., 316 F.2d 595 (7th Cir. 1963), or that the Company was, after demand for Union recognition, merely inquiring into employee interest or checking the extent of the Union activity. He was not required to infer that Schroer\u2019s conversation of the \u201cold man\u201d at Bedford-Nugent was a. mere expression of opinion as that of president Bilton in Bilton Insulation, Inc. v. N. L. R. B., 297 F.2d 141, 143 (4th Cir. 1961). Finally, the Examiner did not think there were merely five \u201cisolated instances\u201d and we are not disposed, in our view of the testimony, to disagree-with his and the Board\u2019s view. The facts-here are far different from those in John,</p>\n<p id=\"b518-11\">S. Barnes Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 190 F.2d 127, 130-131 (7th Cir. 1951). We think: the Board did not err in concluding that, this conduct of the Company violated \u00a7 8-(a) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-12\">On the alleged unlawful discharge of' Barton, the question for the Trial Examiner was the Company\u2019s motive: whether it was for delinquency in his. duty as a meat-cutter on September 19,. 1962, or for his activities as one of the-two employee-instigators of the Union, movement in the summer of 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-13\">Barton worked for the Company as a relief meat-cutter for two years prior to-<em>his </em>discharge. Gaining an excellent reputation<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> he \u2019 was made a regular-meat-cutter on September 1, 1962 at theFairlawn Store. On September 19 he-worked from 8 a. m. to 8 p. m. His department head did not work that day, and' the assistant department head left at 4:30 p. m. Shortly thereafter, the store-manager told Barton to fill up the meat, counter and remove \u201cdark\u201d cuts of meat.. When the order was not complied within \u201c45 minutes\u201d the manager recommended Barton be fired. The next day he was discharged \u201cbecause of his capability and; he just didn\u2019t get along with the other-people in the department.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>14] We think the record as a whole supports the inference that Barton was discharged for his known <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Union activities and not for the incident on September 19. His lack of \u201ccapability\u201d on September 19, eight days after the Regional Director\u2019s direction of an election, is hardly consistent with Schroer\u2019s praise of him to the store manager on September 1 \u2022as an \u201cexperienced\u201d meat cutter or his praise of him two months earlier for his \u201cexcellent job.\u201d The disobeyed order on September 19, expressly blaming Barton for the \u201cdark\u201d meat<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> could strike the Examiner as a \u201cmere pretext to cloak the true ground for his discharge,\u201d in an antiunion atmosphere in which employees\u2019 rights were being violated. We conclude that even though the Examiner had \u201cno doubt\u201d a valid ground for Barton\u2019s discharge existed, the Board was justified, on substantial evidence, in deciding that the Company committed an unfair labor practice by discharging Barton for his Union activities. N. L. R. B. v. Howe Scale Co., 311 F.2d 502, 505 (7th Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">On August 2, 1962, the Union requested the Company to recognize and bargain with it, as representative of a majority of its employees in its meat departments, which the Regional Director later determined to be an appropriate unit. The Company argues that the record as a whole does not support a finding that the Union represented a majority of the meat department employees when the Union requested recognition. It challenges seven of the 22 union authorization cards \u2022signed by the employees in the 38 employee unit: one card, because, it says, it was signed by a part-time employee \u201cnot properly included\u201d in the unit; two others, because, it claims, they were \u201csigned as a result of Union threats;\u201d two, because their authenticity is not supported by substantial evidence; and two more, because, it says, the employees\u2019 signatures \u201cwere purchased\u201d by the Union\u2019s promise to waive its $75.00 initiation fee. We think that at least five of these cards were properly counted for the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">The part-time employee here is not merely \u201cextra Saturday help\u201d as in Canadian Fur Trappers Corp., 4 N.L.R.B. 904, 908 (1938), but is a \u201cregular part-time employee\u201d who does work \u201csimilar to that done by full-time employees in the unit,\u201d and has a community of interest strong enough in relation to regular, full-time employees to properly warrant her inclusion in the bargaining unit. V. I. P. Radio, Inc., 128 N.L.R.B. 113, 116 (1960), Southern Illinois Sand Co., 137 N.L.R.B. 1490, 1492 (1962). It follows that her card was properly counted.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">The finding that employee English was not threatened, by the Union, into signing the card is not clearly erroneous. And the Examiner, who saw and heard the witnesses, was not bound to infer from employee Dillon\u2019s \u201cequivocal\u201d testimony that she was threatened into signing the card. Their cards were properly counted.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">The signatures on the cards of the two employees absent at the time of the hearing were authenticated by Union representative Goss, who testified that both cards were signed in his presence and that he witnessed each signature. In view of the fact that no reason appears in the record to preclude acceptance of Goss\u2019 testimony as determining the authenticity of the cards, we cannot say the finding of the Board was not justified, N. L. R. B. v. Sunshine Mining Co., 110 F.2d 780, 790 (9th Cir. 1940), cert. denied, 312 U.S. 678, 61 S.Ct. 447, 85 L.Ed. 1118 (1941), and these cards were also properly included.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">These conclusions confirm the Union\u2019s majority status (20 of 38), and we need go no further for our decision that the finding of the Board, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>Union represented a majority of the employees in the meat department at the time it requested recognition, is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">The Board found that \u201cRespondent\u2019s refusal to recognize the Union was not based on a good faith doubt as to the appropriateness of the unit sought or the Union\u2019s majority status therein,\u201d and concluded the refusal1 was violative of \u00a7\u00a7 8(a) (5) and 8(a) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The finding was based on the facts that the question as to the appropriateness of the unit \u2014 the meat department employees \u2014 was not raised when the request for recognition was made; and that the Company made no effort to ascertain whether the Union in fact possessed a majority status, refusing to entrust the card check to the Indiana Secretary of Labor, as suggested by Goss, but not proposing a check by any other party; and on the Company\u2019s explanation of its \u201cgood faith doubt\u201d position \u2014 \u201cWe just felt we had a real loyal organization, and they were all happy.\u201d The Board concluded that since the Company made no attempt to learn the facts and \u201cdeliberately shut its eyes to the facts * * and assiduously avoided giving the union any real opportunity to substantiate its claims,\u201d its conduct was not indicative of good faith. N. L. R. B. v. Philamon Labs., Inc., 298 F.2d 176, 180 (2d Cir. 1962), cert. denied, 370 U.S. 919, 82 S.Ct. 1555, 8 L.Ed.2d 498. \u201cGood-faith doubt would have dictated immediate response stating candidly the Respondent\u2019s position.\u201d N. L. R. B. v. Howe Scale Co., 311 F.2d 502, 505 (7th Cir. 1963). The existence of a good faith doubt, in light of all the circumstances, raises mainly a question of credibility, N. L. R. B. v. Crean, 326 F.2d 391 (7th Cir. 1964), and even assuming the validity of the factors advanced by the Company that \u201ccould\u201d prove its \u201cgood faith doubt,\u201d we cannot say the Board erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">In addition to the Company\u2019s lack of candor, N. L. R. B. v. Howe Scale Co., 311 F.2d 502, 505 (7th Cir. 1963), and in view of the Company\u2019s conduct found by the Board \u2014 with respect to interference and coercion of employees ini the Union organizational period, the discharge of Barton for Union activity, and the specious challenges of employee cards while indifferent to any checking of the cards \u2014 we think the \u201cgood faith doubt\u201d defense is refuted by the record as a whole. N. L. R. B. v. Overnite Transp. Co., 308 F.2d 279, 283 (4th Cir. 1962), and that the conclusion of the Board is not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">For the reasons given, the order will be enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b517-17\">.
