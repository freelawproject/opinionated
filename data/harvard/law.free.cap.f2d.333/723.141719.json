Finding that the evidence in question might have been produced at trial if Brown had exercised reasonable diligence, and that it would not have materially affected the outcome in any event, Judge Anderson denied the motion after a hearing. We entirely agree with both conclusions, and accordingly affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-9\">The unlawful sale of which Brown was convicted allegedly occurred between 8:30 and 9:00 P.M., on the evening of July 29,1960, in Hartford, Connecticut. Brown\u2019s \u201cnewly discovered evidence,\u201d consisting primarily of the testimony of one Les Chant, was apparently intended to establish that the appellant had not, in fact, been in Hartford on the evening in question, but instead had been with Chant in Springfield, Massachusetts, listening to the radio broadcast of a baseball game.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-10\">As Judge Anderson noted, Brown has never explained to the Court\u2019s satisfaction why Chant, the clerk of the Springfield hotel in which the appellant resided at the time, was not called at the trial. We wholly concur in the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that the exercise of due diligence has not been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-12\">While this would be sufficient reason for affirmance, Thompson v. United States, 88 U.S.App.D.C. 235, 188 F.2d 652 (1951), we also agree that Chant\u2019s testimony would not \u201cprobably have produced a different result,\u201d Helene Curtis Inds. v. Sales Affiliates, 131 F.Supp. 119, 120 (D.C., S.D.N.Y.1955), aff\u2019d, 233 F.2d 148 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 352 U.S. 879, 77 S.Ct. 101, 1 L.Ed.2d 80 (1956), and would hence not have warranted a new trial in any event. Thus, Brown was positively identified at his trial by four government agents and a \u201cspecial employee\u201d as having consummated the sale of heroin in Hartford on July 29, 1960. Chant, on the other hand, was hardly positive of the precise date that he and the appellant had listened to the baseball game. As he testified at the hearing, \u201cit could have been some other day. I can\u2019t pinpoint it as to * * * any particular day. It\u2019s too far back to remember.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b772-13\">Judge Anderson, who had presided over Brown\u2019s trial without a jury, hardly erred in refusing to find that Chant\u2019s hazy recollections rebutted the conclusive prosecution testimony offered at trial, and we cannot so hold. \u201cA motion for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence is addressed to the discretion of the trial judge. In deciding it, he may utilize the knowledge he gained from presiding at the trial as well as the showing made on the motion. On an appeal from denial of the motion decision must turn on whether there has been an abuse of discretion in denying it. And the order will not be reversed unless the new material tends to \u2018furnish evidence of defendant\u2019s innocence,\u2019 and is such as would probably produce an acquittal.\u201d United States v. On Lee, 201 F.2d 722 (2d Cir.) cert. denied, 345 U.S. 936, 73 S.Ct. 798, 97 L.Ed. 1364 (1953). In the present case, Brown has clearly failed to make the requisite showing. The order is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
