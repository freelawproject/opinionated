Accordingly, he issued an order to cease and desist, designed to prohibit the practices found to be violations of the Federal Trade Commission Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">On review, the Commission accepted the examiner\u2019s holding that Mary Carter\u2019s advertising was not permissible because the \u201cfree\u201d second can of paint was not a gift or gratuity, though the Commission felt obliged to state in its decision that it did not thoroughly understand the hearing examiner\u2019s reasoning on this point, and in a detailed opinion <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> modified, and as modified adopted as its own, the initial decision and the order to cease and desist contained therein. Commissioner Elman filed a dissenting opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">It is the contention of petitioners: that the decision of the Commission is wholly unsupported by and not in accordance with the probative and substantial evidence and the law of the case; that on the one material issue of whether and how the advertising is misleading or deceptive there is no supporting finding; and that the decision of the Commission is arbitrary and capricious and not in accordance with law. Petitioners also contend that there were substantial errors in the exclusion of material evidence and that the order entered is too vague and imprecise to be meaningful, and that all of these are grounds for review and reversal by this court under the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1006-1009.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-11\">\u2022 As to the order <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> itself, it is petitioners\u2019 contention that it is no more than a generality of legal statement which lacks any precision of meaning adequate to satisfy the requirement of clarity and applicability which the Supreme Court has said is the essence of a Commission order. F.T.C. v. Henry Broch, Inc., 368 U.S. 360, 82 S.Ct. 431, 7 L.Ed.2d 353. For the reasons and upon the considerations hereafter stated, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-12\">The complaint and opinion of the Commission, Commissioner Elman dissenting, is that the second can is not \u201cfree\u201d because it is not a \u201cgratuity\u201d, that is the purchaser must buy one can to get the second can free, hence the cost of the second can is included in the price of the first can and the price paid is therefore the price of two cans rather than one can; and that it is misleading or deceptive to advertise that the second can is \u201cfree\u201d. The case, therefore, turns on and revolves entirely around Mary Carter\u2019s use of the word \u201cfree\u201d in its advertising. There is no question or issue as to the quality of Mary Carter paint or as to the double value which it gives the public. The claim of the Commission is, however, that there is something misleading or deceptive in Mary Carter\u2019s expressing and advertising the bargain given in the terms of every second can \u201cfree\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-13\">The petitioners insist: that the opinion of the Commission is a mere quibble and in addition it is contrary to its estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>lished and long time rulings; that in Matter of Walter J. Black, 50 F.T.C. 225 (1953) and Matter of Book-of-the-Month Club, 50 F.T.C. 778 (1953), the Commission held that just such a bargain as Mary Carter gives can be expressed and advertised in the terms of a second article \u201cfree\u201d with the purchase of one article ; and that the Commission enunciated that rule after the most careful consideration and rejection of the argument which it now advances, that the second article could not be considered \u201cfree\u201d because acquisition of the second article required the purchase of an article and hence there was no gratuity in the giving of the second article. In short, the transaction is the same as the well-nigh universal one cent sale practice where the merchants advertise that if you buy one article you can get another of the same article for one cent.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">The majority opinion of the Commission states that the facts in this case are distinguishable from the facts in the Black and the Book-of-the-Month cases. Petitioner, however, and we, as the reviewing court, are in the fortunate situation in this case that Commissioner El-man, speaking not as the scribes and pharisees and the bureaucrats do, but as one having authority, has clearly, vigorously and incontrovertibly pointed out in his dissenting opinion the fallacious and quibbling nature of the majority\u2019s effort to support its position and to distinguish the cited eases.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Further, Commissioner Elman rightly noted, as \u201cperhaps the most serious deficiency in the majority opinion\u201d, that \u201cnowhere does the Commission explain what was \u2018unfair or deceptive\u2019 about what Mary Carter did\u201d; and finally Commissioner Elman found the order issued by the Commission so \u201cindefensibly vague\u201d and \u201cpuzzling\u201d that he did not know how respondents could comply with it. It should be added that Commissioner El-man also aptly and devastatingly observed, \u201cAs a result, uncertainty and confusion are being introduced, needlessly and unsettlingly, into an area of business activity where businessmen and the bar have long and correctly regarded the Commission\u2019s position as definite and clear\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">Contrary to the tone and tenor of most dissenting opinions, Commissioner El-man\u2019s opinion, instead of being a polemic directed at sustaining his own contrary view, is devoted to a careful, thoughtful and positive demonstration that the Commission, in reaching its conclusion, had devoted its efforts to tithing mint, anise and cummin, while neglecting and disregarding the weightier things of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">We find ourselves in agreement with Commissioner Elman\u2019s dissenting opinion: that the opinion of the Commission is completely erroneous; and that its order is lacking in the precision and definiteness which the statute requires of such an order as this. We reject, as Commissioner Elman does, the Commission\u2019s opinion: that Mary Carter\u2019s advertising is misleading because \u201cThe second can of paint was not, and is not now free\u201d; that it was not, and is not now given without cost to the retail purchaser since the purchaser paid the advertised price; and that this was, and is now, the usual and regular retail price at which two cans of Mary Carter paint were ordinarily sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-10\">In short, we agree with Commissioner Elman\u2019s demonstration that in sustaining the complaint in this case and holding that Mary Carter\u2019s advertising is misleading and deceptive in the respects alleged, it is clear that the Commission has departed from its established rules, on which Mary Carter had \u201cevery right to rely\u201d, and has reverted to its discarded reasoning in the first Book-of-the-Month Club case. \u201cThis\u201d, as Commissioner El-man observes, \u201cit has not done forthrightly\u201d, however, but by purporting to find that this case is \u201cdistinguishable\u201d from the Black case, which it purports to still recognize as law. We agree with Commissioner Elman that the cases are \u201cindistinguishable\u201d and the decision of the Commission to the contrary is unsup--ported in law.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>The brief of petitioners has presented in a thorough-going and lawyer-like way petitioners\u2019 position. We are spared, however, the necessity of more thoroughly presenting their views and arguments by the fact that we find it sufficient to say that we adopt and approve the reasoning and the result in Commissioner Elman\u2019s dissenting opinion,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and particularly this concluding statement from it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-4\">\u201cThis brings me to what is perhaps the most serious deficiency in the majority opinion. The duty of the Commission in this case was to determine whether Mary Carter had violated See. 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act by engaging in any \u2018unfair or deceptive acts or practices\u2019. Yet nowhere does the Commission explain what was \u2018unfair or deceptive\u2019 about what Mary Carter did. The word \u2018deceptive\u2019 appears in the Commission\u2019s opinion on page 2 in a description of the allegations of the complaint and again on page 10 in the observation that a good motive cannot justify a deceptive practice. But we are never informed as to who is, or might be, misled by Mary Carter\u2019s \u2018Buy one and get one free\u2019 offer, or as to how that deception might be brought about.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-13\">Finally, Commissioner Elman noted<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that the Commission's order to cease and desist was \u201cindefensibly vague\u201d, particularly in the light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent call for Commission orders \u201csufficiently clear and precise to avoid raising serious questions as to their meaning and application\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-14\">It will be noted that throughout the briefs and arguments of the parties as to the error of the Commission, there is no claim that the Commission\u2019s error is in its findings of fact. Indeed, there could not be because the facts as to what the appellants did were undisputed. There was no evidence to the contrary of what they proved that they did, so that we are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>not confronted here with any question of the presumption attending the Commission\u2019s findings of fact. The evidence presented no conflict which would form the basis of such a finding, and the sole question presented here is a question of <em>law for the court, </em>whether the Commission\u2019s conclusions from the undisputed facts are legally supportable.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">In his annual message to Congress, January, 1936, the President, referring to the establishment of administrative bodies, declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-6\">\u201c * * * in thirty-four months we have built up new instruments of public power. In the hands of a people\u2019s Government this power is wholesome and proper. But in the hands of political puppets of an economic autocracy such power would provide shackles for the liberties of the people.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">Some ten years later, the President transmitted to Congress, with his full endorsement and the statement that it was a great document of permanent importance, the report of his Committee on Administrative Management, which, because of the growth and intensification of administrative legislation of private enterprise and other phases of American life, he had created, appointing to it wise and earnest men. In transmitting the report he took occasion to say that the practice of creating administrative agencies, which perform administrative work in addition to judicial work, threatens to develop a fourth branch of the government for which there is no sanction in the Constitution.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-13\">To this the Committee added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-14\">\u201cThere is a conflict of principle involved in their make-up and functions. * * * They are vested with duties of administration * * * and at the same time they are given important judicial work * * *. The evils resulting from this confusion of principles are insidious and far reaching. * * * Pressures and influences properly enough directed toward officers responsible for formulating and administrating policies constitute an unwholesome atmosphere in which to adjudicate private rights.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-18\">In June, 1946, the Congress enacted, and on June 11, the President approved the Administrative Procedure Act,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and thus there had at last come about an Ad-ministro-Judicial Process established by legislative sanction and judicial approval.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-19\">Because, as we have held above, the Commission\u2019s decision and order are not in accordance with law, its decision and order are reversed and the Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>is directed to enter an order dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b703-9\">. As pertinent, these are the facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHvq\">Mary Carter Paint Co. is engaged in the business of manufacturing, selling, and distributing paint under the trade name of \u201cMary Carter\u201d. At the time of the hearings, the company distributed its paints in more than 27 states of the United States through over 500 retail outlets, including both company stores and franchise dealers. Although still a small company in the paint industry (its share of national paint sales is under one percent), the company has increased its sales from one million dollars in 1955 to twelve million dollars in 1960, a growth achieved by increasing the number of retail outlets and bufiding the repeat business of satisfied customers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-11\">The basic business policy of Mary Carter, consistently followed over the past ten years, has been to manufacture and sell paint of high quality at a net cost to the consumer of half the amount he would pay for paint of comparable quality manufactured by leading national brand companies. This policy of giving \u201cdouble value\u201d is carried out in a merchandising practice of pricing a can of Mary Carter paint at a price comparable to the price of national brand paints of comparable quality, and advertising and giving the purchaser a second can free. Thus, typical Mary Carter advertising in newspapers, magazines, radio, television, store signs, lithographed can tops, and truck sides, states : \u201cBuy One, Get One Free\u201d ; \u201cEvery Second Can Free of Extra Cost\u201d; \u201cEvery Second Can Free\u201d.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-12\">Mary Carter\u2019s merchandising policy and the reason for it are specifically stated in advertisements which explain that Mary Garter paint is \u201cquality priced\u201d and that the company will not \u201csecond rate\u201d its paint with a low-price tag \u2014 a point of particular importance in a market in which the leading paint manufacturers have combined in a sustained publicity campaign to inculcate a public psychology equating quality with price. [Evidence on this latter point was excluded below, and the petitioner here urges that such exclusion was erroneous.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-16\">The quality of Mary Garter paint is not questioned. Indeed, at the hearing, Commission counsel contended that the quality of Mary Garter paint was not an issue, and the hearing examiner ruled that the evidence offered on the subject by Mary Carter was immaterial. The Commission has upheld that ruling. The evidence was taken for reporting, however, and both the evidence and the examiner\u2019s report of the evidence establish that Mary Carter paints are as good as, or superior to, paints marketed under leading national brand names at prices comparable to the single can price of Mary Carter paints. [The exclusion of this evidence constitutes one of petitioners\u2019 exceptions to the decision below.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-17\">In accordance with Mary Carter\u2019s consistent merchandising practice, the single can price of its paint is the advertised price for a single can and the only price at which Mary Carter paint can be purchased, the purchaser being entitled to receive without extra cost a second can of the same kind of paint or of any other similarly or lower priced Mary Carter paint. Naturally, the purchaser will usually take the second can, but this is op<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>tional with him; at times he takes only the single can, and the price paid is the same single can. price.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-7\">There was no evidence, at the hearing, of consumer complaints or of any deception of Mary Carter customers. The extent of consumer satisfaction with Mary Carter paints and with the value offered and given is indicated, however, by the company\u2019s increased sales and, particularly, its repeat-customer sales.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b704-8\">.

In the Matter of Mary Carter Paint Co. Inc. etc.-FTC at page-.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b706-7\">. \u201cThe Commission\u2019s order prohibits respondents from representing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-8\">\u201c \u2018(a) That any amount is respondents\u2019 customary and usual retail price of any merchandise when said amount is in excess of the price at which such merchandise is customarily and usually sold by respondents at retail in the recent and regular course of business\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-9\">\u201c\u2018(b) That any article or merchandise is being given free or as a gift, or without cost or charge, when such is not the fact. * * * \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-10\">\u201cA reading of the order invites this question: What must respondents stop doing that they are now doing? Paragraph \u2018 (a)\u2019 declares that they may not call any amount their usual and customary price if it is in excess of their usual and customary price in the recent, regular course of business. Obviously, this has as little to do with the case as Guide V of the Guides Against Deceptive Pricing. Respondents have never sought to represent their \u2018recent\u2019 prices; they advertise only their current prices. As it happens, however, their current prices are the same as their recent prices. Whether regarded as. a one-can or two-can price, respondents\u2019 advertised price of $2.25 per quart, for example, is their \u2018usual and customary retail price\u2019 NOW, and it is not in excess of $2.25 per quart, which is \u2018the price at which such merchandise is customarily and usually sold by respondents at retail in the recent and regular course of business\u2019. Does this mean that paragraph \u2018(a)\u2019 has no effect at all on respondents\u2019 advertising practice? Surely not, or the Commission would not issue it. But what effect does it really have, and how are respondents to comply with it? I confess I do not know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-16\">\u201cParagraph \u2018(b)\u2019 is almost as puzzling. Presumably, it is intended to require respondents to cease advertising \u2018Buy 1 and get 1 Free\u2019. But this cannot be deduced from anything to be found in the terms of the order. As the Commission\u2019s own troubles with the problem show, the definition of \u2018free\u2019 merchandise is no easy matter. Yet respondents are ordered, on pain of heavy penalties, to cease and desist from describing merchandise as free \u2018when such is not the fact.\u2019- Surely this provision, like paragraph \u2018(a)\u2019, is indefensibly vague, particularly in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent call for Commission orders \u2018sufficiently clear and precise to avoid raising serious questions as to their meaning and application.\u2019 Federal Trade Commission v.

BROWN, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ael-dedup-1\">(concurring specially):</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">I am in full agreement with the Court\u2019s result and with much of its opinion written by my distinguished Brother Hutche-son. With no purpose to prepare a polemic or tithe \u201cmint, anise and cummin,\u201d I would speak \u2014 \u201cnot as the scribes and Pharisees and the bureaucrats do,\u201d cf. Thompson v. United States, 5 Cir., 1964, 332 F.2d 657 (dissenting opinion) \u2014 but as a special concurring Judge should, a few brief words to indicate the views which lead me to decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">At the outset I am not troubled about the so-called undemonstrated deception. One thing clear is that Mary Carter\u2019s paint is not really sold at any of the advertised prices. Thus, the price of $6.98 for the first gallon, the second one \u201cfree\u201d is not the price at all for one gallon. Nor is it $3.49 (one-half of $6.98 for two gallons.) Rather, it is $4.50, represented by the cost of two-one quarts ($2.25), getting for each, another \u201cfree\u201d quart. For those who read and buy paint while running, I would suppose that Government might deem it appropriate to demand that at least one of the advertised prices be the correct one.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">But at issue here is something more fundamental than house paint, bargains, or the American habit of self-delusion on \u201cfree\u201d articles.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">Our complex society now demands administrative agencies. The variety of problems dealt with make absolute consistency, perfect symmetry, impossible. And the law reflects its good sense by not exacting it. But law does not permit an agency to grant to one person the right to do that which it denies to another similarly situated. There may not be a rule for Monday, another for Tuesday, a rule for general application, but denied outright in a specific case.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-10\">That is what the Commission has done here. The precise action done here is permitted by Black, 50 F.T.C. 225 (1953). And even more unequivocal is the \u201cFree Rule\u201d [50 F.T.C. 235-236] patterned on it, but which has the positiveness of a rule, not a judicial-like opinion expounding a principle. These offers meet fully, honestly, and in good faith the requirement of Paragraph (2) found in each. Although Mary Carter\u2019s offer of the \u201cfree paint\u201d is contingent on the purchase of a quart or a gallon, Mary Carter does not either (1) increase \u201cthe ordinary and usual price\u201d or (2) reduce \u201cthe quality\u201d ; or (3) reduce \u201cthe quantity or size of the article of merchandise\u201d which the customer is required to purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-11\">Nevertheless, the Commission now holds that Mary Carter may not do what the Commission\u2019s two pronouncements clearly permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-12\">I am not arguing for Black in perpetuity. It may be bad or undesirable. The \u201cFree Rule,\u201d emphatic as it is, may be worse. If so, the Commission should so declare. But so long as that is the rule, the Commission may not nullify it by individual decision while ostensibly holding it out as the standard for others.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-13\">With Black and the \u201cFree Rule\u201d not yet repudiated, Mary Carter is the victim of individualized discrimination. So long as Black stands, so long as the \u201cFree Rule\u201d stands, paragraph (2) must be fairly applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-14\">As I did with the Interstate Commerce Commission in Yellow Transit Freight Lines, Inc. v. United States, N.D.Tex., 1963, (3-Judge), 221 F.Supp. 465, 469-471 (concurring opinion), I think the Federal Trade Commission has to make up its mind.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
