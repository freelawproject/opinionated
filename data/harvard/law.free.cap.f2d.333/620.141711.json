Although fuller findings might have been helpful, we cannot say that Papalia has been prejudiced by their absence. See Rossiter v. Vogel, 148 F.2d 292, 293 (2d Cir.1945) ; Huard-Steinheiser, Inc. v. Henry, 280 F.2d 79, 84 (6th Cir. 1960); 5 Moore, Federal Practice \u00b652.06 [2] (2d ed. 1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">Papalia\u2019s contention that on the evidence presented at the hearing he was entitled to withdraw his guilty plea is only a disagreement with the district judge\u2019s conclusion. We have examined the evidence and hold that the district judge\u2019s conclusion is not clearly erroneous. Papalia did not sustain his burden of proving that he was not mentally competent when he entered his guilty plea and was sentenced. See Holmes v. United States, 323 F.2d 430 (7th Cir. 1963), cert. denied, 376 U.S. 933, 84 S.Ct. 704, 11 L.Ed. 652 (1964); United States v. Harris, 211 F.Supp. 771 (S.D.Fla.1962), aff\u2019d 316 F.2d 229 (5th Cir.1963).</p>\n<p id=\"AOd\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
