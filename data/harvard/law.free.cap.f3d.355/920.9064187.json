For the reasons that follow, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b951-4\">In 2002, two detectives in Grand Rapids were on surveillance duty in an area known to be used by drug traffickers. They saw a four-door Cadillac pull up to the curb and watched Carter and another individual run up to the vehicle. Carter looked around and conversed with the driver while the other individual interacted with the passenger. The two men entered the rear of the vehicle and drove off, with Carter sitting behind the driver. The detectives followed the vehicle until the Cadillac pulled into a driveway. One detective saw a great deal of commotion in the back seat of the vehicle when the detectives\u2019 van pulled in behind the Cadillac. The detectives observed the rear passenger-side individual immediately place his hands on the headrest of the seat in front of him. Carter, the other back-seat passenger, was observed leaning forward with his right shoulder, looking back at the officers while digging underneath the driver\u2019s seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">When the front passenger exited, several bags of marijuana fell from the shoulder area of his seat. This was directly in the area where the rear passenger-seat occupant had placed his hands. As one detective approached the vehicle from the rear on the driver\u2019s side, he noticed a .25 caliber pistol underneath the driver\u2019s seat toward the back.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">Carter was indicted as a felon in possession of a firearm. At trial, Sylvester Evans, the front passenger and owner of the vehicle, testified that he and the driver, Adowa Reed, were out to obtain some marijuana. They picked up Carter and drove to a house. When a van pulled in behind them in the driveway, there was a lot of commotion in the back seat. During this commotion Evans saw something in Carter\u2019s hand that resembled the pistol shown to him in court. Evans testified that neither he nor Reed had brought the pistol into the vehicle. Carter was convicted for possessing the pistol as a felon. No motion for judgment of acquittal under Fed.R.Crim.P. 29 was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-10\">Carter\u2019s presentence report (PSR) added a four-level enhancement under USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) for possessing the pistol in connection with another felony offense, the possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. Carter\u2019s companion, Mark Matthews, was convicted of this offense in state court. Carter did not raise any objection to the PSR or the guideline range computation when specifically asked by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-11\">At sentencing, the court interrupted Carter twice during his final remarks. After being asked personally by the court if he had anything to say before sentencing, Carter began with a few opening remarks and then continued into the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-12\">DEFENDANT CARTER: ... my purpose in speaking at this time is so the Court may reflect on me as a person and not so much my prior history. This is my\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-13\">THE COURT: Well, Mr. Carter, what is the most accurate predictor of the future, the past or what you tell me about the future? <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-14\">DEFENDANT CARTER: If you give me a chance, Your Honor, I\u2019m</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-15\">THE COURT: I\u2019m asking you a question. If you could just answer it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-16\">DEFENDANT CARTER: Excuse me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>THE COURT: What\u2019s the most accurate predictor of the future, the past or your promises for the future? DEFENDANT CARTER: My promises for the future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-4\">THE COURT: Oh, okay. Continue. DEFENDANT CARTER: Okay. This is my first and only chance to address the Court. Accordingly, I will speak briefly about the trial proceedings, the lack of evidence presented to the jury by the U.S. attorneys</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-5\">THE COURT: Sir, you were convicted. I don\u2019t want to hear any more about that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-6\">DEPENDANT CARTER: Okay. Okay, thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-7\">THE COURT: Continue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-8\">DEFENDANT CARTER: I\u2019ll just speak about my future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-9\">THE COURT: Please do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b952-10\">Carter went on to outline his future plans. Carter did not object to any of the district court\u2019s actions during sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-11\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b952-12\">A. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b952-13\">A review of the sufficiency of the evidence to convict, in the absence of a Fed.R.Crim.P. 29 motion, is limited to determining whether there was a manifest miscarriage of justice. <em>United States v. Carnes, </em>309 F.3d 950, 956 (6th Cir.2002). In his brief, Carter does not argue that there was no evidence to support his conviction. He further concedes that he cannot prevail upon this claim since this court can only reverse if the record is devoid of evidence pointing to guilt. <em>Id. </em>Carter\u2019s sole argument for reviewing the conviction is that his counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to make a motion for acquittal based on the insufficiency of the government\u2019s case. As the resolution of the ineffectiveness claim disposes of the sufficiency claim, we turn to it to address both issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-16\">B. <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b952-17\">Ineffective assistance of counsel claims are mixed questions of law and fact that are reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Fortson, </em>194 F.3d 730, 736 (6th Cir. 1999). Generally, this court does not review ineffective assistance of counsel claims for the first time on appeal, instead requiring a record be developed pursuant to a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>Id. </em>An exception exists when a record is adequate enough to address the merits. <em>Id. </em>As the sole claim for ineffectiveness is that Carter\u2019s counsel did not recognize the insufficiency of the evidence, which is entirely encompassed within the record, the issue is adequately developed.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-18\">Carter\u2019s ineffectiveness claim must establish that: (1) his lawyer\u2019s performance was deficient compared to an objective standard of reasonable performance, and (2) there is a reasonable probability that this deficiency prejudiced the outcome. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>306 F.3d 398, 422 (6th Cir.2002). Failing to make a motion for a judgment of acquittal that had no chance of success fails both prongs. First, counsel cannot be said to be deficient for failing to take frivolous action, particularly since a frivolous effort takes attention away from non-frivolous issues. Second, it is evident that failing to make a motion with no chance of success could not possibly prejudice the outcome.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b952-19\">There was no reasonable probability that a motion for acquittal would succeed. Carter stipulated to all elements of the crime, except for possession of the pistol. However, there was ample evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>dence that Carter possessed the pistol. Evans testified that neither he nor his companion brought the pistol into the vehicle. Evans saw \u201csomething\u201d that resembled the pistol in Carter\u2019s hand when a commotion started in the rear seat upon the approach of the officers. A detective saw Carter reach under the seat while looking back over his shoulder at the detective when he approached the vehicle. Both detectives observed Matthews, who was sitting in the rear passenger seat, immediately put his hands on the headrest in front of him, circumstantially removing himself from being the source of the pistol\u2019s placement under the driver\u2019s seat at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">Given this evidence, a Rule 29 motion would have had no chance of success, since \u201c[i]t is well established that a trial judge confronted with a Rule 29 motion must consider all of the evidence in a light most favorable to the government.\u201d <em>United States v. Head, </em>927 F.2d 1361, 1365 (6th Cir.1991). \u201cThe government must be given the benefit of all inferences which can reasonably be drawn from the evidence, even if the evidence is circumstantial. It is not necessary that the evidence exclude every reasonable hypothesis except that of guilt.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\"> Carter\u2019s attacks on the evidence in his brief are not directly aimed at any evidentiary deficiency, but at the credibility of the witnesses. \u201cIt is well settled in this Circuit that attacks on witness credibility are simply challenges to the <em>quality </em>of the government\u2019s evidence and not to the sufficiency of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Farley, </em>2 F.3d 645, 652 (6th Cir. 1993) (emphasis in original). \u201cIt is equally clear that issues of witness credibility are for the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As a Rule 29 motion did not have a reasonable likelihood of success, it cannot be said that Carter\u2019s trial counsel was ineffective on either prong of <em>Davis. </em>Additionally, since the record is not devoid of evidence of his guilt, Carter\u2019s sufficiency challenge must fail. <em>See Carnes, </em>309 F.3d at 956.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-8\">C. <em>Improper application of sentencing guidelines</em></p>\n<p id=\"b953-9\">Sentencing issues presented for the first time on appeal are reviewed only for plain error. <em>United States v. King, </em>341 F.3d 503, 505 (6th Cir.2003). Carter contends the district court erred by applying a four-level increase for possessing the firearm in connection with another felony offense. To establish plain error, Carter must first show that an error occurred. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b953-10\">The district court is required to add four points to the offense level if the pistol was possessed in connection with another felony offense. USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5). \u201cSo long as the government proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the firearm served some purpose with respect to the felonious conduct, section 2K2.1(b)(5)\u2019s \u2018in connection with\u2019 requirement is satisfied.\u201d <em>United States v. Spurgeon, </em>117 F.3d 641, 644 (6th Cir.l997)(quoting <em>United States v. Wyatt, </em>102 F.3d 241, 247 (7th Cir.1996)). \u201cA firearm is used or possessed \u2018in connection with\u2019 an offense if the weapon facilitated or potentially facilitated the felonious conduct, or emboldened the defendant during the felonious conduct.\u201d <em>United States v. Sanders, </em>162 F.3d 396, 404 (6th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-11\">The PSR detailed Carter\u2019s involvement during his possession offense with \u00e1 drug transaction for which his companion, Matthews, was convicted. Carter did not lodge an objection to the PSR; indeed, his counsel specifically accepted it. \u201cThe district court is allowed to accept as true all factual allegations in a presentence report to which the defendant does not object.\u201d <em>United States v. Levy, </em>250 F.3d 1015, 1018 (6th Cir.2001); <em>see also United States v. Garcia-Meza, </em>315 F.3d 683, 686 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>(6th Cir.2003)(no plain error where the district court accepts a PSR to which no objection was lodged). The court found, without objection, that Carter possessed the firearm in conjunction with a felony-drug offense. There was no plain error in this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">D. <em>Denial of allocution</em></p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">As Carter did not lodge an objection during sentencing, this court reviews his allocution claim only for plain error. <em>Garcia-Meza, </em>315 F.3d at 685-86.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(3)(C) requires the court to \u201caddress the defendant personally and determine whether the defendant wishes to make a statement and to present any information in mitigation of the sentence.\u201d Carter claims when the court stated it did not want to hear about the lack of evidence used to convict him, he was denied allocution. Denial of allocution is reversible error. <em>United States v. Riascos-Suarez, </em>73 F.3d 616, 627 (6th Cir. 1996). A denial generally occurs when a defendant is not, personally and unambiguously, invited to address the court before sentencing, <em>Green v. United States, </em>365 U.S. 301, 305, 81 S.Ct. 653, 5 L.Ed.2d 670 (1961), or when a court refuses to listen to the defendant\u2019s statement. <em>Li, </em>115 F.3d 125, 133 (2d Cir.1997) (\u201cRule demands that each defendant be allowed a meaningful right to express relevant mitigating information before an attentive and receptive district judge\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-9\">Allocution is the right to present a defendant\u2019s plea in <em>mitigation, see Green, </em>365 U.S. at 304, 81 S.Ct. 653, and is not unlimited. <em>Li, </em>115 F.3d at 133 (\u201c[A] defendant\u2019s right to allocution is not unlimited in terms of either time or content.\u201d); <em>United States v. Muniz, </em>1 F.3d 1018, 1025 (10th Cir.l993)(\u201c[T]he judge does not have to let the defendant re-argue the case at sentencing.\u201d); <em>United States v. Kellogg, </em>955 F.2d 1244, 1250 (9th Cir.1992) (\u201cAlthough the defendant has a right of allocution at sentencing, that right is not unlimited.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-10\">Defendants may address the amount or quality of evidence adduced at trial to explain their role in an offense or the severity of their conduct, <em>see Li, </em>115 F.3d at 131-35, but not merely to continue to deny guilt. <em>See Muniz, </em>1 F.3d at 1024-25. Addressing the evidence to show a mitigating role is particularly apt if a plea was not entered explaining a defendant\u2019s conduct and/or mental state, or if the defendant did not testify during trial. However, as the sole contested fact in Carter\u2019s trial was whether he possessed the firearm, this is not such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-11\">The court merely informed Carter it did not wish to hear an irrelevant sentencing argument which had already been properly made before the court during Carter\u2019s closing argument.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>ongoing interaction with Carter during al-locution evidenced a substantive colloquy bearing upon the sentence. <em>See R\u00edaseos-Suarez, </em>73 F.3d at 627. The court demonstrated attentiveness to Carter\u2019s allocution by informing him, after imposing sentence, which comments were ineffective and why, along with the court\u2019s approval of Carter\u2019s future plans. Therefore, as Carter was personally invited to address the court and then engaged in a substantive colloquy with the trial judge bearing upon his sentence, the requirements of Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(3)(C) were fulfilled. Since the court permitted Carter to discuss any relevant matters desired in relation to his sentencing during this colloquy, Carter -was not denied his right of allocution.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b951-7\">. This first interruption should be seen in the context of Carter\u2019s criminal history. Between the ages of 17 and 25, Carter had amassed 18 convictions, 5 other arrests and three separate pending charges in state court, two allegedly committed while Carter awaited trial before the district court. This had been outlined by the PSR before the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b952-14\">. \"An error by counsel, even if professionally unreasonable, does not warrant setting aside the judgment of a criminal proceeding if the error had no effect on the judgment.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 691-92, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b954-7\">. <em>United States v. Wolfe, </em>71 F.3d 611, 614 (6th Cir. 1995), set forth a de novo standard of review for denial of allocution allegations. However, in a case like Carter\u2019s, where the allegation is not that there was a complete denial but only an inappropriate limitation, the defense should indicate some type of discontent. In Carter\u2019s case, the allocution ended with \u2019\u2019[t]hank you for giving me this opportunity to be heard before the Court, Your Honor. THE COURT: Thank you.\u201d Neither Carter nor his counsel voiced any discontent that he was not able to personally address the court in a specific manner desired. <em>See also United States v. Li, </em>115 F.3d 125, 132 (2d Cir.1997) (contemporaneous objection to an inappropriate limitation of allocution found in the defendant's attempt to make herself heard by a court despite lacking a formal objection from counsel).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b954-13\">. Carter argues that he was compensating for his counsel\u2019s failure to address the sufficiency of the evidence at closing. This ignores the fact that his counsel gave a thoughtful and detailed closing argument addressing the weakness of the case against Carter. While not persuasive to the jury, it calls into question Carter's post hoc need to address the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>subject. At oral argument, Carter raised the issue of residual doubt as a proper mitigating subject to address in his allocution. Leaving aside the fact Carter did not raise this to the trial court, there have been only a few times that any legitimacy has been given to the notion that defendants have the right to argue their innocence during sentencing, even for capital defendants. <em>See Franklin v. Lynaugh, </em>487 U.S. 164, 173-74, 108 S.Ct. 2320, 101 \u2022 L.Ed.2d 155 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
