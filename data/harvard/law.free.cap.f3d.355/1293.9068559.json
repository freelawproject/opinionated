Skinner filed the instant petition, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, claiming that federal officials (1) planted narcotics in his prison locker; (2) illegally processed the incident report while he remained in segregation; and (3) pretended to give evidence to the Federal Bureau of Investigation to conduct an investigation. Skinner also alleged that his grievances were rejected and the staff tampered with his mail. The district court dismissed Skinner\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition for, among other things, failure to exhaust administrative remedies as required under \u00a7 1997e(a) of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA). On appeal, Skinner argues that the district court erred in determining that he had not exhausted his administrative remedies. Skinner also argues the merits of his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-16\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241. <em>Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-17\">After reviewing the record, we conclude that the district court did not err in determining that Skinner failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, although it did err in determining that the PLRA applied to Skinner\u2019s habeas petition. We, like several other circuits, have held that the PLRA does not apply to habeas petitions because (1) habeas petitions are not traditional civil actions; (2) Congress designed the PLRA to reduce frivolous civil actions from prisoners; and (3) the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), which affects habeas petitions and motions to vacate, was enacted two days after the PLRA. <em>See Anderson v. Singletary, </em>111 F.3d 801, 803-05 (11th Cir. 1997) (holding that the PLRA\u2019s filing fee provisions do not apply in \u00a7\u00a7 2254 and 2255 petitions); <em>see also Carmona v. United States Bureau of Prisons, </em>243 F.3d 629, 634 (2d Cir.2001) (stating that the PLRA does not apply to \u00a7 2241 petitions); <em>Walker v. O\u2019Brien, </em>216 F.3d 626, 633-34, 636-37 (7th Cir.2000) (holding that the PLRA does not apply to \u00a7 2241 and \u00a7 2254 petitions); <em>Blair-Bey v. Quick, </em>151 F.3d 1036, 1040-42 (D.C.Cir.1998) (holding that the PLRA filing fee provisions do not apply to habeas petitions); <em>Davis v. Fechtel, </em>150 F.3d 486, 490 (5th Cir.1998) (holding that the PLRA does not apply to \u00a7 2241 petitions); <em>McIntosh v. United States Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>115 F.3d 809, 812 (10th Cir.1997) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1295\">*1295</page-number>We have not conclusively determined whether, despite the PLRA\u2019s inapplicability to habeas petitions, a prisoner is still required to exhaust his administrative remedies in all habeas cases. <em>See Gonzalez v. United States, </em>959 F.2d 211, 212 (11th Cir.1992) (holding that prisoner who was denied parole was required to exhaust administrative remedies prior to filing \u00a7 2241 petition because \u201c[ejxhaustion of administrative remedies is jurisdictional\u201d); <em>see also Irwin v. Hawk, </em>40 F.3d 347, 349 n. 2 (11th Cir.1994) (detailing the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 administrative remedy procedures and requiring a prisoner to exhaust his claim administratively when seeking injunctive relief). Our sister circuits, however, have consistently held that prisoners must exhaust administrative remedies before habeas relief can be granted. <em>Carmona, </em>243 F.3d at 630, 632, 634 (addressing \u00a7 2241 petition); <em>Fuller v. Rich, </em>11 F.3d 61, 62 (5th Cir.1994) (addressing \u00a7 2241 petition); <em>Little v. Hopkins, </em>638 F.2d 953, 953-54 (6th Cir.1981) (discussing habeas petitions in general); <em>United States ex rel. Sanders v. Arnold, </em>535 F.2d 848, 850-51 (3rd Cir.1976) (same); <em>Willis v. Ciccone, </em>506 F.2d 1011, 1014-15, n. 3 (8th Cir.1974) (same). We agree with the reasoning of our sister circuits and hold that prisoners seeking habeas relief, including relief pursuant to \u00a7 2241, are subject to administrative exhaustion requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-5\">Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that Skinner was required to exhaust his administrative remedies and failed to do so. Because his failure to exhaust administrative remedies resolves this appeal, we decline to discuss the merits of Skinner\u2019s petition. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
