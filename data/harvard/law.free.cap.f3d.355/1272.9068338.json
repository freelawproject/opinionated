Ellison appeals the district court\u2019s order affirming the Social Security Commissioner\u2019s denial of his application for supplemental social security income, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 405(g), 1383(c). Ellison raises two issues on appeal. First, he argues that substantial evidence does not support the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (\u201cALJ\u201d) finding that Ellison\u2019s seizures resulted from noncompliance with medical treatment. Next, Ellison contends that the ALJ erroneously failed to fully develop the record as it pertained to Ellison\u2019s seizure disorder. For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm the district court\u2019s order affirming the Commissioner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-5\">Ellison, a 44-year-old male with a tenth grade education, applied for supplemental social security income on December 14,</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-6\">1998, alleging an onset date of May 15, 1985, due to \u201cHighblood Seizures, weakness in legs, feet, back problems.\u201d His application was denied initially and on reconsideration. Ellison then requested and received a hearing before an ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-7\">During the hearing, Ellison testified that he had run out of medicine and had gone without taking his medication for, at most, one day at a time, and he was able to purchase more medicine after borrowing money from his girlfriend. Ellison further stated that, after having seizures, he had gone to the emergency room at Oconee Regional Medical Center several times in 1999 and 2000. The ALJ then asked Ellison\u2019s representative whether he had requested current medical records from Oco-nee, and the representative answered \u201cNo.\u201d The ALJ noted that \u201cit sounds like we\u2019re missing a lot more from 2000 and 1999,\u201d and he directed Ellison\u2019s representative to obtain current medical records and lab reports from Oconee. Two months after the hearing, the ALJ sent Ellison\u2019s representative a letter advising that the ALJ had not yet received the medical records at issue and that he would begin working on his decision if he did not hear from the representative within ten days of the date of the letter. Ellison failed to respond to either of the ALJ\u2019s requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-10\">The ALJ eventually made findings in a decision that included the relevant medical evidence and witness testimony. The ALJ discredited Ellison\u2019s allegations of disability as inconsistent with the objective medical evidence, noting that Ellison had worked for several years as an automobile detailer despite his impairments, that Ellison\u2019s alcohol use aggravated his seizure condition, and that the medical evidence indicated Ellison\u2019s noncompliance with treatment. Additionally, the ALJ discredited as inconsistent with the medical evidence the opinion of examining physician Dr. James Baugh, who had opined that Ellison was totally disabled due to his \u201cuncontrolled Epileptic Seizures severe hypertension and other problems.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-11\">The ALJ found that Ellison suffered from seizures and hypertension and that he consequently lacked the residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) to perform any of his past relevant work. The ALJ further found, however, that Ellison retained the RFC to perform heavy work with some restrictions, including work that does not involve heights or heavy, dangerous, or moving machinery. Relying on the medical evidence, and testimony from a vocational expert (\u201cVE\u201d) and Ellison, the ALJ found that Ellison was not disabled as defined by the Social Security Act because he was able to perform other work that existed in significant numbers in the national economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-12\">The Appeals Council denied review of the ALJ\u2019s decision. On judicial review, the magistrate judge issued a report recommending that the Commissioner\u2019s deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>sion denying benefits be affirmed. Thereafter, the district court entered an order affirming the Commissioner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-4\">Ellison argues on appeal that substantial evidence dpes not support the ALJ\u2019s finding that his seizures resulted from noncompliance with, medical treatment. . Ellison maintains that the medical evidence refutes the ALJ\u2019s finding on this issue, and the ALJ erroneously failed to consider the effect of Ellison\u2019s financial condition on his ability to obtain treatment for his seizures. Additionally, Ellison contends that the ALJ erred by discrediting the opinion of examining physician Dr. Baugh.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-5\">\u201cWe review the Commissioner\u2019s decision to determine if it is supported by substantial evidence and based on proper legal standards.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1439 (11th Cir.1997). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cEven if the evidence preponderates against the Commissioner\u2019s findings, we must affirm if the decision reached is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Martin v. Sullivan, </em>894 F.2d 1520, 1529 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-6\">We have held that \u201crefusal to follow prescribed medical treatment without a good reason will preclude a finding of disability,\u201d and \u201cpoverty excuses noncompliance.\u201d <em>Dawkins v. Bowen, </em>848 F.2d 1211, 1213 (11th Cir.1988). Additionally, when an ALJ relies on noncompliance as the sole ground for the denial of disability benefits, and the record contains evidence showing that the claimant is financially unable to comply with prescribed treatment, the ALJ is required to determine whether the claimant was able to afford the prescribed treatment. <em>See id. </em>at 1214. The claimant in <em>Dawkins </em>testified at the administrative hearing that she was unable to take her prescribed medication because she could not always afford to refill her prescription. <em>Id. </em>at 1213. In denying benefits, the ALJ relied \u201cprimarily if not exclusively\u201d on evidence pertaining to the claimant\u2019s noncompliance with prescribed medical treatment. <em>Id. </em>at 1212. On appeal, we reversed and remanded the case, concluding that, because the ALJ\u2019s finding that claimant was not disabled was \u201cinextricably tied to the finding of noncompliance,\u201d the ALJ had erred by failing to consider the claimant\u2019s ability to afford the prescribed medical treatment. <em>Id. </em>at 1214.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-9\">This case is distinguishable from <em>Dawkins </em>because, unlike in <em>Dawkins, </em>the ALJ\u2019s determination that Ellison was not disabled was not significantly based on a finding of noncompliance. Although the ALJ, in discrediting Ellison\u2019s allegations of disability, noted that the medical record \u201csupports non-compliance on [Ellison\u2019s] part,\u201d a review of the ALJ\u2019s decision reveals that his finding on this issue was based primarily on the facts that (1) Ellison worked for several years in spite of his impairments, and (2) Ellison\u2019s use of alcohol aggravated his seizure condition. Moreover, as the ALJ expressly stated, he based his finding of \u201cnot disabled\u201d on testimony of a VE and Ellison\u2019s RFC, age, educational background, and work experience. Accordingly, Ellison\u2019s reliance on <em>Dawkins </em>is misplaced, and the ALJ\u2019s failure to consider Ellison\u2019s ability to afford his seizure medication does not constitute reversible error. <em>See id. </em>at 1212-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-10\">Additionally, the ALJ\u2019s consideration of Ellison\u2019s noncompliance as a factor in discrediting Ellison\u2019s allegations <em>of </em>disability is adequately supported by Dr. G.F. Garcia\u2019s opinion that \u201c[Ellison\u2019s] frequent seizures can be explained because [of] his subtherapeutic level of anticonvulsants, most likely due to his non-compliance.\u201d Finally, the fact that Ellison worked for several years in spite of his seizure disorder, and the medical opinions of Drs. Ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1276\">*1276</page-number>thur Schiff, Charles Bailey, David Williams, and Janet Rice, which indicate that Ellison\u2019s seizure disorder did not prevent him from meeting the demands of unskilled work, constitute substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s decision to discredit Dr. Baugh\u2019s opinion that Ellison was totally disabled. <em>See Oldham v. Schweiker, </em>660 F.2d 1078, 1084 (5th Cir. 1981) (holding that \u201cthe ALJ is free to reject the opinion of any physician when the evidence supports a contrary conclusion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-4\">Next, Ellison argues that the ALJ erroneously failed to fully develop the record as it pertains to his seizure disorder. Ellison concedes that \u201cit is appropriate to initially rely upon his representative, attorney or not, to obtain updated information,\u201d but nonetheless maintains that the ALJ was required to obtain medical evidence regarding the two-year period following Ellison\u2019s filing of his application for benefits. Additionally, Ellison contends that a remand is necessary because the district court, in affirming the Commissioner\u2019s denial of his application for benefits, mistakenly assumed that Ellison\u2019s representative was an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-5\">It is well-established that the ALJ has a basic duty to develop a full and fair record. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.912(d) (stating that \u201c[bjefore we make a determination that you are not disabled, we will develop your complete medical history for at least the 12 months preceding the month in which you file your application\u201d); <em>Brown v. Shalala, </em>44 F.3d 931, 934 (11th Cir.1995). Nevertheless, the claimant bears the burden of proving that he is disabled, and, consequently, he is responsible for producing evidence in support of his claim. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.912(a) (stating that \u201c[claimant] must furnish medical and other evidence that we can use to reach conclusions about your medical impairment(s)\u201d); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.912(c) (stating \u201c[y]our responsibility. You must provide medical evidence showing that you have an impairment(s) and how severe it is during the time you say you are disabled\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-7\">Ellison filed his application for supplemental social security income on December 14, 1998, and, thus, the ALJ was required to develop Ellison\u2019s medical history for the 12 months prior to December 1998. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.912(d). Ellison makes no claim that the ALJ failed to do this; rather, his focus is on the period after his filing. The ALJ, however, was in no way bound to develop the medical record for 1999 and 2000, as Ellison contends. Moreover, the record reveals that the ALJ did attempt to develop the medical record by requesting on two occasions that Ellison furnish him with the 1999 and 2000 medical records, but Ellison failed to do so. Thus, Ellison is not entitled to relief on his contention that the ALJ failed to adequately develop the medical record. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.916 (stating that \u201c[w]hen you fail to cooperate with us in obtaining evidence, we will have to make a decision based on the information available in your case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-8\">Finally, Ellison is not entitled to relief on his claim that the district court mistakenly assumed that Ellison\u2019s representative was an attorney. This claim arguably is a non-issue in light of Ellison\u2019s failure to follow through on the ALJ\u2019s explicit instruction to obtain current medical and lab reports from a specific hospital. Ellison, moreover, fails to explain how the district court\u2019s alleged mistaken assumption mandates a reversal of the ALJ\u2019s decision. Furthermore, to the extent that Ellison maintains that his representative\u2019s status as a non-attorney imposed upon the ALJ a heightened duty to fully develop the record, Ellison is not entitled to relief because he does not challenge the qualifications of his representative. <em>See Cowart v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number><em>Schweiker, </em>662 F.2d 731, 735 (11th Cir. 1981) (stating that \u201cthe ALJ\u2019s \u2018basic obligation to develop a full and fair record rises to a special duty when an unrepresented claimant unfamiliar with hearing procedures appears before him\u2019 \u201d); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1505 (providing that a claimant may be represented by an attorney or a qualified non-attorney).</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that Ellison\u2019s noncompliance with prescribed medical treatment, which the ALJ used as a factor in discrediting his allegations of disability, is supported by substantial evidence. We further conclude that Ellison has failed to demonstrate that the ALJ erroneously failed to develop a full and fair record. We, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
