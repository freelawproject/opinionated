This is a bill in equity to test the constitutionality of the \u201cSlum Clearance and Redevelopment Authority Law.\u201d P. &amp; S.

Further, the plaintiffs pray that the court decree that the resolution of the City Council creating the Slum Clearance and Redevelopment Authority and the council order authorizing the $60,000 payment are \u201cillegal and invalid and that (the 1951 Act) is unconstitutional and void and in violation of the Constitution of this State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">A temporary injunction issued and is now in effect.

The City Council in February 1952 de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>dared \u201cthat one or more slum or blighted areas exist . . . and that the redevelopment of such area or areas is necessary in the interest of the public health, safety, morals or welfare of the residents . . .\u201d, voted to authorize \u201ca public body corporate and politic to be known as the Slum Clearance and Redevelopment Authority . . .\u201d, approved the exercise of the powers granted in the 1951 Act, and appointed commissioners of the Authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">It is specifically agreed that \u201call of the steps required by (the 1951 Act) for the creation of the Slum Clearance and Redevelopment Authority and the entitlement of said Authority to transact business and exercise its powers have been taken and are completed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Under the Housing Act of 1949 (42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1451 et seq.) the Federal Government may \u201cto assist local communities in eliminating their slums and blighted areas and in providing maximum opportunity for the redevelopment of project areas by private enterprise . . ., make temporary and definitive loans to local public agencies for the undertaking of projects for the assembly, clearance, preparation, and sale and lease of land for redevelopment.\u201d Capital grants may also be made to enable the local \u201cagencies to make land in project areas available for redevelopment at its fair value for the uses specified in the redevelopment plans: . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">The Federal Government has reserved $895,000 for capital grants in Portland, has advanced $14,787 used by the Authority in preparation of preliminary plans and surveys leading to the selection of a project area, designated as the Vine-Deer-Chatham Project Area, and has allocated to the Authority $14,427 for preparation of final plans and surveys of the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">The capital grant, we read in the agreed statement, \u201cwill be in an amount not exceeding two-thirds of the net cost of redeveloping the project provided that the City of Portland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>will provide the remaining one-third net cost by the provision of \u2018local grants-in-aid\u2019, which may be in the form of (1) cash grants, (2) donations of land and demolition or removal of site improvements, and (3) the provision of parks, playgrounds and public buildings or facilities necessary to support the new uses of the land in said project area in accordance with the redevelopment plan, and that in connection with said Vine-Deer-Chatham project the City of Portland will provide specific \u2018local grants-in-aid\u2019 in the form of cash, donation of land, and certain site improvements, and said City has appropriated a sum of Sixty Thousand ($60,000.00) Dollars as a local cash \u2018grants-in-aid.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">After stating findings upon the physical characteristics of the project area \u201cof 5.49 acres which is predominately residential but contains some commercial and industrial uses and some vacant land\u201d disclosed in \u201crecent extensive surveys,\u201d the agreement of facts continues with a comparison in recent periods of certain conditions within the area and within the entire city. The rate is given here for the area in terms of the city average: juvenile delinquency 4.2; tuberculosis 2.3; arrests for drunkenness 3.6; fires 4.4; social welfare contacts 1.5 to 2.7; active recipients of welfare from the city 5.25.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">In October 1953 the Authority found, determined and declared the Vine-Deer-Chatham Project Area a blighted area within the 1951 Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">\u201cThat it is the intention of the Slum Clearance and Redevelopment Authority and the City of Portland with the financial assistance of the United States of America to prepare and adopt or cause to be prepared and adopted a redevelopment plan for such project area and (1) to acquire by purchase or eminent domain all of the land, structures, and improvements in the Vine-Deer-Chatham Project Area, including structures and improvements not in themselves deteriorated, but excepting certain buildings whose present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>use conforms to plans for the redevelopment of this area, (2) to clear said Project Area by demolition or removal of existing buildings, structures, streets, utilities and other improvements thereon, and to install, construct, and reconstruct streets, utilities, and site improvements considered essential to the preparation of sites for uses in accordance with a redevelopment plan, and (3) to sell, lease, and otherwise make available to individuals and private or public corporations the land in said project area for commercial, industrial, or other use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-3\">The activities set forth above are necessary for the redevelopment of the project area as contemplated by the Authority and the city. The $60,000 authorized to be paid by the city will constitute a portion of the local grants-in-aid. Unless restrained, the City Treasurer will pay and the Authority will expend the authorized $60,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">The issue on which the case hinges is whether clearance and redevelopment of the blighted area, known as the Vine-Deer-Chatham Project Area, under the 1951 Act is a <em>public use </em>within the meaning of our State constitution. If it is a public use, then the expenditure of public money and the taking by eminent domain are constitutional, otherwise not.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">We may at the outset eliminate certain of the issues raised in the fourteenth paragraph of the bill, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\"><em>First: </em>If the proposed action passes the hurdle of the State constitutional provision with respect to eminent domain, we need not consider the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. We may safely say that the provisions of our state constitution are not of a broader scope than the 14th Amendment. The judgment of the highest court of a state upon what should be deemed a \u201cpublic use\u201d is entitled to the highest respect. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>City of Portland, </em>245 U. S. 217, 221 (1917).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number><em>Second: </em>There is no unauthorized delegation of legislative power under the 1951 Act. Assuming the constitutional right in the State to expend public money and to exercise the right of eminent domain, the Legislature may entrust the power to instruments of its choosing, as here the City of Portland, a municipal corporation, and the Slum Clearance and- Redevelopment Authority, \u201ca public body corporate and politic, exercising public and essential governmental functions.\u201d Section 5 of 1951 Act. <em>Riche </em>v. <em>Bar Harbor Water Co., </em>75 Me. 91 (1883); <em>Ulmer </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>98 Me. 579, 57 A. 1001, 66 L. R. A. 387 (1904); <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Gerald, </em>100 Me. 351, 61 A. 785 (1905); <em>Hayford </em>v. <em>Bangor, </em>102 Me. 340, 66 A. 731 (1907); <em>Bowden </em>v. <em>York Shore Water Co., </em>114 Me. 150, 95 A. 779 (1915); <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Water District, </em>124 Me. 63, 126 A. 162 (1924); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Power Co., </em>125 Me. 238, 132 A. 740 (1926).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\"><em>Third: </em>The complaint that the 1951 Act authorizes the loan of the credit of the state is answered by the provision of the 1951 Act expressly stating otherwise. See Section 10 of 1951 Act, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">There are certain basic principles upon which all are agreed. First: Taxation must be for a public purpose or use, i.e., for the \u201cbenefit of the people,\u201d and a taking by eminent domain \u201cfor public uses.\u201d Maine Constitution, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">For our purposes it is unnecessary to distinguish \u201cpublic use\u201d in taxation from \u201cpublic use\u201d in eminent domain. The latter has been held to be much more restricted in meaning than the former. <em>Opinion of Justices, </em>118 Me. 503, 513, 106 A. 865 (1919). It is apparent that without the right of eminent domain the purposes of the Act cannot be carried out. Accordingly, the constitutionality of the Act may be tested by reference only to the principles of the law of eminent domain. Without eminent domain the Act fails; with it, the public use or purpose of taxation is established. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Second: \u201cWhether the public exigency requires the taking of private property for public uses is a legislative question, the determination of which by the legislature is final and conclusive. . . . Whether the use for which such taking is authorized is a public use is a judicial question for the determination of the court.\u201d <em>Kennebec Water District </em>v. <em>Waterville, </em>96 Me. 234, 241, 52 A. 774, 777 (1902); <em>Ulmer </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., supra; Brown </em>v. <em>Gerald, supra. </em>Third: Whether a given use of public moneys is public in nature is a matter for determination by the courts. <em>Private use: Allen </em>v. <em>Inhabitants of Jay, </em>60 Me. 124 (1871) (loan by town to manufacturing concern); <em>Brewer Brick Co. </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>62 Me. 62 (1873) (exemption of manufacturing plant from taxation). <em>Public use: Laughlin </em>v. <em>City of Portland, </em>111 Me. 486, 90 A. 318 (1914) (Portland municipal fuel yard); <em>State of Maine </em>v. <em>Vahlsing, Inc., </em>147 Me. 417, 88 A. (2nd) 144 (1952) (potato tax). Fourth: There is a strong presumption that a statute is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">In discussing the power of the Legislature, Justice Thaxter said, in <em>State of Maine </em>v. <em>Vahlsing, supra, </em>at page 430:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-6\">\u201cUnless it has clearly exceeded its constitutional powers in so doing, its action must be sustained, All rational doubts as to the constitutionality of statutes must be resolved in favor of the constitutionality thereof. Although it is the duty of the court to declare acts which transcend the powers of the legislature void, this judicial duty is one of gravity and delicacy and it is only when there are no rational doubts which may be resolved in favor of the constitutionality of the statute that the inherent power of the court to declare statutes unconstitutional should be exercised.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">In the words of justice, later Chief Justice Cornish, in the <em>Laughlin </em>case, <em>supra, </em>at page 489:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-10\">\u201cThe court is bound to assume that, in the passage of any law, the Legislature acted with full knowledge of all constitutional restrictions and in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>telligently, honestly and discriminatingly decided that they were acting within their constitutional limits and powers. That determination is not to be lightly set aside. It is not enough that the court be of the opinion that had the question been originally submitted to it for decision it might have held the' contrary view. The question has been submitted in the first instance to the tribunal designated by the Constitution, the Legislature, and its decision is not to be overturned by the court unless no room is left for rational doubt. All honest and reasonable doubts are to be resolved in favor of the constitutionality of the act. This healthy doctrine is recognized as the settled policy of this court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">See also <em>Ulmer </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., supra, </em>and <em>Morris et al.

(2nd) 556 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">' In applying the principles of law to the situation before us, we must keep in mind that the decisive question turns upon the meaning of \u201cpublic use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">The Legislature has stated there are two public uses; first, the clearance of the \u201cblighted area\u201d as in the instant case, or the slum, and second, the redevelopment of the cleared area, under restrictions designed to prevent the recurrence of the \u201cblight\u201d or slum. This redevelopment may be accomplished by sale or lease of so much of the redeveloped area for private purposes as may not be utilized for public purposes, such as parks or schools. Section 7(a) of the Act, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">The clearance of the \u201cblighted area\u201d in our view is the use of property for purposes of public health, morals, safety and welfare. The \u201cpublic use\u201d within the meaning of our constitution lies in the removal of breeding grounds of disease, juvenile delinquency, and other social evils.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-9\">\u201cThe elimination of slums can be found to be a direct benefit and advantage to all of the people, to be a matter not readily approached through pri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>vate initiative but demanding co-ordinated effort by a single authority, to be in line with the purposes of promoting the public safety, health and welfare for which the government of the Commonwealth was established, and to require for its successful accomplishment the exercise of the power of eminent domain. It may well be deemed to rise to the dignity of a public service.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-5\"><em>Allydonn Realty Corp. </em>v. <em>Holyoke Housing Authority, </em>304 Mass. 288, 23 N. E. (2nd) 665 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">With the \u201cpublic exigencies\u201d we are not as a court concerned. On this condition upon the exercise of the right to take property by eminent domain, the Legislature has spoken. It has declared in substance that regulatory measures designed to control the use of his property by an individual cannot remedy \u201cthe menace,\u201d and that the clearance and redevelopment of the infected area is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">There is no element of private use in the. removal of the conditions of blight. Great public purposes are thereby served and the entire community will benefit. For the moment we pass the question of redevelopment. If there is a \u201cuse\u201d within the constitution the use is \u201cpublic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">It is not necessary, in our view, that an active use be contemplated in a taking by eminent domain. The use may be negative in character. The prevention of evil may constitute a use, and as here a public use. Land may be taken to protect a public water supply, and so here land may be taken to protect the community against the destructive forces mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">In determining whether a given use is public in nature, we must consider existing conditions. It was well said in the <em>Laughlin </em>case, <em>supra, </em>at page 492:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-10\">\u201c. . . what could not be deemed a public use a century ago, may, because of changed economic and industrial conditions, be such today. Laws which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>were entirely adequate to secure public welfare then may be inadequate to accomplish the same results now.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">In the recent case of <em>State of Maine </em>v. <em>Vahlsing, Inc., supra, </em>Justice Thaxter said, at page 426:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-5\">\u201cAdmittedly the line of demarcation between a public and a private use is not always easy to draw. Whether a use is public or private is a question of law for the court. This question must be determined by the application of established legal principles to the then existing facts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">We find nothing in the opinions of our court that require us to reach a different result. The principle that \u201cpublic use\u201d in eminent domain means use by the public, or employment by the public, in contrast with public advantage, is well and firmly established. <em>Opinion of Justices, supra, </em>at page 514; <em>Paine </em>v. <em>Savage, </em>126 Me. 121, 136 A. 664 (1927); <em>Haley </em>v. <em>Davenport et al., </em>132 Me. 148, 168 A. 102 (1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">In general, our cases deal with whether a proposed active use will be for public or private use. For example, a water storage reservoir to increase value and capacity of water powers, <em>Opinion of Justices, supra, </em>at page 508; protection of public water supply, <em>Bowden </em>v. <em>York Shore Water Co., supra; </em>a private logging road, <em>Paine </em>v. <em>Savage, supra; </em>a drain across a neighbor\u2019s land, <em>Haley </em>v. <em>Davenport, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">The application of the \u201cuse or employment by the public\u201d rule is less difficult or at least more readily apparent in cases where there is an active use of the property for a given purpose. If active use by the public in the sense that property of a public utility is so used, is an essential requirement under our constitution for the taking of property by eminent domain, then the State is helpless to take necessary action for purposes of public health, morals, safety or welfare. We do not believe that our constitution has so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>limited the exercise of proper and necessary governmental functions by the Legislature. To this point, namely, the clearance of the blighted area, we find nothing unconstitutional in the 1951 Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-3\">The determination of whether an area is \u201cblighted\u201d or \u201cslum\u201d under the statute must rest upon facts directly bearing upon the public health, safety, morals or welfare. Consideration of other facts not so grounded, however, does not affect the validity of the finding, if the pertinent facts are in themselves sufficient to show the \u201cblighted\u201d or \u201cslum\u201d condition. The Vine-Deer-Chatham Project Area is properly a \u201cblighted area\u201d under this test.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">Several of the conditions stated in the statute in clauses 1 and 2 of Section 3 (g) <em>supra, </em>and particularly in clause 2, do not in our view touch upon a public use. Examples are found in \u201cfaulty lot layout,\u201d \u201cdeterioration of site,\u201d \u201cdiversity of ownership,\u201d \u201cdefective or unusual conditions of title,\u201d \u201cimproper subdivision or obsolete platting,\u201d or \u201cmixture of incompatible land uses.\u201d Nor are public uses involved in correcting a condition from which an area \u201csubstantially impairs or arrests the sound growth of the municipality, or constitutes an economic or social liability.\u201d The public use, as we have said, is found in the course of conditions harmful to the public health, safety, morals or welfare.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Further, we do not in this opinion pass upon the constitutionality of Section 9 of the Act, <em>supra, </em>relating to the \u201cAcquisition and development of undeveloped vacant land.\u201d Our discussion is confined to the validity of the Act with reference to the action here taken and proposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">After the clearance of the blighted area, the Authority is faced with the question of its future use. We have seen that the redevelopment of the area, with disposal of parts thereof for private use with restrictions to prevent recur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>rence of the blight, is a second purpose of the Act. Section 2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Taken alone, the redevelopment of a city is not, in our view, a \u201cpublic use\u201d for which either taxation or taking by eminent domain may properly be utilized.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">However beneficial it might be in a broad sense, it would clearly be unconstitutional for the Legislature to provide for the taking of any area in a city for the purpose of redevelopment by sale or lease for private purposes. Such a proposal would amount to no more, than the taking of A\u2019s property for sale or lease to B on the ground that B\u2019s use would be economically or socially more desirable.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">In the instant case redevelopment of the \u201cblighted area\u201d is, in our view, a secondary or minor purpose. The first and main purpose of the Legislature is not to redevelop Portland, but to clear away blighted areas and slums and to prevent their recurrence. If the only uses for which a blighted area or slum may be put when cleared must be uses public in nature by the test of active employment as, for example, parks, playgrounds, schools, municipal buildings and the like, there would be no occasion whatsoever for the 1951 Act. A taking for such public uses requires no consideration of the problems of the slum or blighted area. In brief, the purpose of redevelopment is not the dominant purpose of the Act. Compare <em>Opinion of Justices, supra, </em>at page 513, \u201cThe dominant purpose here (water storage reservoir) is for private benefit and not for the \u2018benefit of the people,\u2019 and therefore the power of taxation to promote it does not exist,\u201d and <em>Bowden </em>v. <em>York Shore Water Co., supra, </em>in which it was held the real purpose of the taking was to serve a private use of protection of timberlands from fire, and not a public use of protection of a public water supply.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">Property may be taken \u201cfor public uses\u201d to carry out the main purpose of the Legislature under the 1951 Act. And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>further, the facts show that the City Council and Authority have acted and propose to act in good faith to carry out such main purpose. See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Power Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Plainly, redevelopment of the area is an essential purpose of the Act. It must be recognized that a large part of the area and perhaps as much as is now in private hands will return to private uses after the cleansing process of removal of the infection. From the disposal of the area to private uses the cost of the project will in part be recouped. The Federal Government, the Authority, and the city all have an interest in the future of the area from the viewpoint of total expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">There will be, however, in the private uses within the area in the future this significant difference from the past. Under the Act it will be the obligation of the Authority to make suitable provision in disposing of the property for the purpose of preventing a recurrence of the evils eliminated. In a limited sense the <em>public use </em>of the area will continue. Private uses will be permitted, but only to the extent the purposes of public health, morals, safety and welfare benefited by the clearance of the area remain unaffected.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Without question, the Authority will be in the business of selling and leasing real estate within the area for private purposes. This situation arises only as a result of the public uses for which it acquired and cleared the area. The disposal of the property, particularly in light of required restrictions to prevent the recurrence of the evil conditions, is not an unreasonable method of returning to private use property no longer needed in its entirety by the Authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">The constitutionality of slum clearance and urban redevelopment statutes alike in principle if not in detail with our 1951 Act is upheld by the great weight of authority in other jurisdictions. Only Florida and Georgia have taken a contrary view.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Typical cases are: <em>Ajootian </em>v. <em>Providence Redevelopment Agency, </em>91 A.
