We are not here concerned with plaintiffs\u2019 due care, or damages. Our duty \u201cis simply to determine whether, upon the evidence, under the rules of law, the jury could properly have found for the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford R.R., </em>111 Me. 263, 88 A. 988 (1913); <em>Glazier </em>v. <em>Tetrault, </em>148 Me. 127, 90 A. (2nd) 809 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">From the record a jury could find the situation here set forth briefly and not in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">In May 1949 the plaintiffs employed the defendant to make alterations in the plumbing in \u201cRockhurst Cottage,\u201d a tourist home, for the purpose of improving the water service on the third floor. The system was changed from low to high pressure. The municipal water pressure of about eighty pounds was reduced by a pressure reducing valve to between forty-five and fifty pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">In the kitchen suspended from the ceiling was a hot water tank or boiler at least thirty-five years old built \u201cfor a low pressure tank . . . any plumber could tell.\u201d The water was heated ordinarily by the kitchen range and also when needed by a \u201cbooster\u201d heater in the basement.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">The system operated without incident until the plaintiffs for the first time caused the \u201cbooster\u201d heater to be put into use on July 17th. Within a few hours Mrs. McCaffrey, a plaintiff, noticed a small leak in the tank, and then three or four leaks ... \u201cit kept getting worse in seconds.'. ..\u201d At her urgent request the defendant sent two employees to the cottage, who warned Mrs. McCaffrey and her daughter to get away from the tank, shut off the water and opened faucets. \u201cJust then there was a terrific noise and I (Mrs. McCaffrey) thought there was dynamite or something exploded, and the boiler folded right up. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">The basic claim of negligence in the declaration is that the defendant in changing the system from an open or low <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>pressure-to a closed or high pressure system \u201cfailed to install a relief valve in the proper place above said boiler, but instead installed the relief valve for said boiler in the basement of said house under said boiler.\u201d There was no such valve above the boiler. .</p>\n<p id=\"b72-3\">Mr. Graham, a' plumber, testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-4\">\u201cQ. Referring to the plan up on the board, in accordance with this Code (State Plumbing Code in evidence) where should the temperature relief valve be placed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-5\">A. It should be in the tank or. on the hot circulating line..</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-6\">Q. Now, Mr. :Graham, referring to the plan that is on the board, .with the pressure reducing valve here and the relief valve, here as indicated, was there \u00e1ny protection to excessive heating for this boiler?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-7\">A. None whatsoever until the boiler became to a danger point \u2014 way above, a danger point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjA\">Q. Then what would happen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-9\">A. If somebody relieved the pressure quick enough, you would have a case of dynamite or something like that go off in your kitchen.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">A jury could reasonably reach the following conclusions:</p>\n<p id=\"b72-11\">(1) The leaks in the hot water tank were caused by the overheating of the water in the high pressure system through use of the \u201cbooster.\u201d To say, as does the defendant in substance, that the tank may have given way simply from old age and because of its condition fails to give justifiable weight to evidence that the difficulty came when the \u201cbooster\u201d was first used after the change from low to high pressure.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-12\">(2) The tank \u201cburst\u201d within the fair meaning of the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>(3) The tank \u201ccollapsed\u201d from the action of defendant\u2019s employees taken to prevent the possibility at least of an explosion.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-3\">(4) A temperature relief valve installed where indicated in the State Plumbing Code and by Mr. Graham would have protected the plaintiifs against the dangers inherent in control of hot water under pressure.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">Under these circumstances, a plumber could not complain should a jury find he did not exercise due care under the circumstances. The plaintiifs were entitled on this record to go to the jury. The non-suit should not h\u00e1ve been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">. \u2022 On. a. second trial counsel should endeavor, particularly if either believes the case will again reach this court, to make a record .that- is complete and clear. References, to a plan drawn upon the board, and to points, \u201chere\u201d and \u201cthere\u201d on the plan useful as they are to the factrfinders, are often of little or doubtful .value to those who must rely upon the record. Care must be taken in the trial court to . preserve the vital points in the record, to the end that, the appellate court may fairly understand the meaning, intent, and value of the- evid\u00e9nceJ Ih brief, in presenting a \u201clive\u201d case to a jury or court, counsel must keep in mind the necessity'of a record for the Law Court.
