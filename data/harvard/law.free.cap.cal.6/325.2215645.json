To the extent therefore in which the canon law was formerly recognized by the civil power and thereby made part of the municipal law, the Court will take judicial notice of it. In the case of Fremont <em>v. </em>the United States, (17 How. R., 357,) the Supreme Court say: \u201c It is proper to remark, that the (laws of these territories under which titles were claimed, were never treated by the Court as foreign laws to be decided as a question of fact. It was always held that the Court was bound judicially to notice them, as much so as the laws of a State of the Union.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b340-6\">The missions were founded under the authority of the kings of Spain. From all the circumstances attending their establishment and the erection and endowment of the mission churches, it is manifest that the assent of the crown was given to the appropriation to religious uses of so much of the royal domain as was required for the churches, cemeteries, habitations of the clergy, and the gardens, orchards and vineyards required for the support of the ministry and the maintenance of divine worship. The Church was an object of peculiar care to the government, which, by constant and minute legislation, regulated everything connected with it; the observance and propogation of its faith and doctrines ; the enforcement of its discipline; the founding and support of churches and other religious and charitable institutions wherever required ; the maintenance of its ministers and the preservation and due administration of its property and of the property of its different orders and associations. It is absurd to suppose that under the eye of so vigilant a government, a church should have been established and existed any length of time without its sanction and authority, especially when it is considered that immediately upon the founding of any church, notice thereof was required to be given to the government. Its foundation, therefore, in the absence of any proof of disapproval or prohibition, must be presumed to have been the act of the Government itself, and the land appropriated to the uses of the Church and possessed by it, must be presumed to have been appropriated and formally dedicated by the crown to religious uses.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b340-7\">The law upon this subject, not already cited, may be found in the \u201cRecopilaci\u00f3n de leyes de Indias,\u201d Book 1.

R., 726,) in speaking of a dedication to public use, which in this respect stands in the same position as a dedication to religious uses, say: \u201cNo law was cited in the argument which showed the power of the king of Spain to alienate land which had been dedicated to the public use; and it is clear that the exercise of such a power would have violated the public law, which is understood to have limited the exercise of the sovereign power in this respect.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b341-6\">Pandectas Hispano-Mexicanas, Vol. 1, p. 149, No. 312.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b341-7\">The separation of Mexico from Spain could not divest this title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b341-8\">\u201c It has been asserted, as a principle of the common law, that the division of an empire creates no forfeiture of previously vested rights of property.\u201d Kelly <em>v. </em>Harrison, 2 John.

But if such had been the intention of the law, it could only have been carried into effect as an appropriation of private property for public uses, and upon making just compensation. The law provides for compensation being-made for property taken under its provisions, and by so doing recognizes it as private property. But that compensation was not fixed in the mode prescribed by the constitution, and the law was inoperative and void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b341-12\">Whatever may have been its intention, its execution was suspended by the decree of Nov. 7, 1835, and was never lawfully carried into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>effect.

The decree of the Government, granting all that he asked, recognized the vineyards and orchards as the property of the Church,\" under the dedication to religious purposes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b342-7\">Without proof of this decree as a fact, the Court will take judicial notice of the action of the Government of Mexico in a matter like this, of general concern.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b342-8\">The Mission of Santa Clara was founded at the expense of the King of Spain, in January, 1777, by Fr. Jun\u00edpero Serra, President of the Missions; the means Oof establishing it being furnished by the then Yieeroy of New Spain. The church was founded at the same time, and pastors assigned to it. From that time to the date of the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, the church building, the dwellings of the clergy, the orchards, etc., have been in the possession of the priests who have successively been the pastors of the Church of Santa Clara, with the exception of intervals between the years 1837 and 1843, during which they were unlawfully expelled from some portions of the property. Their expulsion being illegal, they were restored to the possession, the Government fully recognizing their rights.

The Right Rev. Joseph S. Alemany was the bishop of that diocese. In July, 1853, the State was divided into the arch-diocese of San Francisco and the diocese of Monterey, the dividing line between the two being the parallel of 37\u00b0 13' north latitude. Bishop Alemany became the Archbishop of San Francisco, and continued to act also as Bishop of Monterey, no bishop having been appointed to that diocese until very recently.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-6\">In March, 1851, the plaintiff was appointed by Bishop Alemany the pastor of Santa Clara church and mission, and in September, 1854, the appointment was renewed and confirmed by the same person, who had, in the meantime, become the Archbishop of San Francisco.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-7\">Under the law of Spain and Mexico, the pastors of the Church were entitled to the aid of the proper tribunals in asserting the rights of the Church. The right of administration and possession was in them, and that right was not divested by the change of government. Citations above.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-8\">The land in controversy was in possession of successive priests, holding it for the church by virtue of their position as pastors of the Church of Santa Clara, down to a period subsequent to the acquisition of this country by the United States. Each of these pastors held under the original and often recognized dedication to religious purposes. The plaintiff is the legitimate and regular successor of those who have preceded him in the office of pastor. He claims in the same right, and under the same dedication.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-9\">This ease may be likened to one of dedication for a street or square of a town. If the proprietor of land lays out a town upon it, marks streets and squares upon the plan, and sells lots by reference to them, and they are used for the purposes designated, it is a dedication of the land <em>so </em>marked, or its use, not merely to the first purchasers of the lots, but to all who may afterwards acquire them. The right to the easement passes, by virtue of the ownership of the lots.

That subsequently, when this power to acquire and hold (not to alienate) wordly goods, so variant from the divine purposes of its establishment, was conferred upon the Church, it was under great restrictions, and could never be lawfully exercised without the express sanction of the sovereign power of the State to each acquisition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-9\">3.

That although the Church, as a mystic body, restricted to the spiritual objects of its divine institution, exists independently of, and beyond the control of the State, yet considered as a corporation, and the possessor of temporal goods, it is a political community merely, a constituent part of the political organization of society, with only the rights of those of its class, and subject to all the changes and modifications that may be introduced.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-12\">6.

That the Missions were not corporations, but establishments founded by the Government for the advancement of population, civilization, and Christianity. The ecclesiastical power had no control over them, nor any possession of lands or other property appurtenant to them, nor was such possession in the padres or religious missionaries. The only possession distinct from that of the members of the community, was the possession of the Government; the Missions themselves, and the padres, the military escorts and <em>administradores </em>being mere instrumentalities and agents of the Government. Secularization consisted in removing the religious missionaries, and allowing the Church to appoint pastors of the secular clergy to admisister to the spiritual wants of the community, when the natives had been so far enlightened in the mysteries of the Catholic faith as to be fit subjects for the ordinary ecclesiastical government. This change had nothing to do with the rights of property.

So by reference to Palon\u2019s Life of Father Junipero, (p. 53-5, 63, 64, etc.,) we shall see that the missions erected prior to the date of that regulation, of which Santa Clara was one, established 12th January, 1777, were all founded under express royal orders, and wholly at the expense of the crown.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b349-7\">In the report of a special commission, appointed by the Mexican Government to present a plan for the regulation of the missions of the territories of Upper and Lower California, dated the 6th of April, 1825, the following extract is made:</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b349-8\">\u201cThe Junta acknowledges that the great progress made by the missions established by the Jesuits in Old California, and hy those established in the new by the <em>Fernandinos. </em>(or Franciscans,) is attributable to the Spanish system of discoveries and spiritual conquests, and is aware of the eulogiums that these establishments have merited, not only from the Spaniards, but from some enlightened foreigners. * *</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b349-9\">\u201c The state in which the present missions are found does not correspond to the great progress which they made in the beginning. This decadence is very notable in those of Lower California, and would be enough to prove that the system needs variation and reforms. But among these, in the opinion of the <em>junta, </em>that is indispensable which is demanded by the diversion which missionaries have suffered from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>their essential ministry; occupying themselves with the temporalities of each mission, and with its administration and government, because, besides being prejudicial to their principal destination and object, (which was altogether political and temporal,) this cannot be done without a material relaxation of the vows which the sons of San Francisco have professed, and without being opposed to the spirit and letter of the Bull of Urban VIII, of- the 22d February, 1633, which ordained that the missionary monks should abstain from everything that might have the odor of business, merchandise or traffic.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b350-5\">In the report of a committee of this same <em>Junta, </em>dated 13th May, 1827, respecting the regulations to be adopted for the government of the Californias, it is said:</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b350-6\">\u201cEven the order of government with which this delicious country began to be ruled, was original; the missionaries were at the same time the civil governors and spiritual fathers; they established the ascending sale of reductions, Missions and <em>Pueblos, </em>but in all of them they were the governors, and the superior of the missions under his bonnet reunited the civil authority, the ecclesiastical and the military; the troops which supported it being subject to his dispositions, so that it would have been nothing strange if the catastrophe should have been repeated which was experienced in Paraguay.\u201d Such was the position which the padres occupied in the missions, and such the possession which they held. They were the governors, and administrators of the temporalities committed to their charge, under the political system which was established by law. Their possession was that of the government. In the year 1844, Manuel Casta\u00f1ares was residing in the city of Mexico, in the capacity of deputy elected to the general congress for the Department of Upper California. Several of his speeches and communications addressed to the Supreme Government were published in Mexico. In a very elaborate communication which he presented to the government, treating of all the various topics which he regarded as most interesting to his department, dated 13th May, 1844, are found the following observations, treating of the missions :</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b350-7\">\u201c There can be no doubt that to these establishments that peninsula owes the beginning of its political existence; that the missions constituted its primitive government; that they have always been considered as united with the posterior forms of its administration, and that in any event the system which may. be adopted with respect to the missions, will make a most essential part of that which may be established for the prosperity and advancement of that country. The greatest evil that could have been done to my department, was the alienation of the property pertaining to the piety fund <em>(fonda </em>piadosa) of the Californians by the provisional government. This fund by itself alone was a lever sufficient to give to that country a general impulse, without neglecting on this account the original object of its institution.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b350-8\">This <em>fonda piadosa, </em>it will be recollected, consisted of old landed estates, which had boen actually cultivated, some of them more than a century, and been administered by the religious missionaries. Tet it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>was thought to he in the power of the government to administer, control and alienate this property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b351-5\">Again, in the same communication, under the head of <em>\u201c </em>Mexican Colonization,\u201d the importance of promoting which he represents in most eloquent terms, he says : \u201c I will give to your Excellency (the Minister of Relations) another indication of the funds which in part may be destined to this measure, which is the salvation of the national territory: All the temporalities ('temporalidades,) of the missions are certain property which belong to them in common, and in which the missionaries and the religious orders upon which they are dependent have nothing more than the charge of their administration by commission from the Government.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b351-6\">Neither the Mexican nor Spanish Government ever hesitated to exercise its absolute control in the disposition of the mission lands, whether consisting in those which had been occupied merely for grazing, cultivated fields, gardens, orchards, or otherwise ; nor was it ever pretended that the Church or religious orders had any shadow of right to any portion of them, although it was sometimes doubted whether those which were actually occupied by the missions ought not to be considered as the property of the neophytes and Mexican settlers. Hence in the general regulation on the subject of colonization, of November 21st, 1828, Art. 17, it is provided that <em>\u201c </em>In those territories where there may be missions, the lands which these occupy shall not be colonized at present, and until it be resolved whether they ought to be considered as property of the <em>reducciones </em>(missions) of <em>Neophyte, Catechumens, </em>and <em>Mexican settlers.\u201d </em>This temporary suspense was removed by the Act of Congress, of 26th November, 1833, which provides that <em>\u201c </em>the Government is empowered to take all the measures which may secure the colonization, and to carry into effect the secularization of the missions of Upper and Lower California, being authorized to this effect, to use in the manner most convenient the estates of <em>obras pias </em>(the piety fund) of said territories, in order to furnish resources to the commission and families who are now in this capital, with destination thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b351-7\">The Act of Congress of 17th of August, 1833, for the secularization of the Missions of Upper and Lower California, although it does not recognize the religious missionaries or their order, much less the Church, as owning anything attached to the missions, very distinctly designates and limits, in articles four, five and seven, what the Government was authorized to\u2014but which, so far as appears, it never did\u2014\u25a0 assign to the newly erected parishes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b351-8\">So, then, the very churches which had served the missions, the apartments annexed thereto, and the mission buildings, were all considered as subject to the disposition of the Government, and by its authority were to be given, some to the use of the parish, that is, to the Church, which now, for the first time, makes her appearance in these matters, and the rest to municipal uses, primary schools, and workshops. But <em>nemo dat quod non hdbet.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b351-9\">What, then, was the condition of the vineyards, orchards, and lands, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>which had been cultivated by the common labor of the Indians ? They remained at the disposition of the Government, as they always had been before. They were not assigned to the use of the curate, because his occupation was not agricultural; or horticultural, or the cultivation of vineyards. He was to be employed, not with the cares of business, but with the care of souls.</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b352-5\">In the provisional regulations adopted by Figueroa, 9th August, 1834, for carrying into effect the law of Congress, it is ordered that the vineyards, orchards and corn-fields shall be cultivated by the Indians in common, which for the present remained undisposed of, till the resolution of the Supreme Government. (Rockwell\u2019s Sp. and Mex. Law, v. I, p. 458; Jones\u2019 Rep., 16.) It is unnecessary to notice specifically all the acts of the general and departmental governments, and of Congress, oj&gt; this subject; the several regulations of Figueroa, of Alvarado, of Mieheltorena, and Pio Pico, the more important of which will be found at length in Rockwell, 455-477, and referred to, substantially, in Jones\u2019 Report, 8-22; proving, beyond the slightest doubt, that neither the missionary fathers nor the Church ever had any claim to, or possession of, <em>any </em>of the lands of the missions, but that the former administered them, to use the very words of Casta\u00f1ares, above cited, \u201cby a commission from the Government;\u201d and, as Mr. Jones observes in his Report, p. 17, that \u201call the tracts of land pertinent to the missions, but not directly attached to the mission buildings, were (after the secularization) granted as any other lands of the territory, to the Mexican inhabitants and to colonists, for stock farms and tillage.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b352-6\">The Acts of-the Departmental Government subsequent to Micheltorena\u2019s decree, among which may be referred to, decree of the Departmental Assembly of 28th May, 1845, which provides for renting some of the missions; Pio Pico\u2019s for the sale and renting of the missions; decree of Departmental Assembly of 3d April, 1846, (Rockwell, 271-376,) and another decree of the Departmental Assembly of 24th August, 1844, (which will be found in the archives,) passed on the recommendation of Mieheltorena himself, providing for the sale, renting and hypothecation of the real estate and cultivated lands of all the missions, all show that these establishments, with their vineyards, orchards, gardens, buildings and appurtenances, were regarded as public property, and in no public Act will it be found that the Church, or religious orders, or the clergy, were recognized as having any right of property in anything appurtenant to them, and it is believed that no instance can be found in which any existing right of property was asserted on the part of the Church prior to the American occupation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b352-7\">On reference to the decree of 24th August, 1844, in the records of the Sessions of that period, it will be found to be declared in the report of the committee, which was as is stated, approved with absolute unanimity, that the missions are the property of the nation, and the Government is empowered to offer for sale, mortgage or lease, all <em>fincas ratees </em>(improved real estate) and\u2019 <em>terrenos de labor </em>(cultivated lands) of the missions of Upper California, comprehended in the distance from San <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>Diego to Sonoma, and dispose of the proceeds for the expenses of the war which was anticipated with the United States, paying first the debts of the missions in preference. This excepts no orchards, vineyards or gardens, for these were the only improved real estate and cultivated lands that belonged to the missions, and comprehended all that was valuable on which money could be raised.</p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b353-5\">So by the decree of Pio Pico of the 28th October, 1845, it is ordered: \u201cArticle 1. There will be sold in this capital, to the highest bidder, the Missions of San Rafael, Dolores, Soledad, San Miguel and La Purissima, which are abandoned by their neophytes.\u201d [This decree was made after due' proclamation, made as provided in that of May 28, 1845.]</p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b353-6\">\u201cArticle 14. The renting of the Missions of San Diego, San Luis Rey, San Gabriel, San Antonio, Santa Clara and San Jose, will take place when the difficulties shall be got over which at present exist with respect to the debts of those establishments, and then the Government will inform the public, and all shall be done agreeably to these regulations.\u201d The Departmental Assembly again, in a decree of 3d August, 1846, which as evidence of the light in which the subject was regarded, is just as valuable as if made prior to the raising of the American flag, re-affirm the decree of 28th May, 1845, and expressly recognize and sanction what the Governor had done on the subject.</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b353-7\">Thus it will be seen that every act of Government from the earliest period, not excepting the decree of Mieheltorena and the alleged order of Bustamente\u2019s government, of 17th November, 1840, and the uniform acquiescence of the clergy, go to confirm and establish beyond any room for cavil, that the. mission lands of every kind, improved and unimproved, gardens, orchards and vineyards, and the buildings too, were the property of the nation, subject to be administered, rented, sold, distributed to settlers, or otherwise disposed of by the Government, in conformity with the laws; and moreover, that the padres, or the secular clergy, or the Church, not only never had, nor ever claimed to have, any property in them, but that they never had any possession of them, nor of anything pertaining to them; or, to express this conclusion still more clearly, in the very words of Casta\u00f1ares, which are only a reiterartion of those of the learned Junta before cited, that \u201c the missionaries or the religious orders upon which they depend, had nothing more than the charge of their administration by commission from the Government.\u201d [See Collection of his Official Documents, p. 35.]</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"At\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by Mr. Justice Heydenfeldt.</author>\n<p id=\"AWB\">Mr. Chief Justice Murray concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">The plaintiff, who is the pastor of the Catholic church in Santa Clara, sues for the possession of a piece of land known as the \u201c Orchard,\u201d which belonged to the former Mission of Santa Clara; claiming that the mission lands were church property, and that by the rules of the Church, he is the administrator of the temporalities of that particular church and mission.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">Much discussion has taken place upon the questions of the right of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>the Church, .under the Spanish and Mexican systems, to take property, and the right of the plaintiff to succeed; but the opinion to which I have arrived, renders it unnecessary to consider them.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">According, to all the Spanish and Mexican authorities, (which have been well collated in the respondent\u2019s argument,) the missions were political establishments, and in no manner connected with the Church. The fact that monks or priests were at the Itead of these institutions, proves nothing in favor of the clajm. of the Church to universal ownership of the property. It is here unnecessary to determine in what manner, or by what form of conveyance, the Church, as a political or corporate body, could validly acquire title. It is sufficient that there must have been some mode, so as to take the right out of the Government, or individual, and vest it in the Church, and certainly nothing of the kind is here shown to have existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">If it be relied on that a priest or monk had government and control of the mission, the answer is simply that they were the civil governors; and although they combined with the power of civil government the functions of spiritual fathers, this was only the more effectually to carry out one of the objects of those establishments, which was, to convert and Christianize the Indians. And it appears fully, from all the investigations made into the Spanish and Mexican polity in reference to missions, that neither the missions, nor the priests of the missions, were incorporated into the general body of the Church, nor were, in any respect, under the control or direction of its diocesan ecclesiastics, whose rule was absolute over all their inferiors. On the contrary, the mission establishments arose directly from the action and authority of the government of the <em>country; </em>laws and regulations were made for them by its legislative authority, without referring to, or consulting the authority of the Church; the lands settled by them were not conveyed to any one, neither to priest nor neophyte, but remained the property of the governments ; and there is not a word in all the decrees and acts of the government, which would even show that the church building, devoted to worship alone, ever became the property of the church corporate, until the decree of secularization of 1833.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">It is urged by appellant, that that decree was suspended by a subsequent one, and consequently was never applied to the missions of California. In that ease, as the Church had no rights in the mission before the decree of 1833, it remains without any, because it was only by that decree, if at all, that any rights were given it; on the other hand, if it claims to take by virtue of that decree, the limitations contained in it would not entitle the Church to the property sued for in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">Our conclusion is, that the plaintiff has no rights to the property in question, and therefore the judgment of the Court below is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
