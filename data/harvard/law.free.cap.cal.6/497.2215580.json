The complaint joins the husbands of the above-named defendants as parties defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-15\">The defendants demurred to the complaint for a defect of parties, and specified the joinder of the two husbands as defendants, as ground of demurrer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-16\">The Court below overruled the demurrer, and the defendants failing to answer, judgment and decree of foreclosure was entered against them by default. Defendants appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b509-17\"><em>Smith and Hardy </em>for Appellants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b509-18\"><em>John H. McKune, </em>Respondent, in person.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b509-19\">The statute of California concerning sole traders, is silent concerning the form of remedy in favor of or against such persons. That Act goes to the rights ydiich may be enforced, leaving the manner of their enforcement to the statute concerning proceedings in civil cases. Section seven of this last-mentioned Act, provides that <em>\u201c </em>when a married woman is a party to a suit, her husband shall be joined with her; except, first, that when the action concerns her separate property, she may sue <em>alone; </em>second, when the action is between herself and husband, she may sue or be sued alone.\u201d The first part of that section is mandatory. When <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>a married woman is a party, (plaintiff or defendant,) the husband shall be joined.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b510-5\">Now, it is evident that unless this case falls within the exceptions, the husband is not improperly joined. The first subdivision only provides that a /eme sole may sue alone (not be sued.) In this case, if we had sued the wife without joining the husband, we should have been as clearly wrong as we are right, as we have proceeded. This would be perfectly evident from a reading of the first subdivision alone, but when we compare it with the language of the second subdivision, the correctness of our <em>position is still more apparent. As </em>between herself and husband, she may sue or be sued alone, making a clear distinction between suing and being sued.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b510-6\">The reason of this distinction is as clear as the law itself. When a woman elects to come into Court, she may sue alone; but when she is forced into Court, she shall come in, leaning upon her husband. The law has wisely provided this distinction, and the Legislature must have intended to provide for just such a ease as this.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b510-7\">The view of this case, taken above, is sustained by a decision in the case of Howland <em>v. </em>Port Edward Paper Mill Co., in the Supreme Court of New York, 8 Howard\u2019s Practice Rep., 505, 512. This decision was made upon a statute worded like our own, and is apparently conclusive upon the point.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b510-8\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by Mr. Justice Terry.</author>\n<p id=\"APo\">Mr. Justice Heydeneeedt concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">There was in this case an improper joinder of parties defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">The defendants, Catherine McG-arvey and Margaret McKeon are alleged to be sole traders under the Act of April, 1852. That Act provides that a married woman, taking advantage of its provisions, shall be the exclusive owner of all the money, debts, and property, invested in the business in which she is engaged, and shall be allowed all the privileges and be <em>liable to all the legal processes </em>now or hereafter provided by law against debtors and creditors, and that her husband shall not be responsible for any debts contracted by her.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">The effect of the statute was to make such married woman a <em>feme sole </em>as to the particular business or profession in which she was engaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-12\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
