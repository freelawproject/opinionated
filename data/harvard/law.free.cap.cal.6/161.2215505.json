The complaint in an action of forcible entry need not pray for treble damages, to warrant the Court in trebling them.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b173-11\">Appeal from the County Court of Alameda County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-12\">Action of forcible entry.
