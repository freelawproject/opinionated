In support of the grounds of surprise and newly discovered testimony, the defendants refer to the evidence of one Rossiter, a witness for plaintiff. He testified that the driver was driving too fast for the condition of the roads; denies any knowledge that plaintiff had his leg hanging outside of the coach, or, having ever made any statement to that effect, on which point the evidence on trial was conflicting. The defendants filed the affidavit of one Benton, averring that on the same day of the accident Rossiter had made such statements to him, exonerating the driver.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-7\">In support of the ground taken of misconduct of the jury, defendants file the affidavit of one of their counsel, setting forth that during a recess taken, pending the trial, one of the jury addressed the affiant and said that there was no use in the lawyers occupying so much time examining witnesses and trying to humbug the jury, and that the one who made the shortest speech would get a verdict. As to the amount of damages given, the plaintiff proved that he had been receiving a salary of $200 per month; that he had been laid up several months, and would probably be laid up for life, one leg being made shorter than the other, though there was some doubt raised by the evidence, whether the injury was not aggravated by injudicious treatment.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b241-8\"><em>J.

On his cross-examination, he was asked if he had not, on a former occa^ sion, stated to one Benton that the accident was not caused by the fault of the driver, and if the plaintiff had not had his leg on the outside of the coach at the time it was upset, he would not have been injured; to which he answered, he had not.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-14\">The appellants allege they were taken by surprise by the answer of the witness, having been led to believe that his testimony would be di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>rectly the reverse. If Rossiter had been called by the defendants, and it had appeared on the trial that he had misled them by statements of what his evidence would be, and the defendants relying on such representations, had not prepared themselves with other testimony, it might have been a proper ease for the interference of the Court. But under the circumstances in which the witness presented himself, it was the duty of the appellants to be prepared for their defence.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">It is not very material by whom he was called in this case, as the record shows that there was a conflict of testimony upon this point, and the jury might with propriety have found either way.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">This view disposes of the second ground for new trial, viz.: newly discovered evidence, as the same matter was in controversy on the trial, and there was a conflict of evidence, particularly between the driver and the witness named. The testimony of Benton, as to what the witness had said, would have been merely cumulative, and therefore not a sufficient ground for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">The conduct of the jury was not of a character to vitiate the verdict ; it arose from ignorance or loquaciousness, and is not tainted with corruption, fraud, or willful misconduct; besides which, it is fully sustained by his own affidavit in support thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">The fourth ground, excessive damages, is not supported by .the record, the whole question was submitted to the jury, and the amount assessed was not so outrageous as to shock the conscience of the Court, who tried the cause, or raise the presumption of passion or prejudice. Neither does it appear to us, that there was any abuse of discretion in permitting it to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
