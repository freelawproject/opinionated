That while plaintiff was there residing upon, cultivating, and grazing said land, the defendants, for the purpose of conveying water to certain mining claims owned by them, and distant about one mile from plaintiff\u2019s premises, constructed the ditch mentioned in plaintiff\u2019s complaint, through a part of plaintiff\u2019s enclosures, and within twenty-five or thirty feet of plaintiff\u2019s corral, at the time and afterwards used by him for corralling his cattle, and to the depth, near-said corral, of about six feet. That said ditch was dug against the wishes and consent of plaintiff for the purpose aforesaid, and upon the most practicable route to convey the water to said claims from a ravine above the premises of the plaintiff. That it could have been constructed so as not to run through or interfere with the plaintiff\u2019s premises, but at a greatly increased cost.\u201d * * <em>\u201c </em>That a portion of said premises, some distance from said corral, had been prospected and found to contain gold. That said ditch prevents plaintiff from using his corral without endangering his animals.\u201d The Court also finds the actual damage sustained by plaintiff and the cost of filling up the ditch, making-in all $114, for which sum and for the abatement of the nuisance, the Court gave judgment. Defendants appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b57-12\"><em>R. S. Mesick, B. A.

R., McClintock <em>v. </em>Bryden, Ib., and Irwin <em>v. </em>Phillips, Ib., we decided that the prior possessory rights of settlers on the public lands for agricultural and grazing purposes, must yield to the rights of miners to extract from the land the precious metals. This was a necessary deduction from the statute, which expressly makes the distinction. But this statute cannot be extended by construction. If so, it would require us to overturn other well defined and settled principles. In Tartar <em>v. </em>Spring Creek Co., 5 Cal. R., we said: \u201c The current of decisions of this Court goes to establish that the policy of this State, as derived from her legislation, is to permit settlers <em>in all capacities </em>to occupy the public lands, and by such occupation to acquire the right of undisturbed enjoyment against all the world but the true owner.\u201d That \u201c this policy has been extended equally to all pursuits, and no partiality for one over another, has been evinced, except in the single case where the right of the agriculturist is made to yield to that of the miner when gold is discovered in his land.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">In Fitzgerald <em>v. </em>Urton, 5 Cal. R., it is said: \u201c In .permitting miners, however, to go upon lands occupied by others, it (the Legislature) has legalized what would have otherwise been a trespass, and the act cannot be extended by implication to a class of cases not specially provided for.\u201d It results from a review of these decisions that there was no error in the opinion of the District Court, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
