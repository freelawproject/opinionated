The complaint refers to the mortgage (a copy of which is attached) which contains a sufficient description of the premises for the purposes of the suit. The action was not for the recovery of lands, and, therefore, not governed by the fifty-eighth section of our Practice Act. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">The second point, that the Court erred in ordering a reference, without the consent of defendant, is equally without foundation. The defendant having failed to answer within the time allowed by the Court in overruling the demurrer, a default was entered, and the Court, in strict conformity with the one hundred and fiftieth section of the Practice Act, ordered a reference for the purpose of ascertaining the amount due the plaintiff by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">The third point was decided by this Court in the case of Guy <em>v. </em>Franklin, delivered at the October Term, 1855. The fourth point is not sustained by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">Upon the whole, we are satisfied that this must be treated as a delay case. Judgment affirmed with ten per cent damages and costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
