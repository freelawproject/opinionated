Hanson, John C. Fall, and Samuel L. Dewey, administrator of the estate of B. B. Dewey, deceased, on an undertaking on appeal executed by G. M. Hanson, John C. Fall and B. B. Dewey. The complaint alleges the prosecution of the appeal in the action in which the bond was given, and final judgment against the appellant therein. It also avers the subsequent death of B. B. Dewey and the appointment of S. L. Dewey as his administrator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b655-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>The defendants demurred to the complaint, on the ground, among others, \u201c that the defendant, Samuel L. Dewey, administrator of the estate of B. B. Dewey, deceased, is improperly joined in this action with the other obligors to said bond, being the surviving obligors of B. B. Dewey, deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b655-5\">The Court below sustained the demurrer, though not on the ground above stated.

Humphreys <em>v. </em>Yale, April T., 1855. The undertaking being a joint obligation, only the survivors can be sued on it.

R.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-13\">It is said the demurrer was sustained on a different ground in the Court below. It makes no difference, as this was one of the causes of demurrer assigned below.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-14\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
