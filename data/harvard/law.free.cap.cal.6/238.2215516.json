It is admitted that Douglass &amp; Co. were <em>bona ficle </em>creditors of Daly, in the amount of the judgment, and were ignorant of any fraud in the entering of the judgment, but that Daly, knowing that the plaintiff, also his creditor, was about to issue an attachment, and being in failing circumstances, confessed the judgment, and caused an execution to issue and levy to be made, without the knowledge of Douglass &amp; Co., for the purpose of preferring them and preventing the plaintiff from satisfying his claim out of the property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-12\">The Court below refused to grant the injunction, and ordered the money in the sheriff\u2019s hands to be paid to Douglass &amp; Co.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-13\">Plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b250-14\"><em>W.

It follows that the confession of judgment by Daly in favor of Douglass &amp; Co., having been suffered for the purpose of hindering and delaying the collection of plaintiff\u2019s debt, is void to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
