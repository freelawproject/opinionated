The complaint alleges \u201c that until wrongfully ousted by the defendant,\u201d the plaintiff and his predecessors in interest were in possession, and that plaintiff is still entitled to possession of the land in controversy, and that defendant is wrongfully and unlawfully in possession and unjustly withholds the same from plaintiff, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-12\">On filing affidavits of plaintiff and his counsel that they both reside in the county and that no answer or demurrer had been served on either of them within the required time, default was entered, and on motion of, plaintiff\u2019s attorney final judgment was rendered for plaintiff. Defendant\u2019s attorney moved at the next term of the Court to set aside the default on his affidavit that he had filed an answer within the required time, but had not served a copy on defendant as required by the recent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>amendment to the Practice Act, being ignorant thereof. That the answer was filed after the commencement of the term at which judgment was entered, and that deponent had been informed by the Court that no causes would be tried at that term, in which issue had been joined after the first day of term; and that deponent left the Court in that belief; and that defendant has a good defence on the merits. The District Court overruled the motion, and defendant appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b59-5\"><em>H. P.

Treadwell <em>v. </em>Paine &amp; Dewey, 5 Cal. R., 9. The complaint in this case contains no such allegation, and under our system of pleadings this is such a defect as cannot be cured by a default taken against defendant through the mistake or inadvertence of his counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">The judgment is reversed, with costs, and the cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
