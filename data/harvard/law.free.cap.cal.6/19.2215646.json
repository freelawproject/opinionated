On the trial, the Court at the request of the plaintiff and under the exception of the defendants, gave the jury the following instruction, which was the third asked for: <em>\u201c </em>That if the jury find from the testimony that the plaintiff was prevented from the full performance of his part of the contract by the acts of the defendants, that he is excused from a further performance, and the defendants become liable to pay as damages to the plaintiff the full amount agreed to be paid in the contract.\u201d The Court afterwards, at defendants\u2019 request, instructed the jury that the rule was as defined in the opinion of the Court. The jury found a verdict for plaintiff for $2,012. Defendants moved for a new trial; the motion was overruled and judgment entered for plaintiff. Defendants appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b32-7\"><em>H. P. Barber </em>for Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-8\">The charge of the Court as to the rule of damages was erroneous. Cutter <em>v. </em>Powell, 2 Smith\u2019s Lead. Cas., 30; Baldwin <em>v. </em>Bennett, 4 Cal., 392 ; 7 Hill, 61. The defendants were entitled to a correct instruction without having an improper one, in direct contradiction to it, tacked on to it and nullifying its effect. We are entitled to a new trial when the true rule will be laid down without any admixture of error. 4 B. Monroe, 476, 522; 10 ibid, 5, 317; 1 Cal., 92; 18 Maine, 436; 22 Maine, 113; 1 Pick., 206; 12 Pick., 177; 5 Mass., 365, 438; 5 Wend., 418; 11 Wend., 83; 1 Hill, 347; 4 Hill, 271. It can scarcely be pretended that the verdict of the jury was founded only upon the last instruction of the Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b32-9\"><em>Halleck, Peachy &amp; Billings </em>for Respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-10\">The contract was entire, and the plaintiff having done all that he could do without the concurrent action of the defendants, the latter are guilty of an affirmative act amounting t\u00f3 a tortious interference, and operating as a <em>waiver </em>on their part of whatever remained to be done by him. The compensation named in the contract is therefore the only measure of damages. See Baldwin <em>v. </em>Bennett, cited for appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-11\">Even if the charge is erroneous, yet as the jury have not acted on it, a new trial should not be granted. The plaintiff sued for $3,150, the balance due on the contract. The only offset pleaded was $904 68, which would have made the verdict, under the instruction, $2,245 32, while in fact it was only $2,012. A new trial should not be awarded for error where the record shows that it was unattended with consequences. Santillan <em>v. </em>Moses, 1 Cal., 92; Kilburn <em>v. </em>Ritchie, 2 Cal., 145; Innes <em>v. </em>Senator, 1 Cal., 459; Clayton <em>v. </em>West, 2 Cal., 381. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>Moreover the Court afterward gave the instruction requested by defendants, that \u201c plaintiff was entitled only to such damages as he proved he had sustained.\" As the verdict of the jury is not in accordance with the first instruction, it must be presumed to have been founded upon the latter. Clayton <em>v. </em>West, 2 Cal., 381.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b33-5\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by Mr. Justice Heydenfeldt.</author>\n<p id=\"AtH\">Mr. Chief Justice Murray concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"Ah\">The third instruction given by the District Court, at the request of the plaintiff, is clearly erroneous. The true rule of damages is the value of the labor performed, and the amount of profit which could fairly have been derived from the labor left unperformed by the act of the defendants. Although afterwards, at the defendants\u2019 request, the Court laid down the correct rule, yet it is impossible to say that the erroneous instruction first given had no influence upon the jury. Both stood together and were of equal force, and we cannot by computation ascertain by which one the jury was controlled.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">Judgment reversed, and cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
