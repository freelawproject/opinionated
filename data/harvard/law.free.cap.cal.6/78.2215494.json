On the trial the plaintiff proved the property to be his, and then offered to prove that the defendant was the sheriff of the county, and that John W. Webster was his under sheriff, and as such took the property and sold it on an execution against a third person, put in his hands by the defendant. This testimony was ruled out on the ground that the issue to be tried was that made by the amended complaint and the answer thereto, and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>plaintiff could only show as the base then stood, that the defendant himself actually 'took the property or directed some other person to take the specific property. The plaintiff also offered in evidence the execution under which the property was seized, with the return thereon of the sale by the sheriff, by Webster deputy, and to prove the execution and return, and that the property named therein was the property in question, which testimony was also excluded on the same ground, the plaintiff duly excepting to the rulings of the Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-5\">The jury, under instructions of the Court to the <em>same effect, </em>found a verdict for defendant; plaintiff moved for a new trial, which was denied, and judgment entered for defendant. Plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b91-6\"><em>Otis L. Bridges </em>for Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b91-7\">This Court has decided that an amended complaint might be used together with the original complaint. But the amended complaint was sufficient to charge the defendant with the trespass committed by his authorized agent. 1 Whittaker\u2019s Practice, 322, 323; 4 How., 119; 3 How., 39; 6 How., 68, 71; 1 Archb.

W. Perley </em>for Respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Ayq\">No brief on file.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AL0\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by Mr. Justice Heydenfeldt.</author>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">Mr. Chief Justice Murray concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-11\">Under any aspect of this case, the rulings of the Court below were erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-12\">It was unnecessary for the plaintiff to declare against the defendant as sheriff, although even this is sufficiently stated in the first count of his declaration. If the defendant had been only a private individual, it was competent for the plaintiff to prove that Webster, who committed the trespass, was his agent or servant, and acting under his commands. The defendant also in his answer assumes the responsibility of the act of his deputy, treats it as his own, and justifies it. The Judge trying the case should have let in all the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-13\">Judgment reversed, and cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
