On the trial, the plaintiff was allowed to prove his services in protecting the defendant\u2019s interest in the same property, in a subsequent suit, between Newland, the receiver appointed in the first suit, and one Keane, who has since purchased the property, and now intervenes in this action to protect the property from an attachment levied herein before his purchase. Vidal, the defendant, makes no defence, and the action is defended by the intervenor, who objected to the introduction of the above testimony, and excepted to the order overruling his objection. Newland, who testified that he was not an attorney at law, but had acted as attorney for several parties during the period. 1849-50, when the plaintiff\u2019s services were rendered, and was conversant with attorneys\u2019 fees at that time, was allowed to prove the value of plaintiff\u2019s services, along with other witnesses who were attorneys; his estimate being the highest of all. The intervenor objected to the witness as incompetent; but the objection was overruled, and his evidence admitted under intervenor\u2019s exception. Judgment was -rendered for plaintiff. Intervenor moved for a new trial, which was overruled, and intervenor appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b68-12\"><em>Haights &amp; Gary </em>for Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b68-13\"><em>J.

The count is for services rendered as attorney at law in the case of Brown <em>v. </em>Vidal. Upon the trial, \"evidence was admitted against the objection of defendant to prove the value of services in the case of New-land <em>v. </em>Keane.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-16\">The proofs in every case must correspond with the allegations. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>recovery in this case would be no bar to another action for the services rendered in the case of Newland <em>v. </em>Keane. The evidence should therefore have been excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Newland was an incompetent witness to prove the value of Hart\u2019s legal services. He was not a lawyer, and therefore not such an expert as the rules of evidence admit.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">For these errors the judgment is reversed, and the cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
