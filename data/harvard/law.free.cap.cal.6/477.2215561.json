It is admitted that there are sufficient errors to warrant a reversal, if the bill of exceptions, which was not signed until more than ten days after the trial, can be considered by this Court. \u2022</summary>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b489-11\"><em>Hoge and Wilson </em>for Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b489-12\"><em>William T.

In fact, it is difficult to sec how the failure or refusal to sign a bill of exceptions could defeat the party\u2019s right of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">On examination, it will <em>be </em>found that no analogy whatever exists between this case and the one of Leech <em>v. </em>Allen. 2 Cal., 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
