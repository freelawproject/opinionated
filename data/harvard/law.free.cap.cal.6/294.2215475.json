Sunol, one of the defendants against the plaintiff and J. De Toro, the other defendant, in 1851, in the Court below. The bill denies that service of summons in the action, in which said judgment was rendered, was ever made on plaintiff, and sets forth the sheriff's return on the summons, which is in these words : <em>\u201c </em>Served on J. Jesus Pico in person, by delivering a copy of summons and a copy of complaint, this 25th day of September, at 10 A. m., a. D. 1851. Henry S. Dally, Sheriff.\u201d The plaintiff charges the judgment to be void for want of jurisdiction of the Court over the person of the plaintiff, defendant in that action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-10\">On the hearing of the application, it was proved that Dally was sheriff of the county of San Luis Obispo, and as such served the process on plaintiff, at the date named in the return. The Court below granted the injunction. Defendant Sunol appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b306-11\"><em>L.

After the lapse of more than forty days, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>no answer having been filed, the clerk, on application of Sunol\u2019s attorney, entered judgment against both defendants for the amount due.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Pico had notice of the entry of this judgment, but took no steps to have it vacated until 1855; after the lapse of more than three years he institutes this proceeding for the purpose of enjoining all proceedings against him under said judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">It is now contended that the judgment entered against Pico is a nullity, because the return of the sheriff did not state the place where such service was made, and was, therefore, insufficient to give jurisdiction of the person of Pico. Jurisdiction of the person of defendant is acquired by the service of process, and dates from such service, and not from the return, which is only one of the modes laid down by the statute of proving the service, and which, if irregular or insufficient, may be amended or explained.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">It is in evidence in this proceeding, that service was duly made on Pico, at San Luis Obispo, by the sheriff of the county handing to him a certified copy of the summons and complaint in the action. From the date of that service the Court acquired jurisdiction, to have control over all subsequent proceedings. Practice Act, \u00a7 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">It may be that the evidence of service on file was insufficient to authorize the rendition of judgment against Pico, but this objection should have been taken advantage of either upon appeal, or motion to vacate the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">I know of no instance where a Court of equity has interfered to enjoin a judgment not manifestly wrong, simply because of a defect in the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-11\">Judgment affirmed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
