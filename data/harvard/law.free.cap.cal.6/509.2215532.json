That the Legislature in 1856, failed to elect their successors, although the term had expired for which they were appointed; whereupon the Governor, after the adjournment of the Legislature, appointed other persons to the office, who are claimed, by the information, to be entitled thereto. The Court below entered judgment for defendants, from which an appeal was taken on behalf of the people.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b522-6\"><em>William, T.

The appointments to fill vacancies could not extend beyond the term of the original incumbents, so that a vacancy occurred in the whole hoard at the expiration of two years, the term limited, which the Legislature having failed to provide for, the Governor of the State, by virtue of his general appointing power, corresponding to that of the Crown of Great Britain, in such cases, had the power to fill.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
