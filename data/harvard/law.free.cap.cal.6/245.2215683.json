I can see no reason for ascribing any such intention to the Legislature, and am satisfied the words were omitted without any design whatever. If parties were compelled to appear <em>in persona </em>before Justices\u2019 Courts, and lawyers were excluded, then there might be some reason for the rule; but suits are brought and determined before these Courts in the absence of the parties, so that, in many instances, it would be impossible to serve notice in time upon the party himself; in fact, in many mining cases, where the parties are numerous, it would be a moral impossibility to serve notice upon all.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">The general law regulating appeals, provides, that notice may be served on the party or his attorney, and this we think must govern this case. The appearance of the party by attorney in the County Court was also sufficient to give the Court jurisdiction. If we should affirm the decision of the Court below, a party may bring suit by his attorney, and by keeping out of the way, defeat the right of appeal; a construction more sharp than sound justice or liberal practice would warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
