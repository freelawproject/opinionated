On the trial, and before argument, the Court announced that it would limit the arguments of the counsel for the prosecution, in his opening and closing, to three-quarters of an hour, and that for the defence to half an hour\u2014which rule was enforced, under the exception of defendant, who appeals, assigning this as error.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b648-10\"><em>C.

The establishing and enforcement of such rules are matters resting in the sound discretion of the Court, and are often necessary, to prevent the time of the Court from being wasted in useless and unprofitable discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-15\">It does not appear that the issues raised in this case were numerous or complicated, or that they could not have been fully presented in the time allowed; nor is there any allegation that injustice has been done to the defendant by the verdict, or that the longest argument would have been likely to change the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-16\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
