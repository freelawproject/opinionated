His report stating the account may be excepted to, and the exceptions sustained, or overruled; but whatever may be the order of the Court upon them, sucl^ order is merely interlocutory, and is not the subject of appeal before final judgment or decree; after final decree, the action of the Court may be reviewed. This is a totally different case from that of a referee appointed, in the stead of the Court, to try and determine the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">Appeal Dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
