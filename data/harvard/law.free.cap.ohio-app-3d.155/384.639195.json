The common pleas court affirmed the board\u2019s decision denying the protest in all respects, save one.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">{\u00b6 3} The court found that the part-petitions were not properly verified by the person who had circulated them because they were \u201cfalse.\u201d R.C. 3519.06(D). The falsity concerned the representation of the address of the person from whom the circulator expected to receive payment. Because the part-petitions were not properly verified by their circulators, the court ordered the signatures of electors who had signed them not included in the tabulation of signatures of qualified voters supporting the initiative that the board would report to the Secretary of State.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">{\u00b6 4} The informational requirement at issue appears in R.C. 3519.05. It concerns payments made to persons who solicit signatures of electors. The form of petition that R.C. 3519.05 prescribes contains the following disclosure provision:</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cIn consideration for services in soliciting signatures to this petition, the solicitor has received or expects to receive_from __(Whose address is)__Before any elector signs the part-petition, the solicitor shall completely fill in the above blanks if the solicitor has received or will receive any consideration, and if the solicitor has not received and will not receive any consideration, the solicitor shall insert \u2018nothing.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">{\u00b6 6} The parties stipulated that all the part-petitions that were the subject of the protest before the board, except for two, indicated that the solicitor had or would receive compensation from \u201cJohn Mitchell,\u201d whose address was shown to be \u201c2301 E. Sharon Rd., Cincinnati, Ohio 45241.\u201d It was not disputed that John Mitchell was at the location when the part-petitions were circulated by qualified voters. Neither was it disputed that the location indicated is a Red Roof Inn motel where Mitchell was temporarily lodged and that he is not a resident of Ohio but a resident of California. The two part-petitions that contained different information indicated that the solicitor, H. Clemons, was paying himself and that his address was Cincinnati and/or Miami, Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-12\">{\u00b6 7} The trial court concluded that the address given for Mitchell, a motel in Cincinnati, \u201cwas intentionally used on the petitions to mislead an elector into believing that the person paying the solicitor was a resident of Ohio,\u201d and that, as a result, the part-petitions were false in that respect. R.C. 3519.06(D) provides that no petition is properly verified if a statement it contains \u201cis false in any respect.\u201d Therefore, the court held that the board of elections had abused its discretion when it rejected the protest on a finding that the part-petitions were properly verified.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>{\u00b6 8} Appellants are members of the committee in whose name the initiative petition was circulated. They present five assignments of error on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">FIRST ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cThe court below lacked subject matter jurisdiction to invalidate part-petitions on a basis not set forth in the initial protest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">{\u00b6 10} The jurisdiction of the courts of common pleas is determined by statute. Section 4(B), Article IV, Ohio Constitution. R.C. 3519.16 states, \u201cIf the circulator of any part-petition, the committee interested therein, or any elector files with the board of elections a protest against the board\u2019s findings made pursuant to section 3519.15 of the Revised Code, then the board shall proceed to establish the sufficiency or insufficiency of the signatures and of the verification thereof in an action before the court of common pleas in the county.\u201d R.C. 3519.15 governs the board\u2019s review of petitions and its findings of their sufficiency-</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">{\u00b6 11} R.C. 3519.16 is plainly jurisdictional. Appellants argue that the common pleas court acted outside the jurisdiction conferred on it by that section because the sufficiency or accuracy of the information concerning paid circulators on which the court rejected the part-petitions is not a matter comprehended by \u201cthe sufficiency of the signatures and the verification thereof,\u201d concerning which R.C. 3519.16 requires judicial review of a board\u2019s report after a protest. Appellants also argue that because the board of elections made no findings concerning the circulator\u2019s statement as it appears in the part-petitions, that matter was not properly before the court for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">{\u00b6 12} We do not agree. R.C. 3519.16 authorizes and directs the court of common pleas to adjudicate an action brought by a board of elections upon the board\u2019s \u201cfindings made pursuant to section 3519.15 of the Revised Code.\u201d When a protest is filed, that section requires the board to \u201cdetermine any repetition or duplication of signatures, the number of illegal signatures, and the omission of any necessary details required by law.\u201d The board must then make a report to the Secretary of State of its findings concerning the sufficiency of the signatures on the part-petitions, \u201cindicating whether or not each part-petition is properly verified.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-12\">{\u00b6 13} The disclosure of the name and address of a payor of any solicitor mandated by R.C 3519.05 is one of the \u201cnecessary details\u201d required by law. The board is required by R.C. 3519.15 to report its omission, which comprehends not only the failure to disclose any information at all but also failure to disclose information which is complete and correct. The board\u2019s report in this instance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>amounts to a \u201cfinding\u201d in that regard, for which R.C. 3519.16 requires full judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">{\u00b6 14} The first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">SECOND ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cThe address of the payor provided in the circulators\u2019 compensation statements complies with R.C. 3519.05.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">{\u00b6 16} The common pleas court found that the address for John Mitchell stated on the face of the part-petitions was false, and per R.C. 3519.06(D), held that the part-petitions at issue were therefore not \u201cverified\u201d and that the signatures thereon were therefore insufficient for purposes of the board\u2019s report to the Secretary of State. The court acted within its discretion conferred on it by R. C. 3519.16 when it made that finding. Because the court\u2019s judgment was founded on its determination of an issue of law, the meaning of R.C. 3519.05 and its disclosure requirements, our review of the error alleged is de novo. For that purpose, we must accept the court\u2019s findings of fact as true.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">{\u00b6 17} Use by organized and well-financed interest groups of paid solicitors to circulate petitions in support of the initiative elections has been the subject of concern and disapproval. See Broder, Democracy Derailed: Initiative Campaigns and the Power of Money (2000). Of particular concern is that persons whose support is solicited often are not aware that the solicitor with whom they are dealing is paid for his or her efforts and is thus not necessarily motivated by a desire to advance the public good.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">{\u00b6 18} States have in various ways acted to cure this problem by limiting or restricting paid solicitation. Those efforts are limited by the fact that petition circulation is \u201ccore political speech\u201d for which the First Amendment protection is \u201cat its zenith.\u201d <em>Meyer v. Grant </em>(1988), 486 U.S. 414, 422, 425, 108 S. Ct. 1886, 100 L.Ed.2d 425. Therefore, states may not flatly prohibit payment for the circulation of ballot petitions. Id. States may, however, impose necessary and proper ballot controls that do not unjustifiably inhibit the circulation of ballot-initiative petitions. <em>Buckley v. Am. Constitutional Law Found., Inc. </em>(1999), 525 U.S. 182, 119 S.Ct. 636, 142 L.Ed.2d 599. Among those is a requirement for disclosure of the names of initiative sponsors and the amounts they have spent to gather support, which responds to the state\u2019s substantial interest in controlling domination of the initiative process by affluent special interest groups. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-13\">{\u00b6 19} The trial court implicitly held that the paid-solicitor disclosures that R.C. 3519.05 imposes on the form of an initiative petition are in accord with protection of those legitimate state interests when it found that \u201can Ohio address <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>was intentionally used on the petition to mislead an elector into believing that the person paying the solicitor was a resident of Ohio.\u201d We agree that the fact that support or assistance is obtained by payments from persons outside the state is highly relevant to the substantial state interests of which <em>Buckley </em>speaks. The question presented, however, is whether any of the particular disclosures that R.C. 3519.05 requires were not satisfied in this instance, so as to render the disclosures \u201cfalse\u201d for purposes of R.C. 3519.06(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">{\u00b6 20} Election laws are mandatory and require strict compliance, and substantial compliance is acceptable only when an election provision says that it is. <em>State ex rel. Vickers v. Summit Cty. Council, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 204, 2002-Ohio-5583, 777 N.E.2d 830. That requirement has been applied to referendum petitions. See <em>State ex rel. Commt. v. Lorain Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 308, 2002-Ohio-4194, 774 N.E.2d 239. Petitions for initiative and for referendum enjoy a like status in the law. See Section 1(g), Article II, Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">{\u00b6 21} The dispute here is over the sufficiency or correctness of the information that appeared on the face of the part-petitions disclosing John Mitchell\u2019s address. The word <em>address </em>derives from Middle English, in which it was a verb in the sense of to \u201cset upright,\u201d and to \u201cguide, direct,\u201d which later developed into \u201cwrite directions for delivery on.\u201d Oxford Dictionary of Word Histories (2002). It is now defined as a \u201c[pjlace where mail or other communications will reach a person * * *. Generally a place of business or residence.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed.Rev.1990) 38. In this context, it is also defined as \u201cthe designation of a place (or a residence or place of business) where a person or an organization may be found or communicated with.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1986) 24-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">{\u00b6 22} It is undisputed that the address for John Mitchell stated by the solicitors on the face of the petitions they circulated, \u201c2301 E. Sharon Rd., Cincinnati, Ohio 45241,\u201d is a motel or hotel at which Mitchell lodged temporarily, while the part-petitions were circulated for signature. Neither is it disputed that, as the trial court found, \u201cMr. Mitchell\u2019s residence is in California, not Ohio.\u201d The court then construed the word \u201caddress\u201d as it appears in R.C. 3519.05 to mean the named individual\u2019s legal place of residence. That concept, which is generally called \u201cdomicile,\u201d has two components: an actual residence in a particular jurisdiction, and an intention to make a permanent home in the jurisdiction. <em>Hager v. Hager </em>(1992), 79 Ohio App.3d 239, 607 N.E.2d 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">{\u00b6 23} The definitions of \u201caddress\u201d set out above plainly include residential locations. However, they might as readily include a place of business. The General Assembly did not specify one or the other when it enacted R.C. 3519.05, prescribing the contents of the circulator\u2019s declaration that must appear on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>face of any initiative petition. It is noteworthy that immediately following that passage, and with respect to the signatures of electors, R.C. 3519.05 prescribes: \u2018Your name, <em>residence, </em>and date of signing must be given.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The signer\u2019s \u201cresidence\u201d is then identified as a \u201cRural Route or other Post Office Address.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">{\u00b6 24} Had the General Assembly intended to limit the payor\u2019s address in the paid circulator\u2019s disclosure statement to the payor\u2019s residence address, it presumably would have so defined it by addition of the term \u201cresidence,\u201d as it did with respect to the street address of subscribing electors. The General Assembly did not do that, however, and instead allowed an ambiguity, one in which the location indicated might reasonably mean either a residence address or a business address. Election laws must be strictly construed. <em>State ex rel. Vickers, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 204, 777 N.E.2d 830, 2002-Ohio-5583, 777 N.E.2d 830. However, strict construction does not permit a court to read into a statute a limitation or distinction that the General Assembly did not adopt.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">{\u00b6 25} If the payor\u2019s business address is sufficient for the declaration which R.C. 3519.05 requires, does that square with the purposes for which R.C. 3519.05 presumably was enacted? Further, is it satisfied here, when only a temporary lodging is involved? We believe that both must be answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">{\u00b6 26} The payor\u2019s name and address are framed as a statement by the paid circulator, indicating from whom payment has come or will come and where that person may be found. It can function to reveal whether support or assistance has come from outside Ohio. It can also function to direct electors whose signatures are solicited to the payor for whatever inquiry or other communication the elector may wish to make. The temporary character of the location does not necessarily defeat such an inquiry, so long as the identity of the location coincides in time with when the elector\u2019s signature is solicited. In this instance, it did. Whether Mitchell might be there afterward is immaterial to the proposition. Had the Red Roof Inn rented Mitchell his room for use as a business location for some other venture on a more permanent basis, for six months, for example, there would be no question whether it was his business address through that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">{\u00b6 27} The trial court rejected the part-petitions pursuant to R.C. 3519.06(D) on a finding that the address shown for John Mitchell was intended to mislead. That conclusion follows only if the address was false for purposes of R.C. 3519.05, but it is not false for that purpose when it is a valid business address where, when the representation is made, the payor may be found. That is the case here. Therefore, the trial court erred when it limited the term \u201caddress\u201d as it appears in R.C. 3519.05, to the payor\u2019s residence address and found the part-petitions false on that account and therefore insufficient. The evidence demonstrates that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>the location concerned was Mitchell\u2019s business address, which satisfies the disclosure requirements of R.C. 8519.05.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">{\u00b6 28} The second assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">THIRD ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cInvalidation of state initiative petitions on the basis of information in the circulators\u2019 compensation statements violates Art.
