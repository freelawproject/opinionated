Celebrezze Jr., Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">{\u00b6 1} Defendant, Michael E. Gordon, appeals from his conviction after a bench trial on two counts of aggravated vehicular assault and one count of driving under the influence and claims that the state of Ohio failed to introduce sufficient evidence to support all material elements of the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">{\u00b6 2} On July 12, 2000, at approximately 7:04 p.m., Michael E. Gordon (\u201cGordon\u201d) was driving his sport utility vehicle on Cranwood Boulevard in Garfield Heights, Ohio. Gordon lost control of his vehicle, passed over the center line, and struck another vehicle. After striking the vehicle, Gordon\u2019s vehicle slid sideways into the front yard of a residence, hitting a nine-year-old girl who was sitting there on her bicycle. Both the driver of the other vehicle and the nine-year-old girl suffered serious injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">{\u00b6 3} Officer Dupont arrived at the scene and spoke with Gordon. The officer immediately noticed an odor of alcohol on Gordon\u2019s breath. As a result, Officer Dupont asked Gordon to submit to a field sobriety test. Gordon refused to submit and requested immediate medical attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">{\u00b6 4} Officer Dupont followed as Gordon was transported to the hospital by the emergency squad. At the hospital, Officer Dupont remained with Gordon. At approximately 8:59 p.m., Gordon was treated by medical personnel and voluntarily submitted to blood and urine tests. Officer Dupont observed as Gordon provided the urine sample from behind a hospital curtain.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">{\u00b6 5} The test on the urine, which was performed by the Cuyahoga County Coroner\u2019s Office, revealed that Gordon\u2019s concentration of ethanol was .16 grams per deciliter, .02 over the legal limit of .14. The coroner\u2019s office also identified marijuana metabolites present in Gordon\u2019s urine sample.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-12\">{\u00b6 6} Based on the result of the urine test, Officer Dupont issued Gordon a ticket for driving while under the influence of alcohol and a ticket for driving left of center.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-13\">{\u00b6 7} On May 16, 2001, the Cuyahoga County Grand Jury returned an indictment charging two counts of aggravated vehicular assault, in violation of R.C. 2903.08, and one count of driving while under the influence, in violation of R.C. 4511.19.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>{\u00b6 8} On June 29, 2001, Gordon filed a motion to suppress evidence contesting the admissibility of the blood and urine tests. The trial court granted the motion to suppress, and the state appealed. On May 13, 2002, this court affirmed the suppression as to the blood-sample test, but reversed the trial court with respect to the urine-sample test.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">{\u00b6 9} On October 8, 2002, Gordon waived a-trial by jury. A bench trial ensued after which Gordon was found guilty on all counts. He was sentenced to four years on each count of aggravated vehicular assault, to be served consecutively. He was also sentenced to six months for driving while under the influence, to run concurrently with the sentences for aggravated vehicular assault. The instant appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">{\u00b6 10} The appellant presents the following assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-7\">\u201cThe trial court erred in finding appellant guilty of two counts of aggravated vehicular assault in violation of R.C. 2903.06 where the state failed to introduce sufficient evidence in support of all material elements.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">{\u00b6 11} In <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, the Ohio Supreme Court re-examined the standard of review to be applied by an appellate court when reviewing a claim of insufficient evidence:</p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cAn appellate court\u2019s function when reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction is to examine the evidence admitted at trial to determine whether such evidence, if believed, would convince the average mind of defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(Jackson v. Virginia </em>[1979], 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560, followed.)\u201d Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-12\">{\u00b6 13} More recently, in <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 678 N.E.2d 541, the Ohio Supreme Court stated the following with regard to the \u201csufficiency\u201d as opposed to the \u201cmanifest weight\u201d of the evidence:</p>\n<p id=\"b389-13\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c \u2018Sufficiency\u2019 is a term of art meaning that legal standard which is applied to determine whether the case may go to the jury or whether the evidence is legally sufficient to support the jury verdict as a matter of law. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 6 Ed.1990, 1433. See, also, Crim.R. 29(A)(motion for judgment of acquittal can be granted by the trial court if the evidence is insufficient to sustain the conviction). In essence, sufficiency is a test of adequacy. Whether the evidence is legally sufficient to sustain a verdict is a question of law. <em>State v. Robinson </em>(1955), 162 Ohio St. 486, 55 O.O. 388, 124 N.E.2d 148. In addition, a conviction based on legally insufficient evidence constitutes a denial of due process. <em>Tibbs v. Florida </em>(1982), 457 U.S. 31, 45, 102 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>S.Ct. 2211, 72 L.Ed.2d 652, citing <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>(1979), 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560.\u201d Id. at 386-387, 678 N.E.2d 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">{\u00b6 15} Finally, we note that a judgment will not be reversed upon insufficient or conflicting evidence if it is supported by competent credible evidence which goes to all the essential elements of the case. <em>Cohen v. Lamko, Inc. </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 167, 10 OBR 500, 462 N.E.2d 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">{\u00b6 16} Where there is substantial evidence upon which the trier of fact has based its verdict, a reviewing court abuses its discretion in substituting its judgment for that of the jury as to the weight and sufficiency of the evidence. <em>State v. Nicely </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 147, 529 N.E.2d 1236. The weight to be given the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses are primarily for the trier of fact to determine. <em>State v. DeHass </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 39 O.O.2d 366, 227 N.E.2d 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">{\u00b6 17} To support a conviction of aggravated vehicular assault under R.C. 2903.08(A)(1), the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and as a proximate result caused serious physical harm to another person while operating that vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">{\u00b6 18} R.C. 4511.19 specifically defines what the legislature intends \u201cunder the influence\u201d to mean:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-9\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cDriving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs or with certain concentration of alcohol in bodily substances; chemical analysis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-10\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c(A) No person shall operate any vehicle, streetcar, or trackless trolley within this state, if any of the following apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-11\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-12\">(\u00b6 22} \u201c(4) The person has a concentration of fourteen-hundredths of one gram or more but less than two hundred thirty-eight-thousandths of one gram by weight of alcohol per one hundred milliliters of the person\u2019s urine;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-13\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-14\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c(D)(1) In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (A) or (B) of this section, * * * the court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse, or alcohol and drugs of abuse in the defendant\u2019s blood, breath, urine, or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by chemical analysis of the defendant\u2019s blood, urine, breath, or other bodily substance withdrawn within two hours of the time of the alleged violation. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>{\u00b6 25} \u201c(D)(2) * * * fourteen-hundredths of one gram by weight of alcohol per one hundred milliliters of the defendant\u2019s urine, such fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">{\u00b6 26} During trial, the state established the following: that the appellant was operating a sport utility truck; that the appellant lost control of his truck, crossed the center line, and struck another vehicle; that a nine-year-old girl and the driver of the other vehicle were seriously injured as a proximate result of the appellant\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">{\u00b6 27} The appellant challenges the final element of the crime, that he was operating his vehicle under the influence of alcohol. Appellant argues that the testimony of Dr. Jenkins was not conclusive proof of his impairment to drive a motor vehicle, constituting a reversal of his conviction. Appellant states that the medical expert could not determine with reasonable medical certainty whether the concentration of ethyl alcohol in appellant\u2019s urine bears any correlation to the concentration of ethyl alcohol in appellant\u2019s blood before the sample was taken. Appellant\u2019s argument is misplaced and not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">{\u00b6 28} At trial, Dr. Jenkins of the coroner\u2019s office stated, \u201c* * * using urine results to infer impairment is not scientifically valid * * * what you find in urine is a drug that has accumulated over time and is sitting in the bladder, not necessarily what is circulating in the blood and, therefore, reaching effectory sites in the brain and therefore giving an effect to the drug * * The testimony of Dr. Jenkins is taken out of context.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">{\u00b6 29} It is not the job of a medical expert to determine with reasonable medical certainty the blood-alcohol concentration and impairment of the appellant at the moment of the crime from testing his urine. R.C. 4511.19 specifically sets forth guidelines in order to determine intoxication of a defendant at the moment of the crime. Dr. Jenkins\u2019s only duty was to test the concentration of alcohol in the appellant\u2019s urine using the approved testing procedures found in the Ohio Administrative Code. The results from the urinalysis are then compared to the alcohol limits for urine found in R.C. 4511.19 to determine whether the appellant was under the influence at the moment of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">{\u00b6 30} Under the Revised Code, a person is considered under the influence of alcohol if a urine sample is withdrawn within two hours of the violation and the urinalysis test reveals that the concentration of alcohol is greater than .14 of one gram per hundred milliliters of urine. Furthermore, the test result may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. In the instant ease, the appellant\u2019s urine sample was withdrawn within two hours of the crime and tested .16. It is irrelevant that Dr. Jenkins could not determine from a urine sample the blood-alcohol level of the appellant at the moment of the crime. Intoxication of a defendant at the moment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>of the crime is determined not by the opinion of an expert, but by the alcohol concentration limits set forth by the Ohio Revised Code for urine, blood, and breath. The medical expert need not determine the blood-alcohol concentration from the appellant\u2019s urine sample.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">{\u00b6 31} If the appellant is trying to challenge the validity of urine testing under R.C. 4511.19, he has not properly raised the argument in the lower court. This court will assume that the alcohol concentration limits, the time limits for extraction, and the methods of testing a urine sample set forth by the legislature are valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">{\u00b6 32} Furthermore, Dr. Jenkins testified on redirect that there exists a correlation between the blood-alcohol content and urine-alcohol content, which would indicate that the appellant was in fact intoxicated under the law at the moment of the crime:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-7\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cQ. So in the first instance where\u2014you are looking for a rise in alcohol content, that would be indicated by what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-8\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cA. There has been a relationship established between a blood alcohol concentration and a urine alcohol concentration in the post-absorptive stage. In that case, the urine concentration is higher than the blood concentration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-9\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cQ. I see. Okay. So in this case you had a figure of .16; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-10\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-11\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cQ. And Mr. Gordon\u2019s alcohol level was obviously either increasing or decreasing; correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-12\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-13\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cQ. If it was decreasing, he would have had to have a higher concentration before the test was taken; correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-14\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-15\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cQ. And if it was increasing, that would indicate to you that he had more alcohol in his bloodstream than would be indicated by the urinalysis test; correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-16\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cA. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-17\">{\u00b6 43} Because appellant was driving his vehicle under the influence of alcohol at the moment of the crime and thereby caused serious physical harm to another motorist and a nine-year-old pedestrian, the evidence presented by the state was sufficient to support his two convictions for aggravated vehicular assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-18\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b392-19\">Sean C. Gallagher and James D. Sweeney, JJ., concur and concur separately.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b393-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>James D. Sweeney, J., retired, of the Eighth Appellate District, sitting by-assignment.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b390-15\">. R.C. 4511.19(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b393-5\">Sean C. Gallagher, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Aqk\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">{\u00b6 44} I concur in judgment with the majority that the state offered sufficient evidence to support the convictions under R.C. 2903.08(A)(1), but write separately to address issues concerning the charging of the OMNI offense, application of the term \u201cunder the influence,\u201d and the challenge to the legitimacy of urine testing raised by appellant for a conviction under R.C. 4511.19(A)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">{\u00b6 45} The state of Ohio charged Gordon with aggravated vehicular assault under R.C. 2903.08(A)(1). This provision requires proof of an underlying OMVI, either operating a motor vehicle under the influence under R.C. 4511.19(A)(1) or operating a motor vehicle with a concentration of alcohol above the limits set under at least one of the three proscribed methods outlined in R.C. 4511.19(A)(2) to (7).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">{\u00b6 46} In this case, the state charged Gordon under R.C. 4511.19(A)(4), a violation based on a person having a concentration of .14 of one gram or more but less than .238 of one gram by weight of alcohol per one hundred milliliters of the person\u2019s urine.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">{\u00b6 47} In addition to the (A)(4) (urine sample) violation, the state could have simultaneously charged this offense under R.C. 4511.19(A)(1), alleging that Gordon was under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse. Driving under the influence, as outlined under R.C. 4511.19(A)(1), and the offenses of operating a vehicle with a prohibited blood, breath, or urine level under R.C. 4511.19(A)(2) to (7) are allied offenses of similar import. A person may be found guilty of both but may be convicted and sentenced for only one of the two. <em>Cincinnati v. Moore </em>(1989), Hamilton App. Nos. C-880689, C-880690, and C-880691, 1989 WL 136387. In effect, there are two separate types of offenses: (1) being under the influence, and (2) operating with a prohibited alcohol level in blood, breath, or urine. <em>State v. Wilcox </em>(1983), 10 Ohio App.3d 11, 10 OBR 17, 460 N.E.2d 323. In the instant case, the state failed to charge under R.C. 4511.19(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">{\u00b6 48} Even in the absence of field sobriety tests, due to Gordon\u2019s request for medical treatment, evidence of impaired driving under R.C. 4511.19(A)(1) could have been established by factors that include erratic driving, the accident, the commission of a traffic offense, the odor of alcohol, the admission of alcohol consumption, any noted observable physical conditions related to alcohol or drug consumption, or \u201cblood shot\u201d eyes, or slurred speech, to name just a few. Any of these factors, if believed by the trier of fact, could be used without a chemical test <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>result or field test results to support a conviction for OMVI under R.C. 4511.19(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">{\u00b6 49} The failure by the state to include an (A)(1) charge under R.C. 4511.19 resulted in the state\u2019s having to rely exclusively on the validity of the urine test result for the underlying OMVI conviction and the conviction under R.C. 2903.08(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">{\u00b6 50} The majority\u2019s reference to the language \u201cunder the influence\u201d in relation to a violation under the \u201cper se\u201d limit of R.C. 4511.19(A)(4) is misplaced. The \u201cunder the influence\u201d reference is applicable only to violations under R.C. 4511.19(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">{\u00b6 51} This distinction was made clear in an early decision involving Ohio\u2019s revamped OMVI law in <em>State v. Murphy </em>(1983), 7 Ohio Misc.2d 1, 7 OBR 51, 453 N.E.2d 1304, where the court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">{\u00b6 52} \u201cIt is still a violation of law to operate a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. R.C. 4511.19(A)(1). No longer, however, is this the sole basis for conviction. Effective March 16, 1983, it is now an offense for any individual to operate a motor vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol as measured by blood, R.C. 4511.19(A)(2), urine, R.C. 4511.19(A)(4), or * * * breath, R.C. 4511.19(A)(3). The controversial \u2018per se\u2019 provisions mandate convictions exclusively on the quantity of alcohol, regardless of evidence of physical impairment or lack thereof. One may be in violation of driving under the influence without violating a \u2018per se\u2019 provision and vice versa.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">{\u00b6 53} Gordon\u2019s urine sample reading was .16, or .02 above the proscribed limit under R.C. 4511.19(A)(4) in place at the time of the incident.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">{\u00b6 54} Gordon does not expressly challenge the testing procedures or methods utilized by the Cuyahoga County Coroner\u2019s toxicologist as mandated by the Ohio Department of Health regulations in the Ohio Adm.Code 3701-53 et seq. Rather, Gordon challenges the underlying sufficiency of urine testing as a scientific, reliable, and accurate determination of alcohol in a person\u2019s system at the time of operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">{\u00b6 55} This unique challenge is based directly on the state\u2019s expert witness, Dr. Amanda Jenkins, Chief Toxicologist of the Cuyahoga County Coroner\u2019s Office, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>who testified, in part, that \u201cusing urine results to infer impairment is not scientifically valid.\u201d Dr. Jenkins also testified that \u201curinalysis was an accepted method of testing under the Ohio Administrative Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">{\u00b6 56} Gordon\u2019s reliance on <em>Miller v. Bike Athletic Co. </em>(1988), 80 Ohio St.3d 607, 687 N.E.2d 735, and Evid.R. 702 is misplaced. The very testimony Gordon uses to bring into question the validity of the urine test result is the same evidence Gordon seeks to exclude as unreliable. Nevertheless, logic would appear to dictate that the alcohol concentration in urine detected at the time of a test should have some correlation to the prohibitive level of alcohol in the blood at the time of operation that would indicate impairment. This, however, is not the requirement of the statute. The legal per se limits are just that, legal limits that, once established, create a strict liability offense. <em>State v. Cleary </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 198, 22 OBR 351, 490 N.E.2d 574; <em>State v. Grimsley </em>(1982), 3 Ohio App.3d 265, 3 OBR 308, 444 N.E.2d 1071. Thus, the Ohio legislature has set limits that create a point at which the legal operation of a vehicle is precluded, regardless of individual impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">{\u00b6 57} Further, an acquittal on an \u201cimpairment\u201d charge under R.C. 4511.19(A)(1) is not an affirmative defense to a conviction under a per se violation under R.C. 4511.19(A)(2) to (7). A defendant can be acquitted on a charge alleging \u201cimpairment,\u201d while still being convicted under a prohibited level offense arising out of the same facts. <em>State v. Cox </em>(1985), Franklin App. Nos. 84AP-671 and 84AP-672, 1985 WL 10246, citing <em>State v. Jamison </em>(June 26, 1984), Franklin App. No. 83AP-1163, 1984 WL 5801.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">{\u00b6 58} In <em>State v. Cox, </em>supra, the Tenth District held that guilt based on a chemical test result rather than individual impairment did not deny a defendant equal protection under the law. The court, citing <em>State v. Woemer </em>(1984), 16 Ohio App.3d 59,16 OBR 63, 474 N.E.2d 354, stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">{\u00b6 59} \u201cThe General Assembly has the constitutional authority to define offenses and presumably could prohibit the operation of motor vehicles when a motorist has consumed any alcohol. Although individual reaction to drinking a specified amount of alcohol may vary, the General Assembly has, after appropriate legislative hearings and presumably based upon scientific evidence, decided that there is universal impairment of motorists at or above the prescribed level. The fact that some persons may be more impaired at that level than others and still receive the same penalty does not render the statute constitutionally invalid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">{\u00b6 60} Gordon\u2019s challenge in this case goes to the very validity of using urine test results as the basis of his criminal conviction. The Supreme Court of Ohio, in <em>State v. Vega </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 185, 12 OBR 251, 465 N.E.2d 1303, held that the defendant cannot challenge the general reliability of alcohol-testing equipment. In effect, <em>Vega, </em>a very controversial case, held that a general attack on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>science of the test would not be allowed, while a specific challenge to the test results of the individual defendant would be permissible. Id. Although <em>Vega </em>involved a breath-testing challenge, there is nothing in the analysis to suggest that the court would view blood or urine testing any differently than breath. The majority stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">{\u00b6 61} \u201c \u2018[The judiciary must recognize] the necessary legislative determination that breath tests, properly conducted, are reliable irrespective that not all experts wholly agree and that the common law foundational evidence has, for admissibility, been replaced by statute and rule; and that the legislative delegation was to the Director of Health, not the court, the discretionary authority for adoption of appropriate tests and procedures, including breath test devices.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 188-189, 12 O.B.R. 251, 465 N.E.2d 1303, quoting <em>State v. Brockway </em>(1981), 2 Ohio App.3d 227, 232, 2 OBR 247, 441 N.E.2d 602.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">{\u00b6 62} Nevertheless, the controversial legacy of <em>Vega </em>cannot be ignored. The question of whether the Fourteenth Amendment prohibition against conclusive presumptions in criminal cases applies to OMVI cases involving urine testing remains unresolved. See Palmer, <em>State v. Vega </em>and Ohio\u2019s O.M.V.I. Law: Per Se Unconstitutional? (1995), 24 Cap.U.L.Rev. 687.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">{\u00b6 63} Clearly, if the focus of \u201cper se\u201d or \u201cprohibited level\u201d offenses was the \u201cimpairment\u201d of the individual, the defendant\u2019s assignment of error, in light of Dr. Jenkins\u2019s analysis, would have to be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">{\u00b6 64} The Ohio Supreme Court has upheld the authority of the Ohio legislature to authorize the Ohio Department of Health to determine the techniques or methods for chemically analyzing a person\u2019s blood breath or urine. See <em>Vega, </em>supra; R.C. 3701.143. In light of this holding, I agree with the majority that appellant\u2019s assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">{\u00b6 65} Had Gordon brought in his own expert to challenge his specific results or used Dr. Jenkins under cross-examination to challenge the results in his specific test, <em>Vega </em>would not be applicable. Further, this case leaves unresolved the question of a challenge to urine testing, not based on the general reliability of the test but on the issue of whether the Director of the Ohio Department of Health has done enough to determine, or cause to be determined, under R.C. 3701.143, that the latest and best techniques and methods are in -place for urine testing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>{\u00b6 66} Nonetheless, I concur with the majority opinion that the evidence presented was sufficient to support the challenged convictions.</p>\n<judges id=\"b397-5\">James D.
