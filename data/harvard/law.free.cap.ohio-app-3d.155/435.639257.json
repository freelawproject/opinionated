Reed was found guilty by a jury in the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas of murder, with a firearm specification, and of tampering with evidence in connection with the death of Joseph Smith. He received sentences of 15 years to life imprisonment for the murder and two years\u2019 imprisonment for tampering with evidence, to be served consecutively both to each other and to another sentence issued in a Miami County case. In addition, the trial court sentenced Reed to three years\u2019 actual incarceration for the firearm specification. Reed appeals from his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">{\u00b6 2} The state\u2019s evidence established the following facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">{\u00b6 3} Sometime after 10:00 p.m. on October 21, 2000, Reed, along with Marcus Manns, arrived at the apartment of Shawn Robinson and Erica Jones. The four got into Jones\u2019s car, a 1983 gray Chrysler, with the intention of going to \u201chang out.\u201d While traveling, Reed spoke with Smith on his cellular telephone, and Reed suggested to his companions that they pick him up. According to Robinson, Reed indicated to him that he was \u201cabout to do this nigger.\u201d At approximately 10:30 to 10:45 p.m., the group arrived at the residence of Valerie Fenton, Smith\u2019s girlfriend. Smith entered the vehicle, and they drove to Reed\u2019s residence. They arrived at Reed\u2019s residence shortly after 11:00 p.m. As the five individuals were heading towards Reed\u2019s apartment, Reed called to Smith, saying, \u201cCome here, Joe. Man-, I need to holler at you.\u201d Reed and Smith walked around to the side of Reed\u2019s apartment building while Robinson, Jones, and Manns went inside Reed\u2019s apartment. Sometime after 11:00 p.m., David Egler, whose home overlooks the alley behind Reed\u2019s apartment, heard two male voices, followed by a single gunshot. Looking from his bathroom window, Egler observed Smith lying on the ground and bleeding from his head in the alley behind Reed\u2019s apartment building. Egler called the police. The police were dispatched at 11:26 p.m. A nine millimeter shell casing was found near Smith\u2019s feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">{\u00b6 4} Having heard a \u201csound or something like an echo or cracking sound,\u201d Robinson left Reed\u2019s apartment and went around the side of the building. He observed Reed walking from the alley toward him. Robinson and Reed went into Reed\u2019s apartment, got Jones and Manns, and left to go to some \u201cafter-hours joints.\u201d Smith was not with them. Before entering the \u201cafter-hours joint,\u201d Reed held a gun and asked whether he should bring the weapon inside. Robinson responded, \u2018Yeah, you can bring it in here.\u201d Robinson identified the weapon as a plastic type Glock 9 millimeter. According to Peter Holloway, an individual whom Reed met at the Miami County jail in January of 2001, Reed disposed of the gun by a river. Subsequent to the shooting, Reed told numerous individuals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>that he had killed Smith because he had \u201cmessed with\u201d his girlfriend, Rhyan Cartwright, and his children.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">{\u00b6 5} Reed presents three assignments of error on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">{\u00b6 6} 1. \u201cThe trial court committed prejudicial error by denying defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial by sustaining objections to defendant\u2019s own testimony and by sustaining objections to questions offered to attack and impeach the credibility of the state\u2019s witnesses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">{\u00b6 7} Reed asserts that the trial court committed prejudicial error when it (1) precluded him from offering testimony that he was not present when or where the victim was killed, i.e., alibi testimony, (2) sustained objections to questions offered to attack and to impeach the credibility of the state\u2019s witnesses, and (3) denied him the opportunity to impeach the testimony of Stacy Young with prior inconsistent statements. He argues that the trial court effectively denied him his constitutional right to confront witnesses against him when it sustained the state\u2019s objections and when it precluded Reed from challenging those witnesses\u2019 credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">{\u00b6 8} We begin with the disallowance of Reed\u2019s alibi testimony. Crim.R. 12.1 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cWhenever a defendant in a criminal case proposes to offer testimony to establish an alibi on his behalf, he shall, not less than seven days before trial, file and serve upon the prosecuting attorney a notice in writing of his intention to claim alibi. The notice shall include specific information as to the place at which the defendant claims to have been at the time of the alleged offense. If the defendant fails to file such written notice, the court may exclude evidence offered by the defendant for the purpose of proving such alibi, unless the court determines that in the interest of justice such evidence should be admitted.\u201d In <em>State v. Smith </em>(1985), 17 Ohio St.3d 98, 17 OBR 219, 477 N.E.2d 1128, paragraph two of the syllabus, the Supreme Court of Ohio held that \u201cCrim.R. 12.1 should be construed liberally and not be applied where no prejudice would accrue to the prosecution, where there is a demonstrable and excusable showing of mere negligence, or where there is good cause shown.\u201d However, it has likewise recognized:</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c \u2018Given the ease with which an alibi can be fabricated, the State\u2019s interest in protecting itself against an eleventh-hour defense is both obvious and legitimate. Reflecting this interest, notice-of-alibi provisions, dating at least from 1927, are now in existence in a substantial number of States. The adversary system of trial is hardly an end in itself; it is not yet a poker game in which players enjoy an absolute right always to conceal their cards until played.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Jamison </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 182, 189, 552 N.E.2d 180, quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number><em>Williams v. Florida </em>(1970), 399 U.S. 78, 81-82, 90 S.Ct. 1893, 26 L.Ed.2d 446. We review the trial court\u2019s determination to exclude alibi testimony for abuse of discretion. Id.; <em>Smith, </em>17 Ohio St.3d at 104, 17 OBR 219, 477 N.E.2d 1128.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">{\u00b6 11} Reed first raised the issue of alibi testimony on October 30, 2002, the second day of his trial, in connection with the possible testimony of Marcus Manns, a potential alibi witness. At that time, he filed a motion to finance Manns\u2019s transportation from Georgia. The following day, that motion, along with the issue of Manns\u2019s ability to testify, were discussed by counsel and the trial court. Reed filed his motion for leave to file notice of alibi out of time on November 1, 2002, the following morning. It is undisputed that this written notice of his intention to claim alibi was not given in a timely manner, as provided by Crim.R. 12.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">{\u00b6 12} Defense counsel\u2019s discussion with the court indicates that the failure to file the notice in a timely fashion was a product of two factors. First, trial counsel indicated that the private investigator that he had hired made contact with Manns on October 30, 2002. At that time, Manns indicated that he was a key witness but would not give an interview. He would, however, fly to Dayton if someone else paid for the flight. Although Reed\u2019s father financed Manns\u2019s travel from Georgia, Manns did not arrive in Dayton during the trial. Thus, his potential appearance at the trial was rendered moot. Moreover, because Manns ultimately did not come to Dayton, his llth-hour discovery by the private investigator no longer provided a justification for permitting belated alibi testimony. Second, trial counsel indicated that the lack of notice was due to a last-minute change in trial strategy. He stated that Reed, contrary to the advice of counsel, decided to testify on his own behalf after the trial began.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">{\u00b6 13} The record demonstrates that the prosecution was unaware of Reed\u2019s alibi, and it had no opportunity to investigate the claim. Thus, the state would have been prejudiced by Reed\u2019s unanticipated alibi testimony, and Reed has made no showing of excusable neglect or good cause for his delay in providing notice. In light of Manns\u2019s failure to appear at trial and Reed\u2019s last-minute change in trial strategy, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion by excluding the alibi evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">{\u00b6 14} Turning to Reed\u2019s argument that the trial court repeatedly disallowed questions that were offered to attack the credibility of the state\u2019s witnesses, Reed cites pages 305, 400, 430, 486, 491, 525, 616, 653, 753, 759, 819, 826, 889, 905, and 910 of the trial transcript. As noted by the state, the record does not support Reed\u2019s argument. On pages 400, 486, 653, 753, 759, 819, 826, and 910, the state had objected to questions posed by the defense. Each of these objections was overruled, and defense counsel was permitted to inquire further. On page 491, the state objected to the form of the defense counsel\u2019s question, i.e., the use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>\u201cand I quote.\u201d Reed\u2019s counsel withdrew the question and rephrased it. Likewise, on page 530, defense counsel withdrew the question to which the state had objected on page 525. Accordingly, defense counsel was not prohibited by the trial court from asking the questions transcribed on these pages.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">{\u00b6 15} On page 430, the state objected and requested to approach the bench when defense counsel inquired about a videotaped interrogation of Erica Jones. Although it was stated in the form of an objection, the state merely indicated that it would play the entire videotape if necessary. The colloquy was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-6\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c[Prosecutor]: Just so we\u2019re all on the same page together, if you\u2019re going to inquire about bits and pieces or a bit of the\u2014or a portion of the videotape, then Pm going to be able to play the whole thing. I want to make sure we\u2019re all on the same page together. You can\u2019t pick out one thing, and there\u2019s\u2014so all Pm saying is the whole tape and everything gets played, if you\u2019re going to start taking things out of context or picking portions thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c[Defense counsel]: Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-8\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c[Prosecutor]: So we\u2019re all on the same page together.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-9\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cThe Court: Understand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-10\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c[Defense counsel]: Sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-11\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cThe Court: Got it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-12\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c[Defense counsel]: Okay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-13\">{\u00b6 23} As noted by the state, Reed\u2019s counsel was permitted to continue with his line of questioning after this exchange. Accordingly, Reed was not prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s handling of this objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-14\">{\u00b6 24} On page 306 (we note that no objection was made on page 305), defense counsel questioned Robinson about his felony convictions. In response, Robinson testified that his 1996 conviction was a fifth-degree felony and, further, that he had another felony conviction in 1991. Defense counsel then asked Robinson the nature of the 1991 conviction, drawing an objection from the state. The trial court sustained the objection to the extent that the testimony indicated the offenses underlying the prior criminal convictions, but it permitted defense counsel to inquire as to the existence of those convictions. The trial court\u2019s ruling comports with Evid.R. 609. Accordingly, we conclude that Reed was not prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-15\">{\u00b6 25} Beginning on page 887, counsel and the court began a discussion of the admissibility of alibi testimony by Reed, and Reed\u2019s counsel presented his motion for leave to file notice of alibi out of rule. The trial court overruled the motion and refused to allow Reed to provide an alibi during his testimony. As discussed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>above, that ruling was not an abuse of discretion, and we conclude that it does not constitute prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">{\u00b6 26} With regard to page 616, Reed asserts that the trial court erred when it overruled the defense counsel\u2019s objection to the reading of a portion of Young\u2019s police statement during the state\u2019s redirect examination of her. (In its brief, the state notes that the trial court overruled the objection, but fails to appreciate that the objection was raised by defense counsel, rather than the state.) Specifically, Young read that on November 10, 2000, Reed had come over, gotten into her car, and indicated that \u201cRhyan told him that one of his dudes was messing with her and his little girl. So he took the dude out back, down the alley and shot him in the back of the head. He said he had to get out of state \u2018cause the dude that was with him told on him.\u2019 \u201d At trial, defense counsel asserted that the police statement at issue did not constitute a prior consistent statement, because it was created at the time of Young\u2019s second police interview and she had made prior inconsistent statements during her first interview, as brought out on cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">{\u00b627} Evid.R. 801(D) provides that a prior statement by a witness is not hearsay if \u201c[t]he declarant testifies at the trial or hearing and is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement, and the statement is * * * (b) consistent with his testimony and is offered to rebut an express or implied charge against him of recent fabrication or improper influence of motive * * *.\u201d In the instant case, we need not decide whether the reading of Young\u2019s statement constituted inadmissible hearsay, because even assuming that the police statement did not fall within Evid.R. 801(D), the jury was presented with overwhelming testimony consistent with that statement. Robinson testified that Reed stated: \u201c \u2018I had to do it.\u2019 And, \u2018What\u2019s next? Is the nigger going to be messing with my kids?\u2019 \u201d Jones testified that about a week and a half after the shooting, Reed was talking with Robinson at their residence, and Reed described how he shot Smith. Heather Wendling, a good friend of Reed\u2019s, likewise testified that Reed told her that he had killed Smith because Smith \u201chad tried to rape or something with his baby\u2019s mama while he wasn\u2019t there.\u201d Michael Shoemaker, a \u201cbusiness\u201d associate of Reed\u2019s, testified that Reed had told him, referring to Smith, \u201cMotherfucker fucked with my family so I killed the motherfucker.\u201d Holloway testified that Reed had told him that he shot Smith and got rid of the gun. He further testified that Reed said that Rhyan had told him that \u201cJoe was messing around with her or either one of the kids, one of them.\u201d Finally, Young had previously testified that during a conversation in her car, Reed had told her that he had killed Joe because Joe \u201cwas messing with his daughter and his baby\u2019s mom.\u201d Thus, we conclude that the admission of a portion of the January 8, 2001, police statement was cumulative of the testimony of other witnesses, and it had no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>appreciable effect on the outcome of Reed\u2019s trial. Accordingly, even assuming that Young\u2019s statement constituted inadmissible hearsay, its admission was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">{\u00b6 28} Turning to the impeachment of Stacy Young, Reed claims, without any specific citation to the record, that the trial court denied him the opportunity to impeach her testimony through prior inconsistent statements. He indicates that Young testified during cross-examination that she did not remember statements that she had made to the police during her first police interview and that Evid.R. 613 permits the admission of extrinsic evidence to impeach a witness under those circumstances. The state responds that it has reviewed the entire portion of Young\u2019s testimony, and the record indicates that Reed\u2019s defense counsel did, in fact, attempt to impeach Young with police investigation reports. Although not cited by the parties, the record further indicates that defense counsel sought to introduce extrinsic evidence of Young\u2019s first police interview through testimony by Detective David Eshelman. The trial court ruled that Young\u2019s \u201ccontinual lack of recollection\u201d did not create an inconsistency that can be impeached. Thus, it did not allow defense counsel to call Detective Eshelman for the purpose of providing extrinsic evidence of Young\u2019s first interview with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">{\u00b6 29} Evid.R. 613(B) allows the use of extrinsic evidence to impeach by prior inconsistent statement when the following two conditions are satisfied: \u201c(1) If the statement is offered solely for the purpose of impeaching the witness, the witness is afforded a prior opportunity to explain or deny the statement and the opposite party is afforded an opportunity to interrogate the witness on the statement or the interests of justice otherwise require; (2) The subject matter of the statement is one of the following: (a) A fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action other than the credibility of a witness; (b) A fact that may be shown by extrinsic evidence under Evid.R. 608(A), 609, 616(B), or 706; (c) A fact that may be shown by extrinsic evidence under the common law of impeachment if not in conflict with the Rules of Evidence.\u201d Evid.R. 613(B). We have stated that under this rule:</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cIf the witness admits making the conflicting statement, then there is no need for extrinsic evidence. If the witness denies making the statement, extrinsic evidence may be admitted, provided the opposing party has an opportunity to query the witness about the inconsistency, and provided the \u2018evidence does not relate to a collateral matter[.] * * * \u2019 However, if the witness says he cannot remember the prior statement, \u2018a lack of recollection is treated the same as a denial, and use of extrinsic impeachment evidence is then permitted.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State v. Harris </em>(Dec. 21,1994), Montgomery App. No. 14343, 1994 WL 718227; see, also, <em>State v. Taylor </em>(July 26, 1996), Montgomery App. No. 15119, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>1996 WL 417098 (\u201cA prior statement of a witness may be proved by extrinsic evidence if the witness denies the statement or claims he cannot remember the statement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">{\u00b6 31} In her cross-examination, defense counsel asked Young whether she recalled questions by Detective Eshelman during her first police interview and whether she remembered her answers to those questions. Young indicated that she recalled being asked whether other individuals had talked to her about the shooting and what Reed had said to her about it. However, she repeatedly testified that she did not remember her responses to many of those questions. We agree with Reed that Young\u2019s lack of memory regarding her first interview laid a foundation for the admission of extrinsic evidence, such as the testimony of Detective Eshelman, regarding her prior statements. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court erred when it did not permit defense counsel to present that testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">{\u00b6 32} Under the facts of this case, however, we conclude that the failure to permit Eshelman\u2019s testimony regarding his interview with Young constituted harmless error. In other words, there is no reasonable possibility that the error contributed to the defendant\u2019s conviction. See <em>State v. Bayless </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St.2d 73, 106, 2 O.O.3d 249, 357 N.E.2d 1035; <em>State v. Young, </em>Montgomery App. No. 19328, 2003-Ohio-1254, 2003 WL 1193771. Here, although Young\u2019s prior police statement was not introduced as substantive evidence, nor was Detective Eshelman permitted to relate her responses, defense counsel presented the relevant portions of that interview to the jury during cross-examination by quoting directly from the transcript of the interview. For example, the following exchange occurred between defense counsel and Young:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-7\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cQ [by defense counsel]: * * * Referring to the first interview, do you recall anyone asking you at that time\u2014and I had quoted; I\u2019ll do it again\u2014\u2018Did anybody ever talk to you about Skano killing anybody?\u2019 That\u2019s the question. Do you remember that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-8\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cA [Young]: On the first interview, no. I don\u2019t remember that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-9\">{\u00b6 35} \u201c* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-10\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cQ: Do you remember answering that question with\u2014a question yourself? And I quote: \u2018Has he ever or anybody?\u2019 Do you remember saying that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-11\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cA: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-12\">{\u00b6 38} \u201c* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-13\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cQ: The detective answers in the affirmative. He says, \u2018Uh-huh.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-14\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cA: No. I don\u2019t remember that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>{\u00b6 41} \u201cQ: And then you say something'\u2014do you remember what that is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-4\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cA: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-5\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cQ: Do you remember saying, and I quote, \u2018just people talking about it. I mean, coming to my house and saying they been down here talking to you guys.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">{\u00b6 44} Thus, as illustrated above, defense counsel successfully presented verbatim the relevant portions of Young\u2019s first interview with Detective Eshelman, indicating to the jury the prior inconsistent statements that Young purportedly could not remember. In light of the thorough cross-examination, during which Young was presented with a verbatim account of her prior inconsistent statements, the presentation of extrinsic evidence of those statements would have had minimal impact, at best, on her credibility. Moreover, as stated above, Young\u2019s testimony was merely cumulative of other witness testimony at trial. Thus, the jury had substantial evidence, in addition to Young\u2019s testimony, that rumors were circulating about Smith\u2019s death and that Reed had admitted to killing him. Accordingly, we conclude that Reed suffered no prejudice from the exclusion of Detective Eshelman\u2019s testimony regarding Young\u2019s first police interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">{\u00b6 45} In summary, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it precluded Reed from offering alibi testimony. The trial court did not repeatedly disallow questions that were offered to attack the credibility of the state\u2019s witnesses. Thus, Reed\u2019s constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him was not violated. Any error by the trial court in allowing the state to present Young\u2019s prior consistent statements and in precluding defense counsel from providing extrinsic evidence of her prior inconsistent statements was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">{\u00b6 46} Reed\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-9\">{\u00b6 47} \u201c2. The court should overturn defendant-appellant\u2019s conviction, because the verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-10\">{\u00b6 48} \u201c3. The trial court improperly denied defendant-appellant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal under Criminal Rule 29.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-11\">{\u00b6 49} In his second and third assignments of error, which we will treat together, Reed claims that the trial court improperly denied his motion for judgment of acquittal and that his conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence. He contends that the inconsistencies in the witnesses\u2019 stories, the lack of physical evidence, and the lack of credibility of the state\u2019s witnesses clearly show that the state failed to prove that he committed the offenses of murder and tampering with evidence. Specifically, he claims that the state has failed to prove that he was present at the scene of the shooting on the date in question, that he actually caused or attempted to cause physical harm to Smith, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>or that he knowingly disposed of the firearm. He argues that had he been allowed to impeach the witnesses\u2019 credibility and to present evidence regarding their motives, the jury would not have found him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">{\u00b6 50} Crim.R. 29(A) provides that the trial court shall enter a judgment of acquittal on one or more offenses charged in the indictment if the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction of such offense or offenses. \u201c \u2018[Sufficiency\u2019 is a term of art meaning that legal standard which is applied to determine whether the case may go to the jury or whether the evidence is legally sufficient to support the jury verdict as a matter of law.\u201d <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386, 678 N.E.2d 541, citing Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed.1990) 1433. When reviewing the sufficiency of evidence, the relevant inquiry is whether any rational finder of fact, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the state, could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Dennis </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 421, 430, 683 N.E.2d 1096, citing <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>(1979), 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560. A guilty verdict will not be disturbed on appeal unless \u201creasonable minds could not reach the conclusion reached by the trier-of-fact.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">{\u00b6 51} When a conviction is challenged on appeal as being against the manifest weight of the evidence, we must review the entire record, weigh the evidence and all reasonable inferences, consider witness credibility, and determine whether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the trier of fact \u201c \u2018clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Thompkins, </em>78 Ohio St.3d at 387, 678 N.E.2d 541, quoting <em>State v. Martin </em>(1983), 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 20 OBR 215, 485 N.E.2d 717. Because the trier of fact sees and hears the witnesses and is particularly competent to decide \u201cwhether, and to what extent, to credit the testimony of particular witnesses,\u201d we must afford substantial deference to its determinations of credibility. <em>State v. Lawson </em>(Aug. 22,1997), Montgomery App. No. 16288, 1997 WL 476684. A judgment should be reversed as being against the manifest weight of the evidence only in exceptional circumstances. <em>Martin, </em>20 Ohio App.3d at 175, 20 OBR 215, 485 N.E.2d 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">{\u00b6 52} We have no problem finding extensive evidence to support the guilty verdicts on both the murder and the tampering-with-evidence charges. R.C. 2903.02(B) provides that a person commits murder when he \u201ccause[s] the death of another as a proximate result of the offender\u2019s committing or attempting to commit an offense of violation that is a felony of the first or second degree and that is not a violation of section 2903.03 or 2903.04 of the Revised Code.\u201d The state alleged that Smith\u2019s death was the proximate result of a felonious assault by Reed. Beginning with Reed\u2019s presence at the scene of the crime, Robinson and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>Jones testified that they, along with Manns, Smith, and Reed, arrived at Reed\u2019s residence shortly after 11:00 p.m. on October 21, 2000. Robinson and Jones further testified that Reed and Smith went down the sidewalk alongside Reed\u2019s apartment building toward the alley behind it. They both testified that they, along with Manns, went inside Reed\u2019s apartment. Jones testified that they sat down and began to watch television. She further stated that after 10 or 15 minutes, Robinson went outside to look for Reed. Robinson testified that he walked to the end of the sidewalk, and he soon saw Reed walking toward him from the alley. Egler testified that shortly after 11:00 p.m., he heard voices, followed by a gunshot. He testified that he initially took cover, then retrieved a flashlight that was located a few steps from the bathroom. He went to the bathroom window, called his wife over to look, and then they called the police. Officer Mamula testified that he was dispatched to the Egler\u2019s address at 11:26 p.m. Although there were no eyewitnesses to the shooting of Joseph Smith, a rational fact finder could find, based on the circumstantial evidence presented, that Reed was present in the alley at the time that Smith was shot, i.e., between shortly after 11:00 p.m. and just before 11:26 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">{\u00b6 53} The jury was also presented with ample circumstantial evidence that Reed was in possession of the gun used to kill Smith and that he used the gun to kill him. Both Robinson and Jones testified that Reed possessed a gun on the night of the shooting. Robinson testified that before entering the \u201cafter-hours joint\u201d subsequent to leaving Reed\u2019s apartment on October 21, 2000, Reed held a gun and asked whether he could bring the weapon inside. Jones likewise testified to this conversation. Robinson identified the weapon as a plastic type Glock 9 millimeter. Jeffrey Holmes, a Dayton police officer assigned to the crime scene investigations unit, testified that a 9-millimeter shell casing was found next to Smith\u2019s body in the alley and that the lead portion of a bullet was located in the back door frame of Egler\u2019s home. Robinson, Jones, Wendling, Holloway, Young, and Shoemaker each testified that Reed told them that he had shot Smith. The jury could have reasonably determined that Reed possessed a firearm while he was in the alley with Smith and that Reed shot Smith on October 21, 2000. In other words, the jury could have reasonably concluded, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Reed had caused the death of Joseph Smith as a proximate result of committing the offense of felonious assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">{\u00b6 54} As for the tampering-with-evidence charge, the record demonstrates that Reed was aware of the police investigation of the shooting death of Joseph Smith. Reed himself testified that the police came by his house a couple days after the shooting and that on October 26, 2000, he spoke with Detective Martin at the Safety Building in Dayton. In addition, Peter Holloway testified that Reed admitted to disposing of the gun by a river. Heather Wendling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>likewise testified that Reed said that he had killed Joe Smith but that they would not be able to prove it, because \u201che had got rid of whatever he used.\u201d Based on the record, we conclude that Reed\u2019s conviction on the tampering with evidence charge was not against the manifest weight of the evidence, nor did the trial court err in overruling his motion for judgment of acquittal on that charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">{\u00b6 55} Our conclusion is not altered by the fact that some of the evidence provided by the state\u2019s witnesses was inconsistent. During closing arguments, defense counsel argued that Valerie Fenton, Smith\u2019s girlfriend, provided evidence that Smith may have been picked up by Robinson, Jones, and Reed closer to 10:30 p.m. In addition, Reed had testified on his own behalf, indicating that they had arrived at his apartment about 10:40 p.m. and that they all (including Smith) went into his apartment. Defense counsel also attempted to impeach the credibility of Jones, Young, Wendling, and Shoemaker by indicating that they either made prior inconsistent statements to the police or that Reed had previously told them that he did not kill Smith. The jury was free to believe the testimony provided by Robinson and Jones and thus to credit the timeline proffered by the state. Moreover, in light of the fact that Robinson, Jones, Young, Wendling, Shoemaker, and Holloway each testified that Reed ultimately had confessed to the killing, the jury could have reasonably concluded that these statements were credible. The trial court\u2019s credibility determinations are entitled to great deference by a reviewing court. See <em>State v. Sherrill </em>(Jan. 28, 2000), Montgomery App. No. 17359, 2000 WL 84642.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">{\u00b6 56} In addition, the fact that the state\u2019s case consisted principally of circumstantial evidence does not warrant reversal of Reed\u2019s conviction. It is well settled that a defendant may be convicted solely on the basis of circumstantial evidence. <em>State v. Nicely </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 147, 529 N.E.2d 1236. Moreover, as stated by the Supreme Court of Ohio, \u201ccircumstantial evidence may be more certain, satisfying, and persuasive than direct evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Jackson </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 29, 38, 565 N.E.2d 549. As aptly put by the state: \u201cDefendants charged with murder are not to be rewarded for failing to commit their crimes in broad daylight in the presence of witnesses.\u201d Accordingly, reliance upon circumstantial evidence to place Reed at the scene of the crime and to prove that he shot Smith and tampered with evidence does not render Reed\u2019s conviction against the manifest weight of the evidence. To the contrary, the circumstantial and physical evidence offered by the state strongly supports the convictions for murder and tampering with evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">{\u00b6 57} Reed\u2019s second and third assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">{\u00b6 58} The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b477-10\">' Brogan and Frederick N.
