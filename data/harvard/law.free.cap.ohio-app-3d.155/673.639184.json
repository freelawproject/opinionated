We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-11\">{\u00b6 2} Wendy and her first husband, appellee, Gregory Barker, were divorced in 1997. Wendy maintained custody of the three Barker children and was named the residential parent of Zachary, Jessica, and Nicholas.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-12\">{\u00b6 3} Thereafter, Wendy married her current spouse, Jeff Gramza. Wendy and Gramza have children of their own as a result of that marriage. On January 10, 2003, Wendy applied to change Zachary\u2019s, Jessica\u2019s, and Nicholas\u2019 surname to Gramza so all of her children would have the same surname.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-13\">{\u00b6 4} A hearing was held and, based upon the testimony, the trial court denied Wendy\u2019s application to change Zachary\u2019s, Jessica\u2019s, and Nicholas\u2019 surname to Gramza on April 23, 2003. Wendy appeals the decision raising a single assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>{\u00b6 5} \u201cThe trial court erred in denying the petition for name change.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">{\u00b6 6} Wendy argues that \u201cthe trial court abuses its discretion in denying a residential parent\u2019s petition to change a name of minor children to her name, where the evidence shows the change would not negatively affect the child\u2019s relationship with either parent other than by speculation.\u201d Wendy maintains that \u201cthe children have identified with a family unit with the proposed new name, the child[ren] had actually begun to use the new surname, and that the child[ren], of sufficient maturity, [have] expressed a preference for the name change.\u201d Wendy contends that \u201cthe change would be consistent with that of the child[ren]\u2019s residential parent and that there has been embarrassment, discomfort, or inconvenience as a result of the different name from that of the residential parent, which would be avoided by the name change.\u201d Wendy contends that the nonresidential parent has demonstrated \u201ca lack of or reduced maintenance of contact and support for the children].\u201d Therefore, Wendy argues that \u201cit is in the child\u2019s best interest to have the name change.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">{\u00b6 7} R.C. 2717.01 regulates proceedings to change a person\u2019s name. R.C. 2717.01(B), which governs name changes for minors, provides that \u201c[a]n application for change of name may be made on behalf of a minor by either of the minor\u2019s parents, a legal guardian, or a guardian ad litem. When application is made on behalf of a minor, in addition to the notice and proof required pursuant to division (A) of this section, the consent of both living, legal parents of the minor shall be filed, or notice of the hearing shall be given to the parent or parents not consenting.\u201d Id. Therefore, pursuant to R.C. 2717.01(B), appellant, as the children\u2019s mother, had the right to request the name change, and it is uncontested that their father received notice of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">{\u00b6 8} The standard for deciding whether to permit a name change is \u201cproof that * * * the facts set forth in the application show reasonable and proper cause for changing the name of the applicant.\u201d R.C. 2717.01(A); <em>In re Willhite </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 28, 30, 706 N.E.2d 778. This determination must consider the best interest of the child. Id. at 32, 706 N.E.2d 778. We will reverse a probate court\u2019s determination of whether a proposed name change is in a child\u2019s best interest only if it constitutes an abuse of discretion. <em>In re Crisafi </em>(1995), 104 Ohio App.3d 577, 581, 662 N.E.2d 887. An abuse of discretion \u201cconnotes more than an error of law or judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\u201d <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\"> {\u00b6 9} In order to determine whether reasonable and proper cause has been established, a court must consider the best interest of the child. <em>Willhite, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 32, 706 N.E.2d 778. In determining the best interest of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>child, the trial court should consider the following factors: the effect of the change on the preservation and development of the child\u2019s relationship with each parent; the identification of the child as part of a family unit; the length of time that the child has been using a surname; the preference of the child if the child is of sufficient maturity to express a meaningful preference; whether the child\u2019s surname is different from the surname of the child\u2019s residential parent; the embarrassment, discomfort, or inconvenience that may result when a child bears a surname different from the residential parent\u2019s; parental failure to maintain contact with and support of the child; and any other factor relevant to the child\u2019s best interest. Id.; <em>Bobo v. Jewell </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 330, 528 N.E.2d 180, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">{\u00b6 10} During the hearing, the trial court heard testimony from Wendy, Zachary, and Barker. Zachary testified that he was embarrassed at school because his last name was different from his mother\u2019s. Furthermore, Zachary testified that he was excited about having his surname changed. Wendy testified that changing the children\u2019s surname would save the children from \u201cconfusion, discomfort and embarrassment\u201d at school, the doctor\u2019s office, and at church. Barker testified that he is involved in his children\u2019s lives and changing their surnames would undermine his role as a father.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">{\u00b6 11} In reaching a final judgment, the trial court applied the factors of <em>Willhite. </em>The trial court found that although the children are close to their mother, to change their name would further disassociate them from their father. In addition, the trial court stated that although the children identify themselves as part of mother and stepfather\u2019s family unit, they \u201chave been known as Barker their whole lives.\u201d The trial court stated that \u201ca change from Barker\u2019s surname will, at a minimum, not foster their relationship with Barker and may undermine that relationship, Barker\u2019s support of the children, and Barker\u2019s regular contact with the children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">{\u00b6 12} The oldest child, Zachary, expressed a preference for the name change. Nevertheless, the trial court found that the reasons stated by all for a change are simply convenience and comfort. The trial court noted that \u201cdivorce is common in our society.\u201d The court found that \u201cthe children are subject to some confusion, embarrassment and inconvenience due to having a surname different from their residential parent\u201d; however, this \u201cis an unfortunate fact of modern society,\u201d and the \u201cinconvenience should not be so great as to be intolerable.\u201d Further, the court noted that Barker \u201cis neither notorious nor infamous.\u201d Therefore, there is no indication that Barker has so sullied his name that to be associated with him would cause the children great embarrassment or discomfort. Last, the trial court found that a change in surname \u201cin conjunction with the fact that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>Children reside with Mr. Gramza and refer to him as \u2018dad\u2019 is too much disassociation of the Children with their biological father.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">{\u00b6 13} Given the testimony and the trial court\u2019s application of the facts to the <em>Willhite </em>factors, we find the judgment was not unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. The sole assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b707-7\">Valen, P.J., and William W. Young, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
