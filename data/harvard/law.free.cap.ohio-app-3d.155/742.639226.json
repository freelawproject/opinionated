A patdown failed to reveal any weapons or contraband. Sowry was transported to the Miami County Jail by officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-17\">{\u00b6 3} At the jail, Sowry was asked whether he had any drugs on his person. He replied, \u201cNo.\u201d A more thorough search when he was booked in revealed a baggie of marijuana in his right front pants pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>{\u00b6 4} Sowry was charged with a violation of R.C. 2921.36(A)(2). He was tried and convicted and was subsequently sentenced to a one-year term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">{\u00b6 5} Sowry filed a timely notice of appeal. We granted his motion for release on bond pending appeal. Sowry presents three assignments of error. We will address the second of those first, as its resolution renders the other two moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">SECOND ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cThe court prejudicially erred in failing to grant the defendant\u2019s motion for Rule 29 judgment of acquittal, for the reason that the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to sustain a conviction in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">{\u00b6 7} Defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the state\u2019s case, citing the requirements for criminal liability in R.C. 2901.21(A). The trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-9\">{\u00b6 8} When determining a Crim.R. 29 motion, the trial court must consider the evidence in a light most favorable to the state and determine whether reasonable minds could reach different conclusions concerning whether the evidence the state presented, if believed, proves each and every element of the offense charged beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Bridgeman </em>(1978), 55 Ohio St.2d 261, 9 O.O.3d 401, 381 N.E.2d 184. A Crim.R. 29 motion must be granted when reasonable minds could only conclude that the evidence fails to prove the elements of the offense. <em>State v. Miley </em>(1996), 114 Ohio App.3d 738, 684 N.E.2d 102. Because a Crim.R. 29 motion presents an issue of law, our review of the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion is de novo. <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-10\">{\u00b6 9} R.C. 2921.36(A)(2) states: \u201cNo person shall knowingly convey, or attempt to convey, onto the grounds-of a detention facility * * * [a]ny drug of abuse, as defined in section 3719.011 of the Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b774-11\">{\u00b6 10} It is undisputed that the marijuana that was in Sowry\u2019s pants pocket when he was brought to the jail and which police found when he was searched there is a drug of abuse as defined by R.C. 3719.011, as well as R.C. 3719.01(0). Nor is it disputed that the Miami County Jail is a detention facility for purposes of R.C. 2921.36(A)(2). Rather, Sowry argues that the trial court erred when it denied his Crim.R. 29 motion because, due to the requirements of R.C. 2901.22(A), his conduct cannot render him criminally liable for a violation of R.C 2921.36(A)(2) on the facts that the state\u2019s evidence demonstrates. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-12\">{\u00b6 11} R.C. 2901.21(A) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>{\u00b6 12} \u201cExcept as provided in division (B) of this section, a person is not guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-5\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c(1) The person\u2019s liability is based on conduct that includes either a voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is capable of performing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-6\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c(2) The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the section defining the offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">{\u00b6 15} Subdivision (B) of R.C. 2901.21 concerns strict liability offenses, wherein no culpable mental state is prescribed, or those where no culpable mental state is specified but recklessness is the degree of culpability applicable. R.C. 2921.36(A)(2) prohibits \u201cknowingly\u201d conveying drugs into a detention facility. \u201cKnowingly\u201d is a culpable mental state. R.C. 2901.22(A) therefore must be satisfied in order for an accused to be criminally liable for a violation of R.C. 2921.36(A)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">{\u00b6 16} The \u201cvoluntary act\u201d or \u201comission\u201d requirement of R.C. 2901.22(A)(1) codifies the maxim of criminal law that criminal conduct must rest on an act, and the law will not punish for a guilty mind alone. The same applies to an omission to act, where both a duty to act is imposed by law and a capacity to act exists. The requirement in either instance is the \u201cactus res\u201d necessary to constitute a violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">{\u00b6 17} The conduct that a prohibited act involves must be voluntary in order for criminal liability to result. A reflexive or convulsive act is not voluntary and thus cannot be the basis of criminal liability. R.C. 2901.21(D)(2); <em>State v. Grimsley </em>(1982), 3 Ohio App.3d 265, 444 N.E.2d 1071. Similarly, acts performed while unconscious or sleepwalking are not voluntary acts. \u201cIn short, any act that is not the product of the actor\u2019s conscious determination is not a voluntary act.\u201d 2 Katz &amp; Gianelli, Criminal Law, Baldwin\u2019s Ohio Practice, Section 85:3, at 871.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-10\">{\u00b6 18} Sowry was arrested by police before he was brought to jail, and he was brought to jail under arrest. By suffering arrest or seizure of his person, Sowry was deprived of the fundamental, common-law \u201cright of every individual to the possession and control of his own person.\u201d <em>Union Pacific Ry. Co. v. Botsford </em>(1891), 141 U.S. 250, 251, 11 S.Ct. 1000, 35 L.Ed. 734. A person\u2019s capacity or ability to exercise that right is implicit in the measure of personal autonomy that a voluntary act involves.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-11\">{\u00b6 19} Exercising the power to control his person which their arrest of Sowry conferred on them, officers conveyed Sowry to and into the jail to facilitate his detention. That his \u201cperson\u201d and the possessions on his person were in the jail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>was therefore not a product of a voluntary act on Sowry\u2019s part. Rather, those events were, as to him, wholly involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">{\u00b6 20} The state argues that Sowry acted knowingly because he responded \u201cNo\u201d when he was asked at book-in whether he had any drugs, adding: \u201cThe Appellant chose not to be honest, and that was to his detriment.\u201d (Brief, at 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">{\u00b6 21} The state\u2019s assertion relates more to the culpable mental state that a violation of R.C. 2921.36(A)(2) requires, which is that conduct be engaged in \u201cknowingly,\u201d than it does to any particular conduct that that section prohibits. With respect to an actor\u2019s conduct, R.C. 2921.36(A)(2) imposes no legal duty to act in the way the state suggests Sowry ought to have acted in order to avoid being the author of his own misfortune. Even if it did, such a duty could not be enforceable when, as here, performing the duty would implicate him in criminal conduct: possession of drugs. Both the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and Section 10, Article I of the Ohio Constitution prohibit compulsion of that kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">{\u00b6 22} At most, Sowry might be charged with knowing that drugs were on his person when officers conveyed him to jail. However, as we said above, the law will not punish for a guilty mind alone. Because Sowry\u2019s conduct with respect to the R.C. 2921.36(A)(2) violation with which he was charged cannot satisfy the requirement for criminal liability that R.C. 2901.22(A)(1) imposes, the trial court erred when it denied Sowry\u2019s Crim.R. 29 motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">{\u00b6 23} The second assignment of error is sustained. Sowry\u2019s first and third assignments of error, which concern a pretrial motion to suppress evidence and the manifest weight of the evidence on which he was convicted, respectively, are rendered moot by our resolution of Sowry\u2019s second assignment of error. Therefore, per App.R. 12(A)(1)(c), we decline to decide the other error which Sowry assigns.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-9\">{\u00b6 24} Having sustained the second assignment of error, we will reverse and vacate Sowry\u2019s conviction for a violation of R.C. 2921.36(A)(2), enter a judgment of acquittal on that charge, and order him discharged from any penalty imposed upon his conviction for that offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-10\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b776-11\">Brogan and Wolff, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
