Appellant, in her complaint, alleged that appellee, on or about June 9, 1995, had failed to properly diagnose and treat her for Epstein-Barr virus. After the trial court granted summary judgment to appellee, appellant appealed. Pursuant to an opinion filed on March 7, 2000, in case No. 99AP-219, 2000 WL 254315, the Tenth District Court of Appeals reversed the judgment of the trial court in part and remanded the matter for further proceedings. The Tenth District Court of Appeals, in its opinion, noted that \u201c[d]ue to her lack of an expert medical witness, plaintiff cannot prevail in the current posture of this case,\u201d but reversed the judgment of the trial court, since appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment was not accompanied by an affidavit or any other Civ.R. 56(C) materials. Upon remand, appellant then dismissed her complaint without prejudice in March 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-12\">{\u00b6 3} Subsequently, on March 13, 2001, appellant filed a complaint against appellee in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (case No. 01CVA03-2391). Appellant, in her complaint, specifically alleged that she sought medical care from appellee in May 1995 and that appellee was negligent in failing to properly diagnosis and treat her for Epstein-Barr virus \u201con or about June 9, 1995,\u201d and in failing to disclose test results to appellant. According to appellant, such test results \u201cshowed positive for Epstein-Barr virus.\u201d Appellant further alleged in her complaint that appellee did not meet the standard of care due her. In short, appellant alleged a cause of action for medical malpractice against appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>{\u00b6 4} Thereafter, appellant, on May 11, 2001, while the above case was still pending in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, filed a complaint against appellee in the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas (case No. 01-CVA-05-243). Appellant, in such complaint, alleged as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-5\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cPlaintiff was a patient of Doctor Urban in Franklin County from May thru September, 1995. Defendant orally areed [sic] to treat plaintiff for medical problems in which he was qualified to prescribe medication and treatment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-6\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cIV. Defendant was given reimbursement for his services and subsequently failed to fulfill his legal contractual obligations as to not disclosing information to plaintiff, misleading plaintiff, and giving plaintiff false information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-7\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cV. Defendant did not in good faith fulfill his obligations to plaintiff as a patient or client. Defendant, in fact, refused to treat plaintiff after plaintiff had become ill, approximately four months after initially visiting his business facility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-8\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cVI. Plaintiff requests this court relief for breach of contract, fraudulent information, and failure to fulfill his duty to plaintiff as a physician.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">{\u00b6 9} Thereafter, appellee, on September 6, 2001, filed a motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative, to transfer in the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas. In his motion, appellee argued that appellant\u2019s complaint in the Delaware County Court should be dismissed since, (1) although framed as a breach of contract action, appellant\u2019s case in the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas constituted a medical malpractice action under Ohio law, (2) both the Franklin County and Delaware County actions arose out of appellee\u2019s treatment of appellant during the same period of time, and (3) appellant could not split her cause of action for medical malpractice into two separate actions in two separate courts. In the alternative, appellee argued that since the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas had jurisdictional priority, the trial court should transfer the Delaware action to Franklin County. Appellant did not file a response to appellee\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">{\u00b6 10} While appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative, to transfer was pending in the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas, appellant, in September 2001, filed a complaint against Capital Primary Care in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, Eastern Division (case No. 2-01-911). In her federal complaint, appellant alleged that appellee, an employee of Capital Primary Care, failed to provide appropriate medical treatment to her on May 12, 1995. Since the complaint did not plead any federal cause of action, the magistrate, in his September 19, 2001, initial screening report and recommendation, recommended that appellant\u2019s federal action be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>{\u00b6 11} Subsequently, as memorialized in an entry filed on October 8, 2001, the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas, in case No. 01-CVA-05-243, granted appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment and ordered that appellant\u2019s complaint be dismissed without prejudice. Two weeks later, on October 22, 2001, appellee filed a motion for attorney fees under R.C. 2323.51 for frivolous conduct, seeking attorney fees incurred as a result of defending the Delaware County action. Thereafter, an evidentiary hearing was held before the trial court on November 9, 2001. Appellant failed to appear at the same. As memorialized in a judgment entry filed on November 13, 2001, in the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas case No. 01-CVA-05-0243, the trial court granted appellee\u2019s motion for attorney fees under R.C. 2323.51 for frivolous conduct and held that appellee was entitled to recover from appellant attorney fees in the amount of $6,535.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">{\u00b6 12} Appellant then filed a notice of appeal. Pursuant to an opinion filed on June 27, 2002, in our case No. 01CAE12064, 2002-Ohio-3472, 2002 WL 1467707, this court affirmed the judgment of the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas in case No. 01-CVA-05-243.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">{\u00b6 13} Thereafter, on November 18, 2002, appellant filed a complaint for money against appellee in the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas (case No. 02CV-A-11-677). Appellant, in her complaint, alleged, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-7\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cPlaintiff was a patient of Doctor Urban in Franklin County about May thru September, 1995.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-8\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cDefendant orally agreed with plaintiff to treat plaintiff for medical problems in which he was qualified to prescribe medication and treatment. Defendant was given reimbursement for his services and subsequently failed to fulfill his legal obligations as to disclosing medical information, misleading his patient, and giving his patient false information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-9\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cDefendant did not in good faith fulfill his obligations to plaintiff as a patient or client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-10\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cDefendant, in fact, refused to treat plaintiff after she had become ill, approximately four months after initially visiting his business facility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-11\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cPlaintiff is suing defendant for breach of contract, fraudulent information, and not fulfilling his duty or promise to plaintiff as a physician. Plaintiff requests damages and losses due to this breach of contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-12\">{\u00b6 19} Appellee filed an answer and counterclaim on December 12, 2002. In his counterclaim, appellee alleged that appellant was a vexatious litigator pursuant to R.C. 2323.52. Appellant, in her reply to appellee\u2019s counterclaim, asked the trial court \u201cto reconsider its decision to award attorney\u2019s fees under ORC Section 2323.51, frivolous conduct under Ohio Civil Rule 60, Relief from Judgment or Order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>{\u00b6 20} Subsequently, on December 26, 2002, appellant filed a motion requesting a case management conference. Appellant, in her motion, stated in part, as follows: \u201cThis case must be heard on issues presented by plaintiff and defendant at this time and due to plaintiffs assertion that under Civil Rule 60, this court provide relief from Judge Shaw\u2019s order for attorney fees in the previously filed case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">{\u00b6 21} On January 27, 2003, appellee filed a motion for summary judgment in Delaware Common Pleas case No. 02CV-A-11-677 \u201con the grounds that Plaintiff Linda Castrataro has violated Ohio law by splitting her single cause of action into two separate actions, which she filed in two separate courts.\u201d Appellee also alleged, in his motion, that appellant \u201chas habitually, persistently, and without reasonable grounds engaged in vexatious conduct, including re-filing the instant case despite this court\u2019s prior dismissal of her claims.\u201d Appellant, in response, filed a \u201cMemorandum Contra Motion for Summary Judgment; Oral Hearing Requested; Motion Contra Counterclaim of Vexatious Litigator/Motion for Oral Hearing on Civil Rule 60 Motion.\u201d Appellant, in the same, requested oral hearings \u201con this motion and the Civil Rule 60 motion for relief from judgment/order of the previous filed case in this court which was stated in plaintiffs counterclaim and motion for case management conference.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">{\u00b6 22} Pursuant to a judgment entry filed on May 9, 2003, the trial court granted appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment, stating, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-7\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cAn examination of the pleadings both here and in Franklin County quite clearly reveals that Plaintiff has pursued and is presently pursuing a malpractice action against Dr. Urban arising out of the same operative and material facts, though her Franklin County actions sound in tort while the actions before this Court sound in contract. It is equally clear the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas obtained jurisdiction to adjudicate Plaintiffs malpractice claim prior in time to this Court obtaining jurisdiction. Therefore, this Court is, once again, without jurisdiction to consider Plaintiffs claim leaving it with no choice but to sustain Defendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">{\u00b6 24} The trial court, in its entry, further held that while appellant attempted, in her memorandum contra appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment, to frame her cause of action as one of fraud, appellant had failed to plead the elements of fraud at all, let alone \u201cwith any semblance of particularity.\u201d Finally, the trial court, in its entry, also declared appellant a vexatious litigator.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">{\u00b6 25} It is from the trial court\u2019s May 9, 2003 judgment entry that appellant now appeals, raising the following assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-10\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cI. The trial court erred in dismissing the case after granting summary judgment since it stated plaintiff cannot split her cause of action in Delaware <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>County and Franklin County sharing concurrent jurisdiction and therefore the court must transfer or remand the case to Franklin County on that basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-5\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cII. The trial court abuses its discretion by constantly making plagiarized statements throughout its discretion [sic] identical to defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and citations which are exactly identical to defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. These arguments show no train of thought separate from defendant\u2019s repetitious arguments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-6\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cHI. The trial court erred in denying plaintiffs fraud provision as stated in complaint and in the motion contra summary judgment. Plaintiff did state with particularity the elements of fraud in accordance with Ohio Civil Rule 9(B) and should be considered fully as an argument as separate from medical malpractice as stated in the decision page 6.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-7\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cIV. The trial court erred in not scheduling a hearing on plaintiffs Ohio Civil Rule 60(B) motion, which was stated in the reply to defendant\u2019s counterclaim and in the memorandum contra summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-8\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cV. The trial court erred in determining that the plaintiff engaged in vexatious conduct as outlined in Ohio Revised Code Section 2323.52. This motion to sustain defendant\u2019s counterclaim of vexatious conduct is contrary to O.R.C. 2323.52. This designation borders on libel and slander.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-9\">{\u00b6 31} \u2018VI. The trial court erred in granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Summary judgment motions are not granted if there are any genuine issues of material facts. These facts were not examined nor addressed in the motion for summary judgment nor the court\u2019s decision. This is contrary to summary judgment procedure and laws in Ohio.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">Summary Judgment Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b633-11\">{\u00b6 32} Summary judgment proceedings present the appellate court with the unique opportunity of reviewing the evidence in the same manner as the trial court. <em>Smiddy v. The Wedding Party, Inc. </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St.3d 35, 36, 30 OBR 78, 506 N.E.2d 212. As such, we must refer to Civ.R. 56(C), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-12\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cSummary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, written admissions, affidavits, transcripts of evidence, and written stipulations of fact, if any, timely filed in the action, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. * * * A summary judgment shall not be rendered unless it appears from the evidence or stipulation, and only from the evidence or stipulation, that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>judgment is made, that party being entitled to have the evidence or stipulation construed most strongly in the party\u2019s favor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">{\u00b6 34} Pursuant to the above rule, a trial court may not enter summary judgment if it appears that a material fact is genuinely disputed. The party moving for summary judgment bears the initial burden of informing the trial court of the basis for its motion and identifying those portions of the record that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. The moving party may not make a conclusory assertion that the nonmoving party has no evidence to prove its case. The moving party must specifically point to some evidence that demonstrates that the nonmoving party cannot support its claim. If the moving party satisfies this requirement, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to set forth specific facts demonstrating that there is a genuine issue of material fact for trial. <em>Vakila v. Hall </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 421, 429, 674 N.E.2d 1164, citing <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 662 N.E.2d 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">{\u00b6 35} It is based upon this standard that we review appellant\u2019s assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">I, III</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">{\u00b6 36} Appellant, in her first and third assignments of error, argues that the trial court erred in granting appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Appellant specifically contends that the trial court erred in finding that appellant split her cause of action for medical malpractice into two claims in two different courts\u2014the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas and the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas. Appellant further maintains that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to appellee on appellant\u2019s fraud claim. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">{\u00b6 37} As is stated above, appellant, in Franklin County Court of Common Pleas case No. 01CVA03-2391, alleged that appellee had committed medical malpractice by failing to properly diagnosis and treat her for Epstein-Barr virus \u201con or about June 9, 1995,\u201d and in failing to disclose test results to appellant. Appellee, in her \u201ccomplaint for money\u201d in the case sub judice, alleged that appellee breached his contract with appellee by failing to disclose medical information to her, giving her false and misleading information, and \u201cnot fulfilling his duty or promise\u201d to appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">{\u00b6 38} However, under Ohio law, a patient cannot bring an action against a physician for breach of contract on grounds that the physician negligently performed the contract to provide medical services. Whether the alleged professional misconduct is based on tort or contract, the claim is still for malpractice. See <em>Klema v. St. Elizabeth\u2019s Hosp. </em>(1960), 170 Ohio St. 519, 11 O.O.2d 326, 166 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>N.E.2d 765; and <em>Robb v. Community Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1989), 63 Ohio App.3d 803, 805, 580 N.E.2d 451. Thus, although couched as a \u201ccomplaint for money,\u201d appellee\u2019s complaint in the case sub judice was, in reality, a medical malpractice complaint against appellee. Appellant, therefore, had filed a medical malpractice action based on the same facts in both the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas and the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">{\u00b6 39} Since, therefore, both the Franklin County case and the case sub judice arise from the same set of facts and are both medical malpractice actions, we find that the trial court did not err in granting appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">{\u00b6 40} As is stated above, appellant also argues that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to appellee on appellant\u2019s fraud claim. Civ.R. 9(B) provides that when a complainant alleges a claim for fraud or mistake, \u201cthe circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity.\u201d As stated in <em>Aluminum Line Products Co. v. Brad Smith Roofing Co., Inc. </em>(1996), 109 Ohio App.3d 246, 259, 671 N.E.2d 1343:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-7\">{\u00b641} \u201cThe \u2018circumstances constituting fraud\u2019 include the time, place and content of the false representation; the fact represented; the identification of the individual giving the false representation; and the nature of what was obtained or given as a consequence of the fraud.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">{\u00b6 42} We find that the trial court did not err in granting appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment with respect to appellee\u2019s fraud claim, since appellee, in her complaint, did not plead fraud with any particularity. Appellant, in her complaint in this matter, merely alleged that appellant gave her fraudulent or false information. Appellant never indicated in her complaint the content of the allegedly false representation(s) and the nature of what was obtained or given as a consequence of the fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">{\u00b6 43} Appellant\u2019s first and third assignments of error are, therefore, overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b635-11\">{\u00b6 44} Appellant, in her second assignment of error, contends that the trial court abused its discretion \u201cby constantly making plagiarized statements throughout its discretion [sic] identical to defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and citations which are exactly identical to defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment.\u201d In short, appellant maintains that the trial court showed bias or prejudice against her by citing the same cases in its decision as appellee cited in its motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>{\u00b6 45} However, the fact that the trial court may have cited the same cases in its decision as appellee cited in his motion does not indicate bias or prejudice but merely indicates that the trial court found such cases to be relevant. Moreover, appellant, in her brief, has failed to cite any case law supporting her argument that the trial court erred in citing such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">{\u00b6 46} Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is, therefore, overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">{\u00b6 47} Appellant, in her fourth assignment of error, argues that the trial court erred in failing to schedule a hearing on appellant\u2019s Civ.R. 60(B) motion for relief from judgment or order.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">{\u00b6 48} We find, however, that the trial court did not err in failing to hold a hearing, since, as noted by the trial court in its decision, there is no evidence on the record that appellant ever filed a motion pursuant to Civ.R. 60. Furthermore, while appellant, in her counterclaim and in her February 21, 2003 \u201cMemorandum Contra Motion for Summary Judgment; Oral Hearing Requested; Motion Contra Counterclaim of Vexatious Litigator/Motion for Oral Hearing on Civil Rule 60 Motion\u201d asks the trial court for relief from its entry ordering appellant to pay attorney fees to appellee for frivolous conduct, we note that the entry ordering appellant to pay the same was filed in Delaware case No. 01-CVA-05-243, not in the case sub judice. Appellant should, therefore, have filed any 60(B) motion in such case and not in the case sub judice.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">{\u00b6 49} Appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error is, therefore, overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b636-11\">{\u00b6 50} Appellant, in her fifth assignment of error, challenges the trial court\u2019s decision holding that appellant is a vexatious litigator pursuant to R.C. 2323.52.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-12\">{\u00b6 51} As an initial matter, we note that appellant, in her brief, argues that R.C. 2323.52 was not complied with, since appellee did not file a civil action to have appellant declared a vexatious litigator. Appellant specifically cites R.C. 2323.52(C), which states as follows: \u201cA civil action to have a person declared a vexatious litigator shall proceed as any other civil action, and the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure apply to the action.\u201d Appellant argues that since appellee did not file a civil action but rather filed a counterclaim against appellant requesting that the trial court deem appellant a vexatious litigator, such rule was not complied with. However, a party may file a counterclaim seeking to have a person declared a vexatious litigator. See, for example, <em>Borger v. McErlane </em>(Dec. 14, 2001), Hamilton App. No. C-010262, 2001 WL 1591338.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>{\u00b6 52} R.C. 2323.52(A)(3) states, in part, as follows: \u201c \u201cVexatious litigator\u2019 means any person who has habitually, persistently, and without reasonable grounds engaged in vexatious conduct in a civil action or actions, whether in the court of claims or in a court of appeals, court of common pleas, municipal court, or county court, whether the person or another person instituted the civil action or actions, and whether the vexatious conduct was against the same party or against different parties in the civil action or actions.\u201d \u201cVexatious conduct\u201d is defined in R.C. 2323.52(A)(2) as meaning \u201cconduct of a party in a civil action that satisfies any of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-5\">{\u00b6 53} \u201c(a) The conduct obviously serves merely to harass or maliciously injure another party to the civil action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-6\">{\u00b6 54} \u201c(b) The conduct is not warranted under existing law and cannot be supported by a good faith argument for an extension, modification, or reversal of existing law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-7\">{\u00b6 55} \u201c(c) The conduct is imposed solely for delay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">{\u00b6 56} We find that the trial court did not err in finding that appellant habitually and persistently engaged in vexatious conduct. As is set forth in detail in the statement of facts, appellant has brought numerous lawsuits against appellee in different courts all based on his alleged malpractice in treating appellant in 1995. Appellant initially filed a complaint against appellee in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (case No. 97CVA04-4393). After the Tenth District Court of Appeals reversed the judgment and remanded the matter to the trial court, appellant voluntarily dismissed her complaint in that case. We note that the Tenth District Court of Appeals, in its opinion, noted that \u201c[d]ue to her lack of an expert medical witness, plaintiff cannot prevail in the current posture of this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">{\u00b6 57} Appellant then refiled her complaint against appellee in Franklin County Common Pleas case No. 010VA03-2391. While that case was pending, appellant filed a complaint for breach of contract against appellee in the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas (case No. 01CV-A-05-243). The trial court, in the Delaware case, granted appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment, which was unopposed by appellant, and granted appellee\u2019s motion for attorney fees for frivolous conduct. However, despite this court\u2019s June 27, 2002 opinion in case No. 01 CAE12064, 2002 WL 1467707, which affirmed the trial court\u2019s holding that appellant had engaged in frivolous conduct in such case, appellant, on November 18, 2002, filed another complaint against appellee. Although captioned a \u201ccomplaint for money,\u201d as is stated above, that complaint was, in reality, a complaint alleging that appellee had committed medical malpractice.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>{\u00b6 58} Based on the foregoing, we concur with the trial court that \u201cin the end, plaintiff offered no credible argument and cited no case law suggesting she may split her present or previous malpractice claim into separate actions and pursue those separate actions in courts sharing concurrent jurisdiction. Plaintiffs conduct in pursuing her claims before this court was not warranted under existing law and certainly not supported by a good faith argument for either a modification or a reversal of existing law. Moreover, plaintiffs pursuit of her claim before this court while simultaneously pursuing the same claim before the court that first acquired jurisdiction to consider the claim served to harass the defendant and cause him considerable expense. Thus, plaintiff has habitually, persistently, and without reasonable grounds engaged in vexatious conduct in civil actions before this court against the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">{\u00b6 59} Appellant\u2019s fifth assignment of error is, therefore, overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">{\u00b6 60} Appellant, in her sixth assignment of error, argues that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to appellee, since appellee failed to establish that there were no genuine issues of material fact in dispute. Appellant specifically asserts that the trial court \u201cnever once examined any evidence as outlined in Civil Rule 56 including depositions, affidavits, pleadings, etc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">{\u00b6 61} Civ.R. 56(C) states, in part: \u201cSummary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, written admissions, affidavits, transcripts of evidence, and written stipulations of fact, if any, timely filed in the action, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Appellee, in support of his motion for summary judgment, attached certified copies of the pleadings and decisions filed in the other actions that appellant filed against appellee. The trial court, in its entry granting appellee\u2019s motion, referred to the same in ruling on appellee\u2019s motion. Thus, contrary to appellant\u2019s argument, there was Civ.R. 56 evidence presented to the trial court showing that there were no genuine issues of material facts in dispute and such evidence was considered by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">{\u00b6 62} Appellant\u2019s sixth assignment of error is, therefore, overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-10\">{\u00b6 63} Accordingly, the judgment of the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b638-12\">Gwin, P.J., and Wise, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
