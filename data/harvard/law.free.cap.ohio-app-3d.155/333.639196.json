Hannold Jr. (\u201cHannold\u201d), appeals from the judgment entered by the Ashtabula County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division. The trial court terminated Hannold\u2019s parental rights when it granted permanent custody of his daughter, Debbie Stillman (\u201cDebbie\u201d), to appellee, the Ashtabula County Children Services Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">{\u00b6 2} Debbie is the child involved in this action. She was born in August 1997. Hannold is Debbie\u2019s natural father. Debra Stillman (\u201cDebra\u201d) is Debbie\u2019s natural mother. Hannold and Debra were never married and did not live together during any of the relevant time periods of these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">{\u00b6 3} Debbie has a variety of medical ailments, including juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. This condition has resulted in Debbie\u2019s legs being severely bent. She has undergone several surgeries and takes medication for this condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-12\">{\u00b6 4} In January 2000, appellee filed for temporary custody of Debbie, due to allegations that Debra was not providing adequate medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-13\">{\u00b6 5} In April 2000, Debbie was returned to Debra\u2019s care with an order of protective supervision. A condition of this placement was that Debra would cooperate with Shriner\u2019s Hospital in the medical treatment of Debbie. However, in May 2000, Debbie did not show up for her scheduled admission to the hospital. Thereafter, on May 12, 2000, appellee was again granted temporary custody of Debbie.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>{\u00b6 6} On May 22, 2000, Hannold petitioned the court for temporary custody of Debbie. He was not immediately granted visitation or made part of the case plan because of the uncertainty of his status as Debbie\u2019s father. Debra reportedly informed appellee that another individual was Debbie\u2019s father. Further, she indicated that if Hannold was Debbie\u2019s father, it was because he raped her. Appellee later determined that the rape accusations to be unfounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">{\u00b6 7} Hannold had a paternity test conducted in 1998. This test indicated that he was Debbie\u2019s father to a certainty in excess of 99.9 percent. However, this was not recognized by appellee. A second test was conducted, which also established that Hannold was Debbie\u2019s father with a certainty in excess of 99.9 percent. Appellee\u2019s case plan was amended to include Hannold in April 2001. This plan was approved by the court in May 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">{\u00b6 8} Initially after being added to the case plan, there were several objectives set forth for Hannold to meet. He needed to attend parenting classes. He needed to attend literacy classes. He also had to find suitable housing, because, at the time, Hannold was living in an apartment above a business that he considered inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">{\u00b6 9} Hannold has an IQ in the low seventies. At the time of the hearing, he was living with a female companion, Barbara Grey, and her two adult sons. Carrie Colby, the caseworker assigned to this case, indicated that this was adequate housing.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">{\u00b6 10} Hannold was granted visitation with Debbie. He was also permitted to attend physical therapy sessions with her. Debra Hills, the physical therapist overseeing Debbie\u2019s treatment, testified that Hannold had difficulty learning to assist Debbie in two of three exercises she needed. However, she did indicate that Debbie would \u201cshut down\u201d and resisted doing her exercises if she was nervous or uncomfortable.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">{\u00b6 11} After Debbie was taken from Debra\u2019s custody the second time, Debra has been virtually nonexistent in these proceedings. She did not appear at the final hearing and is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">{\u00b6 12} Due to Debra\u2019s absence, the goal of the case plan was permanent custody. This goal was changed to placement with Hannold in October 2001. However, it was returned to permanent custody in January 2002, when, on January 11, 2002, appellee filed a motion for permanent custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-11\">{\u00b6 13} On January 28, 2002, Hannold filed a motion for summary judgment. On May 9, 2002, appellee filed its brief in opposition. The trial court did not rule on Hannold\u2019s motion for summary judgment prior to the adjudicatory hearing, in September 2002. At the hearing, the trial court orally overruled Hannold\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Then, in April 2003, in the final judgment entry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>in which it rendered its ultimate decision, the trial court overruled Hannold\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">{\u00b6 14} A hearing was held on appellee\u2019s motion for permanent custody in September 2002. Peter Laveck and Carrie Colby, caseworkers of appellee assigned to the case, testified. In addition, Dr. Patricia Gillette testified at length regarding her opinion as to what would be in Debbie\u2019s best interest. Based upon the interviews she conducted with all of the key characters and the tests she performed on Hannold, Dr. Gillette concluded that it would be in Debbie\u2019s best interest for the motion for permanent custody to be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">{\u00b6 15} Specifically, Dr. Gillette stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c[Hannold] does not have the ability to comprehend [Debbie\u2019s] medical needs, to be able to discuss [Debbie\u2019s] needs, emotional, physical, medical, with the physician and other medical personnel * * *. The progression of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis is chronic and her health can deteriorate. You cannot really predict what is going to happen in the future, and so she may have great emotional problems in the future. I don\u2019t believe he would be able to handle these. For example, I know she is on a number of medications. His arithmetic is at a first grade level and his spelling is at a first grade level. I don\u2019t know if he really would be able to continually monitor and maintain the correct dosages, the correct timing of her different physical therapies, medical examinations, appointments and physical therapy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">{\u00b6 17} Dr. Gillette also opined that Hannold\u2019s deficiencies are not something that he could improve upon over time. She concluded, \u201cI just didn\u2019t think [Hannold] even understood what was going on with his daughter or the emotional, medical problems that she was facing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">{\u00b6 18} Carrie Colby, one of the caseworkers involved in this case, echoed many of Dr. Gillette\u2019s concerns regarding Hannold\u2019s ability to comprehend Debbie\u2019s medical needs and to participate in his daughter\u2019s physical therapy. Colby testified that she attempted to train Hannold as to what he needed to do to aid Debbie in her physical therapy sessions, which included three basic exercises. However, it became apparent that Hannold was unable or unwilling to learn them correctly. He also failed to understand the importance of performing the required exercises and would allow Debbie to decide whether or not she wanted to do the exercises.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">{\u00b6 19} Additionally, during home visits, it became apparent that Hannold would not always provide proper supervision. He permitted Debbie to play on an unsafe swing set despite being told not to, as well as play with gasoline cans in the yard. He also kept lighter fluid and various medications on the coffee table <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>within reach of Debbie. In short, Hannold appears unable to appreciate the dangers that he exposed his daughter to during home visits.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">{\u00b6 20} The court issued its judgment entry granting appellee\u2019s motion for permanent custody. The court granted the motion pursuant to R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(d). In regard to Hannold, the court found that Debbie had been in the temporary custody of appellee for more than 12 of the past 22 months. The trial court determined that it was in the best interest of Debbie to grant appellee\u2019s motion for permanent custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">{\u00b6 21} Hannold has timely appealed the judgment of the trial court. He raises seven assignments of error on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-7\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c[1.] The trial court erred in disregarding a parent\u2019s fundamental right to raise his child, in violation of the Due Process and Equal Protection Provisions of the Ohio Constitution and the United States Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-8\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c[2.] The trial court abused its discretion, pursuant to O.R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(d), by terminating parental rights without a finding of parental unfitness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-9\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c[3.] The trial court erred in concluding that Ashtabula County Children Services Board made reasonable efforts to reunify father with his child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-10\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c[4.] The trial court erred in failing to conclude that Alfred E. Hannold, Jr. substantially remedied the conditions which caused the removal of the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-11\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c[5.] The trial court erred by denying the father\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-12\">{\u00b6 27} \u201c[6.] O.R.C. 2151.414, facially and as applied, violates the Substantive Due Process, Equal Protection and Procedural Due Process guarantees of the Ohio Constitution and the United States Constitution by failing to [recognize] or protect a parent\u2019s fundamental right to raise his own child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-13\">{\u00b6 28} \u201c[7.] The trial court erred in admitting into the record Dr. Gillette\u2019s opinions and conclusions regarding the adequacy of Alfred E. Hannold Jr.\u2019s parenting ability.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-14\">{\u00b6 29} We will address these assigned errors out of order.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-15\">{\u00b6 30} In his sixth assignment of error, Hannold challenges the constitutionality of R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(d). He asserts that this provision allows for the termination of parental rights without requiring a showing of parental unfitness. He also claims that the time limit provision of R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(d) is overbroad and arbitrary. However, Hannold did not challenge the constitutionality of this statute at the trial court level; thus, he has waived subsequent challenges on appeal. <em>State v. Awan </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 120, 22 OBR 199, 489 N.E.2d 277, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>syllabus. While this court has recognized that a waiver does not prohibit an appellate court from considering a constitutional challenge to a statute, <em>State v. Schlee </em>(Dec. 17, 1999), 11th Dist. No. 98-L-187, 1999 WL 1313651, citing <em>In re M. D. </em>(1988) 38 Ohio St.3d 149, 527 N.E.2d 286, syllabus, we choose not to do so in the instant cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">{\u00b6 31} In his fifth assignment of error, Hannold claims that the trial court erred by overruling his motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">{\u00b6 32} Pursuant to Civ.R. 56(C), summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 293, 662 N. E.2d 264. In addition, it must appear from the evidence or stipulations that reasonable minds can come to only one conclusion, which is adverse to the nonmoving party. Civ.R. 56(C). The standard of review for the granting of a motion for summary judgment is de novo. <em>Grafton v. Ohio Edison Co. </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 102, 105, 671 N.E.2d 241.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">{\u00b6 33} R.C. 2151.414 pertains to permanent custody hearings and states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-10\">{\u00b6 34} \u201c(B)(1) Except as provided in division (B)(2) of this section, the court may grant permanent custody of a child to a movant if the court determines at the hearing held pursuant to division (A) of this section, by clear and convincing evidence, that it is in the best interest of the child to grant permanent custody of the child to the agency that filed the motion for permanent custody and that any of the following apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-11\">{\u00b6 35} \u201c(a) The child is not abandoned or orphaned or has not been in the temporary custody of one or more public children services agencies or private child placing agencies for twelve or more months of a consecutive twenty-two month period ending on or after March 18, 1999, and the child cannot be placed with either of the child\u2019s parents within a reasonable time or should not be placed with the child\u2019s parents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-12\">{\u00b6 36} \u201c(b) The child is abandoned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-13\">{\u00b6 37} \u201c(c) The child is orphaned, and there are no relatives of the child who are able to take permanent custody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-14\">{\u00b6 38} \u201c(d) The child has been in the temporary custody of one or more public children services agencies or private child placing agencies for twelve or more months of a consecutive twenty-two month period ending on or after March 18, 1999.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-15\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cFor the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, a child shall be considered to have entered the temporary custody of an agency on the earlier of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>the date the child is adjudicated pursuant to section 2151.28 of the Revised Code or the date that is sixty days after the removal of the child from home.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">{\u00b6 40} R.C. 2151.414(D) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cIn determining the best interest of a child * * * the court shall consider all relevant factors, including, but not limited to, the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-7\">{\u00b6 42} \u201c(1) The interaction and interrelationship of the child with the child\u2019s parents, siblings, relatives, foster caregivers and out-of-home providers, and any other person who may significantly affect the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-8\">{\u00b6 43} \u201c(2) The wishes of the child, as expressed directly by the child or through the child\u2019s guardian ad litem, with due regard to the maturity of the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-9\">(\u00b6 44} \u201c(3) The custodial history of the child, including whether the child has been in the temporary custody of one or more public children services agencies or private child placing agencies for twelve or more months of a consecutive twenty-two month period ending on or after March 18, 1999;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-10\">{\u00b6 45} \u201c(4) The child\u2019s need for a legally secure permanent placement and whether that type of placement can be achieved without a grant of permanent custody to the agency;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-11\">{\u00b6 46} \u201c(5) Whether any of the factors in divisions (E)(7) to (11) of this section apply in relation to the parents and child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-12\">{\u00b6 47} Hannold argued that the agency\u2019s motion for permanent custody must fail as a matter of law. However, based on the above standard of R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(d), which the court used in this case, there were genuine issues of material fact to be resolved. The agency submitted an affidavit from caseworker Carrie Colby, who stated that Debbie had been in the temporary custody of appellee for 22 of the past 22 months. Therefore, the court was required to look to the best interest analysis of R.C. 2151.414(D). Reviewing the totality of the circumstances of this case, including Debbie\u2019s medical conditions, we cannot say that reasonable minds could come to only one conclusion, that being a grant of permanent custody to appellee was not in Debbie\u2019s best interest. In fact, the trial court ultimately reached the opposite conclusion. Thus, the trial court did not err by overruling Hannold\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-13\">(\u00b6 48} Hannold\u2019s fifth assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-14\">{\u00b6 49} In his first, second, and fourth assignments of error, Hannold asserts that the trial court failed to make certain findings prior to terminating his parental rights. Specifically, Hannold argues that the trial court never made an express finding that he was unfit as a parent. He further argues that a finding that R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(d) has been met only creates a presumption of unfitness, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>which the parent is then permitted to rebut. He contends that he, in fact, rebutted that presumption. Finally, he asserts that the trial court erred by not mentioning that a parent has a constitutional right to raise his own child.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">{\u00b6 50} The statute in question does not require that the trial court make any of these findings. There is no requirement that a parent be expressly declared unfit, nor is there any requirement that a trial court acknowledge that a parent has a constitutional right to raise his own child.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">{\u00b6 51} The trial court in the present case proceeded under R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(d). Under this section, the trial court needed to find only that Debbie had been in the temporary custody of appellee for 12 or more months of a consecutive 22 month period ending on or after March 18, 1999. Once that finding was made, the trial court properly continued to the second question, whether an award of permanent custody to appellee was in Debbie\u2019s best interests. It was unnecessary to reach any other findings regarding the unfitness of her parents. <em>In re Cather, </em>11th Dist. Nos. 2002-P-0014, 2002-P-0015, and 2002-P-0016, 2002-0hio-4519, 2002 WL 2022964 \u00b6 42-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">{\u00b6 52} Accordingly, the trial court did not have an obligation to expressly determine that Hannold was an unfit parent. This issue was addressed by the Fourth District Court of Appeals in <em>In re Workman, </em>4th Dist. No. 02CA574, 2003-Ohio-2220, 2003 WL 2012574. There, the court opined that while \u201c[a] parent has a \u2018fundamental liberty interest\u2019 in the care, custody, and management of his or her child and an \u2018essential\u2019 and \u2018basic civil right\u2019 to raise his or her children,\u201d the parent\u2019s rights are not absolute and \u201c \u2018are always subject to the ultimate welfare of the child, which is the polestar or controlling principle to be observed.\u2019 \u201d Id. at \u00b6 36, quoting <em>In re Cunningham </em>(1979), 59 Ohio St.2d 100, 106, 13 O.O.3d 78, 391 N.E.2d 1034.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">{\u00b6 53} The <em>Workman </em>court concluded that R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(d) protected the parents\u2019 rights based upon the following logic:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-9\">{\u00b6 54} \u201c[WJe believe that inherent within R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(d) rests the finding that the parent is unable, unsuitable, or unfit to care for the child. If the child has been placed in a children services agency\u2019s temporary custody for at least twelve months of the prior twenty-two months, some reason must exist why the child has not been in the parent\u2019s care. The reason normally would be because the parent has been unable to demonstrate that the parent is able, suitable, or fit to care for the child. Cf. <em>Troxel [v. Granville </em>(2000) ], 530 U.S. [57] at 68-69 [120 S.Ct. 2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49]. (\u2018Accordingly, so long as a parent adequately cares for his or her children (i.e., is fit), there will normally be no reason for the State to inject itself into the private realm of the family to further question the ability of that parent to make the best decisions concerning the rearing of that parent\u2019s children.\u2019). R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(d) thus contains an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>implicit presumption that the parent'is unable, unsuitable, or unfit to care for the child. In enacting R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(d), it appears that the Ohio General Assembly intended to provide a presumption that a parent who is unable to be reunified with the child within a twelve-month period is necessarily unable, unsuitable, or unfit to care for the child. See <em>In re Fricke, </em>Allen App. Nos. 1-02-75, 1-02-76, and 1-02-77, 2003-Ohio-1116, 2003 WL 952173. (\u2018Once the children have been in custody for 12 of the previous 22 months, the parents are presumed to be unfit and all the trial court must find is that granting permanent custody is in the best interests of the children.\u2019).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-5\">{\u00b6 55} \u201cWe do not believe that R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(d) deprives a parent of fundamentally fair procedures. Prior to instituting a permanent custody proceeding under R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(d), the parent has twelve months to demonstrate that the parent is able, suitable, or fit to care for the child. Thus, the parent is not deprived of the ability to be reunified with the child or to demonstrate the parent\u2019s ability, suitability, or fitness to care for the child.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 39, 40.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">{\u00b6 56} We agree with the analysis set forth in the <em>Workman </em>decision. The fact that a children services agency has had temporary custody of a child for at least 12 months of the prior 22 months is a definite indication that a parent is unable, unsuitable, or unfit to adequately care for the child. That is precisely what happened in the case sub judice. Debbie had been in the temporary custody of appellee for the previous 28 months at the time of the hearing. Hannold established his paternity, and was involved with the case, 16 months prior to the hearing. Hannold had ample opportunity to demonstrate his parenting abilities. However, the evidence presented supports a conclusion that Hannold, despite his best efforts to comply with the case plan, was simply not capable of providing the type of parenting that was required by this \u201cspecial needs\u201d child. That is what makes this decision so difficult.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">{\u00b6 57} Based upon the foregoing analysis, Hannold\u2019s first, second, and fourth assignments of error are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">{\u00b6 58} In the third assignment of error, appellant contends that the trial court erred by concluding that appellee made reasonable efforts to reunify Debbie with her father. While appellant is correct in his assertion that the trial court made this finding, the fact is that no such finding is required under the statute. When considering a motion for permanent custody brought pursuant to R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(d), other than the 12-month time requirement, the only other consideration that the trial court needs to address is the best interest of the child. Accordingly, whether or not the trial court was correct in concluding that reasonable efforts were made to reunify the child with her father is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>{\u00b6 59} Hannold\u2019s third assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">{\u00b6 60} In the seventh assignment of error, appellant maintains that the trial court erred by permitting the testimony of Dr. Gillette regarding the adequacy of his parenting because Dr. Gillette relied heavily on hearsay reports provided to her by appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">{\u00b6 61} Evid.R. 703 provides, \u201cThe facts or data in the particular case upon which an expert bases an opinion or inference may be those perceived by him or admitted into evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">{\u00b6 62} Evid.R. 801(C) provides, \u201c \u2018Hearsay\u2019 is a statement other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">{\u00b6 63} It is appellant\u2019s contention that, over his attorney\u2019s objection, Dr. Gillette was permitted to testify to information she obtained from reports prepared by appellee. Thus, appellant argues that this information constitutes hearsay and was, therefore, inadmissible pursuant to this court\u2019s holding in <em>In re Walker, </em>11th Dist. No. 2002-A-0089, 2003-Ohio-799, 2003 WL 474124.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">{\u00b6 64} To begin with, appellant has failed to support his claim that objections were made with citations to the record. It appears to this court that, in fact, there were no objections made to the testimony in question. Accordingly, appellant has waived this issue and cannot raise it for the first time on appeal. <em>State ex rel. Zollner v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 276, 278, 611 N.E.2d 830.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">{\u00b6 65} Moreover, even if this argument had been properly preserved, it is clear that it must fail. It is well established that, \u201cwhen an expert\u2019s opinion is based, in whole or in major part, on facts or data perceived by him, then the requirements of Evid.R. 703 are satisfied.\u201d <em>Ryser v. Conrad </em>(Dec. 7, 2001), 11th Dist. No. 2001-T-0034, 2001 WL 1561795, citing <em>State v. Solomon </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 124, 570 N.E.2d 1118, syllabus; <em>Farkas v. Detar </em>(1998), 126 Ohio App.3d 795, 798, 711 N.E.2d 703.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-11\">{\u00b6 66} In the <em>Walker </em>case, it is apparent that the expert witness relied heavily on the reports of other doctors, social workers, law enforcement agencies, and the children services agency, to form her opinion on whether permanent custody should be granted. That report was admitted into evidence. In contrast, in the present case, Dr. Gillette relied, in major part, on her own observations that resulted from interviewing appellant, Debbie, Debbie\u2019s foster parents, and the physical therapist, and her own test results. Dr. Gillette testified that while she read the reports that resulted from two previous psychological examinations of appellant, she found them to be \u201cnot helpful\u201d as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>some of the tests had been improperly administered. Additionally, Dr. Gillette\u2019s report, itself, was never admitted into evidence in this case. Thus, this case is clearly distinguishable from the <em>Walker </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">{\u00b6 67} Accordingly, appellant\u2019s seventh assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">{\u00b6 68} The judgment of the Ashtabula Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b374-8\">Donald R.

Cases terminating parental rights present an extremely difficult balancing of parents\u2019 fundamental liberty interest to raise their child and the state\u2019s important interest in ensuring the safety and well-being of its children. Although Hannold did not challenge the constitutionality of this statute at the trial court level, I believe this is an appropriate instance to exercise the discretion to consider this important constitutional challenge to a statute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Further, I agree with appellant that R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(d), facially and as applied, is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-13\">{\u00b6 71} The Supreme Court of Ohio has recognized the importance of parents\u2019 rights to raise their children. \u201c \u2018Permanent termination of parental rights has been described as \u201cthe family law equivalent of the death penalty in a criminal case.\u201d * * * Therefore, parents \u201cmust be afforded every procedural and substantive protection the law allows.\u201d \u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-14\">{\u00b6 72} Moreover, both the Supreme Court of Ohio and the United States Supreme Court have recognized parental rights as fundamental liberty interests. This is apparent in the following language:</p>\n<p id=\"b374-15\">{\u00b6 73} \u201c \u2018The fundamental liberty interest of natural parents in the care, custody, and management of their child does not evaporate simply because they have not been model parents or have lost temporary custody of their child to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>State. Even when blood relationships are strained, parents retain a vital interest in preventing the irretrievable destruction of their family life. If anything, persons faced with forced dissolution of their parental rights have a more critical need for procedural protections than do those resisting state intervention into ongoing family affairs. When the State moves to destroy weakened familial bonds, it must provide the parents with fundamentally fair procedures.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">{\u00b6 74} Finally, the United States Supreme Court has \u201crecognized the fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">{\u00b6 75} Because a fundamental constitutional right is at issue, the constitutionality of R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(d) must be reviewed using a strict-scrutiny analysis.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, the statute must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">{\u00b6 76} The state\u2019s interest in protecting its children from abuse and neglect is compelling. However, R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(d) is not narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. This is because it does not require the children services agency to prove, or the trial court to find, that the natural parents are unfit or unsuitable to raise their children.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">{\u00b6 77} The Supreme Court of Ohio has acknowledged that a finding of parental unsuitability is necessary in a custody dispute between a natural parent and a nonparent.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> While the <em>Hockstok </em>case involved a dispute between a parent and a grandparent and was decided pursuant to R.C. 3109.04, there is no reason why this requirement should not apply to custody disputes adjudicated under R.C. 2151.414. Specifically, the Supreme Court of Ohio held that \u201c \u2018the general rule in Ohio regarding original custody awards in disputes between a parent and a non-parent is that \u201cparents who are \u2018suitable\u2019 persons have a \u2018paramount\u2019 right to the custody of their minor children unless they forfeit that right by contract, abandonment, or by becoming totally unable to care for and support those children.\u201d \u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>{\u00b6 78} Pursuant to R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(d), once a trial court finds that a child has been in the temporary custody of a children service agency for 12 months of a 22 month period, it may proceed to the best interest determination set forth in R.C. 2151.414(D). The time limit of 2151.414(B)(1)(d) is entirely arbitrary, as it does not require the court to consider (1) why the child was initially placed in temporary custody, (2) why the child has remained in temporary custody for more than a year, including any delays caused by the agency or other persons involved in the case, (3) improvements the parent has made to achieve reunification, or, ultimately, (4) the parents\u2019 ability to raise their child. Rather, all the evidence the children services agency needs to present to meet this criterion is the date of temporary placement and a calendar.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">{\u00b6 79} Cases involving the termination of parental rights are often very complex. There are many competing interests involved. The child, caseworkers, natural parent(s), foster parent(s), psychologists, doctors, attorneys, and others involved must complete a variety of tasks before there is a final permanent custody hearing. However, as all the various tasks and reports are being completed, the \u201cstatute of limitations\u201d is running against the natural parents. Should 12 months pass, the children services agency is halfway home on the battle for permanent custody. R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(d) has already been met. The only hurdle left is to show that the grant of permanent custody is in the child\u2019s best interest.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">{\u00b6 80} In addition, the children services agency files the motion for permanent custody. The natural parents have no control over the timeliness of the filing of the motion. The current statutory framework entices the agency to wait to file the motion for permanent custody until the child has been in their custody for twelve months. Why would an agency file a motion for permanent custody early, when it could wait to file until after 12 months have passed, and go right to the best interest phase?</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">{\u00b6 81} Simply stated, R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(d) does not protect natural parents\u2019 fundamental rights concerning the care, custody and control of their children.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">{\u00b6 82} Moreover, the best interest analysis of R.C. 2151.414(D) does not force the trial court to find that a parent is unfit or unsuitable to raise their child.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">{\u00b6 83} Not only is the arbitrary time requirement being used against a parent once pursuant to R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(d), the same time requirement is a specific factor to be used when considering the best interest of the child.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Accordingly, if the child has been in the temporary custody of a children services agency more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>than 12 months, there are two strikes against the parent, <em>regardless of the underlying circumstances that caused the placement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">{\u00b6 84} In addition to the time requirement, other factors of the best interest analysis consider the child\u2019s relationship with its foster parents and current placement situation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This is entirely unfair to the natural parents. Foster parents, presumably, will always be \u201cfit,\u201d as they must have met certain screening criteria to become foster parents. Moreover, if the child has been in the custody of the agency for more than a year, it is likely the child has been in the home of the foster parents for that time. In most every case, the child, especially a young child, is going to have a stronger bond to the foster parents, who interact with them on a daily basis, than to the natural parents, whom they see only for minimal times during structured visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">{\u00b6 85} Pursuant to the current version of R.C. 2151.414, after finding that the child has been in the temporary custody of a children service agency for 12 out of the past 22 months, the trial court proceeds to the best interest factors of R.C. 2151.414(D). Accordingly, the court is not required to find any level of unfitness or inability on behalf of the natural parent. Presumably, all the court would need to find is that the child would be better off if permanent custody was granted to the children service agency, so the child could be adopted by the \u201cbetter\u201d foster parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">{\u00b6 86} Moreover, the \u201cbest-interest\u201d analysis of R.C. 2151.414(D), suggests a presumption in favor of granting a motion for permanent custody. Specifically, R.C. 2151.414(D)(4) asks the court to consider whether the child\u2019s need for legally secure placement \u201ccan be achieved <em>without </em>a grant of permanent custody to the agency.\u201d (Emphasis added.) How does this language ensure natural parents their \u201cparamount\u201d right to the custody of their children?</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">{\u00b6 87} Appellee argues that R.C. 2151.414 does provide adequate procedural safeguards for parents. Appellee cites <em>In re Thompson, </em>where the Tenth Appellate District held that the legislature has ensured constitutional safeguards by providing for \u201cadequate notice, assistance of counsel, and (under most circumstances) the right to be present\u201d at these proceedings.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> However, these important safeguards do not address my paramount concern, which is R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(d) does not require a finding of wrongdoing, unfitness, or unsuitability. Remembering that these cases are the family law equivalent of the death penalty, adopting appellee\u2019s position would be analogous to a criminal defendant being provided with the right to counsel, the right to confront witnesses, etc, but, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>instead of requiring he be found guilty of the crime, only requiring the state to show it is in the public\u2019s best interest to send this individual to prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">{\u00b6 88} The majority cites the Fourth District\u2019s holding in <em>In re Workman, </em>for the inference that R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(d) carries a presumption of unfitness.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Essentially, this \u201cpresumption\u201d is \u201cif the parent were fit, the child would not be in the state\u2019s custody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">{\u00b6 89} I disagree with the above analysis, as it raises several constitutional concerns. The initial problem with the \u201cpresumption\u201d reasoning, is that it is factually incorrect. Children can be placed in the temporary custody of a children services agency for a variety of reasons. Such placement is not, per se, indicative of improper acts on behalf of the parent. For instance, in the case sub judice, the uncontested evidence presented by appellee was that Hannold was not responsible for the child\u2019s temporary placement with appellee. The evidence clearly established that the reason for the child\u2019s placement was the neglect of the child\u2019s mother. Hannold did not live with the child\u2019s mother and had no means of controlling her actions. How can there be a presumption that he is unfit to care for his daughter?</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">{\u00b6 90} The second concern is that the children services agency is determining that the parent continues to be \u201cunfit\u201d while the child is in its custody. Permitting a determination of unfitness to be made by a caseworker, rather than a court of law, is fundamentally unfair. Allowing an order of temporary custody (even if a parent was not involved in the temporary custody hearing) and subsequent continuing placement with children services, to be a presumption of \u201cunfitness\u201d is a violation of a parent\u2019s constitutional rights, as they are being deemed an \u201cunfit\u201d parent, without the constitutional safeguards designed to protect them from untrue allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">{\u00b6 91} By the time paternity was legally established and Hannold was involved in the case, nearly a year had passed since the child had been removed from her mother the second time. While there were several factors that contributed to this delay, the children services agency benefited, as the time limitations were running for the duration of this process. At the time of the permanent custody hearing, the child had been in the temporary custody of appellee in excess of twelve months. The only question before the court was \u201cwas it in the best interest of the child to grant appellee\u2019s motion for permanent custody.\u201d The court was permitted to consider the child\u2019s relationship with her foster parents as a factor for terminating Hannold\u2019s parental rights. The trial court was not required to find that Hannold was unfit or unsuited to raise his child. Hannold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>was entitled to a higher burden of proof before his fundamental constitutional right was terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">{\u00b6 92} R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(d) permits a court to terminate parents\u2019 rights to raise their children without finding that the child should not, or could not, be placed in the parents\u2019 home. Rather, the court is merely required to consider whether it is in the \u201cbest interest\u201d of the child for permanent custody to be given to the children service agency. Thus, an individual\u2019s fundamental right to raise their child may be extinguished by the court finding that the child will be better off with her foster parents. This proposition is in direct conflict with the constitutional safeguards that have been continuously reiterated by the Supreme Court of Ohio and the United States Supreme Court.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">{\u00b6 93} I recognize the legislature\u2019s intent to shift emphasis to the well being of the child. However, R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(d) is not narrowly tailored to accomplish the state\u2019s interest, because it allows for parents\u2019 fundamental rights to raise their children to be terminated without any finding of wrongdoing or unsuitability-</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b374-16\">.
