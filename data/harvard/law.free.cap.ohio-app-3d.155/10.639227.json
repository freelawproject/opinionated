Sweeney, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b41-13\">{\u00b6 1} This appeal is before the court on the accelerated docket pursuant to App.R. 11.1 and LocApp.R. 11.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-14\">{\u00b6 2} Plaintiff-appellant, Charles Tolliver Jr., appeals from the trial court\u2019s judgment that dismissed his claim for legal malpractice as untimely. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-15\">{\u00b6 3} A Cuyahoga County Grand Jury indicted plaintiff in May 2000 for conspiracy to commit aggravated murder and aggravated murder. Due to plaintiffs indigence, the court appointed two attorneys, one being defendant-appellee, James J. McDonnell, to represent him. In October 2000, a jury acquitted plaintiff of aggravated murder but found him guilty of conspiracy to commit aggravated murder. The court sentenced plaintiff to serve a term of incarceration. In October 2000, defendant moved to withdraw as plaintiffs appellate counsel, and the court granted the motion. The court then appointed plaintiff new counsel for purposes of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-16\">{\u00b6 4} In correspondence dated November 27, 2000, plaintiff instructed his newly appointed appellate counsel to assert a claim of ineffective assistance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>counsel for failing to assert a statute-of-limitations defense on the charge of conspiracy to commit aggravated murder. That attorney raised this issue on plaintiffs behalf in the appeal filed in the criminal action on December 22, 2000. This court sustained that assignment of error, and ultimately the trial court discharged plaintiff on February 25, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">{\u00b6 5} On March 14, 2002, plaintiff commenced this action, asserting legal malpractice against defendant related to the representation rendered in the criminal action. The trial court granted defendant\u2019s summary judgment motion and dismissed plaintiffs legal-malpractice claim as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">{\u00b6 6} The sole issue plaintiff posits is \u201cwhether the statute of limitations associated with [plaintiffs] malpractice against [defendant] was effectively tolled until this court rendered its opinion in the [appeal of the criminal action].\u201d We hold that it was not so tolled.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">{\u00b6 7} We employ a de novo review in determining whether summary judgment was warranted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Grafton v. Ohio Edison Co. </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 102, 105, 671 N.E.2d 241; <em>Zemcik v. La Pine Truck Sales &amp; Equip. </em>(1998), 124 Ohio App.3d 581, 585, 706 N.E.2d 860.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cThe party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of showing that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 292-293, 662 N.E.2d 264, 273-274.\u201d <em>Zivich v. Mentor Soccer Club </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 367, 370, 696 N.E.2d 201. Once the moving party satisfies its burden, the nonmoving party \u201cmay not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of the party\u2019s pleadings, but the party\u2019s response, by affidavit or as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d Civ.R. 56(E); <em>Mootispaw v. Eckstein </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 383, 385, 667 N.E.2d 1197.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">{\u00b6 9} Generally, R.C. 2305.11(A) provides that \u201c[a]n action for * * * malpractice other than an action upon a medical, dental, optometric, or chiropractic claim, or an action upon a statute for a penalty or forfeiture shall be commenced within one year after the cause of action accrued * * However, the Ohio Supreme Court has held that \u201c[u]nder R.C. 2305.11(A), an action for legal malpractice accrues and the statute of limitations begins to run when there is a cognizable event whereby the client discovers or should have discovered that his injury was related to his attorney\u2019s act or non-act and the client is put on notice of a need to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>pursue his possible remedies against the attorney or when the attorney-client relationship for that particular transaction or undertaking terminates, whichever occurs later.\u201d <em>Zimmie v. Calfee, Halter &amp; Griswold </em>(1989), 43 Ohio St.3d 54, 538 N.E.2d 398, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cTo state a cause of action for legal malpractice arising from criminal representation, a plaintiff must allege (1) an attorney-client relationship giving rise to a duty, (2) a breach of that duty, and (3) damages proximately caused by the breach.\u201d <em>Krahn v. Kinney </em>(1989), 43 Ohio St.3d 103, 538 N.E.2d 1058, syllabus. In <em>Krahn, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court rejected the notion that a malpractice claim based on representation in a criminal case, required a reversal of the criminal conviction. Id. at 105-106, 538 N.E.2d 1058. Consequently, a plaintiff need only allege that he suffered damages \u201cto withstand an attack on the sufficiency of [his] complaint.\u201d Id. Moreover, the \u201ccognizable event\u201d test does not require that a plaintiff know the full extent of his injury. <em>Zimmie, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cA \u2018cognizable event\u2019 is an event sufficient to alert a reasonable person that in the course of legal representation his attorney committed an improper act.\u201d <em>Case v. Landskroner &amp; Phillips Co., L.P.A. </em>(May 3, 2001), Cuyahoga App. No. 78147, 2001 WL 470169 (finding that a letter from new counsel suggesting that former counsel had committed malpractice was a cognizable event triggering statute of limitations). In <em>Case, </em>this court noted that \u201c[i]n determining the cognizable event, \u2018the focus should be on what the client was aware of and not an extrinsic judicial determination.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>Vagianos v. Halpern </em>(Dec. 14, 2000), Cuyahoga App. No. 76408, 2000 WL 1844752. We find that reasonable minds could only conclude that plaintiff was aware of the alleged malpractice no later than November 27, 2000, when he authored the letter to his appellate counsel. See <em>Zimmie, </em>supra, 43 Ohio St.3d at 58, 538 N.E.2d 398 (cognizable event is one which should have alerted a reasonable person that a questionable legal practice may have occurred); see, also, <em>Halliwell v. Bruner </em>(Dec. 14, 2000), Cuyahoga App. Nos. 76933 and 77487, 2000 WL 1867398.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>{\u00b6 13} Stated differently, the pendency of an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim in a criminal appeal does not divest the trial court of jurisdiction over an independent civil legal-malpractice action based on the alleged ineffective assistance. Id.; see, also, <em>Halliwell, </em>supra (statute of limitations against trial counsel began to run, inter alia, when defendant-appellant asserted ineffective assistance of counsel in the appeal of his criminal case).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">{\u00b6 14} The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b44-7\">Michael J. Corrigan, P.J., and Colleen Conway Cooney, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b42-10\">. Summary judgment is appropriate when (1) there is no genuine issue of material fact, (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the nonmoving party, said party being entitled to have the evidence construed most strongly in his favor. <em>Horton v. Harwich Chem. Corp. </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 679, 653 N.E.2d 1196, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
