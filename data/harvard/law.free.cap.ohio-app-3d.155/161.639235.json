Charvat, appeals from the July 29, 2002 decision and September 18, 2002 judgment granting the motion for summary judgment of defendants-appellees, Alex D. Crawford and Jennifer E. Crawford, d.b.a. AJ Marketing Group, on appellant\u2019s Telephone Consumer Protection Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>claim (\u201cTCPA\u201d). For the reasons that follow, we reverse the grant of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">{\u00b6 2} On April 11, 2001, appellant filed a complaint in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas alleging violations by appellees of the TCPA, Section 227, Title 47, U.S.Code, and violation of federal regulations related to telemarketing and telephone solicitation, Section 64.1200, Title 47, C.F.R., violation of the Ohio Consumer Sales Protection Act, R.C. 1345.01 et seq., violation of state statutes governing telephone solicitors, R.C. 4719.01 et seq., and violation of state regulations relating to deceptive acts or practices in connection with consumer transactions. Ohio Adm.Code 109:4-3-ll(A)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">{\u00b6 3} The TCPA and related regulations prohibit the sending of unsolicited advertisements by a prerecorded voice without obtaining the prior express invitation or permission of the recipient, Section 227(b)(1)(B), Title 47, U.S.Code; Section 64.1200(a)(2)(iii), Title 47, C.F.R. Appellant brought this action as a result of receiving two telephone calls placed to his residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">{\u00b6 4} On February 16, 2001, appellees\u2019 company, using a prerecorded message player, made two telephone calls to appellant\u2019s residence almost simultaneously to his two telephone lines. Appellant recorded both calls on recording equipment he had previously attached to each phone line. He was also able to listen to the calls while they were being recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">{\u00b6 5} The following message is taken from a transcript attached to appellant\u2019s memorandum contra to appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-9\">\u201cResident: \u2018Hello.........\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-10\">\u201cRecorded female voice: \u2018Hello!

(Exhibit F to plaintiff Philip Charvat\u2019s memorandum contra defendants\u2019 Alex D. Crawford et al.\u2019s motion for summary judgment.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-19\">{\u00b6 6} Appellees moved for summary judgment, contending that their prerecorded telephone calls did not violate the TCPA because they did not attempt to sell goods, property, or services. Rather, appellees contended that the calls were intended \u201cto provide the receiver with an opportunity to obtain information if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>receiver so chooses.\u201d (Plaintiffs First Request of Defendants for Admissions, Exhibit D to Plaintiffs Memorandum Contra to Defendants\u2019 Motion for Summary-Judgment.) Appellant disagreed, arguing that the calls were for a commercial purpose and contained unsolicited advertising, as that term is used in the TCPA, Section 227(b)(2)(B), Title 47, U.S.Code, and Section 64.1200(c), Title 47, C.F.R. The trial court, agreeing with an earlier decision of the common pleas court on similar facts, concluded that the calls did not constitute unsolicited advertisements. The trial court granted summary judgment for appellees on the federal claims but denied summary judgment on the state-law claims, as appellees did not address those claims in their motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">{\u00b6 7} By mutual agreement of the parties, appellant dismissed his state claims in order to allow his appeal to go forward. On appeal, appellant has assigned the following as error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-6\">\u201cThe trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of appellees and against appellant when there remained genuine issues of material fact and movants were not otherwise entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-7\">\u201cThe trial court erred by not using the mandatory definition of \u2018unsolicited advertisement\u2019 as defined by the TCPA, but used instead an improper definition that resulted in granting summary judgment in favor of appellees and against appellant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-8\">\u201cThe trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of appellees and against appellant when it improperly concluded that the first call in violation of 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(b)(1)(B) is not actionable, regardless of whether or not a prior do not call demand was issued by the called party to the caller.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">{\u00b6 8} For ease of discussion, appellant\u2019s assignments of error will be discussed as a whole. Appellant first argues that there exist genuine issues of material fact, yet he acknowledges that the sole dispute is whether the telephone calls contained an unsolicited advertisement, as that term is used in the TCPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>{\u00b6 10} We note that in this case, the facts are not in dispute. Rather, it is the conclusions that one draws from those facts that are in dispute. In other words, we are being asked to apply a statute using standard rules of statutory construction and giving due deference to the governmental agency that has created regulations based upon the statute. See <em>Charvat v. Dispatch Consumer Serv., Inc., </em>95 Ohio St.3d 505, 2002-Ohio-2838, 769 N.E.2d 829, at \u00b6 17 and 38 (court must follow agency commentary unless it is at odds with the regulation it explains).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">{\u00b6 11} Appellant next argues that the trial court applied the wrong definition of \u201cunsolicited advertisement\u201d in deciding to grant summary judgment for appellees. We disagree. The trial court did not explicitly set out the definition of \u201cunsolicited advertisement,\u201d but it did adopt the reasoning of an earlier case that did.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">{\u00b6 12} Turning to the relevant statutes and regulations, we note that the TCPA provides: \u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person within the United States * * * to initiate any telephone call to any residential telephone line using an artificial or prerecorded voice to deliver a message without the prior express consent of the called party, unless the call is initiated for emergency purposes or is exempted by rule or order by the Commission under paragraph (2)(B).\u201d Section 227(b)(1)(B), Title 47, U.S.Code. The statute goes on to provide that the commission has the authority to exempt calls that \u201cdo not include the transmission of any unsolicited advertisement.\u201d Section 227(b)(2)(B)(ii)(II), Title 47, U.S.Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">{\u00b6 13} The Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) regulations provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKq\">\u201c(a) No person or entity may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-8\">\u201c(2) Initiate any telephone call to any residential line using an artificial or prerecorded voice to deliver a message without the prior express consent of the called party, unless the call,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-9\">\u201c(ini) [i]s made for a commercial purpose but does not include or introduce an unsolicited advertisement or constitute a telephone solicitation^]\u201d Section 64.1200(a)(2)(iii), Title 47, C.F.R.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cUnsolicited advertisement\u201d is defined in the regulations as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-11\">\u201cThe term unsolicited advertisement means any material advertising the commercial availability or quality of any property, goods, or services which is transmitted to any person without that person\u2019s prior express invitation or permission.\u201d Section 64.1200(f)(10), Title 47, C.F.R.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-12\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cTelephone solicitation\u201d is defined in the regulations as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>\u201c(f)(9) The term telephone solicitation means the initiation of a telephone call or message for the purpose of encouraging the purchase or rental of, or investment in, property, goods, or services, which is transmitted to any person, but such term does not include a call or message:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-5\">\u201c(i) To any person with that person\u2019s prior express invitation or permission;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aj-dedup-0\">\u201c(ii) To any person with whom the caller has an established business relationship; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-6\">\u201c(in) By or on behalf of a tax-exempt nonprofit organization.\u201d Section 64.1200(f)(9)(i)(ii)(iii), Title 47, C..F.R.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">{\u00b6 16} In <em>Charvat v. Dispatch Consumer Serv., </em>supra, 95 Ohio St.3d 505, 2002-Ohio-2838, 769 N.E.2d 829, the Ohio Supreme Court determined that an agency\u2019s interpretation and commentary regarding its own rules is due even greater deference than the interpretation of a statute made by a rulemaking authority. Id. at \u00b6 23, 37, and 38. To that end, we turn to the Federal Communications Commission Report and Order In the Matter of Rules and Regulations Implementing the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, Report and Order (2003), 18 F.C.C.R. 14014. In that order, the FCC discusses its current rules and revises those rules. Obviously, the revisions are not relevant to this appeal, as they were not effective at the time appellees made their calls. But the portion of the report that discusses the present status of the rules is highly relevant to our application of the current statute and regulations to the disputed facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">{\u00b6 17} The section of the report that is relevant to our discussion is entitled \u201cOffers for Free Goods or Services; Information-Only Messages.\u201d In pertinent part, that section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-9\">\u201cCongress found that \u2018residential telephone subscribers consider automated or prerecorded telephone calls ... to be a nuisance and an invasion of privacy.\u2019 It also found that \u2018[bjanning such automated or prerecorded telephone calls to the home, except when the receiving party consents to receiving the call or when such calls are necessary in an emergency situation affecting the health and safety of the consumer, is the only effective means of protecting telephone consumers from this nuisance and privacy invasion.\u2019 Congress determined that such prerecorded messages cause greater harm to consumers\u2019 privacy than telephone solicitations by live telemarketers. The record reveals that consumers feel powerless to stop prerecorded messages largely because they are often delivered to answering machines and because they do not always provide a means to request placement on a do-not-call list.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-10\">\u201c* * * The TCPA\u2019s definition [of unsolicited advertisement] does not require a sale to be made during the call in order for the message to be considered an advertisement. Offers for free goods or services that are part of an overall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>marketing campaign to sell property, goods, or services constitute \u2018advertising the commercial availability or quality of any property, goods, or services.\u2019 Therefore, the Commission finds that prerecorded messages containing free offers and information about goods and services that are commercially available are prohibited to residential telephone subscribers, if not otherwise exempted:\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-5\">\u00cd\u00c9:\u00a1: # ;[&lt;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-6\">\u201cFn. 477. Therefore, a prerecorded message that contains language describing a new product, a vacation destination, or a company that will be in \u2018your area\u2019 to perform home repairs, and asks the consumer to call a toll-free number to \u2018learn more,\u2019 is an \u2018unsolicited advertisement\u2019 under the TCPA if sent without the called party\u2019s express invitation or permission. * * *\u201d Report and Order at paragraphs 139-140 and fn. 477.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">{\u00b6 18} We find that the FCC regulations and commentary concerning unsolicited advertisements are consistent with the statute. As the Ohio Supreme Court has stated, \u201cThe purpose of the Act is to reduce the nuisance aspect of telemarketing.\u201d <em>Charvat v. Dispatch Consumer Serv., </em>95 Ohio St.3d 505, 2002-Ohio-2838, 769 N.E.2d 829, at \u00b6 44. Thus, we defer to and agree with the position of the FCC on this matter. We agree that the application of the prerecorded message rule should turn, not on the caller\u2019s characterization of the call, but on the purpose of the message. Thus, a prerecorded message that contains free offers and information about services and that asks the consumer to call a toll-free number to learn more is an unsolicited advertisement under the TCPA if sent without the called party\u2019s express invitation or permission. A review of the evidence presented in this case demonstrates that appellees\u2019 telephone calls did all of the above. Therefore, summary judgment for appellees on appellant\u2019s TCPA claim was unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">{\u00b6 19} Appellant\u2019s final argument concerns an alleged determination by the trial court that it improperly concluded that the first call in violation of Section 227(b)(1)(B), Title 47, U.S.Code is not actionable, regardless of whether a prior do-not-call demand was issued by the called party to the caller. We find that the trial court made no such conclusion and, accordingly, the argument is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">{\u00b6 20} Based on the foregoing, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained in part and overruled in part. The assignment of error is overruled with respect to the issue of whether a genuine issue of material fact exists, but sustained with respect to the contention that appellees were not entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Appellant\u2019s second and third assignments of error are overruled, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas is reversed and remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b198-6\">Watson, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b198-7\">Sadler, J., concurs in part and dissents in part.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b198-8\">Sadler, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A6W\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">{\u00b6 21} I am unable to completely agree with the majority\u2019s disposition of the first assignment of error. However, I concur in the majority\u2019s disposition of the second and third assignments of error and in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">{\u00b6 22} The majority overrules the part of appellant\u2019s first assignment of error wherein appellant contends that genuine issues of material fact exist on the current state of the record. I believe that appellant is correct and would thus sustain this portion of his first assignment of error. It appears that the majority regards the issues presented by appellant\u2019s first assignment of error as purely legal in nature. In \u00b6 8 of the majority opinion it states, \u201c[T]he sole dispute is whether the telephone calls contained an unsolicited advertisement, as that term is used in the TCPA.\u201d I agree. However, I view this issue as one of mixed questions of fact and law.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">{\u00b6 23} I agree that we are obliged to apply the language of the TCPA itself, the FCC regulations concerning the definitions of \u201cunsolicited advertisement\u201d and \u201ctelephone solicitation,\u201d and the FCC\u2019s July 3, 2003 Report and Order. I also believe that the text of the prerecorded messages transmitted to appellant through his telephone is central to the inquiry whether these messages are violative of the TCPA and the FCC regulations promulgated thereunder. However, I believe that the FCC\u2019s Report and Order mandates that the inquiry include examination of facts other than merely the text of the messages.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-12\">{\u00b6 24} The Report and Order states, in part, that \u201c[ojffers for free goods and services <em>that are part of an overall marketing campaign to sell property, goods or services </em>constitute \u2018advertising the commercial availability or quality of any property, goods or services\u2019 [as that phrase is used in the FCC\u2019s definition of \u2018unsolicited advertisement\u2019].\u201d 18 F.C.C.R. 14014, at \u00b6 140. (Emphasis added.) Thus, in reviewing the judgment below, we must assess whether there are genuine issues of fact with respect to whether appellees\u2019 prerecorded messages, which clearly contain an offer of free information about a business opportunity, are part of an overall marketing campaign to sell property, goods, or services. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>This cannot be assessed without resort to evidence other than the text of the prerecorded messages.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">{\u00b6 25} Accordingly, I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s blanket statement in \u00b6 18 that \u201ca prerecorded message that contains free offers and information about services and that asks the consumer to call a toll-free number to learn more is an unsolicited advertisement under the TCPA if sent without the called party\u2019s express invitation or permission.\u201d According to the FCC Report and Order, in order to be considered an \u201cunsolicited advertisement,\u201d the message must be part of an overall marketing campaign to sell something; in many instances, including the case at bar, the text of the call alone will not reveal whether the call is part of an overall marketing campaign, nor will it reveal the character of the overall marketing campaign of which the call may, in fact, be a part.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">{\u00b6 26} Appellant recognized this and dutifully met his reciprocal burden, pursuant to Civ.R. 56(E), to set forth specific facts showing that there are genuine issues for trial. First, appellant attached to his memorandum contra a copy of appellees\u2019 responses to appellant\u2019s first request for admissions. In their response to request number 27, appellees admit that \u201c[p]art of the Defendants\u2019 business income flows from the sales or profits of persons they have trained to engage in business activities similar to those of the Defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">{\u00b6 27} Appellant also attached to his memorandum contra a copy of appellees\u2019 answers to appellant\u2019s first set of interrogatories. Interrogatory No. 12 states, \u201c[BJriefly state the nature of Defendants\u2019 business.\u201d The response is \u201cHealth and Nutrition Distribution.\u201d Interrogatory No. 13 states, \u201cIdentify fully all goods and services that generate income for the Defendants.\u201d The response is \u201cHealth and Nutrition Products.\u201d Interrogatory No. 14 states, \u201cIdentify fully all methods by which Defendants generate business income, such as, but not limited to, sales, leasing, training, recruiting of new members, and consulting.\u201d The response is \u201cSales.\u201d This evidence is sufficient to create a genuine issue of fact with respect to whether appellees\u2019 prerecorded messages transmitted to appellant were part of an overall marketing campaign to sell property, goods, or services (i.e., health and nutrition products). Accordingly, summary judgment for appel-lees was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">{\u00b6 28} On the current state of the record, I cannot agree with the majority that there are no genuine issues of material fact, and thus would sustain the first assignment of error in its entirety. Given that the majority holds that there are no genuine issues of material fact, which would seem to preclude a trial, it is unclear to me what, practically, the trial court is being instructed to do, since appellant did not move the trial court for judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">{\u00b6 29} I also feel compelled to address another central argument in appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment, that is, that appellees obtained \u201cprior express <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>invitation or permission,\u201d as that phrase is used in the FCC\u2019s definition of \u201cunsolicited advertisement,\u201d by the use of the first part of the call, wherein the called party is given the choice of pressing 1 \u201cto receive free information\u201d or pressing 2 \u201cto hang up.\u201d The trial court agreed, finding that appellant essentially gave appellees permission to transmit their advertisement by pressing 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">{\u00b6 30} The FCC Report and Order relied upon by the majority is dispositive of this issue. In \u00b6 142 thereof, the FCC comments that \u201c[pjurporting to obtain consent during the call, such as requesting that a consumer \u2018press 1\u2019 to receive further information, does not constitute the prior consent necessary to deliver the message in the first place, as the request to \u2018press 1\u2019 is part of the telemarketing call.\u201d In accordance with <em>Charvat v. Dispatch Consumer Serv., Inc., </em>95 Ohio St.3d 505, 2002-Ohio-2838, 769 N.E.2d 829, we are compelled to follow this commentary so long as it is not at odds with Section 64.1200(0(10), Title 47, C.F.R. Although the trial court did not have the benefit of the FCC\u2019s guidance on this issue, the commentary does defeat appellees\u2019 argument that they obtained the requisite consent for the advertisement transmitted when appellant pressed 1 on his telephone keypad.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">{\u00b6 31} As discussed above, however, believing that genuine issues of material fact are present as to the existence and character of the overall marketing campaign of which appellees\u2019 calls to appellant may be a part, I would sustain the first assignment of error in its entirety.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
