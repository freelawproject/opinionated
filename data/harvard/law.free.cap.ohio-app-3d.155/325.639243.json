Whitacre Jr., appeal from a Carroll County Common Pleas Court decision granting an injunction prohibiting them from hunting fox on a certain parcel of land because of an easement in favor of plaintiffs-appellees, Robert L. Hunker and the Gully Ridge Hounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">{\u00b6 2} In 1994, Hunker formed a hunting club known as the Gully Ridge Hounds. On May 18, 1995, appellants granted Hunker permission to hunt on 2,000 acres of their land in Carroll County. Appellants, as grantors, and Hunker, as grantee, entered into a recreational easement agreement relating to the 2,000 acres of land. The agreement states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-11\">{\u00b6 3} \u201c(1) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, Grantors grant to Grantee, and the Gully Ridge Hounds (\u2018the Riding Club\u2019), and their respective heirs, successors, assigns, invitees, and permittees, the nonexclusive right, privilege, and permission (\u2018the Easement\u2019), to enter upon and use the real property of Grantors, which is described in Exhibit \u2018A\u2019 and Exhibit \u2018B\u2019 attached to this Agreement (\u2018the Premises\u2019), for the sole purpose of horseback riding, fox hunting with horses and hounds, and hill topping with horses and horse-drawn vehicles and four-wheel vehicles (or motor vehicles). Grantee shall not use the Premises for purposes other than those specified above.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-12\">{\u00b6 4} Appellees thereafter engaged in fox hunting activities on the property from 1995 to the present. Whitacre was a member of the Gully Ridge Hounds until early 2002. In late December 2001, Hunker advised the hunt club that he would no longer be able to underwrite the fox hunting activities and therefore someone else would have to finance the activities. In response to this announcement, the group divided. Part of the group formed the Magnolia-Waynesburg Hunt, which Whitacre joined. The rest of the group formed another hunt club under the name of the Gully Ridge Hounds, which Hunker joined. The new Gully Ridge Hounds attempted to conduct fox hunting activities on the 2,000 acres of land covered by the agreement, thus precipitating the filing of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>{\u00b6 5} Appellees filed a complaint on September 20, 2002, seeking injunctive and declaratory relief regarding the recreational easement to use appellants\u2019 property for fox hunting. They also sought a preliminary injunction restraining appellants from interfering with their rights under the agreement. Appellants filed a joint answer and counterclaim seeking similar injunctive and declaratory relief and also sought a preliminary injunction. The court granted appellees\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, which excluded appellants from using the property for fox hunting during the pendency of the case. Trial was held on December 27, 2002, and the trial court granted a permanent injunction in favor of appellees on December 30, 2002. Appellants filed their timely notice of appeal on January 23, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">{\u00b6 6} Appellants raise two assignments of error, the first of which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-5\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cThe trial court erred in determining that a contract provision granting \u2018the non-exclusive right * * * to use * * * property * * * for * * * fox hunting\u2019 was ambiguous.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">{\u00b6 8} Appellants assert that the question before this court is: What is the ordinary and commonly understood meaning of the agreement language providing \u201cthe non-exclusive right * * * to use * * * property * * * for * * * fox hunting.\u201d Appellants argue that a non-exclusive right is commonly understood to mean a right that does not exclude others from the same right. Accordingly, appellants continue, the commonly understood meaning of the words granting a non-exclusive right to fox hunt would mean that such right does not exclude appellants or others from fox hunting.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">{\u00b6 9} Appellants note that at trial appellees argued that the phrase \u201cnonexclusive right to fox hunt\u201d was merely a recognition of the fact that previous easements had been granted that encumbered the premises, such as oil and gas leases, and that the defendants contemplated that they might grant future easements to generate an economic benefit to them. Appellants, however, contend that because the phrase \u201cnon-exclusive\u201d adverbially modifies only \u201cthe right to fox hunt,\u201d the phrase is not reasonably susceptible of appellees\u2019 interpretation that it somehow relates only to present or future oil, gas, or other easements.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">{\u00b6 10} For these reasons, appellants conclude that the language regarding the non-exclusive right to fox hunt was not reasonably susceptible of two different meanings, particularly the meaning offered by appellees, and that the trial court therefore erred in permitting parol evidence for the purpose of construing that phrase.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">{\u00b6 11} The construction of written contracts and conveyances is a matter of law. <em>Alexander v. Buckeye Pipe Line Co. </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 241, 7 O.O.3d 403, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>374 N.E.2d 146, paragraph one of the syllabus. We review questions of law de novo. <em>Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Guman Bros. Farm </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 107, 108, 652 N.E.2d 684.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">{\u00b6 12} Where terms in an existing contract are clear and unambiguous, a court cannot create a new contract by finding an intent not expressed in the clear language employed by the parties. <em>Long Beach Assn., Inc. v. Jones </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 574, 577, 697 N.E.2d 208, citing <em>Alexander, </em>53 Ohio St.2d at 246, 7 O.O.3d 403, 374 N.E.2d 146. \u201c \u2018Common words appearing in a written instrument will be given their ordinary meaning unless manifest absurdity results, or unless some other meaning is clearly evidenced from the face or overall contents of the instrument.\u2019 \u201d <em>King v. Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 208, 212, 519 N.E.2d 1380, quoting <em>Alexander, </em>53 Ohio St.2d. at 245-246, 7 O.O.3d 403, 374 N.E.2d 146. Language in a contract is ambiguous only if it is reasonably susceptible of two or more meanings. <em>McClorey v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1998), 130 Ohio App.3d 621, 625, 720 N.E.2d 954, citing <em>George H. Olmsted &amp; Co. v. Metro. Life Ins. Co. </em>(1928), 118 Ohio St. 421, 426, 161 N.E. 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">{\u00b6 13} In the present case, the trial court took careful effort to analyze the extrinsic evidence the parties presented to conclude that appellees held an exclusive right to fox hunt. But we need not reach this analysis because the conveyance language is not ambiguous. Extrinsic evidence is admissible to ascertain the intent of the parties only when a contract is unclear or ambiguous, or when circumstances surrounding an agreement give the plain language special meaning. <em>Graham v. Drydock Coal Co. </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 311, 314, 667 N.E.2d 949.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">{\u00b6 14} The phrase, \u201cnon-exclusive right, privilege, and permission * * *, to enter upon and use the real property of Grantors, * * * for the sole purpose of horseback riding, fox hunting with horses and hounds, and hill topping with horses and horse-drawn vehicles and four-wheel vehicles\u201d is not ambiguous. In this phrase, the words \u201cnon-exclusive right\u201d to fox hunt are clear. We must look at these words using their ordinary, everyday meaning. \u201cExclusive,\u201d used as an adjective or adverb, means \u201cexcluding or having power to exclude,\u201d \u201climiting or limited to possession, control, or use by a single individual or group,\u201d \u201cexcluding others from participation,\u201d or \u201csnobbishly aloof.\u201d Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary (10th Ed.1998) 404. The prefix \u201cnon\u201d means, \u201cnot: other than: reverse of: absence of.\u201d Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary (10th Ed.1998) 788. Thus, the common meaning of \u201cnon-exclusive\u201d right to fox hunt is that other people can fox hunt because the holder of the non-exclusive right does not have the power to exclude others from fox hunting.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">{\u00b6 15} Appellees argue that the \u201cnon-exclusive\u201d language is reasonably susceptible of two constructions: the first, as espoused by appellants, and the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>being simply a recognition that other easements were already in place as encumbrances on the property or that others were contemplated by appellants in the future. However, the easement language, without any extrinsic evidence does not lead to this conclusion. It is only upon the examination of extrinsic evidence that one might reasonably conclude that the language is susceptible of two or more interpretations. Within the agreement itself there is no mention of other easements, such as oil or gas leases, as appellees suggest. And since we are not to consider extrinsic evidence unless the language in the conveyance is reasonably susceptible of two or more meanings, we cannot conclude that the \u201cnon-exclusive right * * * for * * * fox hunting\u201d is ambiguous. Accordingly, appellants\u2019 first assignment of error has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">{\u00b6 16} Appellants\u2019 second assignment of error states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-6\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cThe trial court erred by interpreting a non-exclusive easement to use property for fox hunting, to exclude the owner and his assigns from using the same property for fox hunting.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">{\u00b6 18} In its judgment entry, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-8\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cWhether two hunt clubs can schedule joint \u2018use\u2019 of the 2,000 acres is not relevant. The recreational easement agreement at issue, as construed, precludes joint use and joint scheduling. It is a moot point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-9\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cHowever, the weight of the trial testimony supports a finding that two clubs cannot physically \u2018hunt\u2019 the -2,000 acres together on any regular basis as such overuse of such a limited area would diminish, or totally eliminate, the quarry being hunted. Any \u2018second hunt\u2019 would amount to \u2018unreasonable\u2019 interference with plaintiffs\u2019 rights.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">{\u00b6 21} Assuming that the right transferred to appellees in the agreement was a non-exclusive right to fox hunt, appellants argue that the trial court erred in determining that any fox hunting by appellant was unreasonable per se under Section 8 of the agreement, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-11\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c(8) Grantors and their successors and assigns shall have the full right and privilege to use the Premises, <em>provided that Grantors shall not unreasonably interfere with the rights granted to Grantee </em>hereunder(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-12\">{\u00b6 23} Appellants contend that this section was clearly intended to demonstrate that they retained the full right to use their own property while not unreasonably interfering with the rights granted to appellees. If the right to fox hunt is nonexclusive, appellants continue, it cannot be unreasonable to allow two competing groups to fox hunt, because a non-exclusive right to fox hunt clearly contemplates that the owner also has the right to fox hunt. Appellants concede that there is some \u201cgray area\u201d as to how much they can fox hunt before they unreasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>interfere with appellees\u2019 right to fox hunt. However, appellants urge that the language defining the easement clearly contemplates that it is not exclusive, and that both they and appellees have the right to fox hunt. Accordingly, appellants conclude, the issue cannot be resolved by simply saying, as the trial court did, that too much fox hunting would eliminate the quarry being hunted, and that therefore appellants may not engage in fox hunting.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">{\u00b6 24} As stated above, the trial court concluded that the easement was exclusive. Thus, appellants could not fox hunt on the property. This should have ended the trial court\u2019s decision. Instead, the court went on to issue an advisory opinion regarding what the evidence demonstrated <em>if </em>it had found that the easement was non-exclusive. The court should not have reached this issue. The question of whether appellants have unreasonably interfered with appellees\u2019 easement has not yet arisen. Appellants have not, to this date, unreasonably interfered with appellees\u2019 non-exclusive right to fox hunt. Because appellees possess a non-exclusive right to fox hunt, all hunting by appellants cannot be said to be an unreasonable interference. Accordingly, appellants\u2019 second assignment of error has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">{\u00b6 25} For the reasons stated above, the trial court\u2019s decision is hereby reversed, and the permanent injunction is lifted.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">Judgment reversed and injunction lifted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b360-8\">Vukovich, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b360-9\">Waite, <em>P.J., </em>and Gene Donofrio, J., concur separately.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b360-10\">Waite, Presiding Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ar_\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">{\u00b6 26} Although I agree with most of the reasoning used in the majority opinion, I believe that we must also resolve whether there has been an unreasonable interference with appellees\u2019 nonexclusive right to hunt on appellants\u2019 property. In so doing, it is important to review the differences between an exclusive and nonexclusive easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-12\">{\u00b6 27} The right to hunt or fish on property owned by another is given through a type of easement known as a profit \u00e1 prendre. 1 Restatement of the Law Sd, Property (2000) 12, Section 1.2. \u201cA profit \u00e1 prendre is an easement that confers the right to enter and remove [such things as] timber, minerals, oil, gas, game, or other substances from land in the possession of another.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-13\">{\u00b6 28} A profit \u00e1 prendre, as well as most other types of easements, may be exclusive or nonexclusive. These are legal terms of art encompassing (1) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>persons who may be excluded and (2) the uses or area from which those persons may be excluded. Id. at 14, Section 1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cAt one extreme, the holder of the easement or profit has no right to exclude anyone from making any use that does not unreasonably interfere with the uses authorized by the servitude. For example[,] the holder of a private roadway easement in a public road has no right to exclude anyone from using the road. * * * At the other extreme, the holder of the easement or profit has the right to exclude everyone, including the servient owner, from making any use of the land within the easement boundaries. In between are easements where the servitude holder can exclude anyone except the servient owner and others authorized by the servient owner (usually called \u2018nonexclusive easement\u2019) * * Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">{\u00b6 30} Unless the easement agreement states otherwise, the servient owner may make any use of the property that does not unreasonably interfere with the enjoyment of the servitude. 1 Restatement of the Law 3d, Property (2000) 581, Section 4.9. \u201cAll residual rights remain in the possessory estate\u2014the servient estate.\u201d Id. at 582; see, also, 1 Thompson on Real Property (1980) 472, Section 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cIn the absence of detailed arrangements between them, it is assumed that the owner of the servitude and the holder of the servient estate are intended to exercise their respective rights and privileges in a spirit of mutual accommodation.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">{\u00b6 32} The terms of the fox hunting easement in the instant case must be interpreted with an understanding of the aforementioned commonly accepted legal principles. Based on these principles, there is no ambiguity in the language of the easement agreement. Appellants granted a nonexclusive easement for the purpose of fox hunting (among other things), and there were no restrictions placed on appellants\u2019 residual rights except for the promise not to \u201cunreasonably interfere with the rights granted to\u201d appellees. This latter provision is already implied in the very grant of the easement in the first place, and does not materially change the nature of the easement. Seeing that the easement agreement does not place any other restrictions on appellants\u2019 use of their property, the law presumes that appellants, as the grantors of the easement, have reserved the right to fox hunt on their property or to issue other nonexclusive easements for fox hunting, within reasonable limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">{\u00b6 33} Appellees\u2019 attempt to construe the terms of a nonexclusive easement so that it actually establishes an exclusive easement must fail for two reasons. First, as the majority states, there is no ambiguity in the word \u201cnonexclusive.\u201d The common legal meaning of the word allows appellants to continue to fully utilize their property, while at the same time making reasonable accommodations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>for appellees\u2019 right to hunt on the property. Second, appellees\u2019 attorney drafted the easement document, and it is an axiomatic rule of contract interpretation that \u201c[a]ny ambiguities in the document setting forth the rights and responsibilities of each party must be construed against the drafter of the document.\u201d <em>Fletcher v. Fletcher </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 464, 471, 628 N.E.2d 1343. Even if the contract contained the ambiguity asserted by appellees, we could not interpret such ambiguity in appellees\u2019 favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">{\u00b6 34} Once we have determined that the agreement does not contain an exclusive easement, our review is not ended, because there remains an open question as to whether appellants have unreasonably interfered with appellees\u2019 right to fox hunt. The trial court determined, as an alternative legal basis for his decision, that appellants unreasonably interfered with appellees\u2019 right to fox hunt. Whether a person\u2019s actions are reasonable or unreasonable is generally a question of fact to be determined by the trier of fact. See, e.g., <em>Cater v. Cleveland </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 24, 33, 697 N.E.2d 610. A reviewing court will usually defer to a lower court\u2019s factual determinations if they are supported by competent, credible evidence. <em>State ex rel. Fleming v. Rocky River Bd. of Edn. </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 200, 205, 680 N.E.2d 981.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">(\u00b6 35} The majority opinion affirmatively declares that \u201c[a]ppellants have not, to this date, unreasonably interfered with appellees\u2019 nonexclusive right to fox hunt.\u201d It appears from this statement that the majority has implicitly concluded that appellants\u2019 actions were reasonable. While I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion, I find it necessary to explain this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">{\u00b6 36} The trial court found that it was physically impossible for two groups to regularly fox hunt on appellants\u2019 property because it would \u201cdiminish, or totally eliminate, the quarry being hunted.\u201d On this basis, the trial court held that it would be unreasonable for anyone other than appellees to fox hunt on appellants\u2019 property. The trial court has fundamentally misunderstood what the parties actually agreed in their easement. Appellants did not agree to supply live foxes or well-rested foxes or, for that matter, any foxes at all. The easement agreement merely allows appellees the right to hunt for any foxes that happen to be on appellants\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">{\u00b6 37} The holder of a servient estate generally has no duty to the beneficiary of an easement or profit to maintain the condition of the servient estate. 1 Restatement of the Law 3d, Property (2000) 631, Section 4.13. There is nothing in the easement language that created a duty for appellants to maintain foxes on their property, or to keep the foxes in prime condition for the enjoyment of the hunters. There is nothing in the easement language guaranteeing that appellees would find any foxes on the property. Appellees\u2019 attempt to imply such duties and terms adds new elements to the easement to which the parties did not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>{\u00b6 38} Appellees\u2019 allegation that appellants unreasonably interfered with their right to hunt presumes that some right was actually curtailed by appellants. Appellees must prove at trial that appellants prevented them from hunting on their property. There is nothing in the record indicating that appellants prevented appellees from entering the property at any time for the purpose of fox hunting. Therefore, the record does not contain any competent or credible evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s decision, and for this reason, I agree with the majority decision. The trial court\u2019s judgment must be reversed and the permanent injunction vacated, and judgment granted to appellants.</p>\n<judges id=\"b363-5\">Gene Donofrio, J., concurs in the foregoing concurring opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
