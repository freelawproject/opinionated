The amended complaint contained three counts: (1) a common-law claim for restitution alleging that Microsoft had charged a monopoly price for its Windows operating system; (2) a claim that Microsoft had violated Ohio\u2019s version of the Valentine Act, R.C. 1331.01; and (3) a claim that Microsoft had violated two provisions of the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act, R.C. 1345.02 and 1345.03, by engaging in \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d and \u201cunconscionable acts\u201d relating to a consumer sale. Johnson brought her claims as part of a putative class consisting of all those who had purchased a license to use any version of the Windows operating system within four years of her filing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-13\">{\u00b6 2} In her single assignment of error, Johnson argues that she successfully stated claims under Ohio common law, the Valentine Act, and the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">{\u00b6 3} Johnson alleged that she had purchased a personal computer (\u201cPC\u201d) from a retail merchant, Gateway, and that the PC was loaded with the Windows 98 operating system. She further alleged that the Windows system on her new PC remained inoperable until it was out of the box and in her home, and that she used the PC to indicate her acceptance of an on-screen licensing agreement drafted by Microsoft and entitled \u201cMicrosoft End User License Agreement\u201d (\u201cEULA\u201d). When she provided the obligatory acceptance, she alleged, she entered into a separate transaction with Microsoft.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">{\u00b6 4} Johnson further alleged that Microsoft had obtained a monopoly in the market of PC operating systems. She alleged that Microsoft had used its superior position in the market to control price \u201cfree of the normal restraints faced in a competitive market.\u201d She alleged that the price charged by Microsoft for the Windows operating system was a \u201cmonopoly price, far above the price that would be paid in a competitive market.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">{\u00b6 5} Johnson further alleged that Microsoft had erected barriers to competition. Her allegations focused primarily on Microsoft\u2019s efforts to thwart competition from Navigator, a browser program introduced by Netscape Communications. She cited the action of the federal government and several states, including Ohio, in <em>United States v. Microsoft </em>(C.A.D.C.2001), 253 F.3d 34, which, she alleged, had resulted in findings that Microsoft had violated Ohio\u2019s Valentine Act as well as the Sherman Antitrust Act, Section 2, Title 15, U.S.Code. She alleged that these findings had then been upheld in <em>New York v. Microsoft Corp. </em>(D.D.C.2002), 209 F.Supp.2d 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">\n<em>The Valentine Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">{\u00b6 6} Microsoft successfully argued in its motion to dismiss that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois </em>(1977), 431 U.S. 720, 97 S.Ct. 2061, 52 L.Ed.2d 707, required a direct purchase from the company in order to confer standing upon Johnson to bring an action against it under Ohio\u2019s version of the Valentine Act. Johnson argues, as she did below, that Microsoft\u2019s reliance on <em>Illinois Brick </em>resulted from a false premise\u2014that Ohio\u2019s version of the Valentine Act must be interpreted in lockstep with the federal courts\u2019 interpretation of the Sherman Act. According to Johnson, the legislative history of Ohio\u2019s Valentine Act establishes the General Assembly\u2019s intent to chart a different course\u2014a course followed by the federal courts before <em>Illinois </em>Brick<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>\u2014that provides indirect purchasers with standing to sue under antitrust laws. For the following reasons, we agree with the legal analysis propounded by Microsoft.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">{\u00b6 7} Initially, we note that the weight of authority in this state is that the Valentine Act be interpreted consistently with federal antitrust law. The Ohio Supreme Court in <em>C.K. &amp; J.K, Inc. v. Fairview Shopping Ctr. Corp. </em>(1980), 63 Ohio St.2d 201, 17 O.O.3d 124, 407 N.E.2d 507, stated that the statutes comprising the Act \u201cwere patterned after the Sherman Antitrust Act, and as a consequence this court has interpreted the statutory language in light of federal judicial construction of the Sherman Act * * Quoting from <em>Std. Oil Co. v. United States </em>(1911), 221 U.S. 1, 62, 31 S.Ct. 502, 55 L.Ed. 619, the court in <em>C.K. </em>indicated that violations of the Valentine Act were to be judged on the same basis as violations of the Sherman Act\u2014in other words, on the basis that what was prohibited under the one was prohibited under the other. Id. The parallel construction<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> adopted by the court in <em>C.K. </em>was employed by this court in <em>Acme Wrecking Co., Inc. v. O\u2019Rourke Constr. Co. </em>(Mar. 1,1995), 1st Dist. No. C-930856, 1995 WL 84188. In <em>Acme, </em>we applied to the Valentine Act the antitrust-injury requirement of the Clayton Act, Section 4, Title 15, U.S.Code, which permits a private civil cause of action to be brought by persons injured by conduct forbidden by the Sherman Act and other antitrust laws.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">{\u00b6 8} Prior to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Illinois Brick, </em>and at the time that Ohio\u2019s version of the Valentine Act was enacted, there was no direct-purchaser requirement for standing to bring a claim under the Valentine Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, in 1977, the United States Supreme Court decided <em>Illinois </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number><em>Brick </em>and imposed such a requirement. The court\u2019s holding was a corollary of its earlier holding in <em>Hanover Shoe v. United Shoe Mach. Corp. </em>(1968), 392 U.S. 481, 88 S.Ct. 2224, 20 L.Ed.2d 1231. In <em>Hanover Shoe, </em>the court had held that middlemen could recover the full amount of a manufacturer\u2019s illegal overcharge without any deduction for the amount of the illegal overcharge \u201cpassed-on\u201d to the middlemen\u2019s consumers. The court in <em>Illinois Brick </em>imposed the direct-purchaser standing requirement to avoid the possibility of duplicate recoveries by both middlemen and consumers created by <em>Hanover Shoe. </em>Id. at 725-748, 97 S.Ct. 2061, 52 L.Ed.2d 707. The court reasoned that treble-damage proceedings in actions brought by middlemen against the monopolist would be greatly complicated and rendered less effective if they were forced to include an analysis of how much of the illegal overcharge of the monopolist was absorbed by the middlemen and how much was then passed on to the consumer. Id. at 745-747, 97 S.Ct. 2061, 52 L.Ed.2d 707. The court wished to avoid the difficulties and uncertainties of measuring, tracing, and apportioning damages between the two groups (middlemen and consumers) based upon pass-on theories. Further, the court expressed its concern that the dispersion of damages among a much larger group of plaintiffs that included individual consumers would lessen the incentive to sue for such a diluted individual recovery. Id. at 745-746, 97 S.Ct. 2061, 52 L.Ed.2d 707.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">{\u00b6 9} After <em>Illinois Brick, </em>the court in <em>California v. ARC Am. Corp. </em>(1989), 490 U.S. 93, 109 S.Ct. 1661, 104 L.Ed.2d 86, held that states were not obligated to impose their own direct-purchaser standing requirement upon state antitrust laws. The court reiterated that <em>Illinois Brick </em>was intended to interpret only federal antitrust laws, and that state antitrust statutes conferring standing upon indirect purchasers were not preempted by federal law. Id. at 101, 105-106, 109 S.Ct. 1661, 104 L.Ed.2d 86. Nonetheless, a majority of state courts that have considered the issue in the absence of legislative intervention have followed a course of parallel federal-state construction and incorporated <em>Illinois Brick\u2019s </em>direct-purchaser requirement into their states\u2019 versions of the Valentine Act. See <em>Pomerantz v. Microsoft Corp. </em>(Colo.App.2002), 50 P.3d 929; <em>Vacco v. Microsoft Corp. </em>(2002), 260 Conn. 59, 793 A.2d 1048; <em>Hindman v. Microsoft Corp. </em>(July 20, 2000), Hawaii Dist. Ct. No. 00-1-0945; <em>Berghausen v. Microsoft Corp. </em>(2002), 765 N.E.2d 592; <em>Arnold v. Microsoft </em>(2001), Ky.App. No. 2000-CA-002144-MR, 2001 WL 1835377; <em>Davidson v. Microsoft Corp. </em>(2002), 143 Md.App. 43, 792 A.2d 336; <em>O\u2019Connell v. Microsoft Corp. </em>(June 14, 2001), Mass. Sup.Ct. No. CA 0001743, 2001 WL 893525; <em>Ireland v. Microsoft Corp. </em>(Jan. 24, 2001), Mo. Cir. Ct. No. OOCV-201515, 2001 WL 1868946; <em>Arthur v. Microsoft Corp. </em>(June 25, 2003), Neb. No. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>S\u201401\u20141325; <em>Krotz v. Microsoft Corp. </em>(June 19, 2000), Nev. Dist. Ct. No. A41631; <em>Minuteman, LLC v. Microsoft Corp. </em>(2002), 147 N.H. 634, 795 A.2d 833; <em>Major v. Microsoft Corp. </em>(Okla.App.2002), 60 P.3d 511; <em>Daraee v. Microsoft Corp. </em>(June 27, 2000), Ore. Cir. Ct. No. 0004-03311, 2000 WL 33187306; <em>Siena v. Microsoft Corp. </em>(R.I.2002), 796 A.2d 461; and <em>Weinberg v. Microsoft Corp. </em>(Aug. 18, 2002), Tex. Dist. Ct. No. D-162, 526.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">{\u00b6 10} Of equal significance, although some 26 states and the District of Columbia do allow for some form of indirect-purchaser actions, 23 of these jurisdictions do so only because of <em>Illinois Brick </em>repealer statutes passed by their respective legislatures. Many of these repealer statutes, in turn, limit indirect-purchase actions to the state attorney general as parens patriae.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">{\u00b6 11} Ohio is not among the states that have passed an <em>Illinois Brick </em>repealer statute. Still, Johnson argues that, despite the weight of authority to the contrary, <em>Illinois Brick\u2019s </em>direct-purchaser requirement should not be applied to Ohio\u2019s Valentine Act. The reason, Johnson argues, is that the Ohio legislature never manifested an intent that the Act would be subject to evolving federal antitrust law. To support this argument, Johnson isolates the following language in <em>List v. Burley Tobacco Growers\u2019 Co-op. Assn. </em>(1926), 114 Ohio St. 361, 370, 151 N.E. 471: \u201c[W]hen the Valentine Law was enacted in Ohio the Ohio Legislature adopted the judicial construction already placed upon the federal act by the federal courts * * *.\u201d According to Johnson, this language should be read to mean that the <em>only </em>federal judicial construction the legislature intended to adopt was that in effect at the time it passed Ohio\u2019s version of the Valentine Act on April 19, 1898. To accept the contrary view, Johnson argues, in other words that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>of an ongoing parallel construction, would give the federal courts the power to amend Ohio statutes. In short, Johnson advocates the view that \u201c[i]f a \u2018direct-purchase\u2019 requirement is to be found in the Valentine Act, it must either appear in the language of the statute, or, under <em>List, </em>in the federal construction of the federal statute when the General Assembly enacted or amended the Valentine Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">{\u00b6 12} We disagree with Johnson in several respects. First, it is an exaggeration to suggest that a policy of parallel construction somehow grants the federal courts the power to make Ohio law. Obviously, the Ohio legislature can at any time pass legislation that effectively repeals <em>Illinois Brick\u2019s </em>direct-purchaser requirement, as 23 states have already done, and the Ohio Supreme Court can decide at any time that the requirement is not what the legislature intended in the first place. We are convinced, however, that the court in <em>C.K </em>established the principle that Ohio\u2019s Valentine Act should be interpreted by Ohio lower courts in a manner consistent with federal interpretation of the Sherman Act. Furthermore, we are not persuaded to the contrary by the language in <em>List </em>quoted by Johnson. <em>List </em>was decided in 1926, <em>C.K </em>in 1980. In <em>C.K, </em>the court relied upon the <em>Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States </em>(1911), 221 U.S. 1, 31 S.Ct. 502, 55 L.Ed. 619 case that was decided by the United States Supreme Court in 1911, thus refuting the notion that the court\u2019s language in <em>List </em>limited the applicability of federal judicial construction to that existing at the time the Valentine Act was passed in 1896. Furthermore, as noted previously, this court in <em>Acme Wrecking </em>applied to the Valentine Act the antitrust-injury limitation that was articulated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Atlantic Richfield Co. v. USA Petroleum Co. </em>(1990), 495 U.S. 328, 110 S.Ct. 1884, 109 L.Ed.2d 333\u2014-a federal case that followed passage of the Valentine Act by almost a century.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">{\u00b6 13} Guided by the principle of stare decisis, we believe that this court has already adopted and applied an ongoing parallel federal-state construction of the Valentine Act. The rules of the game were established, we believe, in <em>C.K. </em>To hold otherwise now would not be consistent with our own precedent in <em>Acme Wrecking. </em>Furthermore, eschewing the direct-purchaser requirement would place this court outside what is clearly the weight of authority among state courts that have considered the same issue.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In our view, as evidenced by the legislative action taken by 23 of the 27 jurisdictions that have elected to allow indirect-purchaser actions, the decision is one involving public policy and thus should be made by the legislative rather than the judicial branch.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>{\u00b6 14} Finally, we note that we find nothing in the language of the Ohio statute that would dictate a different result. Ohio\u2019s version of the Valentine Act provides that \u201cthe person injured in the person\u2019s business or property by another person by reason of anything forbidden or declared to be unlawful [under the Act], may sue therefor * * *.\u201d R.C. 1331.08. Although at first blush this language may seem broad enough to infer an intent by the legislature to part company with <em>Illinois Brick </em>and allow for suits by indirect purchasers, it is essentially the same language that appears in the Clayton Act, and has therefore been rejected as a basis for diverging from the direct-purchaser requirement in jurisdictions such as Ohio that follow the federal paradigm. See <em>Major, </em>supra, 60 P.3d at 513.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">{\u00b6 15} Johnson argues, alternatively, that even if the direct-purchaser requirement is held to be applicable under Ohio law, the licensing agreement that she entered into with Microsoft was sufficiently direct to satisfy the requirement. Johnson argues that the agreement was directly between Microsoft, the licensor, and herself, as licensee, and had nothing to do with the retailer, Gateway, as middleman. She advocates that we view the license agreement as, in essence, Microsoft\u2019s product that she \u201cpurchased\u201d by using her computer to manifest her agreement to the terms of the license.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">{\u00b6 16} As Microsoft correctly argues, the United States Supreme Court has rejected an industry-specific approach to <em>Illinois Brick, </em>in other words, different rules for different industries. <em>Kansas v. UtiliCorp United Inc. </em>(1990), 497 U.S. 199, 110 S.Ct. 2807, 111 L.Ed.2d 169. According to Microsoft, the position advocated by Johnson would constitute a \u201csoftware exception\u201d unique to the computer industry and violate UtiliCorp\u2019s rejection of exceptions for a particular market. We find this logic persuasive, as we do the decisions of other courts that have refused to equate a direct licensee in an indirect purchase with a direct purchaser. See, e.g., <em>Pomerantz, </em>supra, 50 P.3d at 934-935; <em>Davidson v. Microsoft Corp., </em>supra, 143 Md.App. at 53, 792 A.2d 336; <em>Minuteman, LLC, </em>supra, 147 N.H. at 640-641, 795 A.2d 833; <em>Major, </em>supra, 60 P.3d at 515; <em>Siena, </em>supra, 796 A.2d at 465; <em>Sherwood v. Microsoft Corp. </em>(July 31, 2003), No. M200001850-COA-R9-CV, 2003 WL 21780975 at * 5, 2003 Tenn.App. LEXIS 539 at 16 (use of the end-user license agreement as an exception to the indirect-purchaser preclusion \u201cuniformly rejected\u201d); and <em>In re Microsoft Corp. Antitrust Litigation </em>(D.Md.2001), 127 F.Supp.2d 702, 709. As these courts have, correctly in our view, reasoned, \u201c[w]hether the consumer purchases the software or [the EULA] the immediate economic transaction constituting the purchase occurs between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>consumer and the OEM or the retailer seller.\u201d <em>Pomerantz, </em>supra, 50 P.3d at 934-935. Because the OEM or retail seller deals with the indirect purchaser, it strikes us that the court\u2019s stated aversion to the complicating nature of pass-on theories in <em>Illinois Brick </em>remains equally pertinent here.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">{\u00b6 17} Because we hold that the direct-purchaser requirement deprived Johnson of standing<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to pursue a claim under the Valentine Act, we need not reach the other issues raised by the parties concerning the allegation of sufficient intrastate activity and the necessity of alleging \u201ca combination, contract, or agreement.\u201d Even if we were to agree with Johnson on both these issues, the fact remains that she lacked standing to assert a damage claim under the Act<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> because she did not purchase her PC with its preloaded software from Microsoft.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">\n<em>Restitution</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">{\u00b6 18} Johnson argues that even if she lacked standing under the Valentine Act, her restitution claim, on behalf of the putative class, still stated a viable claim for relief. In this regard, she argues that she alleged all the necessary elements to support claims of equitable restitution and unjust enrichment\u2014to wit, that she and members of the putative class had conferred a benefit upon Microsoft and that it would be unjust or unfair to allow Microsoft to retain the benefit given its alleged monopolistic and anticompetitive activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">{\u00b6 19} A restitution claim is designed to force the defendant to disgorge benefits that it has wrongfully or unjustly obtained. Dobbs, Remedies (1973), Section 4.1, at 224. Microsoft responds correctly, in our view, that the only direct benefit Johnson or members of the putative class conferred was the money that they paid to the retailers who sold them their individual computers or software. A promissory click to the Microsoft licensing agreement, following a purchase of the computer, was an indirect or incidental benefit to Microsoft, and as such it was insufficient under Ohio law to support a claim of restitution. Cf. <em>Norton v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number><em>Gallon </em>(1989), 60 Ohio App.3d 109, 110, 573 N.E.2d 1208. Johnson, it should be noted, wanted more than simply to take back her promise to abide by the terms of the licensing agreement. Rather, in her view, by clicking her agreement on the computer, she was \u201cpurchasing\u201d the licensing agreement, and her complaint asked for restitutionary damages equal to an amount that she and other members of the class claimed they had been overcharged for the software. We agree with Microsoft that this was essentially the putative class\u2019s antitrust claim in a different guise, and that the same difficulties of pass-on theories and the like that troubled the court in <em>Illinois Brick </em>would confound calculation of any proper apportionment of damages between consumers such as Johnson and the retailers from whom they bought their computers.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">\n<em>Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">{\u00b6 20} Johnson argues, finally, with respect to her remaining claim on behalf of the class under the Ohio Consumer Sales Practice Act, that the trial court applied an overly strict pleading requirement. She argues that the court required her to plead with a higher degree of specificity than that called for under the general rule that such claims be pleaded with only \u201creasonable specificity.\u201d See <em>Amato v. Gen. Motors Corp. </em>(1982), 11 Ohio App.3d 124, 130, 11 OBR 203, 463 N.E.2d 625. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">{\u00b6 21} As Microsoft points out, the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act has specific rules permitting a class action. Under R.C. 1345.09(B), a class action is permitted under the Act if the plaintiff alleges that the substantive provisions of the Act have been violated, and (1) a specific rule or regulation has been promulgated under R.C. 1345.05 that specifically characterizes the challenged practice as unfair or deceptive, or (2) an Ohio state court has found the specific practice either unconscionable or deceptive in a decision open to public inspection. As Microsoft points out, Johnson pleaded neither of these elements despite the fact that she brought her claim as part of a class action.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">{\u00b6 22} Furthermore, we find persuasive Microsoft\u2019s argument that it is questionable whether the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act can even be said to apply to monopolistic and anticompetitive behavior, which is more correctly described as a manipulation of market forces than as a sales practice. The Consumer Sales Practices Act is targeted toward \u201csuppliers\u201d who are <em>\u201cengaged in the business of effecting or soliciting consumer transactions </em>* * (Emphasis supplied.) R.C. 1345.01(C). Under R.C. 1345.02, unfair or deceptive sales practices are those that are likely to induce in the consumer a false state of mind concerning the product itself. R.C. 1345.03 sets forth certain circumstances to be used in determining whether a sales act or practice is unconscionable, and these indicate that unconscionability is directed toward some inherent unfairness in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>act of sale, such as overcharging, price gouging, unreasonable refusal to refund, and selling to those unable to pay. None of these stated practices provides support for a claim based upon alleged antitrust violations that affect competitive forces in the marketplace, which we believe that the legislature intended to exclusively address under the Valentine Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">{\u00b6 23} A similar issue arose in <em>Sherwood, </em>supra, a case in which the Tennessee appeals court held that the state antitrust statute <em>did </em>provide for indirect-purchaser actions based upon certain unique language in the Tennessee statute. The <em>Sherwood </em>plaintiffs had also sought recovery under the Tennessee Consumer Protection Act, Tenn.Code Ann. 47-18-101-1808, upon the basis that the same arrangement in restraint of trade also constituted a violation of the TCPA. The <em>Shenvood </em>court rejected, however, the proposition that the same anticompetitive conduct actionable under the antitrust statute was actionable under the consumer protection statute, despite the statutory admonition that the TCPA was to be liberally construed to \u201cprotect consumers and legitimate business enterprises from those who engage in unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce * * Tenn.Code Ann. 47-18-102(2). Tracing the history of the Tennessee statute back to the development of the Uniform Trade Practices Act and Consumer Protection Law developed in the 1960s, the court noted that, as these and other uniform acts<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> evolved, state legislatures were faced with the choice of adopting either a version that mirrored the Federal Trade Commission Act, Section 45(a)(1), Title 15, U.S.Code, prohibiting both unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices (referred to as the \u201clittle FTC Act\u201d version), or another version that elected only to prohibit unfair and deceptive acts and practices without including language targeting unfair methods of competition. <em>Sherwood, </em>supra, at * 32, 2003 Tenn. App. LEXIS 539 at 108. The Tennessee court reasoned that because the history of consumer-protection legislation clearly showed that at the time the Tennessee legislature adopted its version of the Consumer Protection Act, its legislators had the benefit of the uniform laws and the federal law, the only conclusion to be drawn was that the Tennessee General Assembly \u201cknowingly chose not to include antitrust or anticompetitive conduct as actionable under the TCPA.\u201d Id. at * 33, 2003 TenmApp. LEXIS 539 at 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">{\u00b6 24} We find the same logic persuasive here. Indeed, it would have been a small matter for the General Assembly to include language in the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act prohibiting unfair methods of competition if it had wished to do so. By comparing and contrasting the two statutes, we find it to be quite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>clear that the Valentine Act was meant to be the legal remedy in Ohio for the type of conduct for which Johnson has sought recourse. Unfortunately for her and the putative members of her class, the direct-purchaser requirement of <em>Illinois Brick </em>forecloses the type of action she wishes to bring until the legislature or the Ohio Supreme Court repeals or rejects it.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">{\u00b6 25} In sum, we hold that Johnson\u2019s amended complaint failed to state claims under Ohio common law, the Valentine Act, or the Ohio Consumer Sales Practice Act. Accordingly, the trial court did not err when it granted Microsoft\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Civ.R. 12(B)(6). The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b668-7\">Doan, P.J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b668-8\">Pajnter, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b659-9\">. Before <em>Illinois Brick, </em>six of seven federal circuit courts ruling on the issue had held that indirect purchasers could sue for damages caused by a violation of the federal antitrust laws. <em>Illinois v.

The antitrust-injury requirement, like the direct-purchaser standing requirement, was the product of judicial construction. <em>See Atlantic Richfield Co. v.

The requirement of an antitrust injury imposed upon the plaintiff the burden to show not merely any type of injury causally linked to an illegal presence in the market, but, rather, an injury of the type that the antitrust laws intended to prevent\u2014i.e., an injury directly resulting from the anticompetitive aspect of the defendant\u2019s behavior.

As we note infra in fn. 10, the holding of <em>Illinois Brick </em>is at its core a definition of who can be said to have suffered injury under federal antitrust law, and, therefore, by applying <em>Illinois Brick </em>to R.C. 1331.08, it must be said that an indirect purchaser is not \"the person injured.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b665-9\">. Although we have couched the issue as one of standing, it should be noted that there is some debate in the cases whether <em>Illinois Brick </em>is concerned with standing or the definition of injury. As the court in <em>Illinois Brick </em>noted, the questions of who has standing and which persons have sustained injury are \"analytically distinct,\" and its precise holding was that the direct purchaser, not the indirect purchaser, was the one injured for the purposes of federal antitrust law. <em>Illinois Brick, </em>supra, 431 U.S. at 728, 97 S.Ct. 2061, 52 L.Ed.2d 707, fn. 7. While we acknowledge this analytic distinction, the two concepts merge for practical purposes, and we use the word <em>standing, </em>admittedly loosely, to denote a person who has sustained an injury sufficient to give rise to an actionable claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b665-10\">. See fn. 2, supra. As the court noted in <em>Mid-West Paper Products, </em>it is arguable that injunctive relief may still be available to an indirect purchaser even after <em>Illinois Brick </em>since such equitable nonmonetary relief would not be complicated by pass-on theories as would a claim for treble damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b667-7\">.

We are not persuaded to the contrary by Johnson's observation that in <em>Shaver v. Std.

The case may stand for the proposition that a company may commit both antitrust violations and unfair or unconscionable sales practices at the same time, but it does not stand for the proposition that all anticompetitive behavior is a sales practice under the CSPA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b668-9\">Painter, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AF6\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">{\u00b6 26} As the majority correctly points out, there was no direct-purchaser requirement for standing to bring a Valentine Act claim prior to <em>Illinois Brick.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b668-11\">{\u00b6 27} The weight of the authority does indeed provide that the Ohio Valentine Act is to be interpreted consistently with federal antitrust law. But that does not mean that we must follow the federal courts blindly when interpreting Ohio law. <em>Illinois Brick </em>interpreted the <em>federal </em>antitrust laws as precluding any claims by indirect purchasers. And the federal antitrust laws were intended to supplement, not displace, state antitrust remedies.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-12\">{\u00b6 28} After <em>Illinois Brick, </em>which drastically changed federal antitrust law, many states reenacted their own laws to specifically reject the <em>Illinois Brick </em>doctrine. Ohio did not\u2014but reading much of anything into legislative inaction is dangerous. When our Valentine Act was passed, indirect purchasers had stand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>ing to sue. Why a federal interpretation of a federal law should change Ohio law escapes me.</p>\n<p id=\"AF_\">{\u00b6 29} Twenty-seven other jurisdictions do allow for some indirect-purchaser actions. And Arizona, Iowa, North Carolina, and Tennessee courts have all upheld indirect-purchaser actions despite their legislatures\u2019 failure to enact repealer statutes.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Ohio should follow their lead.</p>\n<p id=\"aqh-dedup-0\">{\u00b6 30} The Valentine Act was adopted long before <em>Illinois Brick. </em>It allowed for indirect-purchaser actions. Now, the majority notes that Ohio can pass legislation to repeal the direct-purchaser requirement. But Ohio should not have to enact a new statute every time a federal court rules on a new antitrust case. Wfhat was the law prior to <em>Illinois Brick </em>should continue to be the law. Ohio should allow indirect-purchaser actions under the Valentine Act.</p>\n<p id=\"A-_\">{\u00b6 31} The language of the Valentine Act is broad in granting standing to anyone \u201cinjured in the person\u2019s business or property by another person by reason of anything forbidden or declared to be unlawful * * <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Valentine Act prohibits a trust from fixing prices \u201cto the public or consumer\u201d in any manner.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Trusts also cannot contract to fix prices to preclude unrestricted competition \u201camong themselves, purchasers, or consumers * * <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> And no person shall enter into a combination, contract, or agreement with the intent to fix the price or lessen the production or sale \u201cof an article or service of commerce, use, or consumption * * <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> This language shows a clear intent to allow consumers to proceed under Valentine. And consumers are usually indirect purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"AV9\">{\u00b6 32} The four jurisdictions without repealer statutes that have found indirect-purchaser claims to be valid have based their decisions on similar statutory language.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The similarity to the Clayton Act did not give them pause other than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>to assert their judicial rights to interpret their own state statutes. We, too, should not stumble on similarities in the language.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">{\u00b6 33} <em>Illinois Brick </em>dramatically changed the landscape of federal antitrust litigation. It effectively eliminated a remedy for the one party who was most likely to be injured by antitrust violations\u2014the consumer.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> To suggest that Ohio should continue to apply an ongoing parallel federal-state construction here undermines Ohio courts\u2019 authority and robs consumers of their day in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">{\u00b6 34} I am also not convinced of <em>Illinois Brick\u2019s </em>rejection of the industry-specific approach, which the majority now adopts. The EULAs are contracts between Microsoft and the end user\u2014no more, no less. There may not be a direct exchange of money, but the license <em>is </em>the product. Allowing Microsoft to escape antitrust liability simply because it has figured out a way to insert a buffer of retailers, OEMs, and EULAs between it and its consumers creates an industry-specific exception to justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">{\u00b6 35} Microsoft is in direct privity with its end users. Perhaps if Microsoft were willing to forgo any and all suits arising out of these EULAs, then the end users would simply be indirect purchasers. But Microsoft uses the OEMs or retailers to get PCs into the users\u2019 homes and businesses. It then uses that direct contact with all consumers to force an EULA on all end users before they can use the computers that they purchased from somebody other than Microsoft. And Microsoft accomplishes all of this without suffering any of the ordinary legal consequences. Standard Oil never had it so easy.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">{\u00b6 36} Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b668-14\">. <em>California v. ARC Am.
