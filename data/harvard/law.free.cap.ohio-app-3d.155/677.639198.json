Because we conclude that a material question of fact exists as to whether appellant was legally disabled, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-10\">{\u00b6 2} In 1991, appellant, Patricia L. Ferguson, began work for appellee, Lear Corporation, at appellee\u2019s Huron, Ohio injection molding plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-11\">{\u00b6 3} According to appellant, in 1993, while working in appellee\u2019s molding department, she came into contact with a chemical that caused blisters to form inside and outside her mouth. On a physician\u2019s instructions, appellee moved appellant to a job that did not require contact with the chemical that caused her reaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-12\">{\u00b6 4} In 1996, appellant again reported an adverse reaction to substances in the workplace. Appellant asserted that her exposure to aerosol chemicals at work caused her to experience shortness of breath and irritation to her skin, throat, and chest.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-13\">{\u00b6 5} On May 30, 1998, shortly after starting her workday, appellant reported feeling hot and becoming nauseated. She then noticed a rash developing on her arm. Appellant was taken to a nearby hospital emergency room, where an examination revealed scattered hives on her face, trunk, and extremities. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>was diagnosed as having an allergic reaction, possibly to mold degreaser, to which she had been exposed at work. Antihistamines were administered, and appellant was advised to see her family physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">{\u00b6 6} Shortly after her emergency-room treatment, appellant saw her family physician, Dr. Susan Gallagher. Dr. Gallagher advised appellee that appellant could return to work, provided that her tasks be restricted to \u201cdry work only\u2014no use of\u2014no exposure to liquid aerosolized cleaning materials, solvents, paints, adhesives, liquid chemical sprays.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">{\u00b6 7} Upon her return to work, appellee temporarily assigned appellant to breaking down corrugated boxes, a job which did not expose her to chemicals. Nevertheless, on June 19, 1998, appellant reported an allergic reaction to an aerosol cleaning spray to which she was exposed in a workplace restroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">{\u00b6 8} In July 1998, during a plant shutdown that appellant maintains she was scheduled to work, she was laid off. Appellee insists that this was because appellant\u2019s medical work restrictions made appellee unable to place her in a job during this time. Appellant contends that the layoff was in retaliation for an OSHA complaint she filed about work conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">{\u00b6 9} After the summer shutdown, appellant bid on a \u201ckitting\u201d job\u2014placing parts in a package. Appellee denied appellant that post, however, because working in the kitting department would expose her to propane and diesel fumes and an all-purpose spray cleaner known as \u201cMean Green.\u201d Such conditions would violate appellant\u2019s medical restrictions, according to appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">{\u00b6 10} In August 1998, appellant was awarded a position as a \u201cshipping/receiving clerk.\u201d There is a dispute as to what this job entailed. According to appellee, an integral part of this position is that the employee spend a small part of her time near the loading docks, where there are trucks and the necessarily accompanying fumes. Appellant insists that this is historically not true and that the job was previously limited to an office. Appellant insists that she was temporarily assigned to the loading dock to assist in a company audit. In any event, appellant was on a loading dock on August 12, 1998, when she reported experiencing yet another allergic reaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">{\u00b6 11} Appellant\u2019s physician, Dr. Gallagher, concluded that the most recent episode was the result of appellee\u2019s assigning appellant in an area that violated her medical work restrictions. On August 15, 1998, Dr. Gallagher sent appellee a letter advising it of her conclusions. The result of this letter, according to the deposition testimony of appellant\u2019s supervisor, was a company determination that there was nothing more appellee could do to accommodate appellant\u2019s restrictions and that, indeed, there was no existing position in the plant in which appellant could function. Appellee notified appellant that it was going to place her on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>layoff until such time as the medical condition requiring the imposition of work restrictions was alleviated.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">{\u00b6 12} Appellant never returned to appellee\u2019s employ. Instead, on May 25, 2001, she brought suit against appellee, alleging employment discrimination based on race and disability and retaliatory discharge. Appellee denied the allegations, and the matter proceeded to discovery. Following discovery, appellee moved for and was granted summary judgment on all counts. From this judgment, appellant now brings this appeal, setting forth the following single assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-6\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cThe trial court erred when it granted Lear\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Ms. Ferguson\u2019s claims of (A) race discrimination, (B) disability discrimination, and (C) retaliatory discharge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">{\u00b6 14} On review, appellate courts employ the same standard for summary judgment as do trial courts. <em>Lorain Natl. Bank v. Saratoga Apts. </em>(1989), 61 Ohio App.3d 127, 129, 572 N.E.2d 198. The motion may be granted only when it is demonstrated \u201c(1) that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact; (2) that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, who is entitled to have the evidence construed most strongly in his favor.\u201d <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 67, 8 O.O.3d 73, 375 N.E.2d 46; Civ.R. 56(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">{\u00b6 15} When seeking summary judgment, a party must specifically delineate the basis upon which the motion is brought, <em>Mitseff v. Wheeler </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 112, 526 N.E.2d 798, syllabus, and identify those portions of the record that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 293, 662 N.E.2d 264. When a properly supported motion for summary judgment is made, an adverse party may not rest on mere allegations or denials in the pleading but must respond with specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue of material fact. Civ.R. 56(E); <em>Riley v. Montgomery </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 75, 79, 11 OBR 319, 463 N.E.2d 1246.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">{\u00b6 16} The parties concur on the elements upon which a plaintiff must produce evidence to establish a prima facie case in each of the three claims appellant advances.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-10\">Racial Discrimination</p>\n<p id=\"b712-11\">{\u00b6 17} To make out a claim of race discrimination in employment, a plaintiff must prove that the employer acted with discriminatory intent. <em>Mauzy v. Kelly Services, Inc. </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 578, 583, 664 N.E.2d 1272. Proof of a discriminatory intent may be direct or indirect. Id. at paragraph one of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>syllabus. \u201cDirect\u201d proof \u201cmeans that a plaintiff may establish a prima facie case * * * by presenting evidence, of any nature, to show that the employer more likely than not was motivated by a discriminatory intent.\u201d Id. at 587, 664 N.E.2d 1272. Indirect proof involves the application of certain inferences and presumptions to conclude that when most common nondiscriminatory reasons for an employment action are eliminated, there is an inference of discriminatory intent. Id. at 583-584, 664 N.E.2d 1272. Such an inference arises when a plaintiff shows that (1) she is a racial minority; (2) she suffered an adverse employment action; (3) she was qualified for the position; and (4) a comparable, nonprotected person was treated more favorably. <em>Brewer v. Cleveland City Schools Bd. </em>(1997), 122 Ohio App.3d 378, 385, 701 N.E.2d 1023, applying <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green </em>(1973), 411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">{\u00b6 18} Appellee concedes that appellant, as an African-American, is a member of a racial minority and that she suffered an adverse employment action. The parties\u2019 dispute centers on the remaining two elements of the claim. Appellant insists that she was qualified for both the kitting job and the shipping-clerk position and that comparable white employees were awarded these jobs and/or allowed to continue working on layoff. Appellee maintains that appellant\u2019s medical restrictions made her unqualified for the kitting and shipping jobs and that, in any event, the comparable nonprotected persons who appellant contends were treated more favorably than she were not, in fact, comparably situated.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">{\u00b6 19} With respect to the kitting job, notwithstanding appellant\u2019s assertion that the \u201cMean Green\u201d aerosol cleaner used in that job is benign, appellant\u2019s own physician testified that working with such a product violated the medical work restrictions that the physician had issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">{\u00b6 20} Concerning the shipping position, the parties disagree as to whether the position did or did not require that such a clerk work among the fumes on the loading dock.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">{\u00b6 21} The pivotal question is whether appellant has shown that more favorably treated nonprotected employees were, indeed, comparable.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">{\u00b622} \u201c[T]he plaintiff must show that the \u2018comparables\u2019 are similarly-situated <em>in all </em>respects. Thus, to be deemed \u2018similarly-situated,\u2019 the individuals with whom the plaintiff seeks to compare [her] treatment must have dealt with the same supervisor, have been subject to the same standards and have engaged in the same conduct without such differentiating or mitigating circumstances that would distinguish their conduct or the employer\u2019s treatment of them for it. (Citation omitted and emphasis sic.)\u201d <em>Kroh v. Continental Gen. Tire, Inc. </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 30, 31, 748 N.E.2d 36, quoting <em>Mitchell v. Toledo Hosp. </em>(C.A.6, 1992), 964 F.2d 577, 583.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>(\u00b6 23} Appellant advances seven employees as \u201ccomparables.\u201d Two of these had weight restrictions on lifting and were accommodated by appellee by being assigned to light-duty jobs. Four of these apparently had no medical restrictions, but were Caucasian shipping clerks who were not laid off. The seventh \u201ccomparable\u201d is a woman who appellant claims was on medical restriction for an allergic reaction to PVC fumes and who was reassigned in accommodation to that restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">{\u00b6 24} In our view, the scope of appellant\u2019s medical restrictions is material as to whether other nonprotected employees were similarly situated and, therefore, valid comparables. Those employees who had weight restrictions or no restrictions are not similarly situated to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">{\u00b6 25} The facts advanced by appellant with respect to the remaining employee are simply not supported by the record. In her memorandum in opposition to summary judgment, appellant cites her own deposition testimony and appellant\u2019s response to interrogatories and requests for admission. Yet the only evidence provided by appellant in her own deposition was that \u201cyes, some girl was on restrictions to my knowledge.\u201d The interrogatories and admissions to which appellant cites contain only an admission that such a woman worked at Lear. The remaining questions, as to this employee\u2019s medical restrictions, were objected to on the ground of medical confidentiality and were not answered, pending a court ruling on the objection or an appropriate protective order. We find nothing in the record showing that such a ruling was made or such a protection order issued. As a result, this employee may not be used as a \u201ccomparable.\u201d Accordingly, appellant has failed to meet her burden to come forth with evidence that comparable nonprotected employees were treated more favorably and the trial court\u2019s award of summary judgment on this claim is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">Retaliatory Discharge</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">{\u00b626} For the elements of wrongful discharge, the parties rely on identical oft-quoted standards articulated in <em>Painter v. Graley </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 377, 639 N.E.2d 51, at fn. 8:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-9\">{\u00b6 27} \u201c* * * Ohio courts may find useful the analysis of Villanova Law Professor H. Perritt, who, based on review of cases throughout the country, has described the elements of the tort as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-10\">{\u00b6 28} \u201c 1. That clear public policy existed and was manifested in a state or federal constitution, statute or administrative regulation, or in the common law (the clarity element).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-11\">{\u00b6 29} \u201c \u20182. That dismissing employees under circumstances like those involved in the plaintiffs dismissal would jeopardize the public policy (the jeopardy element).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>{\u00b6 30} \u201c \u20183. The plaintiffs dismissal was motivated by conduct related to the public policy (the causation element).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-5\">{\u00b6 31} \u201c \u20184. The employer lacked overriding legitimate business justification for the dismissal (the overriding justification element).\u2019 (Emphasis sic.) H. Perritt, The Future of Wrongful Dismissal Claims: Where Does Employer Self Interest Lie? (1989), 58 U.Cin.L.Rev. 397, 398-399.\u201d See, also, <em>Collins v. Rizkana </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 65, 69-70, 652 N.E.2d 653; <em>Kulch v. Structural Fibers, Inc. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 134, 150-151, 677 N.E.2d 308.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">{\u00b6 32} The inclusion of this claim is somewhat perplexing. All of the cases cited relate to circumstances in which employees at will were discharged for reasons in violation of public policy. Employees at will may be terminated by an employer for any reason or for no reason. <em>Phung v. Waste Mgt., Inc. </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St.3d 100, 102, 23 OBR 260, 491 N.E.2d 1114, overruled on other grounds. <em>Kulch </em>at paragraph three of the syllabus. An exception to the employment-at-will doctrine was created in <em>Greeley v. Miami Valley Maintenance Contrs., Inc. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 228, 551 N.E.2d 981, which recognized a cause of action for a wrongful discharge in violation of public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">{\u00b6 33} Retaliatory discharge for an employee who has reported a workplace violation to OSHA is in violation of public policy. <em>Kulch, </em>supra, 78 Ohio St.3d at 151-152, 677 N.E.2d 308. Appellant insists that her layoff was in retaliation for her OSHA report.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">{\u00b6 34} Appellee denies this connection and points out that it was not even notified of an OSHA investigation until substantially after appellant was laid off. Appellant responds that appellee could have known because several days before she was laid off appellant told her Local UAW union president about the OSHA complaint. Since the union and management maintained regular communication, appellant insists that appellee could have discovered the OSHA complaint though that means.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">{\u00b6 35} Appellant\u2019s assertion is problematic in two respects. First, her reference to her union president, as well as other references throughout the record, suggested that appellant is a union member and presumably the beneficiary of a collective bargaining agreement. In other words, she is not an employee at will and, therefore, may not pursue a <em>Greeley </em>action. <em>Haynes v. Zoological Soc. of Cincinnati </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 254, 652 N.E.2d 948, syllabus. Moreover, although the causation element of a wrongful-discharge cause of action is ordinarily a question of fact, <em>Kulch, </em>78 Ohio St.3d at 151, 677 N.E.2d 308, appellant presented no evidence that appellee was even aware of her OSHA complaint when she was laid off. The scenario that appellant told someone who might have told someone in management is simply too tenuous a thread of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>communication to satisfy appellant\u2019s burden of coming forth with evidence pursuant to Civ.R. 56. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s award of summary judgment on appellant\u2019s wrongful-discharge claim must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Disability Discrimination</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">{\u00b6 36} Both the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d), Section 12112, Title 42, U.S.Code and R.C. 4112.02(A) prohibit employers from discriminating against employees who are disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">{\u00b6 37} The standards for establishing a prima facie case under either law are \u201cvirtually identical.\u201d <em>Sadinsky v. EBCO Mfg. Co. </em>(1999), 134 Ohio App.3d 54, 59, 730 N.E.2d 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cTo state a claim of disability discrimination under the ADA, a party must establish that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-9\">{\u00b6 39} \u201c \u2018* * * (1) He [or she] is an individual with a disability; (2) he [or she] is \u201cother-wise qualified\u201d to perform the job requirements, with or without reasonable accommodation; and (3) he [or she] was discharged solely by reason of his [or her] handicap.* * *\u2019 <em>Monette v. Electronic Data Systems Corp. </em>(C.A.6, 1996), 90 F.3d 1173, 1178. Similarly, to state a prima facie case of handicap discrimination under R.C. 4112.02(A), the party seeking relief must establish:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-10\">{\u00b6 40} \u201c \u2018* * * (1) That he or she was handicapped; (2) that an adverse employment action was taken by an employer, at least in part, because the individual was handicapped, and (3) that the person, though handicapped, can safely and substantially perform the essential functions of the job in question.* * *\u2019 <em>Columbus Civ. Serv. Comm. v. McGlone </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 569, 571, 697 N.E.2d 204.\u201d Id. at 58, 730 N.E.2d 395.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-11\">{\u00b6 41} The argument with respect to disability discrimination centers upon whether appellant is \u201cdisabled\u201d within the context of the ADA or R.C. 4112.02(A). Under both federal regulations and Ohio code, a \u201cdisability\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is an impairment, physical or mental, which substantially limits one or more of an individual\u2019s major life activities, a record of such impairment, or being regarded as one having such an impairment. Section 12102(2), Title 42, U.S.Code; Section 1630.2(k), Title 29, C.F.R.; R.C. 4112.01(A)(13); <em>Hart v. Columbus Dispatch, </em>10th Dist. No. 02AP-506, 2002-Ohio-6963, 2002 WL 31819705, \u00b6 24. \u201cWorking\u201d is statutorily recognized as a major life activity. R.C. 4112.01(A)(13).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-12\">{\u00b6 42} Appellee, citing <em>Maulding v. Sullivan </em>(C.A.8,1992), 961 F.2d 694, insists that, for an employee to be substantially limited in the activity of \u201cworking,\u201d he or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>she must be precluded from more than a particular job or the job of the employee\u2019s choosing. Moreover, citing <em>Wooten v. Farmland Foods </em>(C.A.8, 1995), 58 F.3d 382, appellee maintains that even an impairment that disqualifies an employee from only a range of jobs is not considered substantially limiting. Appellee insists that this means that to be substantially impaired in \u201cworking,\u201d one must be wholly unemployable in any capacity. According to appellee, because after leaving its employ appellant found other work, she could not be found to be substantially impaired in that category.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">{\u00b643} The cases appellee cites are either procedurally distinguishable or do not support the proposition appellant advances on their authority. <em>Maulding </em>is an appeal from a district court decision affirming a United States Merit System Protection Board factual finding that Maulding, a pharmacologist in the United States Department of Health and Human Services, failed to present adequate proof that her chemical allergy precluded her from laboratory work. As an alternate ground for affirmance, the appellate court approved the district court\u2019s observation that a major life activity is not substantially limited when an impairment interferes with the performance of only one particular job. <em>Mauld-ing </em>at 698.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">{\u00b6 44} This conclusion is echoed in <em>Wooten, </em>supra, quoting <em>Heilweil v. Mt. Sinai Hosp. </em>(C.A.2, 1994), 32 F.3d 718, 723, stating that \u201c[a]n impairment that disqualifies a person from only a narrow range of jobs is not considered a substantially limiting one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">{\u00b6 45} The present matter is distinguished from <em>Maulding </em>because that case was a review of a finding of fact following a hearing, whereas this case is before us on summary judgment. In summary judgment, the existence of a material question of fact precludes affirmance. Whether a plaintiff is substantially limited in a major life activity is generally a question of fact. <em>Hines v. Chrysler Corp. </em>(D.Colo.2002), 231 F.Supp.2d 1027, 1035. Moreover, an examination of these cases reveals a standard substantially narrower than appellee advances. There is a material difference between the proposition that exclusion from a single job or range of jobs is not substantially limiting and appellee\u2019s assertion that an employee must be precluded from all employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">{\u00b6 46} We also find it somewhat incongruous that appellee argues that the impairment of appellant\u2019s capacity to work is insufficient to qualify her as \u201cdisabled\u201d when appellee concedes that the restrictions arising from this impairment preclude her from any job in their factory. This strikes us as a material question that should be resolved by a trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">{\u00b6 47} Appellee advances a similar convoluted argument as to whether appellant was qualified for any position in the plant. Appellee is unqualified for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>\u201ckitting\u201d position or a clerk\u2019s position because both of those jobs would place her in contact with conditions that would violate her medical restrictions. Appellee seems to suggest that appellant is not disabled, but if she is, her disability disqualifies her from any job she might be otherwise qualified for in the plant. Again, this is the sort of assertion that should be tested by a trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">{\u00b6 48} Consequently, we conclude that a question of fact exists as to whether appellant is legally \u201cdisabled\u201d and qualified for a position and that question is material to whether appellee engaged in employment discrimination based on disability with respect to her. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s assignment of error with respect to disability discrimination is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">{\u00b6 49} On consideration whereof, the judgment of the Erie County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed in part and reversed in part. This matter is remanded to said court for further consideration consistent with this decision. Costs to appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Judgment reversed in part and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b718-7\">Peter M.

Ferguson apparently is unemployable only at a particular place\u2014Lear\u2019s injection molding plant\u2014a plant where she would be exposed to chemicals in contravention of her own physician\u2019s medical restrictions for her. I cannot find that because Ferguson is chemically sensitive and undisputedly unable to work at any job in Lear\u2019s Huron plant\u2014that she is \u201csubstantially limited\u201d in a major life activity. She is currently employed elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-11\">{\u00b6 51} Because I believe that the record shows that Ferguson\u2019s medical restrictions render her unqualified for any position at Lear\u2019s plant and that no material issues remain, I would affirm the trial court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment on all causes of action.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
