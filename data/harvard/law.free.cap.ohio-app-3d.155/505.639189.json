Extended Family Adult Care Center, was not entitled to the residuary of Edna S. Falter\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>{\u00b6 2} Falter died testate on April 6, 2000. Prior to her death, she drafted two wills. The second will, which is the subject of this dispute, was drafted on July-27, 1999. The document contained a clause that left the residuary of her estate to \u201cExtended Family Adult Care, Bellevue, Ohio.\u201d At the time of her death, Falter lived in an adult care facility with the registered trade name \u201cExtended Family Adult Care Center,\u201d which is located in Bellevue Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">{\u00b6 3} Upon Falter\u2019s death, separate applications were made regarding each of her two wills. Ultimately, the second will was admitted to probate. The executor and a beneficiary under the first will, Ann Beaston, subsequently filed a complaint, alleging (1) that the second will is invalid because the testator lacked testamentary capacity and was under undue pressure and influence and (2) that the residuary clause is invalid because \u201cExtended Family Adult Care\u201d is not a legal entity and thus lacks capacity to take under a will.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">{\u00b6 4} With the trial court\u2019s permission, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment regarding the validity of the will\u2019s residuary clause. The trial court entered summary judgment on behalf of Beaston, holding that \u201cExtended Family Adult Care,\u201d a nonregistered trade name, is not the same as \u201cExtended Family Adult Care <em>Center,\u201d </em>a registered trade name and legal entity. The trial court went on to find \u201cExtended Family Adult Care\u201d as named in Falter\u2019s will lacked capacity to take under the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">{\u00b6 5} Thereafter, this court reversed the judgment of the trial court, stating that there was a question of fact, or latent ambiguity, as to whether Falter intended to leave the residuary of her estate to \u201cExtended Family Adult Care Center\u201d but mistakenly gave the bequest to \u201cExtended Family Adult Care\u201d in her will. On November 18, 2002, a trial was held wherein a jury was instructed to determine whether Falter intended to leave the residuary of her estate to the place where she lived, \u201cExtended Family Adult Care,\u201d or to \u201cKaren Pelton dba Extended Family Adult Care Center.\u201d The jury found that Falter intended to leave the residuary of her estate to the place where she lived. Thereafter, the trial court determined that because a place cannot accept a bequest, the bequest was void, and therefore, the residuary would pass under the statutes of descent and distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">{\u00b6 6} Pelton now appeals, asserting seven assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">First Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">\u201cThe trial court erred in instructing the Jury that \u2018Extended Family Adult Care, Bellevue, Ohio is a place and not a business entity.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>Second Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">\u201cThe trial court erred in instructing the jury that the burden of proof is upon defendant-appellant to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that Edna S. Falter in her will of January 27, 1999, intended to benefit Karen Pelton doing business as or at Extended Family Adult Care Center.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Third Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">\u201cThe trial court erred in ordering defendant-appellant to present her case-in-chief before plaintiff-appellee presented her case-in-chief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">Fourth Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">\u201cThe trial court erred by submitting improper verdict forms to the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">Fifth Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b538-11\">\u201cThe trial court\u2019s judgment entry filed November 22, 2002 is contrary to law and is not sustained by the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-12\">Sixth Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b538-13\">\u201cThe trial court erred in denying defendant-appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-14\">Seventh Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b538-15\">\u201cThe trial court erred in denying defendant-appellant\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-16\">{\u00b6 7} The treatment of this case by Beaston, her supporters, and the trial court on remand seems to center around a statement we made in our previous decision in this case, <em>Beaston v. Slingwine </em>(Dec. 5, 2001), Seneca App. No. 13-01-23, 2001 WL 1545474. In that decision, we noted, \u201c[Ajppellant [Pelton] concedes that \u2018Extended Family Adult Care, Bellevue, Ohio,\u2019 as named in Ms. Falter\u2019s will, is not a business entity but, rather, merely the name of a place.\u201d Based on this statement, the stance of this declaratory judgment action took a turn down an unexpected path. However, in making this statement, it was not our intent to make a finding of fact, binding upon all subsequent proceedings as to an alleged dichotomy between the \u201cplace\u201d and the \u201cbusiness entity.\u201d Rather, we were merely trying to clarify, however inartfully, that the name \u201cExtended Family Adult Care\u201d is not actually the registered name of the business entity, \u201cExtended Family Adult Care Center.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-17\">{\u00b6 8} Regretfully, it seems that the use in our prior opinion of the phrase <em>\u201cKaren Pelton dba </em>Extended Family Adult Care Center\u201d rather than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>registered trade name of the business, \u201cExtended Family Adult Care Center\u201d created additional confusion on remand. In sum, the interjection of Karen Pelton\u2019s name appears to have turned a simple determination of whether \u201cExtended Family Adult Care\u201d is a misnomer for \u201cExtended Family Adult Care Center,\u201d into a question of whether Falter intended the residuary of her estate to go to the \u201cplace\u201d or to Karen Pelton. This is not the issue of fact to be tried in this case, and it was error to frame the instruction to the jury in those terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">{\u00b6 9} Contrary to the turn of events described above, we would now clarify that the question of fact to be determined by the jury is simply whether \u201cExtended Family Adult Care\u201d as written in Edna Falter\u2019s will is merely a misnomer for \u201cExtended Family Adult Care Center.\u201d In other words, if Edna Falter, in writing the words \u201cExtended Family Adult Care,\u201d actually intended to make her bequest to \u201cExtended Family Adult Care Center\u201d then the fact that this is a trade name for a business owned by Karen Pelton is irrelevant to the descriptive validity of the bequest, i.e., whether the bequest was described adequately enough to be valid.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">{\u00b6 10} Additionally, as there was a question as to who bore the burden of proof in the previous trial, we will address the burden of proof that will be applicable on remand. As stated in our previous opinion,</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">\u201c[A] gift will not fail where it is possible to show by means of admissible extrinsic evidence, or by the name used, that the beneficiary named in the will is a misnomer and that a legal entity, in this case the sole proprietorship, was the intended beneficiary.\u201d. <em>Beaston v. Slingwine, </em>Seneca App. No. 13-01-23; see, also, <em>Strickler v. Courtright </em>(1939), 63 Ohio App. 1, 5-6, 25 N.E.2d 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">(\u00b6 11} While Pelton argues that she should not have the burden of proof because she did not bring this action, the name in Falter\u2019s will does not accurately reflect the registered trade name of the business. Consequently, it will be incumbent upon Pelton to prove that \u201cExtended Family Adult Care\u201d was merely a misnomer for \u201cExtended Family Adult Care Center\u201d or the gift will fail. See <em>Kovar v. Kortan </em>(1965), 3 Ohio Misc. 63, 68-9, 32 O.O.2d 302, 209 N.E.2d 762 (allowing extrinsic evidence to show that although decedent named \u201cMarbetena Fathers of Depere, Wisconsin\u201d in his will, he intended to leave his bequest to \u201cNorbertine Fathers of DePere, Wisconsin\u201d); <em>McCormick v. Dunker </em>(1903), 14 Ohio C.D. 553, 1903 WL 548, affirmed 70 Ohio St. 490, 72 N.E. 1161 (finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>a bequest to a corporation erroneously named in a will, will not fail if it is possible to identify the corporation by extrinsic evidence); <em>Strickler, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">{\u00b6 12} Based on the foregoing, Pelton\u2019s assignments of error one through seven are sustained and the judgment of the trial court is reversed and remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b540-7\">Thomas F. Bryant, P.J., and Cupp, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b539-9\">. We note that even if the business entity is deemed to be described adequately the question of undue influence still remains. Moreover, the status and involvement of Karen Pelton in the business is obviously relevant to the issue of undue influence, should the case progress to that level.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
