ORS 166.270(2). He assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence found in his backpack following his arrest pursuant to an inventory policy that required police to inventory all property removed from a person before the person\u2019s belongings may be placed in secure storage at the police station. He contends that the inventory policy was unlawful in that it authorized police to search all closed containers, not just those designed for, or likely to hold, valuables. The state concedes that the policy is unlawful and that the trial court erred in denying the motion to suppress on that ground. We agree with defendant and accept the state\u2019s concession. <em>State v. Eldridge, </em>207 Or App 337, 341, 142 P3d 82 (2006) (inventory policy may not require search of all containers in an impounded vehicle regardless of whether the container is normally associated with holding valuables).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
