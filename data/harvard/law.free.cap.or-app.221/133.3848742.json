On appeal, defendant advances 15 assignments of error, one of which relates to the trial court\u2019s imposition of a consecutive sentence on the first-degree burglary conviction based on the court\u2019s own factual findings. The state concedes that the court erred in doing so. As explained below, we agree and accept the state\u2019s concession as to that assignment of error, but we reject defendant\u2019s other assignments without discussion. Accordingly, we remand for resentencing, but otherwise affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">At sentencing, the court ordered that the sentence on one of the first-degree burglary convictions be served consecutively to the sentences imposed on the robbery convictions, over defendant\u2019s objection that the imposition of a consecutive sentence requires factfinding by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">On appeal, defendant argues that the court erred in imposing a consecutive sentence on the basis of judicial fact-finding. After defendant submitted his brief, the Oregon Supreme Court decided <em>State v. Ice, </em>343 Or 248, 267, 170 P3d 1049 (2007), <em>cert granted, </em>_US _ , 128 S Ct 1657 (2008), in which it held that, to comply with the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution as interpreted by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 US 296, 124 S Ct 2531, 159 L Ed 2d 403 (2004), a trial court cannot impose a consecutive sentence without jury factfinding. In this case, the trial court made its own findings and imposed a consecutive sentence on the basis of those findings. Although the state insists that Zee was wrongly decided, it agrees that <em>Ice </em>currently controls the consecutive sentence issue in this case. The state concedes that, under <em>Ice, </em>defendant\u2019s contention regarding his consecutive sentence is correct. We agree with the parties that the trial court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">Remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
