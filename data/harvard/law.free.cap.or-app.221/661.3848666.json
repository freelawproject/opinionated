Provident issued plaintiff an overhead expense disability insurance policy. Plaintiff contends that the trial court erred in interpreting that policy to preclude coverage when plaintiff was not engaged in the practice of medicine. We disagree with the trial court\u2019s construction of the policy and reverse the entry of summary judgment in favor of Provident.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Plaintiff is a physician who specializes in the practice of urology. In 1986, plaintiff purchased an overhead expense disability insurance policy from Provident. By the terms of the policy, Provident promised plaintiff to \u201cpay benefits during a Period of Disability for Covered Overhead Expenses which accrue while you are totally disabled after the Elimination Period.\u201d The policy defined \u201cPeriod of Disability\u201d to include a period of \u201cTotal Disability (plus any Partial Disability which follows and for which benefits are paid).\u201d \u201cTotal Disability\u201d was defined, in turn, to mean</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-6\">\u201c* * * that due to Injuries or Sickness:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-7\">\u201c1. you are not able to perform the substantial and material duties of your occupation; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-8\">\u201c2. you are receiving care by a Physician which is appropriate for the condition causing the disability.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">\u201cPartial Disability\u201d means conditions where the insured is unable to perform one or more \u201csubstantial and material daily business duties,\u201d or unable to do \u201cusual daily business duties for as much time as it would normally take * * * to do them\u201d and is under the appropriate care of a physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-10\">In July 2004, plaintiff became totally disabled and ceased treating patients. He placed his medical license in retirement status and cancelled his medical malpractice insurance. Plaintiff hoped to recover from his disability, reactivate his medical license, and resume his practice. Accordingly, plaintiff continued to maintain his medical office, employing a part-time employee for the limited purposes of collecting accounts receivable, copying and mailing patient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>charts, paying bills, and storing financial and patient records.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">In April 2005, plaintiff made a claim for benefits under the policy for expenses incurred in maintaining his downsized medical practice. Provident accepted the claim and paid approximately six months of benefits. Thereafter, Provident declined farther payments on the basis that plaintiffs overhead expenses were not \u201ccovered overhead expenses\u201d as defined by the policy. Plaintiff then brought an action against Provident for breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">The parties\u2019 dispute concerns whether the office expenses were \u201ccovered overhead expenses.\u201d As defined by the policy, \u201ccovered overhead expenses\u201d are \u201citems of expense incurred by you which are usual and customary in the operation of your business or profession. They must be generally accepted as tax deductible business overhead expenses.\u201d The trial court concluded that the office expenses did not qualify as \u201ccovered overhead expenses\u201d because they were not \u201cincurred * * * in the operation of [plaintiffs] business or profession.\u201d To so qualify, the trial court reasoned, plaintiff must be \u201ccurrently active in the operation of a profession involving the medical practice of urology\u201d in order for the benefits to be payable. Because it concluded that plaintiff was not so engaged, the trial court entered summary judgment in favor of Provident.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">On appeal, plaintiff contends that \u201cthere are more facets to the operation of a urology practice than simply seeing patients,\u201d therefore, maintenance of his office for collections, billing, and storing patient files is part of the total operation of the business of his urology practice. Plaintiff adds that any ambiguity in the scope of covered expenses is to be resolved against the insurer. Conversely, Provident contends that plaintiffs business is \u201cpracticing medicine\u201d and because plaintiff is \u201cnot treating patients, performing] surgery, or conduct[ing] hospital rounds,\u201d he is not operating a business or profession for which benefits are owed under the terms of the policy. In Provident\u2019s view, plaintiff is essentially operating a collection agency, expenditures for which are not a payable benefit under the insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>Under the policy, plaintiff is entitled to benefits if he incurred \u201ccovered overhead expenses\u201d during a period of \u201ctotal disability.\u201d The parties do not dispute that plaintiff was totally disabled, as defined by the policy, during the period of the claim. Nor do they differ on whether the \u201citems of expenses\u201d here \u2014 the employee salaries, office rent and other costs of collecting accounts receivable, patient correspondence, and record keeping \u2014 are the types of expense that fit within the definition of \u201ccovered overhead expense\u201d under the policy. The policy specifically lists \u201cemployees\u2019 salaries,\u201d \u201crent,\u201d and \u201caccounting, billing and collection service fees\u201d as types of qualified overhead expenses. Those are the \u201citems of expense\u201d plaintiff incurred. The policy also lists specific items that are not included in the definition of \u201ccovered overhead expenses\u201d: certain salaries, additions to inventory, extraordinary expenses, more than proportionately shared overhead, overhead expenses reimbursable under another policy. Those excluded expenses are not the type of \u201citems of expense\u201d plaintiff incurred.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>Instead, the parties differ on whether costs associated with continuing plaintiffs business during a period of total disability were \u201citems of expense incurred * * * in the operation of [plaintiffs] business or profession\u201d and therefore were \u201ccovered overhead expenses\u201d under the policy. Plaintiff contends that those business continuation expenses are part of the \u201coperation of [plaintiffs] business or profession.\u201d Provident argues that plaintiff is not \u201coperating\u201d his business unless he is practicing medicine. However, Provident does not specify the types of expenses that could be incurred after an insured becomes totally disabled and still qualify as \u201ccovered overhead expenses\u201d under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">The interpretation of the meaning of \u201coperation of [a] business or profession\u201d is a question of law. <em>Hoffman Construction Co. v. Fred S. James &amp; </em>Co., 313 Or 464, 469, 836 P2d 703 (1992). The governing rule of the construction of an insurance agreement is to ascertain the intent of the parties. <em>Totten v. New York Life Ins. Co., </em>298 Or 765, 770, 696 P2d 1082 (1985). That analysis begins with the terms and conditions of the policy. If those terms are not defined in the policy, we look to their plain meaning. <em>Hoffman, </em>313 Or at 469-70. If, after reviewing the plain meaning in context, the term or terms are susceptible to more than one plausible interpretation, the policy will be construed against the drafter. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">We conclude that the plain meaning of \u201coperation of [a] business or profession\u201d in the context of the insurance policy includes performing actions to continue plaintiffs business, without regard to whether patients are still being treated. The meaning of \u201coperation\u201d is \u201c1 a * * * a doing or performing esp. of action: * * * b: a doing or performing of a practical work or of something involving practical application of principles or processes often experimentally or as part of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>series of actions.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int'l Dictionary </em>1581 (unabridged ed 2002) \u201cBusiness\u201d is defined as \u201c1 a (1) * * * purposeful activity : activity directed toward some end * * * (2): an activity engaged in as normal, logical, or inevitable and usu. extending over a considerable period of time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 302. Finally, \u201cprofession\u201d is defined as \u201c4 a: a calling requiring specialized knowledge and often long and intensive preparation * * <em>Id. </em>at 1811. Under those commonly understood definitions, business continuation activities are an \u201coperation\u201d in the sense that they are the performance of actions and the doing of practical work. The work is a \u201cbusiness\u201d or part of plaintiffs \u201cprofession\u201d because it is directed to some purposive end, the continuance of a professional practice, and because the billing and collection efforts continue normal activities that were part of plaintiffs professional practice. Thus, \u201ccovered overhead expenses\u201d includes those type of expenses incurred in the continuation of the business or profession of the disabled insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">The context of the rest of the policy supports an interpretation that \u201ccovered overhead expenses\u201d includes business continuation expenses of a disabled insured and not just more immediate expenses. There is no specific exclusion for business continuation expenses. Just as importantly, the policy contemplates the incurring of expenses by a disabled insured over a long period of time. First, the benefits do not start immediately after an insured becomes disabled. The policy provides that benefits are not payable for \u201cCovered Overhead Expenses which accrue during an Elimination Period.\u201d An \u201celimination period\u201d is the time of total disability that must elapse before benefits become payable. (The elimination period in plaintiffs policy was 90 days.) Second, the policy limits the monthly benefit to $10,000 and the maximum benefit to $120,000. It thus contemplates scenarios where benefits would be paid for a period of total disability that lasted a year or longer. Expenses for that length of time are likely to be those incurred to continue a business or profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Finally, if an exclusion were intended for expenses incurred while an insured physician was not licensed or covered by malpractice insurance, the policy could have plainly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>said so. Based on the text of the definition of \u201ccovered overhead expenses,\u201d the failure to exclude business continuation expenses from that definition, and the context of the remaining portions of the policy, we conclude that the policy required the payment of business continuation expenses as part of \u201ccovered overhead expenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">Nonetheless, Provident relies on <em>Richardson v. Guardian Life Ins. </em>Co., 161 Or App 615, 984 P2d 917, <em>rev den, </em>329 Or 553 (1999), to argue that the policy covers only overhead expenses incurred while \u201coperating a medical practice\u201d in the sense of \u201cexamining patients, performing surgeries, or making hospital rounds.\u201d However, we do not view <em>Richardson </em>as helpful to Provident\u2019s case because <em>Richardson </em>determined only that similar text in an overhead expense disability policy did not cover expenses incurred after a business was sold, expenses that obviously were not business <em>continuation </em>expenses.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">In <em>Richardson, </em>the plaintiff, a dentist and sole shareholder of his incorporated dentistry practice, brought an action against his insurer for nonpayment under two business overhead disability insurance policies. The policies provided coverage for regular business expenses \u201cincur [red] in the <em>conduct </em>of your business or profession\u201d in the event the plaintiff became disabled. <em>Id. </em>at 617 (emphasis added). \u201cTotal disability\u201d was defined as \u201cthe inability \u2018to perform the major duties of your occupation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 618.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">The plaintiffs health deteriorated to a point where he could no longer practice dentistry, so he sold his stock in the professional corporation to one of his dentist employees and agreed in the stock purchase agreement to pay one year of the overhead expenses of the business. The plaintiff then submitted a notice of disability claim to his insurer. After denial of the claim, plaintiff filed a breach of contract action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>against the insurer to recover, among other things, the overhead expenses he had agreed to pay on behalf of his business successor. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the insurer on the breach of contract claim, finding that the policy did not cover the plaintiffs claim for business overhead expenses because he was <em>not conducting a business </em>after the sale of his corporation. This court agreed, holding that the plaintiff \u201cdid not conduct a business or profession <em>after he sold his stock </em>and, therefore, the policies did not cover his payment of overhead expenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 623 (emphasis added). Notably, we did not decide whether the plaintiff conducted a business or profession after his disability and <em>before </em>he sold his stock, a situation more closely analogous to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">The determination of whether the plaintiff in <em>Richardson </em>was due benefits under his policies turned on the fact that he had sold his practice. The court concluded that he could not be \u201cconducting\u201d a business if he was no longer in that business. In contrast to the plaintiff in <em>Richardson, </em>plaintiff here still owns his medical practice and intends to continue it in the future. Thus, <em>Richardson </em>does not alter our conclusion that plaintiffs business continuation expenses were part of \u201ccovered overhead expenses\u201d under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Based on the above, we conclude that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to Provident and in determining that expenses incurred in the operation of plaintiffs business could not include business continuation expenses and must include only those expenses resulting from the treatment of patients. However, our finding of error does not imply any ultimate success in plaintiffs claim. Again, the policy defined \u201ccovered overhead expense\u201d as \u201citems of expense incurred by [the insured] which are <em>usual and customary </em>in the operation of [the insured\u2019s] business or profession.\u201d (Emphasis added.) As we have said, business continuation expenses are categorically the type of expenses that are \u201cincurred * * * in the operation of [a disabled insured\u2019s] business or profession.\u201d What is less clear is whether the incurring of business continuation expenses by plaintiff for a long period after his disability was \u201cusual and customary\u201d in the practice of urology, given his lack of recovery and the ongoing loss of patients to other physicians. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>factual issue was not decided in the summary judgment proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b711-4\"> The policy provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-5\">\u201cCovered Overhead Expense means items of expense incurred by you which are usual and customary in the operation of your business or profession.
