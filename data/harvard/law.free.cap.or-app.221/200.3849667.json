He was later paroled. In July 2003, the Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision notified petitioner that it had received a report that he had violated parole and that he had a right to a hearing. Petitioner waived his right to a hearing. The board revoked petitioner\u2019s parole and ordered a future disposition hearing. At the latter hearing, which took place in November 2003, the board denied rerelease, established a 58-month prison term, and set a parole release date of May 11, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Petitioner later requested that the board reconsider its revocation order; the board agreed to do so and, in May 2005, it held a revocation hearing. Following the hearing, the board issued an order affirming the revocation of petitioner\u2019s parole and his parole release date of May 11, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Petitioner sought judicial review of the board\u2019s May 2005 order, asserting that, by failing to hold a second future disposition hearing after petitioner\u2019s May 2005 revocation hearing, the board violated applicable statutes and rules and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. He also argued that the 58-month prison term established by the board violated the prohibition against disproportionate punishment in Article I, section 16, of the Oregon Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Petitioner has now notified this court that he was released on parole on May 11, 2008. <em>See </em>ORAP 8.45 (providing that, when a party to an appeal becomes aware of facts that probably render appeal moot, the party shall notify appellate court of those facts).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">Petitioner\u2019s petition for judicial review challenged only the aspects of the board\u2019s May 2005 order denying rerelease and setting a parole release date of May 11, 2008. Because petitioner has now been released on parole, his challenge is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">Petition for judicial review dismissed as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
