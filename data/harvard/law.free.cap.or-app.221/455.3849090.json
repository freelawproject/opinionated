J.</author>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">Defendant appeals a judgment of conviction for three counts of witness tampering. ORS 162.285. He assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for a judgment of acquittal, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to prove that defendant had tampered with a \u201cwitness in an official proceeding\u201d at the time his conduct occurred. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">The relevant facts are undisputed. Defendant was arrested for sexual abuse; the victim was his girlfriend\u2019s daughter. On December 24, while in custody, defendant telephoned his girlfriend. He told her that the victim was not permitted to play with his video games while he was in custody. Defendant called again on December 25 and told his girlfriend not to give the victim the Christmas gifts that defendant had bought for her. During another call, on December 26, defendant told his girlfriend that the victim would end up in a foster home if she persisted in her allegations of abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">On December 29, the victim testified before a grand jury regarding the allegations. Because the victim had agreed to testify, she was never subpoenaed. The grand jury returned an indictment against defendant for two counts of first-degree sexual abuse. On January 2, when defendant again called his girlfriend, the victim answered the telephone. Defendant said, \u201cI have enough on you to put,\u201d before being cut off.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">The state then charged defendant with four counts of tampering with a witness, one for each of those four phone calls. In its indictment, the state alleged that defendant \u201cdid unlawfully and knowingly attempt to induce [the victim], <em>a witness in an official proceeding, </em>to offer false testimony and withhold testimony unlawfully.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">The trial court consolidated the sexual abuse and witness tampering cases, and defendant was tried to the court. At the close of the state\u2019s evidence, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on all counts, which the trial court denied.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In his closing argument, defendant asserted that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>state had failed to prove what it had alleged with regard to the witness tampering charges \u2014 namely, that the victim was actually a witness at the time of the phone calls. The court acquitted defendant of the sexual abuse charges. Defendant, however, was convicted of three counts of tampering with a witness, relating to the December 25, December 26, and January 2 telephone calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">On appeal, defendant argues that his motion for a judgment of acquittal should have been granted because the state presented no evidence that the victim was a \u201cwitness in an official proceeding,\u201d as alleged in its indictment. Defendant contends that a person is not a \u201cwitness\u201d within the meaning of the witness tampering statute until he or she has testified or, at the least, has been subpoenaed to testify. At oral argument, defendant conceded that the victim was a witness within the meaning of the statute at the time of the January 2 call, which occurred three days after she testified before the grand jury. With regard to the two calls made before the victim\u2019s grand jury testimony, however, defendant maintains that the victim was not a witness at the time the calls were made, because she had yet to give testimony and had not received a subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The state responds that the scope of the term \u201cwitness,\u201d as used in the witness tampering statute, is broad enough to prohibit defendant\u2019s conduct. The state disagrees that a person is a witness only after he or she gives testimony. The state also disagrees that a person who has yet to testify must have been subpoenaed to be considered a \u201cwitness,\u201d because the statute says nothing about a subpoena. Further, the state notes, because the victim had voluntarily agreed to participate, a subpoena was unnecessary in this case; the state insists that the legislature intended such a person to be protected under the statute just as if he or she had been subpoenaed.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">In reviewing the denial of a motion for a judgment of acquittal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>the state to determine whether a rational trier of fact could have found the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Cunningham, </em>320 Or 47, 63, 880 P2d 431 (1994), <em>cert den, </em>514 US 1005 (1995). In this case, ORS 162.285(1) defines the relevant offense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-4\"><em>\u201cA </em>person commits the crime of tampering with a witness if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-5\">\u201c(a) The person knowingly induces or attempts to induce a witness or a person the person believes may be called as a witness in any official proceeding to offer false testimony or unlawfully withhold any testimony; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-6\">\u201c(b) The person knowingly induces or attempts to induce a witness to be absent from any official proceeding to which the person has been legally summoned.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">Defendant was convicted under paragraph (a) for conduct directed toward \u201ca witness in an official proceeding,\u201d as alleged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\"> To determine whether a rational trier of fact could have determined that defendant tampered with a \u201cwitness,\u201d we must construe the statute to ascertain the meaning of that term intended by the legislature that enacted it, employing the interpretive methodology described in <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). We first examine the text of the statute in its context and, if necessary, its legislative history and canons of statutory construction. <em>Id. </em>at 610-12. Prior construction of a statute by this court is always relevant to our analysis of the statute\u2019s text. <em>Waite v. Dempsey, </em>203 Or App 136, 141, 125 P3d 788 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">The statute provides no definition of the term \u201cwitness.\u201d Nor is a general definition of \u201cwitness\u201d included anywhere in the criminal code. In the absence of a statutory definition, we assume that the legislature intended words of common usage to have their ordinary meanings. <em>State v. Murray, </em>340 Or 599, 604, 136 P3d 10 (2006). We turn then to the dictionary definition of the term \u201cwitness.\u201d <em>See State v. Goddard, </em>178 Or App 538, 542, 37 P3d 1046, <em>rev den, </em>334 Or 121 (2002) (looking to the dictionary for the ordinary meaning of the statutory term \u201cto witness\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>Ordinarily, a \u201cwitness\u201d is \u201cone that gives evidence regarding matters of fact under inquiry; specif: one who testifies or is legally qualified to testify in a cause or to give evidence before a judicial tribunal or similar inquiry.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>2627 (unabridged ed 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">The term \u201cwitness,\u201d as used in ORS 162.285(l)(a), is modified by the phrase \u201cin any official proceeding.\u201d The statute defines \u201cofficial proceeding\u201d as \u201ca proceeding before any judicial, legislative or administrative body or officer, wherein sworn statements are received, and includes any referee, hearing examiner, commissioner, notary or other person taking sworn statements in connection with such proceedings.\u201d ORS 162.225(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Taken together, the ordinary meaning of the term \u201cwitness\u201d and the qualifying phrase \u201cin any official proceeding\u201d suggest that the legislature likely intended the term \u201cwitness,\u201d as it is used in ORS 162.285(l)(a), to mean a person who actually testifies <em>or </em>who is qualified to testify \u2014 and, presumably, has yet to do so \u2014 before a judicial, legislative, or administrative body or officer. The wording, by itself, does not appear to require \u2014 as defendant suggests \u2014 that the person either have actually testified or have been subpoenaed to testify. To the contrary, the statute provides that, to be guilty of witness tampering, a defendant must \u201cinduce! ] or attempt! ] to induce a witness * * * <em>to offer false testimony or unlawfully withhold any testimony.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) If a person is a witness only after he or she has given testimony, it would be an unusual scenario in which ORS 162.285(l)(a) would ever be violated by conduct directed at a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Context lends support to our reading of the phrase at issue. ORS 162.285(1)(b) also employs the noun \u201cwitness,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>and that paragraph prohibits a person from \u201cinducting] or attempt [ing] to induce a <em>witness </em>to be absent from any official proceeding <em>to which the person has been legally summoned\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) If the meaning of the term \u201cwitness\u201d is, as defendant asserts, a person who has been subpoenaed, the phrase \u201cto which the person has been legally summoned\u201d would be unnecessary. We are constrained \u201cnot * * * to omit what has been inserted,\u201d ORS 174.010, and, accordingly, we cannot simply ignore the legislature\u2019s inclusion of that phrase. There is no indication that the legislature intended the term \u201cwitness\u201d to have a different meaning in paragraph (a) than in paragraph (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">In that regard, the Supreme Court\u2019s construction of a similarly worded statute is instructive. In <em>State v. Maney, </em>297 Or 620, 688 P2d 63 (1984), the court addressed the meaning of the aggravated murder statute, which defines the offense as murder committed under, or accompanied by, any of a number of listed circumstances, including that the victim was \u201c[a] juror or witness in a criminal proceeding,\u201d ORS 163.095(2)(a)(E). The defendant argued that, to qualify as a \u201cwitness in a criminal proceeding,\u201d the victim must have actually testified or at least have been subpoenaed to testify. <em>Maney, </em>297 Or at 624. The court rejected that reading of the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 625. The court explained that the obvious purpose of the statute was to protect the criminal justice system. <em>Id. </em>at 624. According to the court,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-5\">\u201c[a] construction of this phrase to include someone who has not yet testified, but who, because of his or her knowledge of the crime is expected to do so, harmonizes with the broad legislative purpose to protect the criminal justice system. It is equally heinous (and perhaps more advantageous from a defendant\u2019s viewpoint) to murder someone with knowledge of the material facts of a crime, who is likely to be called to testify, before the person has the opportunity to do so. Such an interpretation is consonant with the legislative purpose to establish mandatory minimum sentences for murders which interfere with the effective operation of the criminal justice system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-6\">\u00ab\u2021 H&lt; \u2756 H*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-7\">\u201cWe reject [the] defendant\u2019s argument that one is not a \u2018witness\u2019 until one is served with a subpoena to testify in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>pending criminal proceeding. While the criminal code contains no general definition of \u2018witness,\u2019 several statutes relating to criminal trials suggest that the status of being a witness is <em>antecedent </em>to the process of being subpoenaed. ORS 136.555 defines \u2018subpoena\u2019 as \u2018[t]he process by which attendance of a witness before a court or magistrate is required.\u2019 ORS 136.557 authorizes a magistrate before whom an information is laid or complaint made to issue subpoenas for witnesses within the state. The Uniform Act to Secure Attendance of Witnesses from Without a State in Criminal Proceedings defines a witness under that act to \u2018include a person whose testimony is desired in any proceeding or investigation by a grand jury or in a criminal action, prosecution or proceeding.\u2019 ORS 136.623(1). Similarly, ORS 136.607 provides that persons deemed \u2018material witnesses\u2019 on behalf of the state can be required to give written undertakings to ensure that they will appear and testify at trial or before a grand jury. These statutes support our conclusion that the term \u2018witness in a criminal proceeding\u2019 includes someone who has not yet been subpoenaed, but whose testimony is desired in a criminal proceeding or a grand jury investigation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-4\"><em>Maney, </em>297 Or at 624-25 (footnotes omitted; emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Interestingly, in a footnote, the court noted the existence of the witness tampering statute at issue in this case and the fact that it prohibits tampering either with a \u201cwitness * * * in any official proceeding\u201d or a \u201cperson [the defendant] believes may be called as a witness in any official proceeding.\u201d The court suggested that the phrasing in that alternative fashion \u201ccould\u201d be the basis for an argument that \u201cwitness * * * in any official proceeding\u201d has a different meaning than the one the court derived from the aggravated murder statute, namely, that it refers only to a person who has actually testified or has been subpoenaed to testify. <em>Id. </em>at 625-26 n 7. Beyond suggesting the <em>possibility </em>of such an argument, however, the court expressed no opinion on that matter. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">In our view, the court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Maney </em>seems directly applicable to the construction of the nearly identical phrase in ORS 162.285(l)(a). In particular, the court\u2019s reliance on the definitions of the term \u201cwitness\u201d in other related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>statutes \u2014 statutes that, by the way, were in existence at the time that ORS 162.285(1)(a) was enacted and of which the legislature presumably was aware, <em>Stull v. Hoke, </em>326 Or 72, 79-80, 948 P2d 722 (1997) \u2014 would seem to be equally applicable to this case, leading to the conclusion that the legislature intended ORS 162.285 to apply to \u201csomeone who has not yet been subpoenaed, but whose testimony is desired\u201d in an official proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">The statute\u2019s legislative history supports that conclusion. ORS 162.285 was enacted in 1971 as part of the revision of the criminal code. The official commentary that accompanied the revision provides that \u201c[i]t is not a violation of [ORS 162.285] to persuade a witness to lawfully refuse to testify on grounds of personal privilege or to induce a witness to avoid <em>process </em>by leaving the jurisdiction of the court.\u201d Commentary to Criminal Law Revision Commission Proposed Oregon Criminal Code, Final Draft and Report \u00a7 203, 202 (July 1970) (emphasis in original). Had the legislature intended the term \u201cwitness\u201d to refer only to a person who has already testified, the legislature would not have stated that it does not violate the statute to \u201cpersuade a <em>witness </em>to lawfully <em>refuse to testify </em>on grounds of personal privilege.\u201d (Emphases added.) Similarly, had the legislature intended the term \u201cwitness\u201d to be a person who has already been served with process, the legislature would not have stated that it is not a violation of the statute for a person to \u201cinduce a <em>witness </em>to <em>avoid process </em>by leaving the jurisdiction of the court.\u201d (Emphases added.) Instead, it appears that the legislature intended the term to have its ordinary meaning, that is, to include a person whose testimony will be given in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">In short, we reject defendant\u2019s contention that the term \u201cwitness\u201d in ORS 162.285(1)(a) is limited to a person who either has already testified or has been subpoenaed to give testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Turning to the evidence in this case, the victim was a \u201cwitness\u201d at the time of the phone calls. Defendant placed those calls after he had been arrested and taken into custody on the basis of the victim\u2019s report of sexual abuse. For the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>state successfully to prosecute based on that report, the victim may desirably be requested to provide testimony regarding her allegations. Accordingly, the evidence provided by the state at trial was sufficient for a rational trier of fact to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had attempted to induce a \u201cwitness\u201d to either give false testimony or withhold testimony in an official proceeding. The trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b493-9\"> Defendant actually moved for a directed verdict. The trial court appears to have treated that motion as a motion for a judgment of acquittal and applied that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>standard. Neither party is making an issue of that on appeal. Because neither the parties nor the court appear to have been confused as to the legal issue presented, it is appropriate for us to treat defendant\u2019s motion as a motion for a judgment of acquittal. <em>See State v. Cho, </em>297 Or 195, 197 n 3, 681 P2d 1152 (1984) (so stating).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b495-10\"> Since the briefing and oral argument in this case, we have had the opportunity to construe ORS 162.285(1)(a) in <em>State v. </em>Bailey, 219 Or App 526, 183 P3d 232 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>(2008). The issue in that case was whether the defendant was guilty of tampering with a witness when he attempted to dissuade his stepdaughter, who knew that he had committed a theft, from filing a report with the police. <em>Id. </em>at 528. The defendant argued that he could not be convicted of tampering with a witness for conduct that occurred when no official proceeding was actually pending. <em>Id. </em>at 529. We rejected that argument, concluding that, because the legislature chose to include the phrase \u201cor a person the person believes may be called as a witness,\u201d the statute was broad enough to include potential future proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 533-34. In this case, the issue is whether defendant\u2019s conduct was directed toward \u201ca witness in an official proceeding.\u201d Consequently, the issue in this case is the meaning of the term \u201cwitness,\u201d which we did not construe in <em>Bailey.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
