We conclude that the board did not err in excluding those wages and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Employers are permitted under section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code to establish cafeteria plans, through which they can offer a variety of employee benefits, some with tax advantages. An employer\u2019s contributions to a cafeteria plan may be made pursuant to a salary reduction agreement, by which an employee agrees to contribute a portion of his or her salary on a pretax basis to pay for \u201cqualified\u201d benefits. For federal income tax purposes, salary reduction contributions are not actually or constructively received by the participant and are not considered wages; additionally, those sums are not subject to Social Security taxes (FICA) and federal unemployment taxes (FUTA). <em>See </em>26 USC \u00a7\u00a7 3121(a)(5)(G), 3306(b)(5)(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">In order for a participant in a cafeteria plan to avoid constructive receipt of taxable benefits for federal income tax purposes, the plan must offer an election, and, before the beginning of the plan year, the participant must elect the amounts and types of benefits to be received. After a participant has elected and begun to receive benefits under the plan, the plan may not allow the participant to revoke the benefit election during the period of coverage, except in certain limited circumstances. Treas Reg \u00a7 1.125-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Claimant worked for employer full time dining the fourth quarter of 2005 and the first three quarters of 2006, at an annual salary of $31,200. During that period, employer offered a cafeteria plan from which its employees could select certain taxable \u201ccash benefits\u201d and \u201cqualified\u201d nontaxable benefits. From the options available to him, claimant elected health insurance coverage \u2014 a \u201cqualified\u201d benefit. Over and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>above claimant\u2019s salary, employer paid one-half of claimant\u2019s personal health insurance premium and, with pretax dollars withheld from claimant\u2019s salary, employer paid the other half of claimant\u2019s premium and the premium for his family. Claimant and employer entered into a salary reduction agreement whereby claimant agreed to forgo the portion of his salary necessary to pay the insurance premium, and employer agreed to pay those dollars tax-free into the plan. During the plan year, claimant\u2019s election was irrevocable.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">For the period at issue, from claimant\u2019s biweekly check of $1,300 before taxes, employer withheld approximately $386 as claimant\u2019s pretax contribution to his health insurance premiums, for a total contribution of approximately $9,285. During that same period, employer contributed an additional $1,836 into the cafeteria plan over and above claimant\u2019s salary, for half of claimant\u2019s personal health insurance premiums. Both of those amounts were excluded from claimant\u2019s gross income for federal tax purposes and, hence, were tax-free.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Claimant lost his employment during 2006 and sought unemployment benefits. In calculating claimant\u2019s wages under ORS 657.105 for the purpose of determining his weekly benefit, the Employment Department (department) excluded the $9,285 paid by employer into the cafeteria plan, for a net base-year wage of $21,915.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Claimant requested a hearing, and an administrative law judge (ALJ) for the Office of Administrative Hearings affirmed the department\u2019s decision. The board, in turn, affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision, and claimant seeks judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">In determining whether the payments made by employer into the cafeteria plan on claimant\u2019s behalf should be treated as \u201cwages,\u201d we begin with the pertinent statutory provisions. ORS 657.105(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-8\">\u201cAs used in this chapter, unless the context requires otherwise, and subject to ORS 657.115 to 657.140, \u2018wages\u2019 means all remuneration for employment, including the cash value, as determined by the Director of the Employment Department under the regulations of the director, of all remuneration paid in any medium other than cash.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>Certain payments made by an employer are excluded from the definition of wages. ORS 657.115 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-4\">\u201c(1) \u2018Wages\u2019 does not include the amount of any payment made to, or on behalf of, an individual or any of the individual\u2019s dependents on account of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\">\u201c(c) Medical or hospitalization expenses in connection with sickness or accident disability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-6\">* * H; *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-7\">\u201c(2) For purposes of this section, <em>\u2018payment made\u2019 includes amounts paid by an employing unit for insurance or annuities or into a fund.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">(Emphasis added.) The department treated the amount withheld from claimant\u2019s wages pursuant to the salary reduction agreement and paid by employer into the cafeteria plan as an \u201camount [ ] paid by an employing unit for insurance,\u201d ORS 657.115(2), and excluded it from claimant\u2019s wages pursuant to ORS 657.115(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">Claimant challenges the board\u2019s determination as inconsistent with ORS 657.105 and ORS 657.115(2). Claimant complains that, although employer <em>technically </em>paid the funds into the cafeteria plan, it was claimant\u2019s money that employer used to make the payments, and the payments therefore do not constitute payments \u201cby an employing unit.\u201d In claimant\u2019s view, only payments that the employer makes with its own funds over and above the employee\u2019s regular salary are payments made \u201cby an employing unit\u201d for purposes of ORS 657.115(2). Claimant reasons, further, that the funds were his own because he retained the right to determine the payee and the amount of his cafeteria plan contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">The difficulty with claimant\u2019s reasoning is that, by virtue of claimant\u2019s election of benefits and salary reduction agreement, the amount of claimant\u2019s pretax contribution to the cafeteria plan was withheld from his salary with his permission. Those funds were not paid to claimant and he did not have or control them. He could make no changes in his election for the plan year. As claimant concedes, the payments to the cafeteria plan were, as a matter of fact, made by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>employer \u2014 not by claimant; accordingly, we conclude that they were payments made \u201cby an employing unit\u201d under the literal terms of the statute. We therefore affirm the board\u2019s determination that the $9,285 that employer withheld from claimant\u2019s wages and paid into the cafeteria plan for health insurance for claimant and his family in accordance with the salary reduction agreement must be deducted from claimant\u2019s total wages calculated under ORS 657.105.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b490-5\"> Fundamentally, amounts that are withheld from wages under a cafeteria plan are <em>not </em>amounts on which employers pay Social Security or unemployment taxes. To be consistent with that principle, the amounts that are withheld from wages under a cafeteria plan also should not be included in the calculation of wages for payment of unemployment benefits. Oregon\u2019s unemployment tax statutes bear this out. The definition of wages in ORS 657.115 applies to the calculation of unemployment taxes paid by employers, ORS 657.095, <em>and </em>to the calculation of unemployment benefits paid to employees, ORS 675.150. <em>See </em>ORS 657.105. Consequently, the wage used to calculate unemployment taxes is the same wage used to calculate unemployment benefits. Claimant\u2019s argument loses sight of this essential feature of cafeteria plans: amounts withheld from wages under such plans are not amounts on which unemployment taxes <em>or </em>benefits are calculated.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
