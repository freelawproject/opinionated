Defendant acknowledges that he did not preserve the asserted error in the trial court but contends that we should review it as error apparent on the face of the record. ORAP 5.45(1). As we explain, the asserted error is not reviewable because the legal point is not obvious; rather, it is reasonably in dispute. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The relevant facts are undisputed. Defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of attempted sexual abuse in the first degree, ORS 161.405 and ORS 163.427, and was sentenced to 60 months\u2019 probation. The conditions of probation included \u201cnot hav[ing] contact with male or female persons under the age of 14.\u201d The state subsequently sought an order revoking defendant\u2019s probation on the grounds that (1) defendant had had contact with minors, and (2) defendant was not benefitting from probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">At the probation revocation hearing, the trial court found that the state had failed to prove that defendant had been in contact with minors. However, the court found that defendant was \u201cnot benefitting from his probation.\u201d On that ground alone, the court concluded that defendant violated his probation, revoked probation, and sentenced him to the custody of the Department of Corrections.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">On appeal, defendant argues, for the first time, that, pursuant to OAR 213-010-0001, the court has authority to revoke probation only if it concludes that defendant violated a condition of probation or participated in new criminal activity. Because neither prerequisite was met here, defendant argues that the trial court erred in revoking his probation based only on its finding that defendant was not benefitting from probation. Defendant acknowledges that he failed to preserve that contention, but he urges this court to review it as plain error. ORAP 5.45(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">As a general rule, a claim of error must be preserved in the trial court to obtain our review. However, pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>ORAP 5.45(1), appellate courts have discretion to consider errors of law that are \u201capparent on the face of the record.\u201d For an error to be \u201capparent on the face of the record,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>plain error, the error must satisfy three criteria: (1) it must be an error of law; (2) it must be \u201capparent,\u201d meaning the legal point must be obvious, that is, \u201cnot reasonably in dispute\u201d; and (3) it must appear on the face of the record, meaning the court need not go outside the record or choose between competing inferences to identify the error. <em>State v. Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 355, 800 P2d 259 (1990). If those three criteria are satisfied, we must then determine whether to exercise our discretion to consider the error. <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 382, 823 P2d 956 (1991). That decision \u201cshould be made with utmost caution\u201d because reviewing unpreserved errors is \u201ccontrary to the strong policies requiring preservation and raising of error.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">Here, the parties\u2019 arguments focus on the second plain error requirement \u2014 whether the asserted error is \u201cobvious, not reasonably in dispute.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>310 Or at 355. Defendant posits that, pursuant to OAR 213-010-0001 and <em>State v. Buehler, </em>206 Or App 167, 136 P3d 64 (2006), it is obvious that the trial court erred in revoking his probation. According to defendant, \u201ca trial court\u2019s authority to revoke probation is contingent upon it first making a valid determination that the offender either violated a condition of his probation or participated in new criminal activity. Absent that initial determination, the trial court has no authority to revoke the offender\u2019s probation.\u201d (Citation omitted.) The state responds that the claimed error is not \u201cobvious\u201d because the proper construction of OAR 213-010-0001 is reasonably in dispute. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">OAR 213-010-0001 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-6\">\u201cThe decision to revoke probation is discretionary and may be exercised upon a finding that the offender has violated one or more of the conditions of probation, or that the offender has participated in new criminal activity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">According to defendant, the language of OAR 213-010-0001 is plain. To illustrate that point, defendant relies on <em>Buehler </em>in which we stated, \u201cOAR 213-010-0001 provides that a trial court may, in its discretion, revoke an offender\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>probation if it finds that the offender has either (1) violated the terms of his probation, or (2) participated in \u2018new criminal activity since being put on probation.\u201d 206 Or App at 171.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">In <em>Buehler, </em>however, as the state points out, the issue was not whether OAR 213-010-0001 precludes revocation of probation on any basis other than a violation of a condition of probation or participation in new criminal activity. In <em>Buehler, </em>the issue was whether the trial court\u2019s upward dispositional departure sentence was within the \u201cstatutory maximum,\u201d as that term is defined in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 US 296, 124 S Ct 2531, 159 L Ed 2d 403 (2004). The state argued that the \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d includes a \u201cprobationary sentence plus the six months\u2019 imprisonment and 24 months\u2019 post-prison supervision that a court is also authorized to impose should the court decide to revoke probation.\u201d <em>Buehler, </em>206 Or App at 170. It was in that context that we cited OAR 213-010-0001 to emphasize that \u201c[a] court\u2019s authority to revoke probation is therefore entirely contingent on the existence of facts that, by their nature, can occur only <em>after </em>the offender has already been sentenced to probation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 171 (emphasis in original). Based on that reasoning, we concluded that \u201cif the presumptive sentence is probation, then the relevant statutory maximum, as that term is defined in <em>Blakely, </em>is the appropriate period of probation, and nothing more.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, <em>Buehler </em>does not resolve to any extent \u2014 much less beyond reasonable dispute \u2014 the legal point raised here.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">In the state\u2019s view, OAR 213-010-0001 can reasonably be interpreted to grant the trial court discretion to revoke probation if it finds that the offender is not benefitting from probation, because the first clause of OAR 213-010-0001 indicates that \u201c[t]he decision to revoke probation is discretionary.\u201d Because OAR 213-010-0001 does not expressly indicate that the two grounds listed in the rule are the only grounds for revocation, the state argues that \u201cit is reasonable to read the rule as not prescribing the <em>exclusive </em>grounds for revocation but, instead, merely stating <em>permissive </em>grounds for revocation.\u201d (Emphases in original.) The state\u2019s reading of OAR 213-010-0001, regardless of whether it is ultimately correct or incorrect, is at least plausible.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>Another factor also suggests that the legal point at issue here is reasonably in dispute. Historically, a finding that a person is not benefitting from probation has been recognized as a basis for revoking probation. In <em>Barker v. Ireland, </em>238 Or 1, 4, 392 P2d 769 (1964), the Supreme Court explained, \u201cIt is not necessary to revocation that the person on probation be convicted of a new crime, but only that the trial judge be satisfied that the purposes of probation are not being served, or that the terms thereof have been violated.\u201d The reasoning in <em>Barker </em>appears to be based on the legislative intent <em>of former </em>ORS 137.550 (1963), <em>renumbered as </em>ORS 137.545 (1999).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Barker, </em>238 Or at 3-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">Although <em>Barker's </em>interpretation of <em>former </em>ORS 137.550 is not controlling, it is relevant in determining the meaning of OAR 213-010-0001.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, the legislature in approving OAR 213-010-0001 may have intended to supplement the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of <em>former </em>ORS 137.550 in <em>Barker </em>or may have intended to overrule it. That inquiry is not resolved by looking only at the text of OAR 213-010-0001. The concurrence dismisses <em>Barker </em>on the ground that it was decided under a statutory context that \u201cis different\u201d from the statutory context at play in this case. 221 Or App at 90 (Sercombe, J., concurring). The concurrence does not explain why the subsequent enactment of OAR 213-010-0001 makes the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Barker </em>a nullity. We need not make that determination here, where, in the context of an unpreserved claim of error, the question before us is whether the legal point raised is \u201cobvious,\u201d that is, \u201cnot reasonably in dispute.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>310 Or at 355. In that context, we conclude that <em>Barker </em>is further evidence of a reasonable dispute as to whether the trial court erred in revoking defendant\u2019s probation in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>We need not resolve whether the trial court was authorized to revoke defendant\u2019s probation based on its finding that defendant was not benefitting from probation. The question before us is only whether the legal point is open to reasonable dispute. Given that (1) defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Buehler </em>as controlling authority is misplaced; and (2) the state\u2019s contrary construction of OAR 213-010-0001, whether correct or incorrect, is reasonable, we conclude that there is a reasonable dispute whether the trial court\u2019s revocation in this case was error.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because the legal point raised is not obvious, the error, if any, is not plain and we therefore cannot review it.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b107-7\"> <em>Former </em>ORS 137.550 (1963) was also amended several times before it was renumbered in 1999. <em>See </em>Or Laws 1965, ch 346, \u00a7 2; Or Laws 1971, ch 743, \u00a7 326; Or Laws 1987, ch 908, \u00a7 1; Or Laws 1989, ch 790, \u00a7 17; Or Laws 1991, ch 196, \u00a7 2; Or Laws 1993, ch 14, \u00a7 12; Or Laws 1993, ch 581, \u00a7 2; Or Laws 1993, ch 680, \u00a7 17; Or Laws 1997, ch 313, \u00a7 11; Or Laws 1999, ch 614, \u00a7 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"Aa\"> OAR 213-010-0001 was adopted as <em>former </em>OAR 253-010-0001 by the State Sentencing Guidelines Board in 1988 and approved by the Legislative Assembly in 1989.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b108-7\"> After this case was submitted on the briefs, we asked the parties to file supplemental memoranda specifically addressing whether ORS 137.545(1) and (5)(b) limit the trial court\u2019s authority to revoke probation to only the circumstances in OAR 213-010-0001. Both ORS 137.545(1) and (5)(b) grant courts a considerable amount of discretion with respect to probation. ORS 137.545(1) grants courts discretion to determine the length of probation by setting the initial period of probation and discretion to continue or extend it, ORS 137.545(l)(a), and discretion to discharge probation \u201cat any time,\u201d ORS 137.545(l)(b). Likewise, ORS 137.545(5)(b) authorizes courts to impose sanctions after it has revoked probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">Defendant\u2019s response to our request sheds additional light on the inquiry at hand. Defendant acknowledges that neither ORS 137.545(1) nor (5)(b) limits a court\u2019s authority to revoke probation to only the circumstances in OAR 213-010-0001. Instead, defendant argues that other statutes \u2014 specifically, ORS 137.010(1) and ORS 137.540(6) \u2014 limit the court\u2019s authority to revoke probation to the circumstances in OAR 213-010-0001.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">ORS 137.010(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-10\">\u201cThe statutes that define offenses impose a duty upon the court having jurisdiction to pass sentence in accordance with this section or, for felonies committed on or after November 1, 1989, in accordance with rules of the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission unless otherwise specifically provided by law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-11\">ORS 137.540(6) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-12\">\u201cFailure to abide by all general and special conditions imposed by the court * * * may result in arrest, modification of conditions, revocation of probation or imposition of structured, intermediate sanctions in accordance with rules adopted under ORS 137.595.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-13\">We are not persuaded that either ORS 137.010(1) or ORS 137.540(6) conclusively limits the trial court\u2019s revocation authority to only OAR 213-010-0001. However, more importantly, defendant\u2019s response supports our ultimate conclusion that the legal point defendant raises is reasonably in dispute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b108-5\">SERCOMBE, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A8p\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The majority opinion concludes that any error in revoking defendant\u2019s probation was not plain because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>revocation authority of the trial court under OAR 213-010-0001 is not apparent and could be disputed. 221 Or App at 84. In my view, the rule indisputably confines the authority of the trial court to revoke probation to circumstances not present in this case. However, despite the trial court\u2019s error in exceeding its authority under the rule, the court should not exercise its discretion to reverse the probation revocation judgment. Defendant\u2019s failure to object to the state\u2019s motion to revoke probation because \u201cthe defendant is not benefitting from probation,\u201d likely affected the nature of the charges and the evidence presented at the probation violation hearing. It would not be just to allow defendant to contest the sanction or revocation because the proceedings were narrowed by his omission. Because of that, I would conclude that this is not a case in which the court properly should exercise its discretion to consider the plain error and, therefore, concur in affirming the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">On February 11, 2004, defendant was sentenced to 60 months\u2019 probation for his conviction of two counts of attempted sexual abuse in the first degree, ORS 163.427. His conditions of probation, among other restrictions, required defendant to take polygraph examinations \u201cearly in his intervention to properly plan his treatment regimen.\u201d The conditions also forbade defendant from having \u201ccontact with male or female persons under the age of 14\u201d and from engaging \u201cin activities that will bring him in close contact with children.\u201d More particularly, Condition 21 required:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-5\">\u201cThe offender will not frequent places where children or large numbers of people congregate, i.e., parks, playgrounds, schools, etc., until his actual range of deviant interest can be ascertained. This may be altered following the completion of the full disclosure polygraph procedure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Defendant was sanctioned with 60 days in jail in October 2004 because of an admitted violation of the conditions on associating with minors and his probation was continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">The current proceedings arose from claimed associations with children by defendant at the Salem transit mall. The state moved to show cause why defendant\u2019s probation should not be revoked because defendant \u201chad contact with minors\u201d and was \u201cnot benefitting from probation.\u201d There was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>indirect evidence at the hearing that defendant met with children. There was, however, uncontroverted evidence that defendant had not taken the polygraph examination required by his conditions of probation. Following presentation of the evidence, defendant\u2019s counsel argued that the \u201ccontact with minors\u201d charge was not proved and that defendant was employed and in a position to comply with his probation conditions. The trial court revoked the probation and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-4\">\u201c[W]hat bothers me the most is it appears to me [defendant\u2019s] attitude that he\u2019s always going to ask after the fact. If he had taken a full disclosure polygraph * * * he could have then asked, \u2018Can I work at the State Fair?\u2019 \u2018Can I go to the transit mall?\u2019 \u2018Can I ride the buses?\u2019 \u2018Can I be around 14-year-olds?\u2019 But you didn\u2019t do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-6\">\u201cAnd so my finding today is going to be, I\u2019m going to find that \u2014 based upon the fact that it is hearsay within hearsay, I\u2019m going to find that the State has not proven the contact with the minors, but I am going to find that [defendant] is not benefitting from his probation, based upon a preponderance of the evidence and the testimony here today, and the evidence in the file. Therefore, I\u2019m going to find him in violation of his probation on one count.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">Defendant argues in his appeal that the trial court erred in revoking his probation because of its finding that he was not benefitting from probation. Defendant contends that the trial court\u2019s authority to revoke probation is limited by OAR 213-010-0001, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-9\">\u201cThe decision to revoke probation is discretionary and may be exercised upon a finding that the offender has violated one or more of the conditions of probation, or that the offender has participated in new criminal activity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">Defendant reads the rule to state the only circumstances in which the court may exercise its discretion to revoke probation and not to include the circumstance of defendant\u2019s lack of benefitting from probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-11\">The state contends that this issue was not preserved under ORAP 5.45(1), which provides that \u201c[n]o matter claimed as error will be considered on appeal unless the claimed error was preserved in the lower court * * *, provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>that the appellate court may consider an error of law apparent on the face of the record.\u201d Defendant failed to object to the state\u2019s motion to revoke probation on the ground that he was not benefitting from probation and admits that the issue was not preserved. However, defendant contends that the error is apparent on the face of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">The majority correctly recites the test for plain error under <em>State v. Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 355, 800 P2d 259 (1990): (1) the error must be one \u201cof law\u201d; (2) it must be \u201cnot reasonably in dispute\u201d; and (3) it must appear on the face of the record. 221 Or App at 80-81. The trial court\u2019s error in failing to apply OAR 213-010-0001 is apparent from the record on review. But the majority concludes that the meaning of OAR 213-010-0001 is reasonably in dispute and, thus, that defendant is not aided by the plain error doctrine. The majority reasons that, because the rule does not \u201cexpressly indicate that the two grounds listed in the rule are the only grounds for revocation,\u201d it could mean that the grounds are permissive rather than exclusive in nature. 221 Or App at 82. Moreover, the majority cites case law upholding probation revocation for lack of benefit from probation, albeit under different statutes and rules. Those arguments create, according to the majority, a reasonable dispute about the meaning of the rule. 221 Or App at 83.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">I disagree with that conclusion. The meaning of the rule is plain \u2014 the only bases for revocation of probation are (1) a violation of the stated conditions of probation or (2) participation in new criminal activity. The court\u2019s past authority under superseded statutes and rules is irrelevant to our understanding of the meaning of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">The rule\u2019s effect is obvious from its text and context, as well as from statutes that authorize the rule and otherwise frame a trial judge\u2019s authority regarding probation decisions. Again, the text of OAR 213-010-0001 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-7\">\u201cThe decision to revoke probation is discretionary and may be exercised upon a finding that the offender has violated one or more of the conditions of probation, or that the offender has participated in new criminal activity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Asp\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>The sentence in the rule contains a single subject (\u201cthe decision to revoke probation\u201d) and two predicates (\u201cis discretionary\u201d and \u201cmay be exercised upon a finding\u201d). Both predicates describe the decision to revoke probation. It is apparent, then, that a decision to revoke probation may be exercised only when a finding is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">The state argues that the rule does not limit the discretion of the judge in the revocation of probation at all, but only states examples of the types of reasons that would justify that sanction. In other words, the state construes the rule as open-ended, allowing probation revocation for any reason, including the two reasons specified in the rule. That construction is plainly inconsistent with the text of the rule. Why require a finding in order to revoke probation if any determination will suffice? The requirement that a finding be made necessarily implies that something is to be determined. The only reasonable reading of the rule is that the necessary determinations are those stated in the rule itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Moreover, the reasons for revocation that are stated in the rule are not particular, but are very broad categories of reasons \u2014 failure to comply with any condition of probation and commission of any new crime. The rule does not state discrete justifications for revocation of probation as examples of an open-ended grouping, such as failure to remain in the state or possessing a firearm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The breadth of the categories of revocation justifications stated in the rule necessarily implies that those categories are intended to be exclusive in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">A reading of the rule as close-ended and confining of judicial discretion is consistent with statutes that authorize and limit judicial decisions about sentencing and probation. Both ORS 137.010(1) and ORS 137.120(2) confine judicial discretion to pass or impose sentence for a conviction of a felony \u201cin accordance with rules of the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission.\u201d OAR 213-010-0001 was adopted together with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>OAR 213-010-0002 to regulate judicial discretion in the making of probation revocation decisions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>State v. Hoffmeister, </em>164 Or App 192, 196-97, 990 P2d 910 (1999), we concluded that OAR 213-010-0002 limits the authority of a sentencing court to impose sanctions on offenders when probation is revoked, while also describing OAR 213-010-0001 as a limitation on judicial discretion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-4\">\u201cThe trial court retains the discretionary authority to revoke a probationary sentence for cause. OAR 213-010-0001. Similarly, the trial court retains limited authority to impose sanctions on offenders when probation is revoked. OAR 213-010-0002.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">We similarly described OAR 213-010-0001 as a limitation on judicial discretion to revoke probation in <em>State v. Buehler, </em>206 Or App 167, 136 P3d 64 (2006). As noted by the majority, <em>Buehler </em>did not decide the issue in this case \u2014 whether OAR 213-010-0001 confines judicial discretion to revoke probation to just the circumstances described in the rule. <em>Buehler </em>did decide, however, that OAR 213-010-0001 was a restriction on judicial discretion and that the rule narrowed revocation authority to be exercised based on \u201cthe existence of facts that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>by their nature, can occur only <em>after </em>the offender has already been sentenced to probation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 171 (emphasis in original). That view of OAR 213-010-0001 differs from the reading of the rule advanced by the state, that the rule codifies the unfettered discretionary authority of a trial court to revoke probation for any reason and on any set of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">The Legislative Assembly expressly made certain judicial decisions about probation discretionary and not contingent on predicate facts or determinations. A period of probation \u201cmay, in the discretion of the court, be continued or extended.\u201d ORS 137.545(1)(a). ORS 137.545(l)(b) allows discharge from probation by a court without any qualification of that authority. ORS 137.540(7) provides that the \u201ccourt may at any time modify the conditions of probation.\u201d By contrast, ORS 137.540(6) makes revocation of probation a consequence of \u201c[f]ailure to abide by all general and special conditions imposed by the court.\u201d That statutory context makes it more likely that OAR 213-010-0001 was intended to limit judicial discretion to revoke probation. That statutory context is different from the older and superseded statutes that provided bases for the court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Barker v. Ireland, </em>238 Or 1, 4, 392 P2d 769 (1964), that probation may be revoked if the trial judge is satisfied that \u201cthe purposes of probation are not being served.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Based on the text and context of the rule, I conclude that OAR 213-010-0001 plainly limits the exercise of judicial discretion in revoking probation and confines that discretion to the prerequisites stated in the rule. The trial court erred in revoking defendant\u2019s probation for a reason other than one allowed under OAR 213-010-0001. That error of law appears from the record and is not reasonably in dispute under ORAP 5.45. That conclusion, however, does not end the inquiry. Our consideration of plain error is itself discretionary and depends on, among other factors,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-6\">\u201cthe competing interests of the parties; the nature of the case; the gravity of the error; the ends of justice in the particular case; how the error came to the court\u2019s attention; and whether the policies behind the general rule requiring preservation of error have been served in the case in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>another way, i.e., whether the trial court was, in some manner, presented with both sides of the issue and given an opportunity to correct any error.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-4\"><em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 382 n 6, 823 P2d 956 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">The ends of justice would not be served in this case by reversal and remand for further revocation proceedings. The undisputed evidence below was that defendant had not complied with a condition of probation that he submit to polygraph examinations \u201cearly in his intervention to properly plan his treatment regimen.\u201d That violation had continued for 18 months by the time of the revocation hearing. The failure to take a polygraph examination prompted the trial court to conclude that the purposes of probation were not being served and to revoke probation. Were the court to consider the question again, that violation of probation would almost certainly prompt the same result. It does not serve the ends of justice to remand for an unnecessary hearing. <em>State v. Ramirez, </em>343 Or 505, 514, 173 P3d 817 (2007) <em>(Ailes </em>discretion should not be exercised to provide unnecessary hearing on remand). Moreover, had defendant objected to the state\u2019s motion to revoke probation because the purposes of probation were not being served, the violation of the polygraph condition could have been asserted as a basis for revocation of probation. Where defendant\u2019s own failure to object likely affected the scope of the proceedings and the record, it would not be just to allow defendant to avoid probation revocation because of deficiencies in the charges or the evidence to justify probation revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">For those reasons, I concur in affirming the judgment under review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b112-7\"> ORS 137.540(1) lists a number of mandatory conditions of probation that are imposed unless specifically deleted by the court, including requirements that the probationer \u201c[r]emain in the State of Oregon until written permission to leave is granted\u201d and \u201c[n]ot possess weapons, firearms or dangerous animals.\u201d ORS 137.540(1)(e), (L).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b113-6\"> OAR 213-010-0001 and OAR 213-010-0002 <em>(former </em>OAR 253-10-001 <em>and former </em>OAR 253-10-002) were adopted in 1988 by the State Sentencing Guidelines Board, a predecessor to the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission, as part of a package of rules on the implementation of the sentencing guidelines. The rules were approved by the Legislative Assembly. Or Laws 1989, ch 790.
