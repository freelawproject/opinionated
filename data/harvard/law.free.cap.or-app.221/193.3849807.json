We agree with defendant that the trial court erred in denying the motion for judgment of acquittal and reverse the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">As pertinent to the issue that we address on appeal, the facts are not in dispute. Defendant and Boehme have a two-year-old son, T, who was sitting in his car seat asleep in the back seat of Boehme\u2019s car while the car was stopped in the parking lot of a bar. Boehme was in the driver\u2019s seat, and defendant was outside of the car, arguing with Boehme. Defendant struck the driver\u2019s side front window, causing it to shatter. Glass scattered throughout the car. T remained asleep. A police officer came to the scene to investigate. By that time, T was awake. As the officer was checking on T, T pointed to a \u201cvery tiny\u201d cut and a few drops of blood on his left arm and said, \u201cOwie.\u201d He also pointed to his left foot and again said, \u201cOwie.\u201d The officer noticed a small puncture mark and a drop of smeared blood at that spot.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">As a result of the above-described incident, defendant was charged with assault in the third degree, which is established by \u201cintentionally or knowingly causfing] physical injury to a child 10 years of age or younger.\u201d ORS 163.165(1)(h). ORS 161.015(7) defines \u201cphysical injury\u201d as \u201cimpairment of physical condition or substantial pain.\u201d Defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal, contending that the state had failed to establish the element of physical injury to T. The trial court denied the motion, explaining that \u201cit\u2019s pretty obvious that the child thought he was in substantial pain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">On appeal, defendant once again asserts that the state\u2019s evidence was insufficient to establish physical injury. We agree with defendant that, even assuming that T\u2019s pointing out his \u201cowies\u201d was an indication of pain, there is no evidence that the pain was of a sufficient degree or duration to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>be \u201csubstantial.\u201d Nor is there any basis to infer from the description of the wounds that they caused substantial pain. <em>State v. Poole, </em>175 Or App 258, 261, 28 P3d 643 (2001). The state does not contend on appeal that T\u2019s injuries resulted in impairment of T\u2019s physical condition. Because we conclude that the state has not shown that the victim suffered substantial pain, we hold that the state has not established the element of \u201cphysical injury.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
