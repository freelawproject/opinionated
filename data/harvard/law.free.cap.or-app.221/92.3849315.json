We write to address only petitioner\u2019s contention that trial counsel was inadequate by failing to object to the imposition of consecutive sentences on the ground that the principles announced in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 US 466, 120 S Ct 2348, 147 L Ed 2d 435 (2000), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 US 296, 124 S Ct 2531, 159 L Ed 2d 403 (2004), apply to consecutive sentences. We reject petitioner\u2019s remaining contentions without discussion. We conclude that petitioner failed to demonstrate that trial counsel, exercising reasonable professional skill and judgment at the time of sentencing, would have objected to the court\u2019s imposition of consecutive sentences on <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely </em>grounds. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">The relevant facts are undisputed. Petitioner was charged with five counts of sodomy in the first degree and two counts of sexual abuse in the first degree for conduct involving two victims. Pursuant to a plea agreement, petitioner pleaded guilty to four counts of sodomy in the first degree and one count of sexual abuse in the first degree, and the remaining charges were dismissed. On October 7, 2004, the trial court imposed consecutive sentences of 100 months on each of the sodomy convictions and a concurrent sentence of 75 months on the sexual abuse conviction. The court imposed the consecutive sentences based on its own findings \u2014 specifically, the court reasoned that \u201c[g]iven the age of the victims, their vulnerability and the long-time damage caused by [petitioner\u2019s] behavior,\u201d consecutive sentences were appropriate under ORS 137.123(5)(a) and (b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel did not object to the imposition of consecutive sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>Prior to sentencing in this case, the United States Supreme Court had decided <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely. </em>In <em>Apprendi, </em>the Court held that, other than the fact of a prior conviction, any unadmitted fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the legislatively prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Later, in <em>Blakely, </em>the Court held that \u201cexceptional\u201d sentences \u2014 the equivalent of Oregon\u2019s departure sentences \u2014 based on judicial findings of fact required to impose a sentence outside of the presumptive range established by state sentencing guidelines ran afoul of the rule announced in <em>Apprendi. </em>Neither case involved consecutive sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">In October 2007 \u2014 three years after sentencing in this case \u2014 the Oregon Supreme Court addressed the application of <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely </em>to consecutive sentences. In <em>State v. Ice, </em>343 Or 248, 170 P3d 1049 (2007), <em>cert granted, </em>_US_, 128 S Ct 1657 (2008), the court held that the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial entitles a criminal defendant to a jury finding regarding the factual predicate for the imposition of consecutive sentences. After <em>Ice, </em>it is now apparent that the imposition of consecutive sentences in this case \u2014 based on judicial factfinding \u2014 was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Petitioner sought post-conviction relief, arguing, among other things, that trial counsel was constitutionally inadequate at sentencing for failing to object to the imposition of consecutive sentences on <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely </em>grounds. The post-conviction court denied relief. On appeal, petitioner contends that, because the Court had decided <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely </em>at the time of sentencing, \u201c[a]ny defense attorney at that time should have been aware of the potential application of <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely, </em>and should have raised it whenever an enhanced sentence was imposed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">In order for petitioner to prevail on his argument, it is not sufficient for petitioner to show that the imposition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>consecutive sentences would be erroneous under the law as it currently stands. Rather, to prove inadequate assistance of counsel under Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution, petitioner must establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, facts demonstrating that trial counsel failed to exercise reasonable professional skill and judgment based on the law at the time of sentencing and that counsel\u2019s failure had a tendency to affect the result of the criminal trial, that is, that petitioner suffered prejudice as a result. <em>Burdge v. Palmateer, </em>338 Or 490, 492, 112 P3d 320 (2005). The Sixth Amendment requires a similar showing. Under the Sixth Amendment, petitioner must establish that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficient performance caused actual prejudice to the defense. <em>Strickland v. </em>Washington, 466 US 668, 687-88, 104 S Ct 2052, 80 L Ed 2d 674 (1984). Under both the state and federal constitutions, a petitioner who has pleaded guilty to the underlying criminal charges must establish prejudice by showing \u201c \u2018that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, [the petitioner] would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Saroian v. State of Oregon, </em>154 Or App 112, 117, 961 P2d 252 (1998) (quoting <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 US 52, 59, 106 S Ct 366, 88 L Ed 2d 203 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">We recently explained that standard in <em>Buffa v. Belleque, </em>214 Or App 39, 42, 162 P3d 376, <em>rev den, </em>343 Or 690 (2007):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-5\">\u201cIf a lawyer exercising reasonable professional skill and judgment would have recognized such an issue and would have concluded under the circumstances that the benefits of raising it outweighed the risks of doing so, failing to raise the issue may constitute inadequate assistance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-6\"><em>(Citing Burdge, </em>338 Or at 498.) \u201cReasonable professional skill and judgment\u201d can be described only generally; counsel must be prepared on the law to the extent appropriate for the nature and complexity of the case but \u201cneed not, however, expend time and energy uselessly or for negligible potential benefit.\u201d <em>Burdge, </em>338 Or at 493 (citing <em>Krummacher v. Gierloff, </em>290 Or 867, 874-75, 627 P2d 458 (1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">Applying that standard to the facts of this case, we must determine whether trial counsel exercised \u201creasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>professional skill and judgment\u201d in failing to object to the imposition of consecutive sentences. That inquiry turns on the state of the law at the time of sentencing. Accordingly, we start by briefly outlining the development of the relevant case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">As discussed above, the United States Supreme Court decided <em>Apprendi </em>in June 2000 and <em>Blakely </em>in Jume 2004. To date, the Court has not addressed whether the principles announced in <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely </em>apply to limit judicial factfinding in the imposition of consecutive sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Oregon appellate courts first addressed, albeit only tangentially, the application of <em>Apprendi </em>principles to consecutive sentences on November 10, 2004 \u2014 approximately five months after <em>Blakely </em>was decided. <em>State v. Fuerte-Coria, </em>196 Or App 170, 100 P3d 773 (2004), <em>rev den, </em>338 Or 16 (2005). In <em>Fuerte-Coria, </em>the defendant argued for the first time on appeal that the imposition of consecutive sentences based on judicial findings under ORS 137.123(5) was unconstitutional under the principles announced in <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely. </em>In rejecting the defendant\u2019s argument that the imposition of consecutive sentences constituted plain error under ORAP 5.45(1), we stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-6\">\u201cNeither <em>[Apprendi </em>or <em>Blakely], </em>however, involved consecutive sentencing. Indeed, defendant identifies no reported decision in which any court has extended Apprendi\u2019s or <em>Blakely\u2019s </em>reasoning to invalidate a consecutive sentence. To the contrary, as the state points out, several courts have rejected the proposition that defendant now urges. In all events, given that <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely </em>addressed the imposition of single sentences that exceeded the statutorily prescribed maximum for particular crimes, and because making a sentence for one crime consecutive to a sentence for a different crime does not implicate the \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 for either crime in any obvious way, any extension of <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely </em>to consecutive sentencing is, at best, \u2018reasonably in dispute.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-7\"><em>Fuerte-Coria, </em>196 Or App at 174 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">We reached the merits of that issue approximately two years later \u2014 on December 20, 2006 \u2014 in <em>State v. Tanner, </em>210 Or App 70, 150 P3d 31 (2006), <em>vac\u2019d and rent\u2019d, </em>343 Or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>554, 173 P3d 831 (2007). In <em>Tanner, </em>the defendant argued that the imposition of consecutive sentences based on judicial factfinding was unconstitutional under the principles announced in <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely. </em>In noting that the issue was a matter of first impression in Oregon, a majority of this court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument, concluding that \u201calthough the [United States Supreme] Court might in the future extend the Sixth Amendment rule of law announced in <em>Apprendi </em>to factfinding relating to whether a defendant will serve sentences consecutively, we are not presently persuaded that the Sixth Amendment requires such factfinding to be made by a jury.\u201d <em>Tanner, </em>210 Or App at 87-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">The majority in <em>Tanner </em>recognized that other courts throughout the nation have wrestled with the issue of whether the principles of <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely </em>apply to the imposition of consecutive sentences and have reached different results. The majority discussed three of those cases in detail. First, in <em>State v. Foster, </em>109 Oh St 3d 1, 845 NE2d 470, <em>cert den, </em>549 US 979 (2006), a case relied upon by the defendant, the Ohio Supreme Court held that judicial factfinding required under Ohio law for imposition of consecutive sentences ran afoul of the rule announced in <em>Apprendi. Tanner, </em>210 Or App at 80-82. The remaining two cases, <em>State v. Cubias, </em>155 Wash 2d 549, 120 P3d 929 (2005), and <em>People v. Wagener, </em>196 Ill 2d 269, 752 NE2d 430, <em>cert den, </em>534 US 1011 (2001), reached the opposite conclusion, refusing to apply the principles of <em>Apprendi </em>to the imposition of consecutive sentences. <em>Tanner, </em>210 Or App at 82-85. Ultimately, the majority in <em>Tanner </em>agreed with the majority of courts that had considered the issue, stating,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-5\">\u201cIn sum, a number of jurisdictions have grappled with the issue presented here and, while all have considered the implications that <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely </em>may have on judicial factfinding in support of consecutive sentences, all but one have declined to extend the rule of law from <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely </em>into this context, generally on the ground that <em>the Apprendi </em>Court itself appeared to indicate that the rule was inapplicable to multiple sentences.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>The dissent in <em>Tanner, </em>while fully appreciating the authority contrary to its position, would have concluded that the principles in <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely </em>preclude the imposition of consecutive sentences based on judicial factfinding. <em>See id. </em>at 88, 93-99 (Haselton, J., dissenting) (thoroughly discussing decisions from other jurisdictions and concluding that courts from jurisdictions with consecutive sentencing laws similar to Oregon\u2019s are divided on the issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">While review of <em>Tanner </em>was pending in the Oregon Supreme Court, the court decided <em>Ice </em>on October 11, 2007. In <em>Ice, </em>the trial court made a number of findings, over the defendant\u2019s express Apprendi-based objections, to support the imposition of consecutive sentences. The Supreme Court held that the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial entitles a defendant to a jury finding regarding the factual predicate for ordering the imposition of consecutive sentences. 343 Or at 265-66. It explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-5\">\u201cUnder [ORS 137.123], the maximum aggregate sentence that may be imposed, based solely on the jury\u2019s verdicts and without judicial factfinding, when a defendant is convicted of multiple offenses, assumes that all the sentences run concurrently. But, under the same statutes, additional fact-<em>finding </em>\u2014 judicial factfinding \u2014 is required to justify consecutive sentencing. Under that arrangement, a consecutive sentence necessarily \u2018expose[s] the defendant to a greater punishment than that authorized by the jury\u2019s guilty verdict,\u2019 <em>Apprendi, </em>530 US at 494, based on judicial factfinding, and thereby violates the principles discussed in <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-6\"><em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted; emphasis in original). In so holding, the court acknowledged that most courts from other jurisdictions that have considered the issue have reached a different conclusion. <em>Id. </em>at 266.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">The dissent in Ice described the state of the law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-8\">\u201cNot only is the majority\u2019s decision today at odds with the holdings and reasoning of the [United States] Supreme Court\u2019s cases, but it is out of line with the clear weight of authority. In states that require factual findings as a predicate to imposing consecutive sentences, almost every court that has considered the issue has held that <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply to the decision to impose consecutive sentences. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>Specifically, the courts in Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota, New Jersey, and Tennessee have held that <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply to the decision whether to impose consecutive sentences. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-4\">\u201cTo be sure, there is a split among the states that have considered this recurring issue of federal law * * *. One other state has held, as the majority does, that <em>Apprendi </em>applies in this context, <em>State v. Foster, </em>109 Ohio St 3d 1, 845 NE2d 470 (2006), and another state\u2019s decisions provide mixed support for the majority\u2019s decision. <em>Compare State v. Cubias, </em>155 Wn 2d 549, 120 P3d 929 (2005) (holding that <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply to a factual prerequisite to imposing consecutive sentences), <em>with In re VanDelft, </em>158 Wn 2d 731, 147 P3d 573 (2006) (holding that <em>Apprendi </em>does apply to a factual prerequisite to imposing consecutive sentences). Although the majority can count at least one and perhaps two states in its corner, <em>the overwhelming number of state courts (and federal courts considering the constitutionality of state sentencing statutes) have held that Apprendi does not apply to the decision to impose consecutive sentences.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">343 Or at 273-74 (Kistler, J., dissenting) (footnotes omitted; emphasis added). The United States Supreme Court granted <em>certiorari </em>in <em>Ice </em>on March 17, 2008, but has not yet issued a decision in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">With that understanding in mind, we return to the facts of this case. Here, petitioner, pursuant to a plea agreement, waived his right to a jury trial and pleaded guilty to four counts of sodomy in the first degree and one count of sexual abuse in the first degree in exchange for dismissal of the remaining charges. Sentencing occurred on October 7, 2004 \u2014 after <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely </em>but before <em>Fuerte-Coria, Tanner, </em>and <em>Ice. </em>The question is whether, based on the state of the law at the time of sentencing, trial counsel failed to exercise reasonable professional skill and judgment by not objecting to judicial factfinding in the imposition of consecutive sentences. In that respect, counsel was constitutionally inadequate only if we can affirmatively say that trial counsel exercising reasonable professional skill and judgment would have recognized the possible extension of <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely </em>principles to the imposition of consecutive sentences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>under ORS 137.123(5) and would have concluded that there was merit in raising such an argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">For the following reasons, we conclude that trial counsel, exercising reasonable skill and judgment, may well have not seen the possible extension of <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely </em>to the imposition of consecutive sentences or could well have concluded that such an argument lacked merit. First, at the time of sentencing, there was a lack of authority for the argument that petitioner urges on post-conviction review. At the time of sentencing, Oregon appellate courts had not yet addressed whether the principles of <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely </em>applied to judicial factfinding in the imposition of consecutive sentences under ORS 137.123(5). Additionally, no reported decision from other jurisdictions had extended the rule of law from <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely </em>into this context. In fact, as our previous discussion demonstrates, most courts \u2014 both at that time and later \u2014 have rejected the argument that petitioner urges counsel should have made.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Second, it was not apparent at the time of sentencing that <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely </em>applied to consecutive sentences. Neither <em>Apprendi </em>nor <em>Blakely </em>involved a challenge to consecutive sentencing. As we later explained in <em>Fuerte-Coria, \u2018Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely </em>addressed the imposition <em>of </em>single sentences that exceeded the statutorily prescribed maximum for particular crimes,\u201d and \u201cmaking a sentence for one crime consecutive to a sentence for a different crime does not implicate the \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 for either crime in any obvious way.\u201d 196 Or App at 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Lastly, we cannot assume that because trial counsel in <em>Ice </em>accurately anticipated the Supreme Court\u2019s extension of <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely </em>to consecutive sentencing, any lawyer exercising reasonable professional skill and judgment would have done the same. Reasonable skilled counsel can reach different conclusions on such issues. <em>Buffa, </em>214 Or App at 45 n 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">In sum, petitioner failed to demonstrate that trial counsel, exercising reasonable professional skill and judgment at the time of sentencing, would have objected to the court\u2019s imposition of consecutive sentences on <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely </em>grounds. <em>See also Krieg v. Belleque, </em>221 Or App 36, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>188 P3d 413 (2008) (post-conviction petitioner\u2019s criminal trial and appellate counsel were not constitutionally inadequate by reason of failing to challenge consecutive sentences on Sixth Amendment grounds). Accordingly, we need not address the prejudice prong of the inadequate assistance test.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b118-6\"> ORS 137.123(5) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-7\">\u201cThe court has discretion to impose consecutive terms of imprisonment for separate convictions arising out of a continuous and uninterrupted course of conduct only if the court finds:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-8\">\u201c(a) That the criminal offense for which a consecutive sentence is contemplated was not merely an incidental violation of a separate statutory provision in the course of the commission of a more serious crime but rather was an indication of defendant\u2019s willingness to commit more than one criminal offense; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>\u201c(b) The criminal offense for which a consecutive sentence is contemplated caused or created a risk of causing greater or qualitatively different loss, injury or harm to the victim or caused or created a risk of causing loss, injury or harm to a different victim than was caused or threatened by the other offense or offenses committed during a continuous and uninterrupted course of conduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
