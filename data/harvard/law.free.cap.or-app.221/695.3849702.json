On one count, defendant was convicted on the theory that he had previously been convicted of assaulting the victim, ORS 163.160(3)(a); on the other count, defendant was convicted on the theory that he had previously been convicted at least three times of assaults involving domestic violence, ORS 163.160(3)(b). On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erred in failing to merge his convictions into a single conviction for felony fourth-degree assault. He acknowledges that he did not preserve that claim of error below but urges this court to review it as error apparent on the face of the record, ORAP 5.45(1). We agree with defendant that the trial court committed error apparent on the face of the record in failing to merge the convictions and, for the reasons expressed in <em>State v. Orobio-Juan, </em>220 Or App 446, 447-48, 186 P3d 326 (2008), exercise our discretion to correct the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Defendant also advances a number of other arguments concerning unpreserved sentencing errors. Because we must remand for resentencing as a result of the trial court\u2019s error in failing to merge the convictions, ORS 138.222(5), we need not address those remaining assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Convictions for fourth-degree assault reversed and remanded with instructions to enter judgment of conviction for one count of felony fourth-degree assault reflecting that defendant was convicted on both theories; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
