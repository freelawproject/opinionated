J.</author>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">In 1994, the Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision revoked petitioner\u2019s parole and denied rerelease based on a finding that he had committed an aggravated parole violation. In <em>Himes v. Thompson, </em>336 F3d 848 (9th Cir 2003), the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals granted petitioner federal habeas corpus relief as to the board\u2019s rerelease order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In response to the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision, the board reopened and reconsidered its order denying rerelease. After reconsideration, it issued an order again denying rerelease, establishing a 332-month prison term, and setting a parole release date consistent with that term. Petitioner now seeks judicial review of that order, asserting that the board lacked authority to impose a revocation sanction beyond the 10-month period authorized by <em>former </em>OAR 254-70-042 (July 19,1978)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for nonaggravated parole violations, because the board has not adopted rules governing post-revocation parole release for aggravated violations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">In March 1979, petitioner was sentenced to consecutive sentences totaling 70 years for four felony offenses, including first-degree rape and first-degree sodomy, that arose out of two criminal episodes that occurred in November 1978. The board released petitioner on parole in April 1994. The board revoked his parole in August 1994, based on its determination that petitioner had violated the condition of his supervision that required him to answer all questions promptly and truthfully. On administrative review, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>board denied relief. Petitioner did not seek judicial review of the order revoking his parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">In October 1994, the board held a future disposition hearing and denied petitioner rerelease; it also denied relief on administrative review of that order. The board scheduled petitioner\u2019s next parole review for May 2024, thus requiring petitioner to serve a minimum of 29\u00bd additional years in prison for the parole violation. <em>Himes, </em>336 F3d at 852. Petitioner sought judicial review of that order. In 1996, this court affirmed the board\u2019s future disposition decision without opinion, and the Oregon Supreme Court denied review. Petitioner later filed a federal habeas corpus proceeding and, in July 2003, the federal appeals court issued its decision remanding the case to the federal district court with instructions to issue a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">In November 2003, in response to the federal court decision, the board reopened petitioner\u2019s future disposition hearing and reconsidered the matter. The board again denied rerelease and set a parole release date of February 25, 2022, based on its determination, pursuant to <em>former </em>OAR 254-70-042,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that the violation was aggravated because it occurred less than six months after petitioner was released on parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">When petitioner committed his crimes, ORS 144.343(2) (1977) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-7\">\u201c(2) The board may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-8\">\u201c(a) Reinstate or continue the alleged violator on parole subject to the same or modified conditions of parole; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-9\">\u201c(b) Revoke parole and require that the parole violator serve the remaining balance of [the] sentence as provided by law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AhO\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>The board revoked petitioner\u2019s parole within the meaning of that statute. As a consequence, the board had authority to require petitioner to serve the entire remainder of his sentence in prison. <em>See Cole v. Board of Parole, </em>220 Or App 362, 365, 186 P3d 321 (2008); <em>State ex rel Gonzalez v. Washington, </em>182 Or App 112, 116-18, 47 P3d 537 (2002). With respect to that issue, in <em>Cole, </em>we stated that, \u201c[t]he question in this case, and in <em>Gonzalez, </em>concerned the board\u2019s authority to deny [rerelease] on parole to parole violators. As explained in <em>Gonzalez, </em>there is no doubt that the board has statutory authority to do this. 182 Or App at 116-18.\u201d <em>Cole, </em>220 Or App at 364. In <em>Gonzalez, </em>we relied on ORS 144.343 as the statutory source of authority for the conclusion that, upon revocation of his parole, \u201cthe board was authorized to require [the appellant] to serve the remainder of his sentence.\u201d 182 Or App at 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Here, instead of requiring petitioner to serve his entire remaining sentence in prison, the board set a new rerelease date under ORS 144.395 (1977), which authorized the board to adopt rules relating to the rerelease of offenders whose parole has been revoked.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See Gonzalez, </em>182 Or App at 119-20 (explaining board\u2019s authority to do so under identical 1986 statute). Petitioner initially argues that ORS 144.395 (1977) does not itself give the board authority to release an offender on parole after revocation of parole. He asserts: \u201cThat statute only authorizes the board to promulgate rules for releasing an offender on parole after parole revocation.\u201d Petitioner contends that the board lacked authority to apply <em>former </em>OAR 254-70-042 and to set a rerelease date beyond 10 months based on an aggravation factor, because no board rule had established a range of extended prison terms for aggravated parole violations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In the absence of such a range, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>petitioner asserts that the board was required to impose a term no longer than that expressly authorized for a nonaggravated violation based on his crimes\u2019 severity, namely, 10 months. <em>See former </em>OAR 254-70-042(2). Citing <em>Megdal v. Board of Dental Examiners, </em>288 Or 293, 321, 605 P2d 273 (1980), in which the court held that, where an agency has statutory authority to promulgate rules regulating conduct but fails to do so, the agency lacks authority to regulate the conduct, petitioner argues that the board unlawfully made an ad hoc determination. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">By 1978, when petitioner committed his offenses, the board had adopted <em>former </em>OAR 254-70-042 pursuant to its authority under ORS 144.395 (1977) to promulgate rules pertaining to the rerelease of offenders whose parole had been revoked. Among other problems, petitioner\u2019s argument is based on the mistaken premise that ORS 144.395 (1977) required the board to adopt \u201cranges\u201d that are consistent with the criteria in ORS 144.780. That is not the case. Instead, ORS 144.395 (1977) merely required the board to adopt \u201crules\u201d consistent with those criteria. Thus, petitioner\u2019s argument would require us to insert words into the statute that the legislature omitted. That we cannot do. ORS 174.010. In any event, <em>former </em>OAR 254-70-042 did include \u201cranges.\u201d For nonaggravated violations, those ranges were particularized based on the severity of the underlying offense. Thus, <em>former </em>OAR 254-70-042(2) authorized a range of six to ten months for \u201ca parolee revoked and returned after release with an original crime severity of 6 or 7[.]\u201d For aggravated violations, the rule implicitly allowed the imposition of terms \u201cranging\u201d between the upper end of the applicable range for a nonaggravated violation and the entire remaining balance of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>offender\u2019s indeterminate sentence. Thus, the rule implicitly authorized a broader range based on aggravating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">It follows that petitioner\u2019s reliance on <em>Megdal </em>is misplaced. <em>Megdal </em>addressed the requirement for agency rule-making in advance of adjudication. The licensing statute at issue in <em>Megdal </em>required the board to \u201cexpand the list of conduct deemed unprofessional for disciplinary purposes by rules [.]\u201d 288 Or at 316. The court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-5\">\u201cthe breadth of potential administrative choice to develop and execute the term \u2018unprofessional conduct,\u2019 together with the agency\u2019s authority to make rules on that topic and the similarity of the agency with other licensing boards for whom rulemaking was mandatory, indicated a legislative intent that the standard must be explained by rules. We examined the character of the statutory term itself, the rulemaking authority delegated to the agency and we compared the agency\u2019s task and structure with comparable agencies to reach our conclusion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-6\"><em>Trebesch v. Employment Division, </em>300 Or 264, 269, 710 P2d 136 (1985) (explaining the court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Megdal). </em>It is well settled, however, that an agency need not adopt rules establishing the agency\u2019s policy in regard to every possible factual circumstance that may arise in the course of the agency\u2019s exercise of its enforcement functions. <em>See Larsen v. Adult &amp; Family Services Division, </em>34 Or App 615, 619-21, 579 P2d 866 (1978) (agencies are not subject to \u201can inflexible requirement that every refinement of an articulated policy be promulgated through\u201d prior rulemaking); <em>see also Trebesch, </em>300 Or at 270 <em>(Megdal </em>does not require that all policymaking functions be exercised only after rulemaking); <em>Megdal, </em>288 Or at 314 (rules need not \u201ccatalogue all the types\u201d of conduct that are subject to enforcement action in order to serve the purposes of \u201cgiving notice of censurable conduct\u201d and confining the agency\u2019s discretion to the announced standards).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">Here, unlike the agency in <em>Megdal, </em>the board did not make an ad hoc determination. Rather, it applied an existing rule that implicitly established standards for setting petitioner\u2019s rerelease date based on a finding that his parole violation was aggravated. The fact that the range of the board\u2019s discretion was broader than petitioner wishes does not make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>the exercise of that discretion unlawful. As discussed, if the board had chosen to do so, after revoking his parole it could have required petitioner to serve the entire remainder of his sentence, as authorized by ORS 144.343(2)(b) (1977). By requiring him to serve a shorter term \u2014 as it did here \u2014 based on the application of a rule that was consistent with the terms of its authorizing statute, ORS 144.395 (1977), the board did not act unlawfully.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b424-6\"> In that case, the federal appeals court concluded that the board\u2019s application of rules adopted after petitioner committed his underlying offenses \u2014 rules that the court deemed more onerous than the rules in effect when petitioner committed those offenses \u2014 violated the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution. <em>Himes, </em>336 F3d at 864. The court granted federal habeas corpus relief to petitioner, thus, in effect, remanding the case to the board for reopening and reconsideration of its rerelease decision under a different set of rules. Petitioner does not contend that the board failed to carry out the federal court\u2019s directive. Because the federal court decision does not otherwise inform the issue before us, we do not consider it further.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AXQ\"> All references to <em>former </em>OAR 254-70-042 refer to the version effectuated on July 19,1978.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AeG\"> Petitioner also argues that substantial evidence does not support the board\u2019s order.
