J.</author>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">Defendant appeals from his conviction, following a jury trial, of driving under the influence of intoxicants (DUII), ORS 813.010(1)(b). He assigns error to, <em>inter alia, </em>the denial of his motion to suppress a thermos-like coffee cup, containing an alcoholic beverage, that was found between the driver and passenger seats during a post-impoundment inventory of his truck. The state acknowledges that, in light of <em>State v. Eldridge, </em>207 Or App 337, 142 P3d 82 (2006), the inventory was invalid, rendering the seizure of the container unlawful under Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution. The state contends, nevertheless, that the denial of suppression, and the consequent admission at trial, of the coffee cup and testimony concerning its contents, was harmless error, given the totality of the evidence at trial. As explained below, we cannot say that, notwithstanding the erroneous admission of evidence that defendant had been driving with an open container of alcohol within reach, there was \u201clittle likelihood\u201d that that evidence affected the jury\u2019s verdict convicting defendant of DUII. <em>State v. Davis, </em>336 Or 19, 32, 77 P3d 1111 (2003). Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The facts material to our consideration are undisputed. On June 10, 2005, at about 8:45 p.m., North Bend Police Officer John Bohanan saw defendant driving, with a passenger, in a pickup truck.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Bohanan, who was driving in the opposite direction, circled around and pulled up behind the pickup as it stopped at a red light. After stopping, defendant then drove through the intersection while the traffic light was still red. Bohanan followed, activating the overhead lights on his patrol car, and defendant immediately pulled over, in routine fashion, within a quarter of a block.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">When Bohanan approached the pickup, he asked defendant to produce his driver\u2019s license and other documents, but defendant was unresponsive, gripping the steering wheel and staring straight ahead. At the same time, Bohanan smelled a \u201cmoderate\u201d \u201codor of an alcoholic beverage\u201d coming from the pickup and observed that defendant\u2019s eyes were \u201cwatery and glassy.\u201d Defendant\u2019s eyes were not, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>however, bloodshot and \u201chis speech was fair\u201d and not \u201cnoticeably slurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">Bohanan learned from a records check that defendant had been driving while suspended and decided to take him into custody. Consequently, Bohanan asked defendant to get out of the pickup. As defendant did so, Bohanan could smell alcohol on defendant\u2019s breath, but did not observe anything unusual about defendant\u2019s balance. Bohanan believed that defendant might be under the influence of intoxicants and read defendant his <em>Miranda </em>rights before placing him in the patrol car and driving him back to the police station to continue the DUII investigation, including performance of field sobriety tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">At some point before taking defendant back to the police station \u2014 and it is unclear whether before or after reading defendant his <em>Miranda </em>rights \u2014 Bohanan determined that the pickup must be impounded and its contents inventoried in accordance with North Bend city policies. During the inventory, Bohanan found, in the area between the driver\u2019s and passenger\u2019s seats, a \u201cthermos, almost like a coffee cup, traveling coffee cup with a slider where you could sip from.\u201d That receptacle, which was within defendant\u2019s reach, gave off a \u201cstrong odor of maybe a liquor beverage\u201d and was less than half-full of some sort of liquid.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">After Bohanan took defendant to the police station, defendant voluntarily performed a variety of \u201cstandardized\u201d and \u201cnonstandardized\u201d field sobriety tests. The \u201cstandardized\u201d tests were the horizontal gaze nystagmus (HGN) test, the \u201cwalk-and-turn\u201d test, and the \u201cone-leg stand\u201d test. On the HGN test, defendant showed a \u201clack of smooth pursuit in both eyes\u201d and a \u201cdistinct and sustained nystagmus\u201d in both eyes, which indicated impairment. On the \u201cwalk-and-turn\u201d test, defendant failed that test because he did not maintain his balance initially, started the test too soon, \u201cmissed heel to toe\u201d on one of his first set of 10 steps, and, on his returning set of steps, missed \u201cheel to toe\u201d several times, \u201cstepped offline,\u201d and raised his arms for balance. Defendant also failed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>\u201cone-leg stand\u201d test by noticeably swaying, twice putting his foot down, and concluding the test a few seconds before the prescribed 30-second period.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">Bohanan then administered a variety of \u201cnonstandardized\u201d field sobriety tests. On the \u201cestimated passage of time\u201d test, on which defendant was instructed to stand with his head leaning back and eyes closed and to estimate the passage of 30 seconds, defendant, although exhibiting some circular swaying, indicated after 28 seconds that 30 seconds had passed \u2014 which was well within the \u201cnormal range for a person that would be given this test.\u201d On the \u201cbackwards count\u201d test, defendant\u2019s only error was in counting backwards in correct sequence from 100 to 75, instead of to 77, as instructed. Finally, on the \u201calphabet\u201d test, defendant correctly recited the alphabet, without singing or rhyming, from \u201cA\u201d to \u201cP,\u201d paused for a moment \u2014 and then, when prompted with \u201cQ\u201d by his passenger who was observing \u2014 correctly recited the balance of the alphabet.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">After completing both the \u201cstandardized\u201d and \u201cnon-standardized\u201d field sobriety tests, Bohanan determined that defendant had \u201cfailed by standardized field sobriety test\u201d and that defendant had been driving under the influence of intoxicants. At Bohanan\u2019s request, defendant then consented to an Intoxilyzer test. That test, given at 10:00 p.m., approximately one hour and 15 minutes after the traffic stop, showed that defendant had a .07 blood alcohol level.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Before trial, defendant sought to suppress evidence pertaining to the \u201ccoffee cup\u201d containing an alcoholic beverage found during the inventory of his pickup, arguing, in part, that \u201csuch evidence was discovered pursuant to an illegal inventory.\u201d The trial court denied that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">At trial, the prosecutor, in his opening statement, referred to Bohanan\u2019s discovery of a \u201cmug type container that has [an] alcoholic beverage in it * * * between the seats, close to where the defendant is sitting.\u201d The only witness at trial was Bohanan, and, after Bohanan testified regarding the circumstances of the stop, the prosecutor elicited detailed testimony from him (summarized above) regarding the discovery of the \u201ccoffee cup,\u201d its location, and its contents. The prosecutor then offered, and the court received, the \u201ccoffee cup\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>(which no longer contained any liquid) as \u201cState\u2019s Exhibit No. 1.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">The balance of Bohanan\u2019s testimony pertained to defendant\u2019s performance on the field sobriety tests, the Intoxilyzer result, and Bohanan\u2019s assessment of defendant\u2019s impairment. In particular, and as pertinent to defendant\u2019s second assignment of error on appeal, Bohanan gave the following testimony to which defendant unsuccessfully objected:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-5\">\u201cQ. So, once all the tests were done, what was your assessment of the Defendant\u2019s overall performance on the field sobriety tests?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-6\">\u201cA. My observations [were] that he failed by standardized field sobriety test and that I believed him to be operating a motor vehicle under the influence of intoxicants to a noticeable and perceptible degree.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">In closing argument, the prosecutor again referred to the \u201ccoffee cup\u201d-related evidence as significant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-8\">\u201c[T]hey looked through the vehicle, they find the cup. It was found in the vehicle between the seats in reach of the Defendant with alcohol [ic] beverage in it. Another indicator. We never heard anything from Officer Bohanan about seeing him throwing it back or seeing him drink it, but it\u2019s evidence that you can consider as to whether the Defendant was under the influence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">The jury, by an 11-1 verdict, found defendant guilty of DUII.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">On appeal, defendant raises two assignments of error. First, he reiterates his contention that the \u201ccoffee cup\u201drelated evidence should have been suppressed because the predicate inventory was unlawful either under Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution or the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Defendant further argues that, given the totality of the evidence regarding defendant\u2019s degree of impairment, the erroneous admission of evidence that defendant had been driving with an open container of an alcoholic beverage within reach cannot be deemed harmless error. Second, as before the trial court, defendant contends that Bohanan\u2019s testimony (quoted above) regarding his assessment of defendant\u2019s impairment was improper \u201ceither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>as a legal conclusion or because it pertained to an ultimate fact that was not beyond the jury\u2019s ability to decide for itself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">With respect to defendant\u2019s first assignment of error, the state acknowledges that, given <em>Eldridge </em>\u2014 which issued nearly a year after the trial here \u2014 the inventory was unlawful under Article I, section 9. <em>See Eldridge, </em>207 Or App at 343 (\u201c[T]he North Bend inventory program lacks standardized criteria or procedures that properly prevent officer discretion and limit each inventory to a scope that is a constitutional administrative action rather than an unlawful warrantless search.\u201d). However, the state contends that that state constitutional error was harmless because there was \u201clittle likelihood that the particular error affected the verdict.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>336 Or at 32. The state further disputes defendant\u2019s alternative contention that the inventory violated the Fourth Amendment and asserts that, even if there was federal constitutional error, the admission of the \u201ccoffee cup\u201d-related evidence was \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 US 18, 24, 87 S Ct 824, 17 L Ed 2d 705, <em>reh\u2019g den, </em>386 US 987 (1967). Finally, with respect to the second assignment of error, the state responds that Bohanan\u2019s testimony was properly admitted and, in all events, any asserted error was harmless because Bohanan later \u2014 and without any objection or derivative assignment of error by defendant \u2014 \u201cprovided a more expansive opinion of defendant\u2019s sobriety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">We accept as well-founded the state\u2019s acknowledgment that, given <em>Eldridge, </em>the admission of the \u201ccoffee cup\u201drelated evidence was erroneous under Article I, section 9. Further, as explained below, we do not agree with the state that there was \u201clittle likelihood\u201d that the \u201ccoffee cup\u201d-related evidence affected the jury\u2019s verdict. That is so, regardless of the admissibility of Bohanan\u2019s testimony that is the object of the second assignment of error.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, because the admission of the \u201ccoffee cup\u201d-related evidence was not harmless error, we reverse and remand.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number><em>Davis </em>frames the inquiry. There, the trial court, in a murder prosecution, excluded evidence that the defendant sought to present regarding the alleged victim\u2019s possible motivation to commit suicide. 336 Or at 23-25. The Supreme Court, in reversing the defendant\u2019s conviction, determined that the exclusion of that evidence was error, <em>id. </em>at 27, and that that error required reversal because it was not \u201charmless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 28-35. In so holding, the court clarified that, under Article VII (Amended), section 3,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-4\">\u201cOregon\u2019s constitutional test for affirmance despite error consists of a single inquiry: Is there little likelihood that the particular error affected the verdict? The correct focus of the inquiry regarding affirmance despite error is on the possible influence of the error on the verdict rendered, not whether this court, sitting as a factfinder, would regard the evidence of guilt as substantial and compelling.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">The Supreme Court further explained that a variety of considerations may properly inform that \u201csingle inquiry,\u201d including \u201cthe nature of the error that occurred below,\u201d <em>id., </em>and the \u201ccontext of the legal error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 33. The court noted, for example, that the erroneous exclusion or admission of evidence would be harmless \u201cif the particular issue to which the error pertains has no relationship to the jury\u2019s determination of its verdict,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 32, or if the jury \u201cwould have regarded the * * * evidence as duplicative or unhelpful to its deliberations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 33. Ultimately, the Supreme Court in <em>Davis </em>concluded that the erroneous exclusion was not harmless, because it could not \u201csay that the excluded statements were merely cumulative of\u2019 admitted evidence \u2014 and, indeed, \u201cwere qualitatively different than the evidence that the jury heard\u201d \u2014 and because \u201cthe excluded evidence goes directly to the heart of defendant\u2019s factual theory of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">This case is the functional obverse <em>of Davis </em>in that it involved the erroneous admission of evidence presented by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>the state, rather than the erroneous exclusion of evidence that a criminal defendant sought to present. But the considerations bearing on the \u201csingle inquiry\u201d are, of course, the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">The state, for its part, attempts to cast the \u201ccoffee cup\u201d-related evidence as \u201cmerely cumulative\u201d of other evidence as to a largely uncontroverted issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-5\">\u201cFirst, the coffee cup evidence proved nothing new to the jury. The ultimate factual issue that the jury needed to decide was whether defendant was intoxicated to a noticeable and perceptible degree. The coffee cup was offered only to demonstrate the presence of alcohol near defendant. There is no dispute that defendant drank alcohol that night. Defendant was found to have a .07 BAC an hour and fifteen minutes after he was pulled over, arrested, conducted six field sobriety tests, and waited an additional fifteen minutes. Those results were admitted into evidence. All that the coffee cup evidence demonstrated was that Officer Bohanan located a potentially alcoholic beverage in defendant\u2019s vehicle. There was no evidence presented that defendant drank from that coffee cup, or that the passenger did not drink from the coffee cup.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">The state also contends that there was very substantial evidence of defendant\u2019s culpable impairment, including that defendant ran a red light with a police car stopped behind him, that defendant had glassy and watery eyes and smelled of alcohol, that defendant failed various field sobriety tests, that defendant had a .07 blood alcohol content more than an hour after the stop, and that Bohanan, an experienced officer, regarded defendant as impaired to a noticeable and perceptible degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">Defendant rejoins that, at the time of the stop, his speech was not slurred, that his eyes were not bloodshot, that, when defendant got out of his pickup, Bohanan noticed nothing unusual about his balance, that he performed well on the \u201cnonstandardized\u201d field sobriety tests, specifically including the \u201ctime estimation\u201d and \u201cbackwards counting\u201d tests, that his performance on the \u201cstandardized\u201d tests, while deemed a failure, was not egregious, and that his \u201cbreathalyzer result was only a .07.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>We cannot say that, in these circumstances, there was \u201clittle likelihood\u201d that the \u201ccoffee cup\u201d-related evidence affected the jury\u2019s verdict \u2014 and, particularly, its determination that defendant\u2019s faculties were impaired, because of the consumption of an alcoholic beverage, to a noticeable or perceptible degree. Although the state now casts that evidence as pertaining solely to the essentially undisputed issue of whether defendant had consumed an alcoholic beverage, that does not square with its use of that evidence at trial. Rather, after highlighting the location and contents of the \u201ccoffee cup\u201d in opening statement and in the direct examination of Bohanan, the prosecutor explicitly invited the jury to rely on that evidence as \u201c[a]nother indicator * * * that you can consider as to whether the Defendant was under the influence.\u201d Thus, at least as argued by the state to the jury, the \u201ccoffee cup\u201d-related evidence went \u201cdirectly to the heart of [the state\u2019s] factual theory of the case.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>336 Or at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">Further, that evidence was not \u201cmerely cumulative of [the admitted] evidence,\u201d <em>id.; </em>indeed, as a practical matter, it was \u201cqualitatively different than the [other] evidence that the jury heard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The presence of an open container of alcohol within the defendant driver\u2019s reach can be the quintessential \u201csmoking gun\u201d in a DUII prosecution. It is unsurprising, given the potential visceral impact of such evidence on jurors, that the prosecution here featured the coffee cup (albeit empty) as \u201cState\u2019s Exhibit No. 1.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Finally, we decline the state\u2019s implicit invitation to assess the persuasiveness of its other evidence pertaining to the degree of defendant\u2019s impairment. <em>See Davis, </em>336 Or at 32 (in determining whether error is \u201charmless,\u201d appellate court must not \u201cengage improperly in weighing the evidence and, essentially, retrying the case, while disregarding the error committed at trial, to determine whether the defendant is guilty\u201d). Rather, our function is properly, constitutionally limited to determining whether, given the nature of the erroneously admitted evidence and its relationship, as framed by the parties\u2019 presentations, to the matters essential to the jury\u2019s verdict, there was \u2018little likelihood\u201d that that evidence affected the verdict. <em>Id. </em>We cannot so determine here. Accordingly, the court\u2019s admission of the \u201ccoffee cup\u201d-related evidence was reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b164-7\"> Bohanan had earlier \u201ctalked to [defendant about] another issue.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b165-7\"> There is no indication in the record that the state, after seizing the container, ever tested or otherwise confirmed the precise nature of its contents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b168-6\"> Consequently, we need not, and do not, address that assignment of error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"Atr\"> Given our analysis and disposition, we do not address the parties\u2019 arguments, including those raised in the <em>pro se </em>supplemental appellant\u2019s brief, as to whether the inventory was lawful under the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b169-8\"> Article VII (Amended), section 3, provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-9\">\u201cIf the supreme court shall be of opinion, after consideration of all the matters thus submitted, that the judgment of the court appealed from was such as should have been rendered in the case, such judgment shall be affirmed, notwithstanding any error committed during the trial[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b170-9\"> The state did not present evidence as to the possible effect of the passage of approximately one hour and 15 minutes on defendant\u2019s blood alcohol level.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
