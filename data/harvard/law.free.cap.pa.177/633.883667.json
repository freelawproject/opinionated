School Dist., 168 Pa. 386.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"Ae9L\">Mr. Chief Justice Sterrett,</author>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">In June, 1881, judgment was entered against defendant by virtue of a warrant of attorney contained in an unsealed note for $4,000 payable one day after the date thereof, November 10, 1873.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">On defendant\u2019s application, the court in January, 1893, made a decree opening the judgment, for the purpose of enabling him to interpose the statute of limitations, and awarded an issue in which it is provided that \u201c the judgment note shall stand for a declaration and defendant shall plead the statute of limitations, and no other plea, within ten days; the plaintiff on the trial to be at liberty to show any matter in bar of the running of the statute, subject to the usual rules as to notice of special matter.\u201d On appeal to tins court, the action of the court below, in thus opening the judgment and awarding the issue, was affirmed: Bates v. Cullum, 163 Pa. 234.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">By agreement of the parties the cause was tried January 27, 1896, by the court without a jury. On the trial, evidence relating to the merits of the claim and also tending to prove that within a few weeks after the note in question was given defendant left the state of Pennsylvania and ceased to be a resident thereof, and thenceforth continued to reside without the state, etc., was offered by the plaintiff and received under objection. In connection with the evidence of defendant\u2019s nonresidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>etc., he also cited and relied on the act of May 22, 1895, P. L. 112, which declares: \u201c That in all civil suits and actions in which the cause of action shall have arisen within this state the defendant or defendants in such suit or action, who shall have become non-resident of the state after such cause of action shall have arisen, shall not have the benefit of any statute of this state for the limitation of actions during the period of such residence without the state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Referring to the evidence that was received under objection, the learned trial judge, in his opinion, says: \u201c All this evidence should have been excluded and we accordingly now sustain the objection, exclude the evidence from consideration and seal bill of exceptions for plaintiff. The plaintiffs evidence having been excluded, that offered by the defendant may be treated as withdrawn.\u201d As to the act above quoted, he says : \u201c The language of the act before us does not seem to require a retrospective construction \u2014 at least not such as to compel us, on ascertaining a fact by the trial of an issue, to enter a different judgment from that which we should have entered had the fact been judicially ascertained at the time of the order awarding the issue.\u201d He accordingly held that \u201c No fact appears by which the running of the statute of limitations was prevented; \u201d and, having found that the note in suit \u201c was due more than six years before the judgment was entered \u201d thereon, he enforced the bar of the statute and entered judgment for the defendant. Hence this appeal, in which the correctness of the learned judge\u2019s rulings are challenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">If the act, properly construed, is applicable to suits and actions, such as this, in which the cause of action arose in this state prior to the passage of the act of 1895, etc., and is not unconstitutional on that or any other ground, it is impossible to justify the action of the court below in excluding the evidence of defendant\u2019s \u201c residence without the state,\u201d for more than twenty years, as a fact \u201c in bar of the running of the statute.\u201d One of the terms of the issue, awarded by the court, is that on the trial thereof the plaintiff shall \u201c be at liberty to show any matter in bar of the running of the statute.\u201d The trial did not take place until January 27, 1896, more than eight months after the act was passed. All that was adjudicated prior thereto was the authority of the court to open the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>and award the issue on the terms therein specified. The issue was pending and undetermined when the act went into operation. The learned counsel for defendant, in their argument candidly \u201c admit that the weight of authority is in favor of the power of the legislature to repeal and pass laws changing the methods of procedure, and relating solely to the remedy, pending litigation; \u201d but they claim \u201c that the peculiar situation of this case \u201d renders those authorities as well as the act itself inapplicable. For reasons above suggested, we are unable to see wherein either the act or the authorities referred to are not strictly applicable to the case in hand. The language of the act is clear, specific and imperative. It applies to \u201c all civil suits and actions in which the cause of action shall have arisen within this state.\u201d It affects all defendants \u201c who shall have become nonresident, .... after said cause of action shall have arisen.\u201d This language is clearly retrospective at least as applied to the cause of action and residence of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Whether our statute of limitations should or should not continue to run in favor of persons who had abandoned their residence in this state was purely a legislative and not a judicial question. The defendant had no right in or under the statute that could interfere with the power of the legislature to declare that he and all others similarly situated should not have the benefit thereof \u201c during the period of\u201d their \u201cresidence without the state.\u201d As was said in Campbell v. Holt, 115 U. S. 628, \u201c no man promises to pay money with any view of being released from that obligation by lapse of time. It violates no right of his, therefore, when the legislature says, time shall be no bar, though such was the case when the contract was made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">We are of opinion that the act of 1895 is neither unconstitutional nor inapplicable to the facts of this case, and that the learned court erred in holding otherwise and excluding plain tiff\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">Judgment reversed and record remitted for further proceed ings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
