R. R. and the C. <em>V. </em>R. R., two railroad companies, entered into a contract with the S. M. R. R. and the G. &amp; H. R. R,, two other railroad companies which were not parallel or competing lines, by which the four companies agreed to interchange traffic and cars, sell through tickets for passengers, and issue through bills of lading for freight. The P. R. R. and the C. V. R. R. also agreed to set apart fifteen per cent of <em>the gross </em>receipts of freight and passenger traffic to and from any points on the four roads, and pay the same to the trustee of a mortgage to secure bonds issued by the G. &amp; H. R. R. to build an extension of its road. These bonds were payable in thirty years, and to each bond was attached a memorandum of this provision of the agreement. The bonds were sold at par, and the extension of the G. &amp; H. R. R. subsequently completed. For nine years the P. R. R. and C. V. R. R. paid to the trustee the fifteen per cent upon the traffic receipts. About nine years after the date of the contract, the P. &amp; R. R. R. obtained a controlling interest in the stock of the G. <em>&amp; </em>H. R. R., and all of the stock of the S. M. R. R. The officers and directors were changed, and the two roads were consolidated under the name of the G. <em>&amp; </em>H. Ry. About the same time the H. R. R. was incorporated to build a railroad parallel and competing with the C. V. R. R. After the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>completion of this road by orders of the general manager of the P. &amp; R. R. R., the traffic arrangements with the C. V. R. R. and the P. R. R. were disregarded, and the traffic contract was practically extinguished. The P. R. R. and the C. V. R. R. filed abill in equity against the G. &amp; H. Ry., and P. &amp; R. R. R., and the H. R. R. for the specific performance of the traffic contract above referred to. Some of the material portions of the contract were as follows: \u201cParties of the third and fourth parts (S. M. R. R. and G. &amp; H. R. R.) hereby respectively covenant and agree that they will so far as they lawfully can send to destination all traffic controlled by them via the lines of the parties of the fust and second parts. ... It being the intention that their lines shall be worked as far as possible in harmony with each other. . . . Nothing in this contract shall be so construed as to give the use of the roads and facilities of the parties of the first and second parts hereto to any parties whose interests may be at variance with, or unfriendly to said parties, nor shall the same be used hereunder to divert from the parties of the first and second part traffic properly tributary to the lines controlled by them.\u201d <em>Held, </em>(1) that as the contract was wholly between connecting railroads, not competing or parallel, it was for the benefit of the public; (2) that under the terms of the contract the court could not assume that it was intended to unlawfully exclude traffic; (3) that as the P. R. R. and the C. Y. R. R. were bound to set aside fifteen per cent of the gross receipts to secure the bonds, and as the S. M. R. R., and the G. &amp; H. R. R. had received in large part the consideration for entering into the contract, the contract ought to be enforced specifically; (4) that the consolidation of the S. M. R. R. and the G. &amp; II. R. R. did not change the identity of the corporations nor their contract liability, inasmuch as equity deals with the substance, and not the form, when it seeks to enforce its decrees; (5) that the mere change of name and personnel of the boards of directors was no obstacle to a mandatory writ in aid of a restraining order; (6) that the contract could not be revoked by either party on notice, as it was fixed by its terms to continue for thirty years; (7) that the contract was sufficiently definite in its terms to enable the court to specifically enforce it; (8) that the complainants were entitled to a decree of specific performance.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b540-4\">Argued April 28, 1896.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A6S\">Appeals, Nos. 79, 80, 81 and 82, Jan.

All of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>defendants were duly served with, process and have appeared and made answer to the complaint. An examination of the agreement of September 30, 1882, shows that, in letter as well as in spirit, the covenants therein are jointly made by the parties of the first and second parts and jointly by'the parties of the third and fourth parts and there is, therefore, no technical objection to the maintenance of the action in its present form. . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b558-4\">The contract of September 30,1882, is a conscionable one, with mutual covenants, and it in no wise infringes upon the rights of the public. Its whole purpose was to increase the business of the contracting parties in a perfectly legitimate manner. A railroad company has an undoubted right to enter into a just and fair arrangement with a corporation or association of men, whereby its business will be increased, although the effect of the arrangement may be to take business from others. The right of connecting railroad corporations to make contracts for through rates is incident to their powers unless prohibited by their charters : Munhall v. Railroad Co., 92 Pa. 150. In Tonawanda R. R. Co. v. N. Y., L. E. &amp; W. R. R. Co., 42 Hun, 496, a traffic agreement between two railroad companies, by which each covenanted that it would use its influence to promote the interests and business of the other, so far as it could do so with a proper regard for its own interests, was held to be valid. It was there further held that the parties having entered upon and enjoyed the benefits of the contract for a long period of time, it was too late for one of them to assert that the contract was void because it had no power to secure its performance in the manner stipulated in the instrument; neither party could assert such a defense after entering upon and enjoying the benefits of the contract. A court will not refuse to enforce specific performance of a contract between railroad companies because it involves acts of a continuou.s and perhaps complicated character extending over a long period of years. In Union P. R. R. Co. v. Chicago, R. I. &amp; P. R. Co., 51 Am. &amp; Eng. Railroad Cases, p. 162, the following language is used: \u201c The next objection made to this decree is that this contract is not one of which specific performance can be enforced in equity; that the acts to be performed under it are so numerous and complicated, and their performance is to extend through so long a term of years, that it would be impracticable for any court to supervise and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>enforce such performance. The question here presented is no longer open for consideration in the federal courts. It is settled adversely to the appellants by the decision in Joy v. City of St. Louis, 138 U. S. 1.\u201d ... It is a settled rule in equity that the specific performance of a contract -will not be decreed, unless its terms are clear and capable of ascertainment from the instrument itself; so courts of equity will not ordinarily entertain bills for the specific execution of contracts with variations or additions, or new terms to be made or introduced into them by parol: Hammer v. McEldowney, 46 Pa. 334. The proposition is conceded by all parties concerned that where goods have to pass over two or more connecting lines in order to reach their destination, the shipper may designate the route and the shipping road must observe his directions. In the matter of jurisdiction, it is not material to this case that there was no demand for arbitration, under the ninth article of this agreement, before suit brought. The provision in regard to arbitration which is there contained is not adequate to oust the jurisdiction of the courts: Commercial Union Assurance Co. v. Hocking, 115 Pa. 407.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b559-3\">MILEAGE BASIS.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b559-4\">We are asked by the plaintiffs to decree that the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg Railway Company shall apportion upon a mileage basis the earnings arising from joint business exchanged by it with the lines of plaintiffs, and to adjudge the twenty mile block system to be a proper basis for apportionment. Upon the subject of the division of earnings, the only provision in the agreement is that \u201c the earnings from joint business exchanged with the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg Railroad, shall be apportioned to and between the parties hereto on such a mileage basis as shall be agreed upon between the parties hereto.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b559-5\">It will be noticed that this applies only to business exchanged with the party of the fourth part and not to business interchanged among the other three parties, and that it does not fix a definite mileage basis. Prior to July 1, 1891, the earnings arising from joint business were divided on a twenty mile block basis. The testimony in the case is to the effect that this division was inequitable to the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg Railroad Company and that said company could not continue to exist under such an arrangement. On June 4, 1891, at a meeting between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>the representative freight agents of the Cumberland Yalley Railroad Company and the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company, a memorandum was made of a proposed division of the earnings from freight traffic exchanged between the former company and the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg Railroad Company, on a fifty mile block basis, which proposed division was subsequently declared by the general freight agent of the former company to be satisfactory, and it only went into effect on July 1,1891. The same through rates were continued in force as previously, the only change being in the method of apportionment between the two companies. An arrangement by which \u201c arbitrarles \u201d were charged on business exchanged between the line of the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg Railroad Company and on the line of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company also went into effect on the same date. These arbitrarles, which were ostensibly \u201c figured on a basis of fifty miles for all points on the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg Railroad,\u201d in reality constituted charges on the basis of blocks of one hundred miles, and they were intended to give the average charges upon that block system. The division between the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg Railway Company and the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company was upon the same mileage block basis. Special arbitrarles for anthracite coal, etc., were also fixed. The above mentioned rates have continued in force ever since. . . . After a careful consideration of all the facts of the ease, we are satisfied that the court would not be justified in adjudging the twenty mile block system to be a proper basis for the apportionment of joint earnings, and further, that, there is not anything in the bill taken in connection with the evidence which would warrant a decree of any kind in relation to a mileage basis.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b560-4\">THE PHILADELPHIA &amp; READING RAILROAD COMPANY.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b560-5\">It was urged on the argument that the bill should be dismissed as to the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company for the reason that it does not show any lawful ground for the relief which is prayed for against that company. The fact that, with knowledge of the agreement of September 30, 1882, it secured the ownership of the majority of the shares of the capital stock of the South Mountain Railway &amp; Mining Company and of the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg Railroad Company, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>thereby procured the election of boards of directors of both companies favorable to itself, with the intent of securing the business of said companies, clearly does not in itself afford sufficient basis for the injunction asked for. By the terms of the act of April 23, 1861 (Purd. Dig. p. 1810, pl. 156) it was lawful for the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company to purchase and hold the stock of the above mentioned companies, and after it had acquired a majority of the stock it had the same rights in relation thereto that any other purchaser would have had. A shareholder has a right, at a meeting of shareholders, to vote upon a measure, even though he has a personal interest therein separate from that possessed by others. In such a meeting each shareholder represents himself and his interests solely, and he in no sense acts as a trustee or representative of others. The law of self interest has at such times very great and proper sway and a shareholder commits no wrong when he votes his stock in favor of a resolution to purchase property from himself: Gamble v. Q. C. W. Co. et al., 123 N. Y. 91. In N. W. Trans. Co. v. Beatty, L. R. 12 App. Cas. 589, one of the directors of a company, who owned a majority of the capital stock therein, contracted to sell to the company a vessel which he owned, and it was held that at a meeting of the stockholders he had a right to vote his stock in favor of ratifying the contract and concluding the purchase.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b561-3\">An investigation into personal interests of the numerous shareholders voting at a general meeting would obviously be very difficult, if not impossible, and great uncertainty would result if the validity of acts of the majority were made to depend upon such an investigation. It has, therefore, been held, for reasons of convenience amounting to a practical necessity, that shareholders in a corporation are not disqualified from voting at a general meeting of the company by reason of their individual interests in the result of the vote: Morawetz on Priv. Corp.,Sec. 477.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b561-4\">When the proposed action of the majority stockholders, or of a board of directors representing them, is fraudulent or unduly oppressive to tbe minority holders, the latter may maintain an action to enjoin the contemplated step; but we know of no principle which would sustain the position that a majority stockholder can he held responsible to one not a stockholder, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>lie lias voted his stock in favor of propositions which are unfavorable to the outsider\u2019s interests. But the plaintiffs further state in their bill that the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company since it obtained control, in May, 1891, of the lines of the South Mountain Railway &amp; Mining Company and the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg Railroad Company, has operated said roads as part of the Philadelphia &amp; Reading system, in such manner as to promote the interchange of business with itself, to the exclusion as far as possible of the plaintiffs\u2019 roads and other lines. It is further stated that since the acquisition of control as aforesaid by the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company and by reason thereof, the above mentioned parties of the third and fourth parts to the agreement of September 30, 1882, and the company into which they were consolidated in July, 1891, have not kept the covenants and stipulations of the said agreement, although requested to do so.

Under the principles of law above referred to we are of the opinion that the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company has a right to use its control obtained by stock ownership in the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg Railway Company, in any way that it deems best, so long as the minority stockholders are content, and that the injunction asked for in prayer 5 should not be granted. Any remedy, therefore, which may be granted to the plaintiffs against the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company can be allowed only under, and by virtue of, the prayer for general relief. We are also of opinion that the fact that the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company has taken actual possession of the lines of the consolidated companies, and conducted their operations exclusively through its own officials, cannot properly be considered to be the result of a control obtained by stock ownership, although without such ownership it \u25a0would doubtless not have been able to take possession. Therefore if the prayer in the bill were for an injunction restraining the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company from holding possession of and operating the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg Railway, to the detriment of the rights of the plaintiffs under the contract of September 30, 1882, it would correctly state the only relief against the first named company which under any circumstances the bill would justify; and would present to the court the real problem which is entirely irrespective of stock ownership.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-4\">The question then arises whether the court under the prayer for general relief should consider the subject as if the last mentioned special prayer had actually been made, and grant relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>in accordance therewith, if a proper case has been shown both by the bill and proofs to sustain it. In regard to whether the bill has shown a sufficient case, it will be noticed that whilst it does not contain an express averment that the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company has taken possession of the lines of the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg Railway Company, yet it does contain the averment that the lines of the latter company \u201c have been operated \u201d by the former, as part of the Philadelphia &amp; Reading system.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b564-4\">This expression is a general one, and is entirely consistent with the facts which appear in the eighteenth finding, and its signification is sufficiently broad to warrant the implication that it was intended to cover all of said facts as well as any others of a similar character which might appear in detail in evidence. A general charge or statement of the matter of fact is sufficient, and it is not necessary to charge minutely all the circumstances which may conduce to prove the general charge; for these circumstances are properly matters of evidence which need not be charged to let them in as proofs : Story\u2019s Eq. Pl. sec. 28.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b564-5\">The rules of practice on the subject of special relief are thus stated: The usual course is for the plaintiff to make a special prayer for the particular relief to which he thinks himself entitled, and then to conclude with a prayer for general relief at the discretion of the court. The latter can never be properly and safely omitted; because if the plaintiff should mistake the relief, to which he is entitled in his special prayer, the court may yet afford him the relief, to which he has a right, under the prayer for general relief, provided it is such relief as is agreeable to the case made by the bill: Story\u2019s Eq. Pl. sec. 40; Slennner\u2019s Appeal, 58 Pa. 155. Although the special relief asked may not be allowed, yet the court will, if possible, grant such relief as the allegations will support, in order to meet the demands of justice between the parties; so where a bill asking for an assignment of a mortgage was not allowed, yet the court, upon certain averments in the bill, sustained it as a bill to redeem; 6 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, p. 764. It is well settled, as a general principle, that where a court of equity has obtained jurisdiction for one purpose it may retain it generally for relief: Allison and Evans\u2019 Appeal, 77 Pa. 221. We are satisfied that, in the present action, although the prayer for special relief by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>injunction is defective, suitable relief may be granted under tbe general prayer, in accordance with tbe equities of tbe case, both against the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company and its receivers, notwithstanding there was no special prayer against the latter. It seemed to be conceded at the argument, though not distinctly admitted, that the fact that the receivers had been made parties defendant by leave of the court which appointed them, made them amenable to the decree of this court in all respects as fully as the other parties. If the practice in the United States courts should prove to be otherwise, the plaintiff should apply to the court which appointed the receivers for leave to have the subjoined decree against them carried into effect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-3\">We have found as a fact that the contract of May 21, 1891, was executed by A. A. McLeod, president of the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company, with notice and full knowledge of the provisions of the agreement of September 30, 1882. This was notice to the company which he represented, upon the familiar doctrine that a principal is charged with notice of every fact coming to the knowledge of his agent, which is connected with the business in which the agent is employed. It was he who negotiated for the purchase of a controlling interest in the capital stock of the parties of the third and fourth parts to the agreement of September 20,1882, and it was he who affixed the name of the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company to the contract of purchase. Notice to him of any fact relating to the business which was being transacted was clearly notice to the company of which he was both president and agent. We determine in a later part of this opinion that a lessee of a portion of the road of the South Mountain Railway &amp; Mining Company, with notice of the agreement of September 30, 1882, is bound to observe the terms thereof. A fortiori, the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company is bound to observe its terms.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-4\">THE HUNTEB\u2019s BUN &amp; SLATE BELT BAILBOAD COMPANY.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-5\">The position is taken on behalf of the Hunter\u2019s Run &amp; Slate Belt Railroad Company that there is no obligation on its part to observe the terms and provisions of the agreement of September 30,1882. Said company is the lessee of that portion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>line of the South Mountain Railway &amp; Mining Company which extends from Hunter\u2019s Run to Pine Grove, a distance of about eight miles. J. C. Fuller, the president of the lessee corporation, testified that prior to and at the time of the execution of the contract of May 21, 1891, for the sale of stock, both he and the said corporation had notice of the agreement of September 30, 1882. Under these circumstances the lessee became bound to carry out the terms of said agreement so far as they appertained to the portion of the road leased. The law upon this subject seems now to be settled. In Joy v. St. Louis, 138 U. S. 1, it was held that the covenants in a tripartite agreement between the commissioners of a park and two railroad companies, as to the use by other railroad companies of a right of way which was granted to the contracting companies through the park, were binding upon subsequent purchasers from one of the railroad companies, with notice. A large number of cases in support of the proposition are cited in the opinion of the court on page 34. Valid contracts made by a corporation survive even its dissolution by voluntary surrender or sale of its franchises: Railroad Co. v. Howard, 7 Wall. 392.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-4\">The general rule is thus stated in 19 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 897 : upon the execution of the lease, the lessee becomes bound by all the prohibitions and limitations contained in the charter of the lessor and assumes its rights, franchises and obligations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-5\">The evidence in the case has failed to show any violation by the Hunter\u2019s Run &amp; Slate Belt Railroad Company as to the leased road between Hunter\u2019s Run and Pine Grove, of the covenants of the agreement of September 30, 1882, and for that reason the prayer for an injunction against it is refused. Yet as said company, by the contract of July 20, 1891, has covenanted for the period of nine hundred and ninety-nine years to send to destination, so far as it lawfully may, all traffic of every kind, by way of the lines of the consolidated company, and of the lines owned and controlled or operated by the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company, it is proper that there should be a decree against it for specific performance as to business interchanged between the roads of plaintiffs and the eight miles of leased road.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-6\">Section 7 of prayer 3 of the bill is for a decree that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg Railway Company shall run its passenger trains so as to afford the passenger trains of the Cumberland Valley Railroad Company close and convenient connections at Gettysburg Junction, the point of intersection. There is no provision in the agreement of September 30, 1882, that its passenger trains shall he so run, and the decree ashed for would have no better basis than an implication from the general covenants in said agreement in relation to promoting and facilitating the interchange of cars and business between the respective roads of the parties thereto. With how many passenger trains of the Cumberland Valley Railroad Company should close connections be made, and with which particular trains ? The court has no light upon this subject, either in the agreement, the bill, or the evidence. The decree, if granted, would offend against the rule that a contract to be specifically enforced must be certain and definite in its terms, and against another rule, which is a deduction from the above, that equity may enforce agreements hut may not make them. The decree is therefore refused. *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-3\">Section 8 of prayer 3 is for a decree that the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg Railway Company shall operate its road exclusively in connection with the roads of plaintiffs, except as to shipments specifically routed or destined to points not reasonably accessible by said lines. We do not find any covenant in the agreement of September 30, 1882, which either expressly or by implication binds the parties of the third and fourth parts to so operate their roads, and the decree asked for is therefore refused. Section 9 of prayer 3 is also refused, for the reason that there is no evidence of the solicitation and exertion therein referred to. In accordance with the views hereinbefore expressed, we enter the appended decree.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-4\">DECREE.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-5\">And now June 26, 1895, the court does order and decree that the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg Railway Company shall observe and perform those covenants in the agreement between the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, the Cumberland Valley Railroad Company, the South Mountain Railway &amp; Mining Company and the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg Railroad Company, dated September 30, 1882, arid recited in paragraph 2 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>bill, wbicb are to be performed by tbe third and fourth parties thereto, especially in the following matters, as to the performance of which we adjudge that breaches have been shown.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-4\">Wherefore it is ordered and decreed that the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg Railway Company shall do and perform as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-5\">First.

The court does further adjudge and decree that the Hunter\u2019s Run &amp; Slate Belt Railroad Company henceforth treat clause 5 (which is recited in the bill) of the lease and traffic contract of July 18, 1891, as inoperative, null and void in so far as it conflicts with the rights of the plaintiffs, under the agreement of September 30,1882, and that it specifically perform the covenants of said agreement which are to be performed by the party of the third part thereto, as to business interchanged between the roads of plaintiffs and the leased road extending from Hunter\u2019s Run to Pine Grove.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-11\">Seventh.

From Carlisle, a point on the Cumberland Yalley Railroad eighteen miles southwest of Harrisburg, the South Mountain Railway &amp; Mining Company operated a railroad for eighteen miles to Pine Grove, hr a southeasterly direction; this road had a connection and interchanged traffic with the Cumberland Valley. In 1882, the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg Railroad was incorporated to be built from Hunter\u2019s Run, a point on the South Mountain Railway about ten miles from Carlisle, to the town of Gettysburg in Adams county, a distance of about twenty-one miles. This last company needed funds to build, and thereupon all four roads named, on 30th of September, 1882, entered into an agreement by which it was covenanted, they would, to promote their mutual interests, interchange traffic and cars on their respective roads; would sell through coupon tickets for passengers ; make through bills of lading for freight; and the joint earnings of the business coming from and going over the Harrisburg &amp; Gettysburg road should be apportioned among the respective parties on a mileage basis thereafter to be agreed upon, and the \u2022whole connecting system of the four roads should be operated in harmony in the development of traffic ; the South Mountain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>and Harrisburg and Gettysburg at the same time covenanting they would, so far as they lawfully could, send traffic to destination over the lines of tibe Cumberland Valley and Pennsylvania Railroads. In consideration thereof, these two last named roads covenanted to set apart fifteen per cent of the gross receipts of freight and passenger traffic to and from any points upon the South Mountain and Gettysburg and Harrisburg roads to and from any points on the Cumberland Valley and Pennsylvania roads, and pay the same to the trustee in a mortgage of $250,000 to secure bonds to be issued on such mortgage on the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg Railroad, the bonds to be payable in thirty years with interest at six per cent, the trustee to appropriate the fund thus raised annually in the purchase of the bonds; it was further agreed the trustee should attach to each bond a memorandum of this provision of the agreement. The bonds were soon after all sold at par, and the road completed to Gettysburg in April, 1884. A prosperous business was built up; the Cumberland Valley paid, of the fifteen per cent set apart by it in the purchase of bonds in the first five years after the road was opened, $18,000, and the Pennsylvania, $19,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">In May, 1891, the Philadelphia, &amp; Reading Railroad purchased a controlling interest in the stock of the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg road, and all of the stock of the South Mountain, immediately after, the boards of directors in each company were changed, and officers and employees of the Reading were put in their places, and the two roads consolidated under the name of the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg Railway Company. About the same time, the Hunter\u2019s Run &amp; Slate Belt Railroad was incorporated to build a road from Pine Grove, the southern terminus of the South Mountain, to the slate quarries, a distance of about five miles; then, a traffic contract for the term of nine hundred and ninety-nine years was made between the different companies, and such leases made as were deemed desirable, with the stipulation that all traffic was to be sent to destination by the Reading and lines controlled or operated by its connections. At the date of these contracts, the contract with the Cumberland Valley and Pennsylvania of 80th of September, 1882, was known to all parties. Soon after, by orders of the general manager of the Reading, the connection between trains running on the Cumberland Valley and Pennsylvania was broken, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>through, billing of freight and the sale of coupon tickets were stopped; the theretofore agreement for apportionment of receipts on a mileage basis was also disregarded; in fact, the business accruing to'the Cumberland Valley and Pennsylvania under their traffic contract was practically extinguished, as concerned them. Thereupon these two companies filed this bill setting out these facts and praying: 1. For a decree of specific performance of the contract as against the* Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg Railway Company into which the two contracting roads had been consolidated, and 2. For an injunction against the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Company and its receivers in aid of such decree. The answers filed by defendants really leave nothing in dispute as to the material facts which must control the decree; the right to relief as prayed for is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-3\">The court below, after full hearing, decreed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-4\">\u201c And now June 26, 1895, the court does order and decree that the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg Railway Company shall observe and perform those covenants in the agreement between the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, the Cumberland Valley Railroad Company, the South Mountain Railway &amp; Mining-Company and the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg Railroad Company, dated September 80, 1882, and recited in paragraph 2 of the bill, which are to be performed by the third and fourth parties thereto, especially in the following matters, as to the performance of which we adjudge that breaches have been shown.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-5\">\u201c Wherefor it is ordered and decreed that the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg Railway Company shall do and perform as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-6\">\u201c First. It shall issue coupon tickets to passengers who shall travel from its line via the Cumberland Valley Railroad and the Pennsylvania Railroad, or either of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-7\">\u201cSecond. It shall issue through bills of lading for freight which is shipped from its line via the Cumberland Valley Railroad and the Pennsylvania Railroad, or either of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-8\">\u201c Third. It shall send to destination all traffic controlled by it, via the Cumberland Valley Railroad and the Pennsylvania Railroad, except traffic destined to points not reasonably accessible by those lines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-9\">\u201c Fourth. It shall receive and transport over its line, upon as favorable terms as it gives to any other railroad, all traffic inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>changed by it with the Pennsylvania Railroad Company and the Cumberland Valley Railroad Company, or either of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-4\">\u201c Fifth. It shall furnish its agents with rates on freight via the Cumberland Valley Railroad and the Pennsylvania Railroad, and shall not charge local rates to Carlisle on shipments routed via the Cumberland Valley Railroad so long as such rates are not charged to all other lines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-5\">\u201c Sixth. The cou'rt does further adjudge and decree that the Hunter\u2019s Run &amp; Slate Belt Railroad Company henceforth treat clause 5 (which is recited in the bill) of the lease and traffic contract of July 13, 1891, as inoperative, null and void in so far as it conflicts with the rights of the plaintiffs, under the agreement of September 30, 1882, and that it specifically perform the covenants of said agreement which are to be performed by the party of the third part thereto, as to business interchanged between the roads of plaintiffs and the leased road extending from Hunter\u2019s Run to Pine Grove.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-6\">\u201c Seventh. The Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company and Edward M. Paxson, Elisha P. Wilbur and Joseph S. Harris, receivers of said railroad company, their directors, officers and agents, are hereby perpetually restrained and enjoined from holding possession of and operating the road of the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg Railway. Company in any wise to the detriment of the rights of the plaintiffs under the said agreement of September 30, 1882.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-7\">\u201c Eighth. It is ordered that the costs in this action be paid equally by the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg Railway Company and the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company, or the receivers thereof.\u201d s</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">From this decree, both plaintiffs and defendants have appealed. The plaintiffs assign twenty-nine errors to the decree, defendants, thirty-nine. As to those on either side which question the correctness of any finding of facts by the court below, they are dismissed; we discover no manifest error in any of these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">We are clear in our conclusion, that the South Mountain &amp; Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg form in no reasonable view a parallel and competing line to the Cumberland Valley with which they connect; their line approaches Carlisle, the connecting point, almost at right angles; a glance at any railroad map shows this; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>from Gettysburg to Carlisle, the traffic along this line, when the contract of September 30, 1882, was made, was not one for which the Cumberland Valley could compete; the only competitors that these two short roads could have had at that date were country wagons on the ordinary highways. The contract was not, therefore, forbidden by the constitution. It was in fact an advantage to the public, as well as to the contracting parties, for it relieved the public of the inconvenience of transfer of goods, rebilling, provided for travelers close connections, and necessarily lessened the actual cost of transportation; and there is no evidence the contract was made with a view to increase charges to the shipper; the profits of the contracting parties were expected to result from a lessening of operating expenses to all of them. Any such contract inevitably tends to the advantage of the public, for the cheaper any product can be delivered at destination, the better able is the producer to meet in the market the same products brought to the same destination by other roads, which last always aim to reach and do reach the points where products are marketable. The contract really tends to accomplish the purpose of the general railroad law of 1868, which provides that railroads of a similar character shall have the right to connect upon such terms as may be agreed upon by those who have the management of such roads; and also of the constitution, which declares they shall have the right to connect, and then avows the purpose, that they may \u201c receive and transport each the other\u2019s passengers, tonnage and cars, loaded or empty, without delay or discrimination.\u201d We conclude, therefore, the contract was not between parallel and competing roads; nor was it unlawful in its ostensible purpose. Whether any of its provisions are unlawful, or whether because of the indefiniteness of others, it is incapable of specific execution, are altogether different questions, and these we now proceed to notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-3\">It is alleged by defendants the contract attempts to exclude other railroads from any use of the roads controlled by the contracting parties. This is only inferential; there is nothing in the contract expressive of such intention. The 5th section of the agreement provides that: \u201c The parties of the third and fourth parts (the South Mountain and the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg roads) hereby respectively covenant and agree that they will, so far as they lawfully can, send to destination all traffic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>controlled by them via the lines of the parties of tbe first and second parts hereto.\u201d Then further, the sixth section: \u201cIt being the intention of the parties hereto that their lines shall be worked as far as possible in harmony with each other;\u201d the two stronger roads covenanting that they will, so far as they can consistently with obligations to other parties, promote the development and interchange of traffic, and carry it at as favorable rates as they accord to any others. Up to this point there is nothing even hinting at a course of conduct violative of either the common or statute law. Nor is the eighth obnoxious to the law. It is as follows: \u201cNothing in this contract shall be so construed as to give the use of the roads and facilities of the parties of the first and second parts hereto (the Cumberland Valley and Pennsylvania) to any parties whose interests may be at variance with or unfriendly to said parties, nor shall the same be used hereunder to divert from the parties of the first and second parts, traffic properly tributary to the lines controlled by them.\u201d The object of this provision, it is clear, had no application to circumstances as they existed when the contract was made September 30, 1882. The Philadelphia, Harrisburg &amp; Pittsburg Railroad, running from Shippensburg to Harrisburg and crossing the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg road six miles south of Carlisle, was not opened for nearly ten years after the date of this contract; it is leased and controlled by the Philadelphia &amp; Reading, and not only is a parallel and competing road with the Cumberland Valley, but was probably intended to be such by its promoters. This section of the contract had in contemplation, doubtless, the construction of this or any other road to be thereafter built; but its provisions could not legally prevent either the one party or the other, after a connection was established as provided by law, from interchange of traffic, nor could it prevent shippers from routing freight to destination over any lines they selected, no matter what the point of shipment or destination. All that can be said of this section is, it may have contemplated a violation of law; if it did, no such violation is shown, although the contract was in operation for years. As it is capable of a wholly different and lawful interpretation, we cannot assume it was intended to unlawfully exclude traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">It seems to us, the argument and the authorities cited to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>the illegality of the contract bear on a state of facts other than those found in this case. If this agreement was intended to give a preference to a certain class of shippers or transporters, and to exclude others, shipping and transporting under like circumstances, it would be void, and Sandford v. Railroad Co., 24 Pa. 878, and like cases would be in point. But it is wholly between connecting roads, not competing or parallel, for interchange of traffic upon terms agreed upon; and they expressly disclaim any intention to violate the law by stipulating to promote their mutual interests so far as they lawfully can.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-3\">Before the construction of the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg road, plaintiffs agreed to set aside fifteen per cent of certain gross receipts for purchase of the bonds of that road, which had thirty years to run; that at once gave them a value to the investing public, who, it is to be presumed, now hold them; they have thirty years to run; to every one of them, by full authority of plaintiffs, was appended a memorandum of this agreement; the road was constructed from the money thus received; by virtue of this stipulation, already nearly $40,000 has been set aside and appropriated to the purchase of these bonds, and the action of these plaintiffs, having made this part of the contract, in effect, a contract between them and the bondholder, their liability by the contract will continue until the last bond has been paid; that is, nothing the obligor in the bond, the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg road, may do in violation of the contract, can relieve plaintiffs from, in substance, their contract with the bondholder to continue to set aside fifteen per cent of the gross receipts for purchase of bonds. The South Mountain and Gettysburg roads having received in large part the consideration for entering into the contract, and the contract not being in violation of law, it ought to be enforced specifically, if it be of such terms as that it is capable of enforcement in equity, and if the parties, as they now stand in relation to each other, can be brought within the jurisdiction of equity, so that the hand of a chancellor will reach them.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">First, as to the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg Railway, which by the consolidation now stands as the representative of the South Mountain and Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg Railroad Companies : A controlling interest in the stock of the two merged and consolidated roads was obtained by the Philadelphia &amp; Reading, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>which controlled the Philadelphia, Harrisburg &amp; Pittsburg .Railroad, a parallel and competing line with the Cumberland Valley, constructed long after the contract. It was manifestly, therefore, to the Reading\u2019s interest as the practical owner of a competing line, to break the contract with the plaintiffs. It proceeded to do so without hesitation, acting nominally through the new boards of management in the roads over which it had secured control.' But a change of persons in a corporation board of directors does not change the identity of the corporation, nor its contract liability; nor is the obligation of the other party to the contract affected ; such change can no more relieve the corporation from its contract liability than from the $250,000 mortgage on its corporate property. What effect the dissolution of the corporation under judicial decree or the sale of its franchise and property under proceedings in bankruptcy would have on unsecured contracts are altogether different questions. Here, the two corporations, at the instance of stockholders having full knowledge of the prior contract, were consolidated under a new name and different management; but for juridical purposes, the new managers and new name present no obstacle to a judicial decree for performance of a contract. Equity deals with the substance, not the form, when it seeks to enforce its decrees. This was in effect held in Bald Eagle Valley Railroad v. Nittany Valley Railroad, 171 Pa. 284. Counsel are mistaken in assuming the decision in that case was based solety on Tulk v. Moxhay, 2 Phil. 774. The court below, in the case first cited, had based its decree on Spencer\u2019s case, and Keppell v. Bailey, 2 Myl. &amp; K. 517; Tulk v. Moxhay was cited by us as overruling Keppell v. Bailey, and deciding that where the covenant was, the purchaser and his assigns would use or abstain from using the land in a particular manner, that equity would enforce the covenant against all purchasers with notice of it. The doctrine of that ease has been applied in later eases in England only to restrictive covenants. But this court has not so limited the principle, by confining the administration of equity in like cases to a restraining order; to accomplish equity, where there is no adequate remedy at law, often demands mandatory orders : Thou shalt do, as well as, thou shalt not. True, the restrictive order is generally more easily enforced than one purely mandatory; in practice, often, the latter is incapable of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>enforcement; but where such order can be enforced in aid of an equitable decree it will be issued, and ought to be. In the mere change of name and personnel of the boards we see no serious obstacle to a mandatory writ in aid of a restraining order.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-3\">It is further argued that as the term for which the contract Was made is not fixed, therefore it continued only during the will of the parties, and might be revoked by either on notice. This, as a general proposition, if the fact were as stated, is correct, and it is so held in Phila. etc. Railroad v. River Front Railroad, 168 Pa. 357, and the authorities there cited. But the term in this contract is fixed by the plainest implication; the bonds to be purchased ran for thirty years ; the obligation of plaintiffs was to set aside annually fifteen per cent of the gross receipts, to be used in annual purchase of the bonds. The term of defendants\u2019 obligation under the joint contract must be coextensive as to time with plaintiffs\u2019 obligation to set aside and pay ; that is, thirty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">Nor is the contract so indefinite in its terms that performance cannot be decreed; for nine years they operated their roads under the agreement without, so far as appears, finding it necessary to resort to the arbitration clause in case of dispute; its indefiniteness is first alleged when a motive exists for breaking the contract. While the exact details by which each shall receive and transport promptly the other\u2019s traffic, and how the joint earnings shall be apportioned on a mileage basis, cannot now be particularized by the court, the primary stipulations of the contract are definite, and as to them has been entered a decree that they shall be performed specifically; the purpose of defendants to stop the interchange of traffic under the contract has been arrested by this decree; the contract is now obligatory upon all the parties, and is to be performed according to its manifest intent; when this is done in good faith, the daily operations of the respective roads alone can determine the exact details necessary to effective obedience of the decree. In case of dispute as to the particular methods, either can call into opera,tion the arbitration clause, or if this be unavailing, either can, on proper proof, secure from the court below a supplementary decree, which in the light of the evidence that may then be adduced will carry out fully the decree already made. While parties to such contract can agree definitely that they will pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>mote and facilitate tbe interchange of cars and business between their respective roads, and that the earnings from the joint business shall be apportioned on a mileage basis, it would be practically impossible to enumerate in the agreement all the details by which it should be carried into effect; these would necessarily have to be postponed until the daily operations of the road suggested what would best promote their convenience and that of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">As to the appeal of the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg Railway Company, it is dismissed and the decree affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">For the reasons given by the court below, the decree as against the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company, the Hunter\u2019s Run &amp; Slate Belt Railroad Company and the receivers of the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company is affirmed, and their appeals dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
