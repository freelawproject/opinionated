About a month after the date of the deed, he signed a paper declaring that four other persons had contributed to the purchase money of the property at the sheriff\u2019s sale, and agreeing that he would hold the title for the joint use of himself and the persons who had contributed, and that, when the property was sold or disposed of by him, he would contribute and pay to the contributors each his pro rata share of the proceeds. Seven years afterwards he applied to the defendant\u2019s agent for insurance and the agent asked the insured \u201cwho the title was in,\u201d to which the insured replied \u201c the title is in me, I have the deed.\u201d The defendant subsequently accepted two annual premiums, and the insurance was renewed without any further information or inquiry.

Love, P.

D. Caldwell, the decedent, in his lifetime bought the property upon which the insurance was placed, at sheriff\u2019s sale, December 17, 1884. D. Caldwell, George A. Port, D. Blair, Frank Hefright and James It. Carmon were at the time of the sale creditors of George B. Wharton. The said creditors agreed among themselves that said D. Caldwell should bid in the property and take the legal title in trust for himself and other creditors above named. Subsequently some of the parties transferred their respective interests to others so that when the insurance was effected, which is the subject of this controversy, George A. Port\u2019s interest in the premises was thirty-three sixty-ninths of the whole, J. R. Carmon\u2019s interest, fourteen sixty-ninths of the whole, and D. Caldwell\u2019s interest twenty sixty-ninths of the whole.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-10\">2. D. Caldwell held at the time the policy was placed the legal title in trust for the joint use of himself and George A. Port and J. R. Carmon, in proportion to their respective interests to make sale or dispose of the same and account and pay to each their pro rata share of the net proceeds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-11\">3. The first policy placed in this defendant company was dated January 5,1891, for one year, and renewed from year to year, and was issued in the name of David Caldwell alone, who held the legal title. At the same time policies were taken out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>in other companies upon the same property, all through the same agent representing all of them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-5\">4. From the time of the purchase by David Caldwell, he took charge of the property, looked after it, leased it, paid taxes and insurance thereon up until the time of his decease.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-6\">5. The creditors in purchasing the property did so for the purpose of saving their claims against George B. Wharton, and with a view to have Mr. Caldwell resell the property, and not with a view of operating it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-7\">6. David Caldwell died April 7,1893, and letters of administration were duly issued to I. C. Caldwell upon his estate by the register of Huntingdon county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-8\">7. The property was a boot and shoe manufactory, situated on the west side of Penn street, between Fifteenth and Sixteenth streets, in Huntingdon, and was destroyed by fire on the night of April 11, 1893.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-9\">8. Proofs of loss were duly made out by I. C. Caldwell, administrator of D. Caldwell, setting forth that the property insured belonged exclusively to D. Caldwell\u2019s estate, and that no other person or persons had any interest therein. The said administrator had no knowledge at the time of the interest of George A. Port and J. 11. Cannon in the property, there being nothing in the deed showing any trust, and no declaration of trust recorded, but on learning of their respective interests, concedes that they are entitled to their pro rata share of the insurance, and this suit is maintained for their benefit, as well as of the estate of D. Caldwell.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-10\">9. The insurance was placed by W. H. D\u2019Armitt, as agent of the defendant company, as well as that of the American Insurance Company, and the Queen Insurance Company. He testified that when he first placed the policies in January, 1891, that he asked I). Caldwell who the title was in, and that he replied, \u201cthe title is in me.\u201d On cross-examination, he said he asked the question because he had information of mixed ownership. He also testified that he wrote the policy in the name of D. Caldwell, individually, because he said \u201cthe title is in me, I hold the deed,\u201d and that in subsequent renewals of the policy nothing was said as to the title at all. The statements of Mr. D\u2019Armitt are not modified or contradicted, and could not he, as they were made by the decedent, whose mouth is since closed by death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>10. The policy in suit was issued by defendant company January 5, 1893, for one year in the sum to two thousand (2,000) dollars, of which sum $920 was on the building, $280 on the engine and connections, and $800 on fixed and movable mar chinery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-5\">The total loss suffered as fixed by appraisers was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-6\">Building $1,957 86</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-7\">Machinery, etc.......1,346 50</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-8\">Total......$3,304 36</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-9\">The pro rata share claimed under the policy in suit is as follows: On the building is $783.61, and on the machinery, etc., $538.60, making $1,321.76, with interest from August 10,1893.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-10\">11. The policy contains the following clause: \u201c This entire policy unless otherwise provided by agreement, indorsed hereon, or added hereto, shall be void if the interest of the insured be not truly stated herein .... or if the interest of the insured be otherwise than unconditional and sole ownership; or if the subject of insurance be a building on ground not owned by the insured in fee simple.\u201d The defendant denies liability solely upon the ground of the alleged breach of the above stated provision of the policy by tire insured.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-11\">CONCLUSIONS OK LAW.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-12\">We are asked to hold as a matter of law upon the foregoing facts that there had been such a violation or breach of the provisions of the policy as set forth in the eleventh paragraph of our findings of fact that the plaintiff cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-13\">The question then is: Do the facts as above set forth constitute such a violation of the provisions of the policy as to work a forfeiture thereof and defeat the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover thereon? It is conceded that D. Caldwell at the time the policy was issued, and at the time of the fire, had an insurable interest in the property insured. At the time the policy was issued, D. Caldwell, so far as the legal title showed of record, was the absolute owner thereof. The deed to him contained no condition of trust, nor was there any'declaration of trust in relation thereto upon record. So that the trust under which the legal title was held was a secret trust so far as the public was concerned. The declaration of trust executed by D. Caldwell, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>George A. Port and Joseph It. Cannon, January 7, 1885, defines the nature of the trust, as follows: \u201c The said Caldwell agrees to hold the title to the said property, purchased as aforesaid, for the joint use of himself and such of us as have contributed to the payment of the purchase-money aforesaid and when said property aforesaid is sold or disposed of by him he will distribute and pay to each contributor, as aforesaid, his <em>pro rata </em>share of the net proceeds thereof.\u201d The condition of the trust, as above stated, left the property in the hands of the trustee, with power to sell and dispose of the same and account for the proceeds to his cestuis que trust. It then can hardly be said that a tenancy in common existed under its terms. It is not necessary to cite the very numerous decisions of our own courts and those of other states construing what amounts to \u201c unconditional and sole ownership \u201d as contained in the policy. It has been held that a vendee under articles having paid part of the purchase money, the vendor still holding the legal title, is such owner, and that such ownership by the insured is not a violation of such a clause in the policy. It has also been ruled that if the insured after taking out a policy with a clause such as contained in this policy, sell the property insured, under an executory contract, and retain the legal title until purchase money be paid, and loss occur before purchase money be paid or deed executed, is not a violation of the condition: Walter v. Sun Fire Office, 165 Pa. 381; Burson v. Fire Association, 136 Pa. 267; Penna. Fire Insurance Company v. Dougherty, 102 Pa. 568; Imperial Fire Insurance Co. v. Henry Dunham, 117 Pa. 460; Chandler v. The Commerce Fire Insurance Company of New York, 88 Pa. 223.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-5\">We think in view of the character of the trust, which in our opinion is of such a nature as does not create a tenancy in common, that it is doubtful whether the cestui que trust could sustain proceedings in partition under its provisions, that the title and ownership of the insured does not violate the provisions of the policy. And we are inclined to think that under the express term of the trust, had D. Caldwell been negligent in not looking after and keeping the propferty insured and loss had occurred, he might have been called upon to make good the loss to his cestuis que trust, as he could be called upon to account to them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-6\">There is no question that a trustee may insure in his own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>name property in -which he has an insurable interest for himself and the benefit of his cestui que trust, and recover upon the policy the whole insurance, .and pay over the proportion to his cestuis que trust, to which he is entitled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-5\">The insurance in this case was to cover the entire interest in the property. The premiums in full were duly paid for the insurance of the whole. When the policies were first taken out in 1891, W. H. D\u2019Armitt testifies that he asked the insured in whom the title was, and the insured replied that, \u201c the title is in me, I hold the deed.\u201d He did not inquire as to the character of the ownership. He further testifies that he asked the question as to whom the title was in, because he had information as to mixed ownership. He does not state what information he had or from whom he received it. He says further, that when Mr. Caldwell told him that the title was in him; that he held the deed, that he (D\u2019Armitt) took it for granted that Caldwell had bought the others out; by fuller inquiry he would no doubt have learned, if he did not know, the real character of the ownership. It seems to us that according to Mr. D\u2019Armitt\u2019s own testimony he had such information that practically amounted to knowledge of the interests of the other parties therein. The answer of Mr. Caldwell that the title was in him, that he held the deed, would seem to import that. If so, then may it not be fair to presume that the insurance was placed with such information as to ownership as was tantamount to knowledge thereof. And if so, then the company would be liable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-6\">When the present policy in suit was written there was no question or inquiry as to the title or ownership, and no change in the nature or character thereof had been made. There is no allegation of fraud, or that untruthful answers were given as to title, or that there was any increase of risk. We are therefore of the opinion that under all the facts in the case the plaintiff is entitled to recover, and therefore direct judgment to be entered in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of fourteen hundred and sixty-seven dollars and fifteen cents ($1,467.15), being the amount of the pro rata fixed by the adjustment of loss, to wit: The sum of $1,321.76, with interest from August 10,1893, to this date, July 9, 1895, unless exceptions be filed according to law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Upon exception the court filed an opinion which is in part as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-4\">The first exception is that we failed to find sufficiently as a fact \u201c that J. R. Carmon, Geo. A. Port, David Blair and Frank Hefright, each contributed his proportion to the purchase money of the property claimed to be covered by the policy,\u201d etc. While in our findings of fact we did not state specifically that the said parties had contributed their respective shares of the purchase money, yet it was so treated in our disposition of the case, and we now do find as a fact that the said J. R. Carmon, Geo. A. Port, David Blair and Frank Hefright each paid his proportion of the purchase money paid for the property covered by the policy as per agreement of June 27,1885, offered in evidence, and that D. Caldwell at the time of placing the policy which is in suit was the owner of the interest of Frank Hefright, it having been transferred to him sometime prior thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-5\">We find as a fact that the title to the premises in question remained in D. Caldwell up to the time of his decease, April 6, 1893, and in his estate under the terms of the agreement of trust dated June 27, 1885, for himself or his estate, and J. R. Carmon and George A. Port, until after the fire, and that subsequent to the fire, to wit: June 30, 1893, the said premises were conveyed by the estate of David Caldwell, Geo. A. Port and wife and J. R. Carmon and wife to J. R. Kendig, the cestuis que trust thus joining in the deed. . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-6\">The evidence of Mr. D\u2019Armitt the agent of the defendant company, who placed the policy in suit, shows that, when he placed the first policy in January, 1891, upon the property in question, he asked Mr. D. Caldwell, \u201c Who is the title in? \u201d Mr. D. Caldwell said \u201c The title is in me, I hold the deed.\u201d He also testifies that the reason he asked the question was that he had information of a mixed ownership.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-7\">In this case the agent of the company evidently had knowledge of the ownership of the property in question about the time of the fire, or shortly after, which occurred April 11,1893, and on May 18,1893, had an award of appraisers chosen by the company and the assured, adjusting the loss. It might be a question whether the company knowing the nature of the ownership of the property and going on to appraise the loss and adjust the same under the terms of the policy providing for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>appraisement thereof, and putting the assured to the expense of such appointment, could not be held to have waived the condition of sole and unconditional ownership.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b519-4\">Our attention has been especially called to the cases of Diffenbaugh\u2019s Appeal, 150 Pa. 270, and that of Schroedel v. Humbolt Fire Ins. Co., 158 Pa. 459. In the case of Diffenbaugh\u2019s Appeal, the husband took out a policy in his own name on his wife\u2019s property. She had the title and insurable interest. The husband had no insurable interest whatever, and it was held that the condition of the policy making it void if the interest of the insured be not truly stated therein was violated and a suit on the policy by the wife could not be maintained. In the case of Schroedel v. Ins. Co., there the title was in the name of John and Bertha Schroedel and the policy was issued in the name of John Schroedel alone. Had the title in that case been wholly in John Schroedel, and he had held one half in trust for his wife, by a declaration of trust made to her, and he had power to sell and dispose of the property and account to her for one half of the proceeds, then the case would have been similar to the one trying. We do not however think the principle described in those cases controls the one at bar.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b519-5\">And now, December 81, 1895, we therefore, except wherein we have stated our additional findings of fact, overrule the other exceptions and direct judgment to be entered in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of $1,467.15, in accordance with our findings July 9, 1895.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b519-6\"><em>Error assigned </em>was entry of judgment for plaintiff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b519-7\"><em>Isaac S. </em>Sharp, of <em>Sharp &amp; </em>Alleman, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4_\">The rule applicable where there is no trust relation does not apply where there is such relation.

His findings of fact together with his conclusions of law are set forth in the record and need not be repeated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The policy in suit provides, among other things, that it \u201c shall be void if the interest of the insured be not truly stated therein .... or if the interest of the insured be otherwise than unconditional and sole ownership.\u201d The learned judge was asked to hold, as matter of law, that there had been such violation of these provisions of the policy that there could be no recovery thereon. This he refused to do ; and, in view of the facts, and for reasons suggested by him in support of his judgment we are not prepared to say there is any substantial error therein. We find nothing in the record that requires a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s intestate, David Caldwell, acquired title to the property insured by sheriff\u2019s deed in December, 1884. In January following he signed a paper recognizing the fact that George A. Port and three others had contributed to the purchase money of the property at the sheriff\u2019s sale and agreeing that, when the property is sold or disposed of by him, he will distribute and pay to said contributors each Iris pro rata share of the proceeds. This declaration left the property in the hands of Caldwell, the sheriff\u2019s vendee, with full power to sell or dispose of the same, as he might deem best, and account to the parties above referred to for their respective portions of the proceeds. In that way he held the legal title to the property and controlled the same until his death in April, 1893.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">In January, 1891, when he applied to Mr. D\u2019Armitt, defendant\u2019s agent at Huntingdon where the property was located and where both the insured and the agent resided, for insurance on the buildings, said agent asked Caldwell \u201c who the title was in,\u201d to which the latter replied: \u201c the title is in me, I have the deed.\u201d D\u2019Armitt further testified, in substance, that the rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>son he asked this question was because he had information of a \u201c mixed ownership \u201d of the property. He did not say from whom he derived that information. If he knew, as he testified he did, that more than one person was interested in the property or the proceeds thereof, and desired to ascertain who they were, etc., he should have prosecuted his inquiry further by asking Caldwell who, if any one, other than himself, was interested in the property or the proceeds thereof; but, he did not do so. On receiving Caldwell\u2019s answer which was directly responsive to his question, he appears to have been satisfied with the information thus communicated, viz: that the legal title to the property was in Caldwell and that he had the deed therefor; and thereupon, as he says, he wrote the policy in Caldwell\u2019s name, individually delivered it to him and received the premium. In the circumstances attending the writing and delivery of the first policy, Caldwell doubtless believed, and was warranted in assuming, that everything was satisfactory to the company. In January, 1892, and again in 1893, the annual premiums were paid by plaintiff\u2019s intestate, and the insurance was renewed in his name alone, as before, without any further information or inquiry by either party. The company, through its agent, previously knew that more than one person was interested in the property or the proceeds thereof, and nothing was ever said or done by the insured to indicate anything to the contrary. As was rightly found by the court below, the insured acted in entire good faith.

Spencer, 53 Pa. 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
