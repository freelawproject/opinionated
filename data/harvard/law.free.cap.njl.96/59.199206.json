He entered a plea of guilty and then moved in arrest of judgment on the ground that the indictment did not charge a crime because as no license could be granted to sell intoxicating liquors which would be protective under the section mentioned it became nugatory, and the selling which it forbids is no longer a crime. <em>Held, </em>that when the offence charged was committed, selling intoxicating liquors without a license was a crime without regard to the reason why the violator could not obtain a license to sell.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-9\">On error to the Middlesex Oyer and Terminer.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b106-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Before Gummebe, Ci-iiee Justice, and' Justices Bebgen and Tyatzebbach.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b106-6\">Eor the state, <em>Joseph E.

The fallacy in appellant\u2019s argument is that section 66 has nothing to do with the granting of licenses, and its only effect is to forbid sales without a license, and if none can be obtained for any reason whatever, that does not abrogate the law forbidding sales without it. The act of 1888 <em>(Pamph. L., p. </em>142) forbids the sale of liquor without a license and then provided that if by a majority vote any county should declare against the sale of intoxicating liquors, \"no&gt; license\u201d should be granted to any person to keep an inn or tavern, or to sell intoxicating liquors. The constitutionality of that act was approved by the Court of Errors and Appeals in <em>Paul </em>v. <em>Gloucester </em>County, 50 <em>N. J. L. </em>585. The argument of the appellant leads to the absurd conclusion that if any county adopted the option, under the act of 1888, forbidding the sale of liquors and consequently the granting of licenses to sell intoxicating'liquors, that part of the act prohibiting such sales was abrogated, because no license could be granted, and, therefore, no one in such, county could violate the law against the sales of liquor if he should sell the same without restriction and without a license, producing a situation beyond the wildest dream of the most ardent anti-local optionist. The motion to arrest was property denied and the judgment will be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>There were four other cases submitted on the same argument, viz.: State <em>v. </em>Webber, State <em>v. </em>Intervartolo, State <em>v. </em>Colura and State <em>v. </em>Fierenza. The reasons given above for affirmance are applicable to the cases last named and the judgments of conviction in each of them will be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
