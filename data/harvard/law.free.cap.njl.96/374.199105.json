The defendant then applied to the Court of Oyer and Terminer, in which he was convicted, to be admitted to bail during the appeal. The trial court refused this application and he obtained a writ of <em>certiorari </em>to review this action. <em>Held, </em>that as the charge against the defendant was a capital offence, it continued to be such until the final disposition of the cause on appeal, and that section 143 of the Criminal Procedure act requiring the court in which the judgment had been rendered to admit defendant to bail pending the prosecution of writ of error, is not available to the defendant because the act provides that this section \u201cshall not apply to capital cases.\u201d <em>Query. </em>Is <em>certiorari </em>the proper remedy in such case?</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-9\">On <em>certiorari.</em></summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b420-10\">Before Justices Teenohabd, Bergen and Minturn.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b420-11\">For the defendant, <em>J.

Whereupon the defendant caused a writ of error to be issued removing the record of his conviction from the Court of Oyer and Terminer to the Court of Errors and Appeals for the purpose of reviewing the judgment based on the verdict. While this writ of error was pending defendant made an application under section 143 of the Criminal Procedure act to the Oourt of Oyer and Terminer where he was convicted, to be admitted to bail, which the court denied on the ground that the offence c\u00f1arged was a capital one, the statute relied upon containing this proviso, \u201cibis section shall not apply to capital cases.\u201d Without passing upon the question whether the action of the trial court in refusing to admit defendant to bail can be properly reviewed by a writ of <em>certiorari </em>rather than by an application for <em>mandamus, </em>or proceeding by a writ of <em>habeas om'pus, </em>as in <em>State </em>v. <em>Rockafellow, </em>6 <em>N. J. L. </em>332, we think this writ should be dismissed, because we agree with the Court of Oyer and Terminer thal it was not authorized by the statute referred to to admit the defendant to hail pending his writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Assuming, as the defendant argues, that a capital case is one in which the only punishment is death, we have then this situation, viz., the defendant is held under an indictment which charges a capital offence and the judgment against him does not require the taking of his life but that be be immediately imprisoned for life. Notwithstanding this condition, the defendant caused a writ of error to issue for the purpose of reversing that judgment, and he will, if successful, still remain charged with a capital offence, and a jury on the second trial might wilhhold any recommendation relating to the punishment to be inflicted if they should convict him of murder in the first degree. In our opinion, in a case where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>the indictment charges the defendant with murder, it remains a capital one until the cause is finally disposed of, and is not within the mandatoiy clause of the section referred to, because the crime charged is a capital one, and its character is not changed by bringing a writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">The writ should be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
