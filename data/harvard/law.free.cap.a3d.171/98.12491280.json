Gostyla, appeals from the judgment of the trial court, rendered after a jury trial, in favor of the defendant, Bryan Chambers. The plaintiff claims that he is entitled to a new trial because the court improperly allowed one of the defendant's expert witnesses, a biomechanical engineer, to provide opinion testimony on a matter that went beyond the purview of his expertise in biomechanics, namely, whether the plaintiff's personal injuries were caused by the collision. Although we agree that the challenged testimony was improper, the plaintiff has not provided us with an adequate record to determine whether the error was harmful. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are pertinent to this appeal. In 2013, the plaintiff commenced this negligence action seeking compensatory damages for personal injuries he sustained as a result of a motor vehicle collision that occurred on May 19, 2011. In his amended complaint, the plaintiff alleged that he was operating his vehicle behind the defendant's dump truck\n   when the defendant suddenly stopped and began driving his truck in reverse, colliding with the plaintiff's vehicle and pushing it several feet. The plaintiff further alleged that, as a result of the defendant's negligence, he sustained, inter alia, knee and hip injuries and a core muscle injury in his abdomen that required surgery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In his answer, the defendant admitted that he acted negligently, but left the plaintiff to his proof with regard to the issue of causation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Prior to trial, the defendant disclosed Calum McRae, a biomechanical engineer, as an expert witness. Because McRae would be unavailable to testify at trial, the parties conducted a videotaped deposition of him on July 24, 2015. The plaintiff did not object to McRae being considered an expert in the field of biomechanics. During his direct examination, McRae explained that biomechanical engineers use fundamental principles of physics and engineering\n   to determine the amount of force necessary to cause certain kinds of injuries and whether a particular situation generated that level of force. McRae testified that, after reviewing a multitude of documents relevant to the plaintiff's injuries and the collision,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   he was able to determine that the collision caused the plaintiff to experience, at the very most, a g-force of 2.3, slightly less than the force a person would experience from \"sitting down quickly\" in a chair. McRae admitted, however, that he was not qualified to contest the accuracy of the diagnoses of the plaintiff's\n   injuries. The defendant's counsel then asked: \"[B]ased upon a reasonable degree of scientific and biomechanical certainty, was the motor vehicle accident in question here today the cause of the [p]laintiff's injuries?\" Over the plaintiff's objection, McRae answered: \"No, sir, it was not.\" During cross-examination, McRae admitted that he was not a medical doctor and did not have experience treating patients for injuries. When asked whether biomechanical engineers are not qualified to render medical opinions regarding the precise cause of a specific injury to a specific individual, McRae replied: \"Well, sir, biomechanical engineers provide biomechanical opinions, not medical opinions, sir. And in that respect, they opine specifically on individuals.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Thereafter, the plaintiff filed a motion in limine seeking to exclude, inter alia, the portion of McRae's testimony in which he opined that the collision did not cause the plaintiff's injuries. The plaintiff asserted that McRae was not qualified to render such an opinion because he was not a medical doctor and did not have experience diagnosing or treating injuries. The court heard argument on the plaintiff's motion at a pretrial hearing on September 1, 2015. After ordering a brief recess to review, inter alia, the transcript of McRae's video deposition, the court ruled that McRae's causation testimony was admissible because it was \"relevant for the purpose [for which] it [was] being offered,\" and was \"not a medical opinion regarding causation, but one based on biomechanical engineering.\" The court also noted that the plaintiff's counsel had an opportunity to highlight McRae's purported lack of qualifications to opine on the issue of causation during cross-examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At trial, the defendant played McRae's video deposition for the jury, including the portion in which McRae opined that the plaintiff's injuries were not caused by the collision. Following the trial, the jury returned a\n   verdict for the defendant. The court denied the plaintiff's motion to set aside the verdict and rendered a judgment for the defendant. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The plaintiff claims that the court improperly admitted McRae's opinion testimony on the issue of causation because McRae, as a biomechanical engineer, was not qualified to render such an opinion. Although we conclude that the court abused its discretion in admitting McRae's causation testimony, the plaintiff is not entitled to a new trial because he has failed to provide us with an adequate record to determine whether the error had any effect on the outcome of the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We begin by determining whether McRae's opinion testimony that the\n   plaintiff's injuries were not caused by the collision was improperly admitted. \"[T]he trial court has wide discretion in ruling on the admissibility of expert testimony and, unless that discretion has been abused or the ruling involves a clear misconception of the law, the trial court's decision will not be disturbed. ... In determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion, the ultimate issue is whether the court could reasonably conclude as it did.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Vitali\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Southern New England Ear, Nose, Throat &amp; Facial Plastic Surgery Group, LLP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=153%20Conn.%20App.%20753\">\n    153 Conn.App. 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 756-57,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=107%20A.3d%20422\">\n    107 A.3d 422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014).\n   \"Expert testimony should be admitted when: (1) the witness has a special skill or knowledge directly applicable to a matter in issue, (2) that skill or knowledge is not common to the average person, and (3) the testimony would be helpful to the court or jury in considering the issues. ...

It is well settled that trial courts have discretion to permit expert witnesses to render opinions as to certain matters but not others.

Decisions from other courts, however, consistently have recognized that, although biomechanical engineers are qualified to testify about the amount of force generated by a collision and the likely effects of that force on the human body, they are not qualified to render\n   opinions about whether a collision caused or contributed to a particular individual's specific injuries because they are not medical doctors. For instance, in\n   <em>\n    Smelser\n   </em>\n   , the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the trial court had improperly admitted opinion testimony from a biomechanical engineer regarding the causes of the plaintiff's injuries, which purportedly stemmed from a motor vehicle accident, because such testimony went \"beyond [his] expertise in biomechanics.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7630660\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/105/299/#p305\">\n    Id., at 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As a biomechanical engineer, McRae was qualified to provide his opinion as to the amount of force generated by the May 19, 2011 collision and the types of injuries likely to result from exposure to that amount of force. His testimony that\n   <em>\n    this specific plaintiff\n   </em>\n   's injuries were not caused by the collision, however, exceeded his expertise in biomechanics and should have been excluded. Opinion testimony regarding the cause of specific injuries \"requires the identification and diagnosis of a medical condition, which demands the expertise and specialized training of a medical doctor.\"\n   <em>\n    Bowers\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Norfolk Southern Corp.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3667453\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/537/1343/#p1377\">\n    537 F.Supp.2d at 1377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . McRae's causation testimony was, therefore, a medical opinion, not a biomechanical one. Because, as he readily admitted, he was\n   not a medical doctor and did not have experience diagnosing or treating injuries, he did not possess the \"reasonable qualifications\" required to offer such an opinion.\n   See\n   <em>\n    Weaver\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    McKnight\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=313%20Conn.%20393\">\n    313 Conn. at 408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=97%20A.3d%20920\">\n    97 A.3d 920\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   That McRae formulated his opinion in part through reviewing a subset of the plaintiff's medical records and other documents related to the accident; see footnote 2 of this opinion; does not alter our analysis.
