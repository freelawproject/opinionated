Redmond, who is the father of Patrick S. Redmond, the defendant in the underlying criminal proceeding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In his writ of error, Redmond alleges that the trial court improperly (1) ordered the forfeiture of certain seized property pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-36a and (2) entered its forfeiture order without providing him notice and an opportunity to be heard in violation of the in rem forfeiture procedures set forth in General Statutes (Rev. to 2013) \u00a7 54-33g.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons that follow, we disagree and dismiss the writ of error.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following relevant facts and procedural history are apparent on the record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This writ of error concerns\n   sixteen firearms,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   at least one magazine, and an unknown quantity of ammunition that were seized by the police on February 13, 2013, pursuant to a valid search warrant issued in the course of a narcotics investigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   That investigation revealed that the defendant was selling drugs from a residence owned by Redmond, and occupied by both Redmond and the defendant. The residence was not subdivided, and Redmond and the defendant had equal access to all areas of the residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   During their search of the residence, the police found nine of the sixteen firearms \"scattered about the living quarters, hidden in the seat cushions, in a dresser, leaned up against the walls,\" hidden under a couch in the living room, as well as in the defendant's bedroom. The remaining seven weapons were found in a safe on the second floor of the residence, which the defendant opened using a key in order to surrender the weapons to the police. Alongside these weapons, the police also seized various narcotics and narcotics paraphernalia. Redmond was not present for the search of the residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Later that day, the defendant was arrested. After receiving\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   warnings, the defendant provided the police with a sworn statement in which he admitted his ownership of many of the seized weapons, and\n   asserted that Redmond consented to his possession and use of the remaining weapons. The defendant also told the police that Redmond knew that he was selling narcotics from the residence and had previously asked him to cease doing so. Nothing in the record suggests that Redmond took steps to limit the defendant's access to the weapons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The defendant thereafter was charged with eight counts of drug and weapon offenses,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   for which he faced a significant term of imprisonment if convicted. Over the next four months, the defendant engaged in plea negotiations with the state in which the court,\n   <em>\n    Ginocchio, J\n   </em>\n   ., actively participated. During those negotiations, the defendant was represented by Attorney Anthony F. DiPentima. At that time, DiPentima also provided counsel to Redmond, though Redmond was not a party to the criminal action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Redmond's awareness of both the plea negotiations and the contemplated forfeiture of the weapons was\n   made clear to the court and the state through DiPentima, and it appears that Redmond was present for at least some of those negotiations. From the outset, the plea negotiations involved\n   leveraging the disposition of the seized property to obtain a more favorable disposition of the charges against the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On March 18, 2013, Redmond executed an affidavit, witnessed by DiPentima in his capacity as a commissioner of the Superior Court, claiming ownership of the seized weapons, ammunition, and magazine. This affidavit, however, was never submitted to the court or the state. The prosecutor also indicated that the agreement to surrender all of the disputed property in return for favorable treatment was suggested by DiPentima.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On May 31, 2013, the state agreed to nolle six of the eight charges against the defendant. In return, the defendant agreed to (1) forfeit the seized property to the state for destruction; (2) plead guilty to one count of possession with intent to sell in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-277(b) ; and (3) enter an\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   to one count of illegal transfer of a pistol or revolver in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 2013) \u00a7 29-33.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   At that time, the terms of the plea agreement were put on the record, including the forfeiture and destruction of the disputed property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The agreement contemplated a total effective sentence of eight years, execution suspended after three years, with three years of probation, and the defendant retained the right to argue for a lesser sentence at the sentencing hearing on December 10, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At that hearing, DiPentima argued for a suspended sentence for the defendant, as the defendant had already been incarcerated for approximately four months. He also offered the following argument regarding Redmond's interest in the seized firearms: \"We've talked about the weapons. There's been a lot of angst and concern, especially from [Redmond], a devout hunter, a man who has owned firearms responsibly for a number of years, [about] the ownership of those firearms, despite the fact as to where in the house the firearms were located, even though it was not a separate apartment, per se, where [the defendant] resided with his fianc\u00e9.\" At the conclusion of that hearing, the court imposed a total effective sentence of eight years of imprisonment, execution suspended, with three years of probation. The court also ordered the forfeiture and destruction of the weapons, magazine, and ammunition. At the sentencing hearing, Redmond did not object to the forfeiture and destruction of the disputed property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The leniency of the defendant's sentence is apparent when compared with the maximum sentence allowed by the General Statutes that the defendant would have potentially faced had he proceeded to trial\n   under these charges. The total effective sentence, for the charges the defendant entered pleas on, was twelve years of imprisonment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, had the defendant proceeded to trial on the charges the state agreed to nolle pursuant to this agreement, he would have potentially faced an additional twenty-nine years and three months of imprisonment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Redmond subsequently hired new\n   counsel who filed on his behalf a \"Motion for Stay of Order of Destruction and Return of Seized Property\" with the criminal court, in which he claimed to be the owner of the firearms and argued that \u00a7 54-33g gave him a right to notice of any forfeiture proceeding.

Redmond made this motion in the concluded criminal matter rather than initiating a separate action. The court held hearings on the motion on March 14, 2014, and April 15, 2014, at which Redmond and the state offered argument, but no evidence or testimony was taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The court thereafter denied Redmond's motion. Although the court did not issue a written decision, the grounds on which the court denied the motion were stated during the April 15, 2014 hearing. Specifically, the court indicated that (1) no notice was required because the property was ordered forfeited under \u00a7 54-36a(c), as interpreted by\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Garcia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5754213\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/108/533/#p554\">\n    108 Conn.App. 533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 554-55,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=949%20A.2d%20499\">\n    949 A.2d 499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3964184,3962981,3963566\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/289/916/\">\n    289 Conn. 916\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=957%20A.2d%20880\">\n    957 A.2d 880\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008), and not under \u00a7 54-33g, as argued by Redmond, and (2) the nexus between the property and the crimes rendered an in rem forfeiture proceeding unnecessary because, under\n   <em>\n    Garcia\n   </em>\n   , that nexus allows the court to order forfeiture pursuant to \u00a7 54-36a(c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   From that judgment, Redmond appealed to this court, claiming that the court improperly (1) concluded that the seized property met the statutory definition of contraband in \u00a7 54-36a and (2) disposed of the property without giving him proper notice and an opportunity to be heard.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Redmond\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=161%20Conn.%20App.%20622\">\n    161 Conn.App. at 624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=128%20A.3d%20956\">\n    128 A.3d 956\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We dismissed his appeal on the ground that this court lacked jurisdiction to consider these claims in a direct appeal of the criminal conviction\n   because Redmond was not a party to the underlying proceeding.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=128%20A.3d%20956\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   In so doing, we observed that the appropriate vehicle for such claims is a writ of error. Id., at 626-27,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=128%20A.3d%20956\">\n    128 A.3d 956\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Redmond then filed this writ of error with the Supreme Court, which transferred the case to our docket pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In his writ of error, Redmond raises two claims. First, he argues that the court improperly ordered the forfeiture of the seized property under \u00a7 54-36a(c) because an in rem forfeiture proceeding under \u00a7 54-33g was required to effectuate the forfeiture. Second, Redmond\n   argues that the order of forfeiture was improper because the court failed to provide him proper notice and an opportunity to be heard as required by \u00a7 54-33g, which requires the court to give notice to any person with an interest in property that is proposed to be forfeited on the ground that it is a nuisance as the instrumentality of a crime, and to hold a hearing on the forfeiture within six to twelve days of such notice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   In his claim for relief, he asks this court to reverse and set aside the April 15,\n   2014 decision on his motion for return of his property.\n   Practice Book \u00a7 72-1(a)(1) provides that a nonparty may bring a writ of error in matters of law from the final judgment of the Superior Court where that judgment is binding on that nonparty and the nonparty is aggrieved by that judgment. Accordingly, our scope of review is circumscribed in such matters and is limited to questions of law only. See E. Prescott, Connecticut Appellate Practice &amp; Procedure (5th Ed. 2016) \u00a7 9-1:6, p. 524. \"A writ of error ... necessarily presents a question of law. When the trial court draws conclusions of law, our review is plenary and [an appellate court] must decide whether its conclusions are legally and logically correct and find support in the facts that appear in the record.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Sowell\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    DiCara\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=161%20Conn.%20App.%20102\">\n    161 Conn.App. 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 120,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=127%20A.3d%20356\">\n    127 A.3d 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=320%20Conn.%20909\">\n    320 Conn. 909\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=128%20A.3d%20953\">\n    128 A.3d 953\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). This standard of review governs both of Redmond's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Redmond's first claim, that the court improperly ordered the forfeiture of the seized property under \u00a7 54-36a(c), hinges on his claim that this section provides the court with the authority to order the forfeiture of contraband only, including cash linked to illicit narcotics transactions, and that firearms are not contraband under the statute. He contends that \u00a7 54-36a(a)(1) defines \"contraband\" as \"any property, the possession of which is prohibited by any provision of the general statutes,\" and that possession of the disputed property is not prohibited by the General Statutes. He argues that because \u00a7 54-36a(c) applies only to contraband and certain cash linked to illegal drug transactions, the court should have conducted in rem forfeiture proceedings under \u00a7 54-33g in order to effectuate the forfeiture. Proceeding under \u00a7 54-33g would have required notice of the proposed forfeiture and a hearing prior to the court's forfeiture order. Had Redmond received notice\n   and a hearing, he asserts that the property would not have been ordered forfeited and destroyed. In light of established precedent, we disagree that \u00a7 54-36a(c) is limited to contraband and certain cash, and conclude that the court properly acted under this section.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Section 54-36a(c) addresses the final disposition, at the conclusion of a criminal prosecution, of property that was seized by the police in connection with a criminal arrest. It provides in relevant part that \"unless the court finds that such property\n   <em>\n    shall be forfeited or is contraband\n   </em>\n   ... it shall, at the final disposition of the criminal action or as soon thereafter as is practical ... order the return of such property to its owner within six months upon proper claim therefor.\" (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 54-36a(c). The pivotal phrase in this section is that the court is not required to return the property to its owner if the court finds that the property \"shall be\n   <em>\n    forfeited or is contraband\n   </em>\n   ....\" (Emphasis added.) In\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Garcia\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5754213\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/108/533/#p554\">\n    108 Conn.App. at 554-55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=949%20A.2d%20499\">\n    949 A.2d 499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , this court considered that statutory language when faced with arguments substantially the same as Redmond's arguments, and concluded that \" \u00a7 54-36a(c) empowers courts presiding over criminal actions to dispose of [seized property] ... provided that a nexus exists between the [seized property] and the crimes charged.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   So long as a nexus exists between\n   the seized property and the crimes charged, it is irrelevant whether the property is contraband.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In the present case, the trial court's determination that a nexus existed between the seized weapons, ammunition, and magazine, and the crimes charged is logical and finds support in the facts that appear in the record. Additionally, Redmond has not challenged the propriety of the trial court's nexus determination. The record reflects that the defendant was selling narcotics from the residence owned by and co-occupied by Redmond, and that the weapons were found throughout this residence, some appearing to be loaded and staged for quick use, and some in proximity to narcotics. The defendant had free access to all areas of the residence, including to the weapons stored in a safe on the second floor of the residence. \"Connecticut courts repeatedly have noted that [t]here is a well established correlation between drug dealing and firearms.... Federal courts also have recognized this fact of life.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1120112\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/255/268/#p284\">\n    255 Conn. 268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 284,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=764%20A.2d%201251\">\n    764 A.2d 1251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001).\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant either possessed or had easy access to all of the weapons for use in his illicit business dealings. We, therefore, conclude that the court's determination that the requisite nexus existed between the seized firearms and the defendant's narcotics business was logical and supported by the record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Redmond next argues that the court's forfeiture order was improper because it was entered without giving him proper notice and an opportunity to be heard, as required by \u00a7 54-33g.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Redmond's\n   arguments concerning the requirements of \u00a7 54-33g are inapposite because, as previously noted, the court in the present case properly ordered the forfeiture under \u00a7 54-36a(c). Section 54-36a(c) does not require the court or the state to\n   provide formal notice to any individual that may have an interest in seized property that is to be forfeited. It requires only that, at the final disposition of a criminal action, the court \"[find] that such property shall be forfeited or is contraband, or [find] that such property is a controlled drug, a controlled substance or drug paraphernalia,\" before it can order a forfeiture of the seized property. General Statutes \u00a7 54-36a(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Moreover, contrary to Redmond's claims, he was not deprived of an opportunity to be heard on the disposition of the property. Rather, the record indicates that Redmond was aware of the proposed disposition of the property and chose not to assert his claim to the property until after the final disposition of the criminal action. Practice Book \u00a7 41-13\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   provides a procedure for any person, whether a party or not, who is aggrieved by the seizure of property in the course of a criminal investigation to make a motion in the criminal action for the return of the seized property. Practice Book \u00a7 41-15\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   restricts such motions to being made during the pendency of the criminal action. Redmond's choice not to make a timely motion pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 41-13, whatever his reasons may have been, does not render the forfeiture improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that Redmond failed to demonstrate that the trial court improperly denied his motion for the return of the seized property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The writ of error is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    The defendant, Patrick S. Redmond, did not participate in this writ of error. For purposes of clarity, we refer to Patrick S.

Although the record reveals that the trial court discussed this issue with the parties, it is not clear that the trial court considered this a ground for denying the motion. Indeed, the court expressed doubt about whether waiver was a relevant consideration given its clear authority under \u00a7 54-36a(c) and\n    <em>\n     Garcia\n    </em>\n    , stating that \"I'm not even sure if waiver is required based on the\n    <em>\n     Garcia\n    </em>\n    case.\" Neither party sought an articulation from the trial court, and we cannot conclude on the record before us that the trial court considered waiver as a ground for the denial.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    We note that we are considering Redmond's writ of error although it was not filed within twenty days of the judgment, as required by Practice Book \u00a7 72-3(a), because of the unusual circumstances of this matter and because our Supreme Court elected to transfer this matter to this court under Practice Book \u00a7 65-1, rather than dismissing it pursuant to its authority under Practice Book \u00a7 72-3(a), which provides in relevant part that the Supreme Court may dismiss a writ of error that is untimely brought without cause. The state did not move either the Supreme Court or this court to dismiss this writ as untimely. Additionally, when Redmond brought his direct appeal, we dismissed it because he was a nonparty to the criminal matter, and we stated that he should have raised his claims through a writ of error. Following this suggestion, Redmond initiated the writ of error six days later on December 14, 2015, which is within the twenty day period provided by Practice Book \u00a7 72-3(a).
