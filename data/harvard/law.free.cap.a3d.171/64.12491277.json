On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court (1) abused its discretion by preventing him from pursuing certain inquiries on cross-examination, thereby violating his sixth amendment right to present a defense, and (2) abused its discretion by admitting into evidence out-of-context portions of his interview conducted following a polygraph examination, in violation of his right to due process. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. The victim, N, is the defendant's daughter. The defendant repeatedly sexually assaulted N from the time she was seven or eight years old until she was eleven years old. Most of the assaults during this period took place when N and the defendant went fishing together. The assaults recommenced when N was approximately twelve or thirteen years old and continued until she was approximately seventeen years old. Many of the assaults included threats of violence against N, her mother, and her sister. On several occasions, the defendant warned N that if she told anyone about the assaults, he would kill her, her mother, and her sister. On occasion, the defendant brandished a weapon, including a double-barreled shotgun, while committing an assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   N did not report the defendant's conduct until 2009. At that time, the defendant and N's mother had divorced, and N was living with her mother and her sister in Massachusetts. N kept a journal as part of a course of psychiatric treatment that she received from Stefanie Lindahl, a psychiatrist. N documented her father's conduct in the journal and shared it with Lindahl. N reported the assaults to the police on July 31, 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Detective William Flynn, a major crimes detective with the Connecticut State Police and a member of the child abuse investigative team, was assigned to investigate N's report. Throughout the investigation, Flynn interviewed N and took written statements from her. At the request of the\n   state's attorney, Flynn used his police vehicle to drive N as she directed him to various locations where the abuse had occurred. These trips prompted N to remember additional incidents of sexual assault perpetrated by the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The defendant was arrested on September 29, 2010. The original information charged the defendant with\n   offenses that were alleged to have occurred between March, 1997 and 2000. The state filed a substitute long form information on March 5, 2015,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   charging the defendant with three counts of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-70(a)(1) for offenses occurring in 2002, 2003, and 2004.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On March 31, 2015, the jury found the defendant guilty of three counts of sexual assault in the first degree. The court sentenced the defendant to a term of twelve years of imprisonment and five years of special parole on each count, to run consecutively, resulting in a total effective sentence of thirty-six years of imprisonment and fifteen years of special parole. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The defendant first claims that the trial court made two erroneous evidentiary rulings in violation of his right, under the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the federal constitution, to present a defense. Specifically, the defendant asserts that the trial court improperly prohibited him from cross-examining Flynn about a statute of limitations issue that the state had discovered on the eve of the original trial date. In addition, the defendant argues that the trial court erroneously barred testimony from Joseph C. Scirica, one of N's former treating physicians, regarding a notation in a 2006 letter in his file that N had a \"remarkable history of a molestation/sexual assault.\" The state responds\n   that the trial court properly excluded both the evidence relating to the statute of limitations and Scirica's letter. For the reasons that follow, we agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The defendant's claims implicate both his constitutional right to present a complete defense, as well as the proper constraints that the rules of evidence impose on that right. Therefore, our analysis has two parts. First, we must determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in making certain evidentiary rulings regarding the statute of limitations and Scirica's letter. Second, if we find that the trial court abused its discretion, we must determine whether that caused a violation of the defendant's constitutional rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Because our analysis of each of the defendant's claims in this part of the opinion relies on the same legal principals, we first set forth our standard of review for each of those claims. \"The sixth amendment to the United States constitution require[s] that criminal defendants be afforded a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense .... The defendant's sixth amendment right, however, does not require the trial court to forgo completely restraints on the admissibility of evidence .... Generally, [a defendant]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   must comply with established rules of procedure and evidence in exercising his right to present a defense ....

The defendant's trial originally was scheduled to begin on January 13, 2014. On the eve of trial, however, the state discovered that the statute of limitations had expired on the conduct supporting the original charges. The state sought a continuance, which the trial court granted. During the continuance, the state's attorney\n   requested that Flynn conduct an additional interview with N. In this interview, N made additional allegations against the defendant pertaining to more recent sexual assaults that fell within the statute of limitations. These new allegations formed the basis for the substitute long form information that the state filed on March 5, 2015, and under which the defendant was tried and convicted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At trial, the defendant attempted to establish, through cross-examination of Flynn, that the state's discovery of the statute of limitations issue prompted N's new allegations. The state objected on relevance grounds. In an offer of proof outside the presence of the jury, Flynn testified: \"I knew there was an issue with the statute of limitations, I-that's about all I knew, there was a-we didn't have a large discussion on that.\" The trial court declined to allow any questioning regarding Flynn's \"awareness of the statute of limitation [s] issue or that the-that issue demolished the [s]tate's case or anything of that\n   nature.\" The trial court, however, allowed the defendant to inquire regarding Flynn's knowledge of the January, 2014 trial date and continuance, his involvement in trial preparations, and his role in the taking of an additional statement from N at the request of the state's attorney in January, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding testimony regarding the statute of limitations issue during cross-examination of Flynn, thereby violating the defendant's sixth amendment right to present a defense. The defendant asserts that until the state discovered the statute of limitations issue, N was \"remarkably consistent on the ages of the alleged sexual abuse\" as being between the ages of eight and eleven. Because the trial court did not allow Flynn to testify about the statute of limitations issue, the defendant argues that he was left unable to\n   explain his defense that N fabricated the newer allegations. As previously noted, to the extent that the defendant challenges an evidentiary ruling of the trial court, we review the claim for abuse of discretion. We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding this evidence and also did not violate the defendant's sixth amendment right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Our resolution of this claim is guided by\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Andrews\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4039571\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/102/819/\">\n    102 Conn.App. 819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=927%20A.2d%20358\">\n    927 A.2d 358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3956420,3955342,3956095\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/284/911/\">\n    284 Conn. 911\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=931%20A.2d%20932\">\n    931 A.2d 932\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007). In\n   <em>\n    Andrews\n   </em>\n   , the defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court violated his sixth amendment right to present a defense by improperly limiting his cross-examination of certain witnesses. Id., at 824-25,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=927%20A.2d%20358\">\n    927 A.2d 358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The defendant was charged with sexual assault in the first degree, sexual assault in the second degree and risk of injury to a child. Id., at 821,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=927%20A.2d%20358\">\n    927 A.2d 358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At trial, the defendant was precluded from introducing certain evidence regarding details of the defendant's sexual relationships with other members of the victim's family. Id., at 825,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=927%20A.2d%20358\">\n    927 A.2d 358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The court in\n   <em>\n    Andrews\n   </em>\n   held that the defendant's sixth amendment right to present a defense was not violated. Id., at 827,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=927%20A.2d%20358\">\n    927 A.2d 358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court explained that the evidence presented made the jury aware of the defendant's complicated relationship with the victim's family and that members of the victim's family may have had various motives for corroborating the victim's testimony.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=927%20A.2d%20358\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   The court concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in precluding additional details of the defendant's sexual relationships, as they were not relevant to the issue of whether the defendant had sexually assaulted the victim.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=927%20A.2d%20358\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Applying the analysis in Andrews to the present case, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding testimony of the statute of limitations\n   issue. The defendant argued that he attempted to present evidence that N changed her story upon learning that the statute of limitations for the original charges had expired. Because N \"was remarkably consistent on the ages of the alleged sexual abuse,\" the defendant argued that evidence that the statute of limitations barred the original charges was necessary to show that the only reason for the new allegations was to save the state's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Similar to Andrews, the defendant in this case was able to conduct sufficient inquiry into his defense theory. Specifically, the defendant elicited testimony from Flynn about the continuance of the originally scheduled trial and Flynn's involvement in the case. In addition, the defendant presented evidence that the state had asked Flynn to obtain another statement from N after the continuance of the original trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The defendant attempted to introduce evidence of the statute of limitations issue through Flynn, not N. The defendant never cross-examined N regarding her motivations for detailing the abuse that occurred in 2002, 2003, and 2004, only after she learned that the statute of limitations issue barred the original charges. The defendant could have asked N if she was changing her story due to pressure from authority figures such as her mother or the state's attorney, but did not do so. Instead, the defendant attempted to address this topic in his cross-examination of Flynn; however, Flynn could not have testified about N's motives and the defendant failed to ask Flynn whether he pressured N to make new allegations because of the problem with the statute of limitations. He could not testify, without speculating, about why N was detailing the later abuse at that particular time. Therefore, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow the defendant to cross-examine Flynn on the statute of limitations issue and that this was a reasonable\n   constraint on the defendant's sixth amendment right to present a defense. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Andrews\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4039571\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/102/819/\">\n    102 Conn.App. at 826-27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=927%20A.2d%20358\">\n    927 A.2d 358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The defendant next claims that the trial court abused its discretion by excluding Scirica's letter and testimony. He argues that exclusion of this evidence prevented him from rebutting the state's consciousness of guilt argument. The state argues that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding this evidence. We agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The following facts are relevant to the defendant's claim regarding the exclusion of Scirica's letter. On April 1, 2007, Lindahl received a letter from the defendant stating, \"I am not a sexual predator, nor am I an abusive father.\" The defendant sent this letter two years prior to N's initial allegations of sexual assault against him. Prior to the time the defendant sent this letter, N's primary care physician had referred N to Scirica for treatment in 2006. Following that referral, Scirica sent a letter to N's primary care physician with a notation that N had a \"remarkable history of a molestation/sexual assault.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   At trial, the defendant attempted to introduce Scirica's letter into evidence and to have Scirica testify about his recollection of this history of molestation or sexual assault. The state objected, arguing that the letter constituted inadmissible hearsay within hearsay. Scirica testified in an offer of proof regarding the 2006 letter. Scirica did not have any independent recollection of the letter, nor could he say whether it was N, her mother, or someone else who had provided him with N's medical history. Scirica noted that, as a mandated reporter, he would have to report any fresh complaints of sexual assault, but did not do so in this case. Scirica could not\n   state with any certainty the origin of the information about N's history of sexual assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Thereafter, the trial court excluded Scirica's testimony and letter because the hearsay quality and uncertain source of the information rendered it unreliable and irrelevant. In its ruling, the trial court noted that \"[t]here is no way to tell through the letter or [Scirica's] testimony whether the phrase '[a] remarkable history of a molestation/sexual assault' refers to the alleged conduct of the defendant or other allegations of sexual misconduct that have been presented to the jury, namely the alleged incidents in school and at Silver Hill [Hospital].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The defendant argues that the trial court's refusal to allow Scirica to testify about the notation in his letter that N had a \"remarkable history of a molestation/sexual assault\" prevented him from presenting his defense. The defendant asserts that this evidence would have given context to the defendant's April 1, 2007 letter to Lindahl, which stated: \"I am not a sexual predator, nor am I an abusive father.\" The state used the defendant's letter as evidence of his consciousness of guilt, and the defendant sought to introduce Scirica's letter as a way to rebut the state's argument. The state argues that the trial court properly excluded the evidence. The state asserts that the admission of Scirica's testimony and letter would have forced the jury to speculate as to which instance of abuse the notation specifically referred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The defendant challenges the trial court's evidentiary ruling regarding Scirica's testimony and letter. As previously discussed, \"we will set aside an evidentiary ruling only when there has been a clear abuse of\n   discretion.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Santos\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=318%20Conn.%20412\">\n    318 Conn. at 423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=121%20A.3d%20697\">\n    121 A.3d 697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The court's analysis in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344680\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/298/1/#p23\">\n    298 Conn. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1%20A.3d%2076\">\n    1 A.3d 76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , informs our resolution of this claim.

The defendant sought to use this evidence from Scirica to counteract the state's use of his letter to Lindahl to prove consciousness of guilt on the assumption that the defendant's April 1, 2007 letter to Lindahl appeared to be spontaneous and not in response to some allegation against him. The defendant argued that the admission of Scirica's letter would show that, contrary to the state's assertions, allegations of sexual assault had occurred prior to the defendant's April 1, 2007 letter, and that\n   the defendant's letter was a reaction to the allegations contained in Scirica's letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   As we have already discussed, there was no evidence in the record as to where or from whom Scirica had obtained the information of N's \"remarkable history of a molestation/sexual assault.\" Furthermore, there is no evidence in the record indicating which instances of sexual assault the notation refers to-the incident at school, the incident at Silver Hill Hospital, or the conduct alleged against the defendant. Because Scirica could not testify as to the origin of the information or to which allegations of abuse the notation referred, this testimony would have caused the jury to stray too far into the realm of speculation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Similar to Davis, the foundation for this evidence is \"wholly speculative,\" as Scirica could not provide any insight about the source of the notation in his letter or to what the notation was referring. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344680\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/298/1/#p23\">\n    298 Conn. at 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1%20A.3d%2076\">\n    1 A.3d 76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Specifically, the defendant argues that the admitted portions of his interview do not constitute positive assertions of fact and, therefore, are not admissible under the statement by a party opponent exception to the hearsay rule. The defendant also argues that the only way for the jury to have received the proper context of the admitted statements would have been to admit information regarding the polygraph examination itself, which is not admissible in Connecticut trial courts. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Porter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"72601\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/241/57/#p94\">\n    241 Conn. 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 94,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=698%20A.2d%20739\">\n    698 A.2d 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997). The defendant asserts that without the ability to present this necessary evidence, the trial court's admission of the interview statements deprived him of his right to due process. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to this claim. The defendant agreed to submit to a polygraph examination on September 20, 2010. A three and one-half hour interview of the defendant followed the exam. The state's attorney's office prepared a transcript of the interview. The state, through a motion in limine, sought to admit portions of the interview at trial through the testimony of Flynn. Specifically, the state sought\n   to introduce statements related to the following three areas: (1) that the defendant felt sexually aroused by N as she was developing; (2) that the defendant locked his bedroom door at night because he was worried that N was going to kill him; and (3) that the defendant changed his response \"from his earlier full denial of any inappropriate behavior.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The trial court ruled that no statements would be admitted that were made in response to the fact that the defendant had\n   failed the polygraph. Accordingly, the trial court excluded the state's third area of inquiry regarding the defendant's change in response to the allegations. The trial court reasoned that the third area of inquiry was inadmissible because the likely \"defense argument is that his response changed because there was an intervening polygraph ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The court allowed Flynn to testify regarding the other two areas of inquiry. In regard to the defendant feeling aroused by N, Flynn testified that \"[the defendant] had stated words to the effect that while she was developing, uh, he began to feel things of-of becoming aroused looking at [N], but said 'that's my daughter, uh, it's got to stop there, it's my daughter' or words to that effect.\" Flynn further testified concerning the defendant's statements that he feared for his safety: \"He had said words to the effect that he was locking his bedroom door at night, because he was afraid [N] was [going to] kill him.\" The trial court allowed these statements into evidence as admissions by a party opponent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In his brief, the defendant argues that even though the trial court would not admit any statement that was in response to the failed polygraph examination, \"all of the defendant's statements were intertwined with the failed polygraph results; therefore, all of his statements would have been in response to the failed polygraph examination.\" The state responds that the admitted\n   statements were material and relevant to show the defendant's consciousness of guilt. The defendant claims that the trial court improperly admitted the interview statements because (1) the statements were not positive assertions of fact and, therefore, did not fall under a hearsay exception, and (2) admission of the out-of-context statements violated the defendant's right to due process. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   We begin by setting forth the standard of review for determining whether the trial court properly interpreted \u00a7 8-3 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence, which sets forth certain hearsay exceptions. \"To the extent a trial court's [ruling regarding] admission of evidence is based on an interpretation of the [Connecticut] Code of Evidence, our standard of review is plenary.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4185572\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/121/775/#p780\">\n    121 Conn.App. 775\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 780,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=998%20A.2d%20170\">\n    998 A.2d 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344897,4343781\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/298/902/\">\n    298 Conn. 902\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=3%20A.3d%2072\">\n    3 A.3d 72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010).
