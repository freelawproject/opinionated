The matter was referred to this hearing panel by the Professional Responsibility Board. Due to scheduling conflicts, petitioner moved the hearing panel for a continuance of the scheduled hearing on September 7, 2016. Upon review of available dates for members of the hearing panel, the petitioner and counsel, the only dates available for hearing lay beyond the 90 day period set by rule for decision on the petition. (A.O. 9, Rule 22(D)). Time limitations being directory and not jurisdictional (A.O. 9, Rule 16(I)), the hearing panel deemed the motion for continuance to be a waiver of the ninety-day rule.
