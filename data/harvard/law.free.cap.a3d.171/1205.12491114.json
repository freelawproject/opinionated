Bar Counsel charged McLaughlin with violating\n   the Maryland Lawyers' Rules of Professional Conduct (\"MLRPC\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   during her representation of Doris Leedom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The AGC investigated after Paula McCabe, Ms. Leedom's daughter and power of attorney, filed a complaint. Bar Counsel alleged that McLaughlin violated the following: (1) Rule 1.3 (Diligence);\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) Rule 1.4(a) and (b) (Communication);\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (3) Rule 1.5(a) (Fees);\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (4) Rule 1.15(a) and (e) (Safekeeping\n   Property);\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (5) Rule 8.1(a)\n   and (b) (Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters);\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (6) Rule 8.4 (a), (c) and (d) (Misconduct);\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Maryland Code (1957, 2010 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article (\"BP\") (Misuse of Trust Money).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We transmitted the matter to the Honorable Kevin J. Mahoney (\"the hearing judge\") of the Circuit Court for Harford County to hear the case. After trying and failing to serve McLaughlin, Bar Counsel served the Client Protection Fund of the Bar of Maryland pursuant to Maryland Rule 19-723(b). The Fund mailed the Petition to McLaughlin at three different addresses. When McLaughlin did not answer the Petition, Bar Counsel moved for an Order of Default under Maryland Rule 2-613(b), which the Circuit Court granted. McLaughlin was sent notice of the Default Order and served with Bar Counsel's discovery requests. McLaughlin never responded to Bar Counsel, nor sought to overturn the default.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   McLaughlin did not appear at the Circuit Court hearing on March 20, 2017. The hearing judge concluded that because McLaughlin had defaulted, all requests for admissions in Bar Counsel's discovery requests were deemed admitted pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-424(b). The hearing judge issued Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, based on the admitted facts, in which he found by clear and convincing evidence that McLaughlin violated MLRPC 1.3, 1.4(a) and (b), 1.5(a), 1.15(a) and (e), 8.1(a) and (b), 8.4(a), (c), and (d), and BP \u00a7 10-306. He found multiple aggravating factors and no mitigating factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    THE HEARING JUDGE'S FINDINGS OF FACT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The hearing judge made the following findings of fact. McLaughlin was admitted to the Maryland Bar on June 15, 2004 and has substantial experience in the practice of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2011, Ms. Leedom, then age 86, and a resident of New York, retained McLaughlin to prepare estate planning documents. Ms. Leedom gave her son George Leedom (\"Mr. Leedom\") her power of attorney, and her daughter, Mrs. McCabe, was identified as his successor. When Ms. Leedom moved to Maryland in 2013, McLaughlin drafted a Maryland power of attorney for her, which named Mr. Leedom as her agent. In 2013, Ms. Leedom sold her New York home and gifted the proceeds, over $500,000, to Mr. Leedom. McLaughlin provided some advice regarding this gift. The hearing judge found that Mr. Leedom managed his mother's finances from 2011 to June 2014. At that time,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Mr. Leedom entered a rehabilitation for substance abuse issues, and Mrs. McCabe notified [McLaughlin] .... However, [McLaughlin] did not advise Ms. Leedom of the risks of allowing Mr. Leedom to continue to serve as her power of attorney at any time after June 2014. In fact, [McLaughlin] did not communicate with Ms. Leedom at all in June 2014, and never discussed Mr. Leedom's substance abuse issues with Ms. Leedom.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   On August 12, 2014, Ms. Leedom, with [McLaughlin's] assistance, sold two pieces of property located in Aberdeen, Maryland. The sale of the two properties resulted in net proceeds to Ms. Leedom of approximately $95,000.00. [McLaughlin] agreed to serve as an escrow agent, holding the proceeds of the sale in her Attorney Trust Account. Respondent was not to disburse the proceeds of the sale until [Mr.] Leedom and Mrs. McCabe agreed on the disposition of the funds.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The hearing judge found that despite this agreement, McLaughlin disbursed $10,000 to Mr. Leedom in October 2014. McLaughlin did not notify Mrs. McCabe or obtain her consent to the disbursement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In December 2014, Ms. Leedom executed a power of attorney, naming McLaughlin as her agent. The next month, McLaughlin \"paid herself $5,175.00 from Ms. Leedom's funds held in her trust account without Mrs. McCabe's authorization or consent.\" McLaughlin did not provide invoices or billing statements to Ms. Leedom, or to Mr. Leedom when he had his mother's power of attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Ms. Leedom executed another power of attorney in April 2015, naming Mrs. McCabe as her agent. Mrs. McCabe immediately sent McLaughlin a letter asking \"for an accounting of and the return of her mother's funds.\" The hearing judge found that McLaughlin provided an accounting in May, \"but refused to return the balance of Ms. Leedom's funds unless and until Mrs. McCabe signed a waiver releasing [McLaughlin] from any and all liability.\" He also found that Mrs. McCabe signed this release under duress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In July 2015, Mrs. McCabe filed a complaint with the AGC. Bar Counsel sent McLaughlin a copy of the complaint and requested a written response. McLaughlin submitted a written response on September 18. The hearing judge found that McLaughlin made \"knowing and intentional misrepresentations to Bar Counsel\" in her response, specifically:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [McLaughlin] stated that 'Doris Leedom ... was adamant that she did not want her daughter [Paula McCabe] involved. I had been told by [Mr.] Leedom on several occasions that his mother became very agitated and combative when Paula wanted to take her to a hair appointment\n   or when her name came up. I witnessed this on several occasions in meetings just between Doris Leedom and myself.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [McLaughlin] also misrepresented to Bar Counsel that she was in frequent contact with [Mr.] Leedom, including in person meetings, in the fall of 2014. Additionally, [McLaughlin] misrepresented that she wrote a letter to Mrs. McCabe on May 15, 2015, when in fact she had not. [McLaughlin] also misrepresented that Mike McCabe, Paula McCabe's husband, '[o]n more than one occasion ... said he did not want to deal with Paula or have her get involved and finally\n   on May 8, 2015 said he was not getting involved with this and that he had told Paula he wanted nothing to do with her actions.' Finally, [McLaughlin] misrepresented that she 'explained on several occasions to Mrs. McCabe [that] there was never an [escrow] account in Doris Leedom's name.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Bar Counsel sent a letter to McLaughlin dated November 13, 2015, which explained that the matter had been docketed for further investigation, enclosed additional correspondence from Mrs. McCabe, and requested a response. Bar Counsel sent a similar letter on January 11, 2016. McLaughlin received both of these letters, but never responded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   An AGC investigator interviewed McLaughlin in February 2016. McLaughlin told the investigator that she did not think she had to respond to Bar Counsel's November 13 letter, and that she \"did not recall\" receiving the January 11 letter. Bar Counsel sent McLaughlin additional copies of the previous correspondence through U.S. mail and e-mail. McLaughlin received, but did not respond to these communications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    THE HEARING JUDGE'S CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The hearing judge found that an evidentiary hearing was unnecessary because the Circuit Court had entered an Order of Default and McLaughlin had not moved to vacate the order. He found that the admitted facts were \"sufficient by a clear and convincing standard\" to justify the court's conclusions of law that McLaughlin violated MLRPC 1.3, 1.4(a) and (b), 1.5(a), 1.15(a) and (e), 8.1(a) and (b), 8.4(a), (c), and (d), and BP \u00a7 10-306.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    MLRPC 1.3: Diligence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The hearing judge concluded that McLaughlin violated Rule 1.3 when she \"fail [ed] to promptly advise her client, Doris Leedom, of the risks of continuing to have [Mr.] Leedom act as her power of attorney when [Mr.] Leedom was experiencing problems with substance abuse.\" This \"increased the likelihood that her client would suffer adverse financial consequences.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    MLRPC 1.4: Communication\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The hearing judge found that McLaughlin violated 1.4(a) by failing \"to provide information, advice and counsel to her client regarding the propriety of having [Mr.] Leedom, who had known substance abuse issues, continue as her power of attorney.\" This omission left Ms. Leedom without \"sufficient information to participate in making decisions regarding the representation.\" The hearing judge found that McLaughlin's failure \"to explain to [Ms.] Leedom in any manner, the risks of having [Mr.] Leedom continue as her power of attorney\" violated Rule 1.4(b) because she never explained the matter to permit her client to make an informed decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    MLRPC 1.5(a): Fees\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The hearing judge found that McLaughlin never provided an invoice or billing statement for the $5,175 fee to either her client or her power of attorney. She simply deducted the money from her IOLTA account, and the only justification for this fee was a notation: \"through 08/2014.\" The hearing judge found that \"[w]ithout any basis to substantiate her charges in this case, [McLaughlin's] fee is unreasonable,\" and violated Rule 1.5(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    MLRPC 1.15(a) and (e): Safekeeping Property\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The hearing judge found that McLaughlin \"violated ... Rule [1.15(a) ] when she failed to keep her own property, i.e., the $5,175 in fees she earned in August 2014, separate from [Ms.] Leedom's own property,\" because \"she failed to withdraw the funds from the IOLTA account until January 24, 2015.\" The hearing judge found that McLaughlin violated Rule 1.15(e) \"by disbursing $10,000 to George Leedom in October 2014 without Mrs. McCabe's consent.... [and] when she disbursed $5,175.00 to herself for attorney's fees without Mrs. McCabe's consent.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    MLRPC 8.1: Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The hearing judge concluded that McLaughlin violated Rule 8.1(a) when she repeatedly made false statements to Bar\n   Counsel in her September 18, 2015 letter. The hearing judge found that McLaughlin violated Rule 8.1(b) because she received three requests for information from Bar Counsel and never responded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    MLRPC 8.4: Misconduct\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The hearing judge determined that McLaughlin violated Rule 8.4(a) because she violated other Rules of Professional Conduct. The hearing judge concluded that McLaughlin's five misrepresentations to Bar Counsel in the September 18 letter violated Rule 8.4(c), which prohibits conduct involving dishonesty or misrepresentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The hearing judge found that McLaughlin's \"failures to communicate with her client, failures to safeguard her client's funds, misrepresentations to [Bar Counsel], and failures to respond to [Bar Counsel's] lawful requests for information\" were \"likely to impair public confidence in the profession and impact the image of lawyers in the public eye.\" Such conduct was prejudicial to the administration of justice, and violated 8.4(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    Business Occupations &amp; Professions \u00a7 10-306 : Misuse of Trust Money\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The hearing judge found that McLaughlin violated \u00a7 10-306 when she disbursed $10,000 to Mr. Leedom and $5,175 to herself contrary to the agreement that she would not disburse any proceeds from the sale of the Aberdeen properties until Mr. Leedom and Mrs. McCabe could agree on the disposition of the funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    Aggravating and Mitigating Factors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Relying on\n   <em>\n    Attorney Grievance Comm'n v. Shuler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4279212\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/443/494/#p506\">\n    443 Md. 494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 506-07,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4279212\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/443/494/#p506\">\n    117 A.3d 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015), the hearing judge considered: (1) the rules McLaughlin violated; (2) her mental state; (3) the injury her misconduct caused, or could have caused; and (4) aggravating and mitigating factors. He found that McLaughlin had violated numerous Rules of Conduct and BP \u00a7 10-306. The hearing judge concluded that McLaughlin's mental state \"seem[ed] to be intentional and deliberate\" based\n   on her September 18 letter. He found that Ms. Leedom lost $10,000 when McLaughlin released funds to Mr. Leedom without Mrs. McCabe's consent, and $5,175 when McLaughlin transferred the fee to herself without \"proper documentation that [she] had earned those fees.\" Ms. Leedom may\n   have lost additional funds when McLaughlin failed to advise her client of the dangers of retaining Mr. Leedom as her power of attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The hearing judge found multiple aggravating factors. He found that McLaughlin had violated multiple rules and BP \u00a7 10-306. She engaged in \"bad faith obstruction of the attorney discipline proceedings\" because she \"failed to respond to [Bar Counsel's] last three letters.... failed to file an answer to the PDRA, which resulted in a default judgement being entered against her.... [and] she failed to respond to any of [Bar Counsel's] discovery requests.\" McLaughlin \"submitted false statements, false evidence, and engaged in other deceptive practices\" by making multiple misrepresentations in her response to Bar Counsel. McLaughlin did not acknowledge the wrongful nature of her misconduct because she \"never admitted that she violated any Rules of Professional Conduct.... [and] never apologized for her misconduct.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The hearing judge found that Ms. Leedom was a vulnerable victim because she was 89 years of age at the time the misconduct occurred. McLaughlin had substantial experience in the practice of law. McLaughlin was indifferent to making restitution or correcting her misconduct because she never refunded her fees, nor apologized. He also found that McLaughlin was likely to repeat her misconduct, because \"absent recognition of and remorse for her wrongdoing, there is a substantial likelihood that she will repeat it.\" The hearing judge found that McLaughlin had no available mitigating factors because she had not provided any evidence, nor had she \"participated in any way during these proceedings ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In proceedings before this Court, McLaughlin was limited to addressing sanctions because of the default entered against\n   her. We issued a per curiam order disbarring McLaughlin on September 11, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Attorney Grievance Comm'n v.

McLaughlin was aware that Mr. Leedom entered a facility to treat his substance abuse in June of 2014, and interacted with him while he was intoxicated after he had been released from treatment. Mrs. McCabe had contacted McLaughlin in July 2014 regarding her brother's past and current substance abuse problems, and alleged that he had poor financial management skills. McLaughlin's September 18 letter lists a series of events between June and December 2014 that should have raised concerns for any reasonable attorney regarding Mr. Leedom's fitness to serve as his mother's power of attorney.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   These events undoubtedly impacted Ms. Leedom's interests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MLRPC 1.3, cmt.

Bar Counsel identified five \"knowing and intentional\" misrepresentations McLaughlin made in her September 18 letter to Bar Counsel. The hearing judge found,\n   apparently by allegation and default, that McLaughlin made five \"knowing and intentional\" misrepresentations to Bar Counsel, and that this conduct violated Rule 8.1(a). We review these misrepresentations in greater detail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Misrepresentation regarding Ms. Leedom's preference that Mrs. McCabe should not be involved in her finances or her day-to-day care.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   McLaughlin misrepresented that Ms. Leedom did not want Mrs. McCabe involved in managing her finances or her day-to-day care, and became \"agitated and combative\" when Mrs. McCabe took her to appointments, or when her name came up. Mrs. McCabe provided letters to Bar Counsel from Ms. Leedom's physician and daily caregivers. All of these letters refuted McLaughlin's assertion and stated that Mrs. McCabe was involved in her mother's day-to-day care and that they had a loving and positive relationship. McLaughlin did not provide any information supporting her claim, and we find that the record sufficiently demonstrates the falsity of her statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Misrepresentation regarding the frequency of contact with Mr. Leedom.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   McLaughlin claimed frequent contact with Mr. Leedom in the fall of 2014, including in-person meetings. McLaughlin's letter states that she met with Mr. Leedom in September and October 2014, but he began cancelling meetings and never rescheduled at the end of October 2014. Mrs. McCabe explained that both she and Mr. Leedom's wife regularly contacted McLaughlin after July 2014 because Mr. Leedom was not accounting for his mother's finances. McLaughlin told them that Mr. Leedom had set up meetings, but failed to attend or reschedule. It is unclear when McLaughlin had meetings with Mr.\n   Leedom, but an e-mail from May 2015 she enclosed in her September 18 letter suggests that Mr. Leedom was meeting with McLaughlin to discuss his mother's care in August of 2014-but not after that point. McLaughlin did not\n   provide any other information substantiating her claims of regular meetings with Mr. Leedom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Misrepresentation regarding correspondence with Mrs. McCabe.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Mrs. McCabe's initial complaint to Bar Counsel stated she sent a certified letter to McLaughlin in April 2015, which requested a full accounting of the escrow account, and included a copy of Ms. Leedom's new power of attorney naming Mrs. McCabe as her agent. McLaughlin told Mrs. McCabe that she had not received the letter, although Mrs. McCabe had a received signed confirmation card. The individual who signed the card told Mrs. McCabe that McLaughlin had been given the letter. McLaughlin subsequently claimed that she found the letter, and that she mailed a response on May 15. McLaughlin's September 18 letter encloses a copy of a letter dated May 15, 2015. There is no evidence that she mailed the letter. Mrs. McCabe stated that she never received it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Misrepresentation regarding Mr. McCabe's willingness to deal with Ms. Leedom's affairs and statements he made about Mrs. McCabe.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   McLaughlin misrepresented that Mr. McCabe said on multiple occasions that he did not want to deal with his wife, or have her involved in Ms. Leedom's affairs, and that he wanted nothing to do with his wife's actions. Mr. McCabe provided information regarding this claim to Bar Counsel. He explained that once he and his wife learned that Mr. Leedom had been mishandling his parents' financial affairs, Mr. McCabe addressed his father-in-law's financial situation, and attempted to remain neutral regarding Ms. Leedom's finances. He asserts that McLaughlin used this information out of context. Mr. McCabe denied that he ever said that he wanted nothing to do with his wife's actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Misrepresentation regarding the escrow account.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   McLaughlin misrepresented that she had explained on several occasions to Mrs. McCabe that there was never a separate\n   escrow account in Ms. Leedom's name. McCabe's initial complaint stated that everyone had agreed that McLaughlin would invest the proceeds of the sale of the Aberdeen properties in Fidelity Investments. One of McLaughlin's emails confirms that this was the original understanding. Mrs. McCabe independently sought account information from a bank after McLaughlin failed to provide an accounting and told Mrs. McCabe that no separate account existed. When McLaughlin sent an accounting in May 2015, she stated that the funds were in her IOLTA escrow account, and not a separate account in Ms. Leedom's name. Mrs. McCabe was apparently unaware of this until McLaughlin told her in May 2015. McLaughlin's letter misrepresents the course of events and suggests an agreement that did not exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The September 18 letter demonstrates\n   <strong>\n    at least\n   </strong>\n   five intentional misrepresentations to Bar Counsel about McLaughlin's representation of Ms. Leedom.

Respondent did not act diligently in the representation to protect her client's interests. Respondent failed to communicate with her client about essential matters concerning the representation.

When the AGC investigated the matter, Respondent provided incomplete records and made knowing and intentional misrepresentations. Respondent also failed to respond to Bar Counsel's requests for information, the Petition for Disciplinary Action, and discovery requests. Respondent did not attend the evidentiary hearing. Respondent violated (1) MLRPC 1.3 (Diligence); (2) MLRPC 1.4 (a) and (b) (Communication); (3) MLRPC 1.5(a) (Fees); (4) MLRPC 8.1(a) and (b) (Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters); (5) MLRPC 8.4(a), (c), and (d) (Misconduct); and (6) BP \u00a7 10-306 (Misuse of Trust Money) when she neglected to communicate with her client about essential matters, failed to explain the basis for her fees or supply invoices,\n   mishandled client funds, failed to fully comply with the AGC's disciplinary investigation, and made knowing and intentional misrepresentations to Bar Counsel.
