We agree with the respondent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our discussion of this claim. In his direct appeal, our Supreme Court noted a discussion that occurred on the record during jury selection in the underlying criminal trial about Dickerson and defense counsel:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"The Court: Good morning, everybody. We are back to jury selection in [the present case]. The attorneys have brought a matter to the court's attention this morning which should be put on the record. [Assistant State's Attorney Stacey] Haupt [the prosecutor], I don't know if you want to go first or-\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: ... It was brought to my attention late Friday by [Assistant State's] Attorney Jack Doyle [regarding] the [plea offer] between ... Dickerson and the state's attorney's office. I asked Attorney Doyle to write a memo about how exactly that went down and what promises had been made to [Dickerson] and in looking at his file attempting to prepare the memo, Attorney Doyle realized that [defense counsel] ... had spoken to [Dickerson] at the request of Attorney Jamie Alosi to try to talk to him about taking some type of deal. However, it was prior to [Dickerson] cooperating in this case. I don't believe that deal came to fruition, but I just thought it should be brought to the court's attention that ... [defense counsel] in some respect had conversations with one of the state's witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"The Court: Let me flush that out a bit. Apparently, [Dickerson], and it's already a matter of knowledge and public [record] in this case, is going to testify against [the petitioner]. [Dickerson], and I think you put this on the record earlier, and if not, it should be. [Dickerson] was on trial in front of this court, represented by Attorney Alosi. At some point, he entered a plea upstairs, and I had nothing to do with the plea. I had nothing to do with the sentencing. My involvement was picking a jury up to the point where the matter was resolved. Apparently, [defense counsel], you can add to that factual situation. Listen up, Mr. Walker, I just want to make sure you understand this.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"[Defense Counsel]: [Dickerson] was brought in to begin jury selection in a matter which he eventually\n   [pleaded] guilty to and is seeking to have consideration for based on his testimony or anticipated testimony in this case. I happen[ed] to be on the sixth floor. He was in the bull pen upstairs with his attorney, and his attorney, who I know, had told me about the case he was proceeding to trial on....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"Defense counsel then went on to explain that Dickerson's attorney had told him about the evidence against Dickerson relating to the sale of narcotics, which included a videotape of the purported transaction and a still photograph from that videotape that appeared to show Dickerson making the sale, and the fact that the state had offered Dickerson a plea agreement. Because defense counsel knew Dickerson, he was asked, or may have volunteered, to speak with Dickerson about the sentence that could be imposed in light of the evidence and Dickerson's past history. In summarizing the discussion that ensued, defense counsel noted that Dickerson had told him about the plea offer as well as what the plea agreement was that he could accept short of going to trial. Defense counsel then explained: I said, in my opinion, the evidence was substantial. Then again, I didn't spend more than five or six minutes with him, nor did I, other than the layout, which he probably already heard from his attorney, have anything that would impact on [the] decision he made. Then he proceeded to come down here and begin jury selection with Your Honor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"Subsequent to that, it would appear, and I didn't know until, let's say, a month to six weeks after, that he had given that statement because it wasn't being handled by [the prosecutor] at that time ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"[The petitioner] was incarcerated, having not made bond, and, at some point ... I became aware that Dickerson had made a statement. As soon as I became aware, I asked [the prosecutor] to send me a copy of\n   that statement. I spoke to [Assistant State's Attorney] Doyle.... I spoke to them about the parameters of the new plea agreement that [Dickerson] had entered into based on his cooperation, and I was told essentially what happened. I was given a copy of the statement, and that's where we are today. [The petitioner] is aware I had a limited interaction with [Dickerson] prior to him giving inculpatory evidence or [an] anticipated statement that inculpates him, and I explained to [the petitioner] that this in no way would impede my cross-examination of [Dickerson]. I don't think that that conversation is probably relevant to the deal he eventually entered into, and I would probably not, in my cross-examination, unless it came out that we knew each other, but we had known each other prior to me speaking to him up in court, and I wouldn't get into any details of the conversation. I don't think that would hamper my cross-examination of him at all. [The petitioner] has indicated to me that he wants me to continue to represent him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"The Court: You heard that, Mr. Walker? You're comfortable with that?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"[The Petitioner]: Yes, yes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"The Court: Let me tell you what I'm concerned about to protect your rights. As your lawyer, [defense counsel] owes you a duty of undivided loyalty. He can't represent two people at the same time that have any kind of conflict. From what I've heard here today, I haven't seen any. Whatever he did with [Dickerson] was unrelated to whatever deal [Dickerson] now has going, and he can go after that deal hand and claw, and there's nothing that I can see in his prior contact with [Dickerson] that is even relevant to the situation that developed after he spoke to [defense counsel]. I don't see any conflict. I don't see any violation of the law by [defense counsel], and I want to make sure you're comfortable with it so\n   we can get on with the trial, and you've got to let me know. Are you okay with it?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"[The Petitioner]: Yes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"The Court: Good, all right, then we'll pick it up. Let's bring the panel out.

Dickerson, showed no indication that his prior contact with and knowledge of ... Dickerson adversely affected his representation of the petitioner. Further, the court found that the petitioner \"failed to allege or establish what additional meaningful cross-examination could have been conducted by ... counsel at trial [and that] ... counsel's representation of the petitioner and cross-examination of ... Dickerson contributed mightily ... to the petitioner's acquittal on two of the three charges.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On appeal, the petitioner challenges the propriety of that determination. As a preliminary matter, we set forth the following guiding legal principles and standard of review governing ineffective assistance of counsel claims based on an actual conflict of interest. \"[I]t is well established that [a] criminal defendant is constitutionally entitled to adequate and effective assistance\n   of counsel at all critical stages of criminal proceedings....

Moreover, the conversation between Dickerson and defense counsel occurred prior to Dickerson's giving the state any evidence against the petitioner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As the habeas court emphasized in its memorandum of decision, defense counsel's blistering and thorough cross-examination of Dickerson gave no indication of his prior contact with, or knowledge of, Dickerson, which further underscored the lack of an actual conflict of interest. The lack of an actual conflict is further supported by the underlying trial transcript, which included an accusation that Dickerson lied to the police and falsely implicated the petitioner. In his closing argument, defense counsel criticized Dickerson by characterizing his testimony as \"bought and paid for.\" In our view, counsel's cross-examination of Dickerson and his closing argument suggest that he energetically advocated on behalf of the petitioner. There is no suggestion that he was hampered by his prior limited interaction with Dickerson. Furthermore, the jury found the petitioner not guilty of assault in the first degree, convicting him only on the conspiracy charge. The habeas court noted that defense counsel's performance \"contributed mightily\" to this outcome. On our review of the record, we concur with that assessment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In sum, it is clear to this court that defense counsel's relationship with Dickerson did not create an actual conflict between him and the petitioner. The record substantiates the court's finding that he strenuously advocated on the petitioner's behalf, unburdened by any conflict of interest. Accordingly, there is no merit to this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The petitioner next claims that the habeas court improperly concluded that he abandoned his due process claim that he was denied his right to be present at an in-chambers conference. In response, the respondent argues that this court should not review this claim because the habeas court correctly concluded that it was abandoned.
