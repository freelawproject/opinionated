Evans, of Chicago, Ill.; that the following named persons are all the persons, to the knowledge and belief of your said orator, that own or claim any estate, in fee or otherwise, in said lands or any part thereof, and that their places of residence are as follows: Henry F. Miller, of Boston, Mass.; James G. Dwen, of Chicago, Ill.; Elizabeth G. Van Zandt, of Newport, R. I.; Mary C. Eastman, of Concord, N. H.; Sarah M. F. Duncan, of Haverhill, Mass.,\u2014all of whom, as your orator is informed and believes, claim an estate or interest in said lands through, by or under one certain Thomas R. Greene; that the following named persons are in possession of said land or some portion thereof: Malcolm Stalker, (this petitioner,) Mary Ann Stalker, his wife, Michael Reed, Jacob Mitchell, James Carr, Mary McCallum; that said Mary Ann Stalker is in possession as the wife of your orator, and the other persons as tenants of your orator, deriving their right of possession from him and paying a monthly rent to him, and that no other person is in possession of said land or any part thereof.\u201d Also, that Henry F. Miller, and the other parties claiming title as above stated, have conspired together to cloud the title of the petitioner to said lands, and have placed, or caused to be placed, upon the records of said Ooolc county, since the burning of said records, (as set forth in the petition,) the following described instruments, to-wit: First, an affidavit of James G. Dwen, subscribed and sworn to May 10, 1884, and recorded in the office of the recorder of said connty on the 27th day of November, 1889, in book 2763, at page 80, setting out the names of certain persons as the heirs-at-law of said Thomas R. Greene; second, the last will and testament of Elizabeth Greene, widow of John H. Greene, of Providence, R. I., dated January 17, 1856, and recorded in the office of the recorder of said county on the 27th day of January, 1881, in book 1058, at page 227, said Elizabeth Greene having been named in said affidavit aforesaid as one of the heirs-at-law of said Thomas R. Greene. Then follows the averment that the public records of said county relating to the title of said lands were totally destroyed by fire on the 8th and 9th days of October, 1871, and that by reason of the destruction thereof and the claim of said parties the title of petitioner is clouded, etc., followed by the usual prayer in such cases.</summary><summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-5\" pgmap=\"518(86) 519(259)\">The only defendants claiming title to the premises were these plaintiffs in error, and they filed a general and special demurrer to the petition, which was overruled, whereupon they filed their joint and several answer, denying the allegations in paragraphs 1 to 8, inclusive, of the petition, and the making and recording of the deeds as therein stated. With their answer they again demurred to the petition, on the ground that it did not show that the petitioner derived any title to the property, by mesne conveyances or otherwise, from the United States, or that his grantor ever had any title to the same, and failed to show in what manner, if any, he derived title thereto, and also on the ground that it did not aver or show any-right or title to said lot, or the possession thereof, under any of the clauses of the Limitation act of this State. They admit that they claim an estate in fee in the premises, and that under the deeds averred and set forth in complainant\u2019s first amended petition, filed February 10, 1894, the title to said lot was vested in fee in said Thomas E. Greene on November 29, 1847, and aver, \u201cby virtue of divers deeds, wills, devises, descents and inheritances the title to said lot which was in said Thomas E. Greene, as aforesaid, and all right and title, at law and in equity, in and to said lot, has passed, descended, been conveyed to and is now vested in these defendants in fee,\u201d and claim that this court should, upon the hearing hereof, find and decree the title to said lot is in these defendants, and that the pretended title of complainant should be set aside, and pray such relief according to the statute in such cases enacted. They deny that they have conspired to cloud complainant\u2019s title, or that he has any title to said lot, or that it has been rendered uncertain or unsafe. Both the petition and answer were sworn to as required by the statute.</summary><summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b519-5\" pgmap=\"519(110) 520(23)\">On the hearing, the petitioner introduced in evidence the several conveyances under which he claimed title, as set forth in paragraphs 1 to 8 of his petition. He also offered a certified copy of the affidavit of James G. Dwen, dated May 10,1884, and a certified copy of a will of Elizabeth Greene, set up in the petition. He proved possession, payment of taxes and the destruction of the records, as alleged. The only evidence introduced by the defendants was the first amended petition, sworn to by petitioner February 10, 1894. The decree is in the usual form, confirming title in the petitioner, and finding that the affidavit and will, under which defendants claim, tend to cloud complainant\u2019s title, and should be removed from the records .of Cook county.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b520-5\" pgmap=\"520\">Beam &amp; Cooke, and James Barlow, for plaintiffs in error:</attorneys><p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b520-6\" pgmap=\"520\">The answer of plaintiffs in error was sworn to, was responsive to the petition, and is therefore evidence which requires proof equivalent to the testimony of two witnesses to overcome it.

Gentzel, 144 id. 455.</p><p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b521-6\" pgmap=\"521\">In McDuffee v. Sinnott, 119 Ill. 449, is clearly stated the doctrine that the Statute of Limitations is available as well for attack as for defense, even as against the one holding the record title.</p><p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b521-7\" pgmap=\"521\">In general terms, this court has pronounced upon the scope and intention of the Burnt Records act in Smith v. Stevens, 82 Ill. 556, in the following language: \u201cIt is emphatically a remedial act, and in accordance with a well established canon it must receive a liberal construction, and made to apply to all cases which, by a fair construction of its terms, it can be made to reach.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b521-8\" pgmap=\"521\">Cases in point on the question of color of title are Holloway v. Clark, 27 Ill. 483; Hassett v. Ridgely, 49 id. 197; Brian v. Melton, 125 id. 547.</p> <opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b521-9\" pgmap=\"521\">Mr. Justice Wilkin</author> <p id=\"AZT\" pgmap=\"521\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p> <p id=\"Ap5\" pgmap=\"521(132) 522(97)\">The first'ground of reversal insisted upon is, that the evidence introduced upon the hearing proved the title to the property in question, at the time of the destruction of the records, to be in plaintiffs in error, as shown by the record. This contention is based upon the fact that the first amended petition, which was introduced in evidence by the defendants, showed a regular chain of title from the government to Thomas R. Greene, and, as we understand counsel, they claim that the defendants\u2019 sworn answer so connects them with that record title as to prove ownership in them in fee. Conceding that the amended petition was competent and sufficient evidence, as against petitioner, to prove title in Thomas R. Greene by mesne conveyances from the United States, the position that defendants have in any way connected themselves with that title is untenable. The sworn answer in this proceeding is not evidence, as in an ordinary chancery proceeding. It has no other or greater weight as evidence than the petition. (2 Starr &amp; Curtis, sec. 13, chap. 116, p. 1998.) Moreover, the answer does not show in what manner defendants acquired title from Thomas R. Greene. The averment, \u201cby virtue of divers deeds, wills, devises,\u201d etc., amounts to nothing as proof of title. It is no more than the statement of a mere conclusion.</p> <p id=\"b522-5\" pgmap=\"522(272) 523(115)\">It is again insisted, that the petitioner, by his petition and proofs, failed to establish such title in himself as would authorize a court of chancery to grant him the relief prayed. The basis of this contention is that a petitioner, under the Burnt Records act, must by proper averments show that he derives his title mediately or immediately from the United States. This position we dp not think is supported by the provisions of the act or the decisions of this court. A person can certainly have an absolutely good title to real estate in this State though not able to show a connected chain of title from the United States, and there is nothing in the Burnt Records act which makes the owner of such a title an exception to that rule. Section 11 prescribes what the petition shall show, and it only requires the petitioner to state the character and extent of the estate claimed by him, and from whom and when and by what mode he derived his title. By section 18 the defendant is required, if he answers, to admit, confess and avoid or traverse all the material allegations of the petition. It was said in Smith v. Hutchinson, 108 Ill. 662 (on p. 666): \u201cThe petitioners were only required to establish the validity of their own title. The statute provided that they should make all persons owning or claiming any estate in fee in the premises, and all persons in possession, and all persons to whom the land had been conveyed and the deeds placed on record since the destruction of the record, defendants. But when such persons were made defendants and were served with process, it became their dnty to establish, by competent testimony, whatever title they had to the premises, if they desired to rely upon such title.\u201d It was also said in Gage v. Gentzel, 144 Ill. 450 (on p. 456): \u201cThe court, in such cases, is required to decree, not what the record showed before it was destroyed, but in whom the title is vested,\u201d\u2014citing section 15 of the statute. If, therefore, the petitioner, by his allegations and proof, established a prima facie valid title, from whatever source, he was entitled to the decree below unless the defendants showed a better one.</p> <p id=\"b523-5\" pgmap=\"523\">The petition alleges color of title, made in good faith, possession and payment of taxes for more than seven years, and sets out the color of title as being deeds of conveyance, duly executed, recorded, etc. We think there can be no serious doubt as to its sufficiency to show title in the petitioner under section 6, chapter 83, of the Revised Statutes, being the seven year statute of limitations of 1839. It is also clear, that when the requirement's of that statute were complied with, by his obtaining color of title from Badeaux, in good faith, having actual possession of the premises and paying all taxes for more than seven years,-\u2014i. e., to March 12,1859,\u2014he became possessed of a title which he could use, not only to protect his possession, but as against every one claiming adversely to him. (Hale v. Gladfelder, 52 Ill. 91; McDuffee v. Sinnott, 119 id. 449;\" Gage v. Hampton, 127 id. 87.) It was not necessary that he should show any title prior to the conveyance to himself, in order to make color of title in good faith. Woodward v. Blanchard, 16 Ill. 424; Hassett v. Ridgely, 49 id. 197; Rawson v. Fox, 65 id. 200 ; Milliken v. Marlin, 66 id. 13; Burgett v. Taliaferro, 118 id. 503; Brian v. Melton, 125 id. 647.</p> <p id=\"b523-6\" pgmap=\"523(26) 524(64)\">The proof fully sustained every material allegation of the petition necessary to establish color of title made in good faith, possession and payment of taxes. That the deed from Badeaux to petitioner, dated August 2, 1849, is, under the repeated decisions bf this court, good color of title, is not questioned. It seems clear, therefore, that by the allegations of his petition and proofs the petitioner is entitled to be deemed the owner of the premises in question in fee, by the terms of the act of 1839, supra.</p> <p id=\"b524-9\" pgmap=\"524\">Plaintiffs in error also say the court below erred in finding in its decree that the affidavit of James G. Dwen and the recorded will of Elizabeth Greene tend to cloud petitioiier\u2019s title and should be removed from the records of Cook county. It is clear these instruments are a cloud upon petitioner\u2019s title, and, from what has already been said, as against him they have no rightful place upon the records of Cook county, and it is in that sense only that the decree orders them removed.</p> <p id=\"b524-10\" pgmap=\"524\">Other questions raised have been considered, but we find them unimportant. There seems to be no reversible error shown in this record.</p> <p id=\"AQv\" pgmap=\"524\">Decree affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
