Ho bills of exception were reserved, consequently we can not review those grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">The fact that the foreman of the jury on their retirement stated to the others that they could not consider the fact that appellant did not testify, was but a reiteration of the charge of the court- to the jury. It is not sought to be shown that such fact was offered to be discussed. The other grounds alleged as to the misconduct of the jury are equally groundless.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">The special charges requested were covered by the court\u2019s main charge, and there was no error in refusing them.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-12\">The only ground in the motion that presents a question for serious consideration is the one that alleges the insufficiency of the testimony to support the verdict. Several witnesses testify that about the-second day of October they went to appellant\u2019s wagon yard and camp house. That when they went in appellant was filling bottles with whisky; that there were about' a dozen bottles on the table; that two gallon jars of whisky were in the house and another was found in the manure pile just outside of the house; that two bottles of whisky were found in another room. It is further shown that about this time Harry Winn went up. to appellant\u2019s place and was given a drink of whisky by him; that he then left, but when he decided to leave town, he returned and took another drink with appellant, then placed the bottle in his pocket, remarking to appellant that he would take it \u201cand would make it all right with him; that he intended to repay appellant by returning to him a like quantity of whisky.\u201d If this is true, under our decisions this would\" be a sale, and while the testimony of this witness is not very satisfactory, yet there is no denial that this really and truly represents the transaction, and the jury under a proper charge finds appellant guilty. The trial court heard the testimony and overrules the motion, and shall we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>at this distance say this testimony does not show a sale under our decisions, although this witness testifies in a way that we do not feel like giving but little credence to his testimony? The jury gave it sufficient credit to find appellant guilty, and taking into consideration the quantity of whisky appellant is shown to have had on hand at this time, we can not say there is not sufficient evidence to sustain the verdict.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"b209-6\">[Eehearing denied October <em>22, </em>1913.\u2014Beporter.]</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b209-3\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"b209-5\">DAVIDSON, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AEn\">I refer to Ross v.
