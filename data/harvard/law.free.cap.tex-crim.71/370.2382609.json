The witness Shipman testified that some time in the fall, Easter and himself were in a field in the eastern part of Stonewall County, and Pitt-cock made his appearance; that they went from the field up near a house, when Pittcock said to defendant, \u201cI come down here after my money (the money defendant owed Pittcock).\u201d Defendant said, \u201cI haven\u2019t got the money now, but as soon as I can get it I will pay you.\u201d Pittcock said, \u201cI come down here to tell you how low down trifling you were; where is that bale of cotton?\u201d Defendant said, \u201cIt is over at the gin, and when I get the money I will pay you.\u201d Pittcock said, \u201cYou will not do any such thing, you did not pay my brother for the feed he let you have.\u201d Defendant said, \u201cI did pay your brother for the feed.\u201d Pittcock said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t do any such thing.\u201d Defendant said, \u201cIf you say that I did not. pay your brother for the feed you are a liar.\u201d Pittcock said, \u201cTake that back,\u201d and then picked up a board or piece of plank and stood and held it for some little hit, threw it down and turned and walked toward his horse like he was going home, and after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>he had gotten some distance from where Jim Easter and I were standing he turned and walked back to where we were, picked up the board or plank, and rushed bn the defendant, and struck him on the shoulder, breaking defendant\u2019s shoulder and collarbone. Defendant\u2019s arm dropped to his side. Defendant run from Pittcock, but Pittcock pursued him and struck him, defendant, over the head with the board or plank. On cross-examination this witness said that neither Pittcock nor defendant cursed any, and what he had stated was about all that was said by either of the parties. \u201cNeither of them seemed to be mad until Pittcock rushed on defendant with the board or plank. They did not talk loud but in an ordinary tone of voice. All the defendant said to Luther Pittcock was, Tf you say that I did not pay your brother for the feed he let me have, you are a liar.\u2019 Pittcock is still living down there where he was last fall. He is not here as a witness in this case.\u201d This is the State\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The contention of appellant is that the language used, that is, \u201cIf you say that I did not pay your brother for the feed he let me have, you are a liar,\u201d does not make out a case under our law of using abusive language, and he should have been acquitted. This matter is presented not only as to the sufficiency of the evidence but the refusal of the court to charge the jury to acquit under the particular state of facts. This case would seem to come within the rule laid down in Johnson v. State, 66 S. W. Rep., 1097. Hnder the rule laid down in that case it seems the judgment will have to be affirmed. Hnder the authority of Watkins v. State, 44 S. W. Rep., 507, and Christmas v. State, 44 S. W. Rep., 175, abusive language towards the defendant will not justify him in using abusive language, but such language could be considered in mitigation of the penalty in case defendant should be found guilty. _ So it would seem under these authorities this jujdgment should be affirmed, and it is accordingly so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
