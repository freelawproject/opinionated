'We have carefully read the statement of facts and are of the opinion that the evidence supports the verdict. The other ground contends that while the court did submit the issue of aggravated assault, he should also have submitted it from the viewpoint- that if death had resulted and the offense was of no graver grade than manslaughter, then appellant would only be guilty of aggravated assault. If the evidence presents the issue of \u201cadequate cause/\u2019 then appellant\u2019s contention would be sound. To place the matter in the most favorable light to appellant, appellant testified on the trial that the alleged injured person, S. B. Davis, and another, charged him with drinking on the train; that they had been summoned before the grand jury, and would report him. Words ensued, when appellant claims Davis cursed him and called him a cowardly s\u2014n of a b\u2014li; other words followed, when they parted. Appellant came back in about forty minutes and said to Davis, \u201cI do not like what you said, and want you to apologize,\u201d when Davis replied, \u201cI will not do it, you damned s\u2014n of a bitch,\u201d and raised his hand, when he, appellant, struck him with a knife. This would not be adequate cause to reduce an unlawful homicide to the degree of manslaughter, and would not present that issue. Calling a man a s\u00f3n-of-a-bitch is not an insult to a female relative within the purview of our statute, as has been held in a number of cases.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"b425-7\">[/Rehearing denied October 29, 1913.\u2014Beporter.]</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
