A certain amount of this timbered land was marked out and defined and these partners cut the timber together, and no other hands were permitted to cut timber on that - allotment. Appellant\u2019s camp or the camp of himself and partner was something like two miles from where they were cutting timber. They had\" gone over to their place of work, and as we gather from the record appellant and his partner were going from one allotment of land on which they had finished cutting timber to another which had been awarded them by the man in charge of the company\u2019s work. While going down what they called the right of way in the direction of his new allotment of land a witness in the case named Bass accosted appellant\u2019s partner, who was with -him, which resulted in a difficulty between Bass and' appellant\u2019s partner, a man named Benfro. Bass obtained an axe and Benfro went to appellant and got a pistol from him with which \u2022 he fired several shots at Bass, one or more of them striking him.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">The State\u2019s contention is that when the trouble came up between Bass and Benfro, \u25a0 that Benfro got the pistol from appellant\u2019s jumper, and used it. The defendant\u2019s testimony on this particular phase of the case is that he did not have the pistol on his person, but- that it was in a sack which he was carrying. He also testified that Benfro had carried this pistol in his, Benfro\u2019s, sack from his tent because he was afraid it would be stolen, as they had missed several things from their tent during their absence when at work. That when moving from one allotment of land over to the other at Benfro\u2019s request he carried this particular sack which contained the pistol, and Benfro carried one of his, appellant\u2019s, sacks. This is a sufficient statement of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">Appellant\u2019s contention is that as the cutting of timber on these particular allotments was his place of business, under any view of the law he had a right to have a pistol at his place of business, and that had he carried the pistol from his camp to the place where he was seen with it,, it would not be a violation of the law. This is presented from the State\u2019s viewpoint of the evidence. Appellant further contends he did not carry the pistol and did hot own the pistol, and that it was an accidental matter; that he had it in his possession by reason of the fact he was carrying Benfro\u2019s' sack. We are of opinion that under no view of this testimony ought appellant to have been convicted. If it was his pistol and not Benfro\u2019s, he had a right to carry it from his tent to the place he was at work; and he had a right to carry it from one allotment of land he had finished cutting timber on to another allotment, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>other matters that he was carrying. There is no evidence that he ever carried a pistol before, and the evidence does not show that the pistol belonged to him but that it belonged to Renfro. His testimony on this phase of the case seems not to have been controverted. The State relied upon the fact that when the difficulty came up between Renfro and Bass, Renfro went to appellant and got the pistol from him, and that this constituted appellant a violator of the law. As before stated, if appellant was going from one place of business to another to begin work at a new place of allotment, he bad a right to carry the pistol to that place. That was his place of business, and he had a right to have the pistol on the ' land. Under any view of this case we do not believe the State has made out a ease which entitles it to a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
