A. 0. Lvnch. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>and Hinson Coulter were brothers-in-law. That deceased rented four or five acres of land from Hinson Coulter and erected a mill thereon. The pond, from which the water for the mill was secured, was inside of Hinson Coulter\u2019s pasture, an underground pipe making the connection. It appears that deceased cut a gate in the fence of Hinson Coulter\u2019s pasture, and when Coulter learned of it he nailed it up, and then went to the mill and so informed deceased. Words ensued, the exact language being used being conflicting. Any way Coulter went to his home some four hundred yards distant. It appears after he left, deceased fired his pistol three times, but not at any person. Deceased and one of his employes, McBride, went near the house of Coulter after an oil pump, and while they were there a pistol was fired twice in the lot of Mr. Coulter. The testimony of the State would then show a third shot was fired from the inside of the lot, knocking up the dirt near the feet of deceased; that he then cursed those in the lot for G\u2014d d\u2014n son of b-s and dared them to come out and fight it out, at this time drawing his pistol, when the State\u2019s witnesses say two more shots were fired from the lot, and deceased fell with a bullet in his brain. The State\u2019s witnesses testify positively that deceased fired no shot, and did not draw any weapon until after the third shot was fired. ' After the shooting was over a pistol was taken from Baymond Coulter, with only one empty shell, showing it to have been fired but once, and all the witnesses testify that he fired at least once, and the defendant\u2019s witnesses would have that one inflicting the fatal wound. Two of the State\u2019s witnesses, Judge Green and John White, state that after the shooting appellant, Henry Coulter, came up to the fence with a pistol in his hand and made a remark to deceased\u2019s son, Bobert.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">The defendant\u2019s witnesses would show that after the difficulty at the gin, Hinson Coulter came to the house, and then he, his three sons, Henry, Baymond and Amos, and Elisha War started to the field to work. They say onW one of them had a pistol; Baymond Coulter had a pistol. That when he got in the lot he fired twice at some guineas; that he then reloaded his pistol. There is no contention that those two shots were fired at deceased. The defendant\u2019s witnesses say that when the two shots were fired in the lot, deceased began to curse, drew his pistol and fired, shooting between Hinson Coulter and his son, Baymond; that Hinson Coulter jumped behind the barn, and Baymond Coulter behind a tree. That Baymond Coulter and deceased both fired then about the same time and deceased fell. When deceased\u2019s pistol was secured it would indicate two shots had been fired out.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">This shows the contention of the parties, the State\u2019s being that after the trouble at the gin, Hinson Coulter had said he would return; that he and all his boys did go towards the gin, and that deceased fired no shot but that all five of the shots then fired were fired by those inside the lot\u2014the Coulters. The appellant\u2019s contention is that they had no\" thought of going 'towards deceased, but were going to the field to work; that Baymond fired two shots at the fowls, when deceased began <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>to curse, drew a gun and fired at Hinson Coulter and his son Baymond. Further contending that appellant had no pistol; did not shoot, and was in a position where he could not see the difficulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-3\">There are three bills of exception in the record to the introduction of certain testimony. As to the first two, the court states, in approving them, that no objection was made to the testimony when elicited, and no motion made to exclude it. As to the third, the court states the testimony .was elicited by defendant. Under such circumstances, of course, these bills present no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">As appellant was found guilty of only manslaughter, it is only necessary to discuss the question, did the court properly present that issue and the issue of self-defense? We think the court correctly applied the law of principals to the case, and the criticisms of that portion of the ch\u00e1rge are without merit. However, the court instructed the jury:</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">\u201cIf from the evidence, you believe beyond a reasonable doubt that Baymond Coulter killed A. C. Lynch, but you further believe, or if you have a reasonable doubt as to whether or not such is a fact, that at the time of so doing, and before Baymond Coulter made any effort to shoot A. C. Lynch, if he did so make any effort, that A. C. Lynch had made, or was about to make, an attack on Baymond Coulter as viewed from his standpoint which from the manner and character of it caused Baymond Coulter to have a reasonable expectation or fear of death or bodily injury, and that acting under such reasonable expectation or fear of death or bodily injury, Baymond Coulter killed A. C. Lynch, then you will acquit the defendant, Henry Coulter; and if A. C. Lynch was armed, and was making, or was about to make, an attack on Baymond Coulter, and Baymond Coulter believed at the time he shot (if he did shoot) that A. C. Lynch was about to attack him, and if the weapon used by Lynch, and the manner of its use, was such as was reasonably calculated to produce death or serious bodily harm, then the law presumes he intended to murder or inflict bodily injury upon Baymond Coulter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AErj\">Thus it is seen the court instructed'the jury, and applied the law, solely as to what they thought Baymond Coulter believed, and how it appeared to him. Appellant\u2019s acts and conduct could not and should not be judged by the belief of and appearances to Baymond Coulter, but if it reasonably appeared to him, appellant, that deceased was about to kill Baymond Coulter, or his father, Hinson Coulter,, and under such circumstances he acted, he would be entitled to an acquittal irrespective of what Baymond Coulter may have thought about the matter. While it is true, if Baymond Coulter was justified in his acts, appellant would be entitled to an acquittal, yet even though Baymond Coulter should be held to be not justifiable, yet if it reasonably appeared to appellant that his brother or father was in danger of death or serious bodily injury, and acting under such belief, he so conducted himself as to make himself a principal in the transaction, j'et he would be entitled to have the jury pass on the question as to whether under the facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>and circumstances it so reasonably appeared to him, and he should not be held bound by how the jury might conclude it reasonably appeared to his brother Baymond. We and each of us are liable only for our own acts, and in a case where self-defense is an issue, the jury should always be instructed as to his rights, viewing the matter from his standpoint and not the standpoint of another. The evidence is sharply conflicting as to who fired the first shot at the lot, and if the jury should believe that Baymond did fire the first shot, but appellant did not see him do so and did not know that fact as he testifies, if he then saw deceased with a gun in his hands, which all the witnesses say he then had, and he under such circumstances did in fact draw a pistol and shoot, as is contended by the State, he would be entitled to a charge on that theory of the case. If Henry Coulter took any part in the shooting or difficulty, it is shown by circumstantial evidence, and under such circumstances the jury should have been told in addition to the above charge that if he .did participate in the difficulty, that at the time he did so it reasonably appeared to him that his brother or father urns in danger and acting under such belief, he acted in such a manner as to become a principal in the transaction, he woiild not be guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"ANUk\">Again the court instructed the jury: \u201cIf you believe beyond a reasonable doubt that Baymond Coulter, with intent to kill A. C. Lynch, or Henry Coulter acting as principal, drew his pistol and attempted to shoot A. C. Lynch, or did shoot at A. C. Lynch before said A. C. Lynch made any effort to shoot the said Baymond Coulter, as viewed from his standpoint, and you further believe beyond a reasonable doubt in said altercation Baymond Coulter shot and killed A. C. Lynch, and you further believe beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant Henry Coulter, knowing these facts, acted with Baymond Coulter in such killing, as a principal, as that term has heretofore been defined to you, then you will find the defendant, Henry Coulter, of some grade of homicide as you may determine from the charge hereinbefore .given, notwithstanding that you may believe from the evidence that at the time Baymond Coulter fired the shot that killed A. C. Lynch, Lynch was making an effort to shoot said Baymond Coulter.\u201d The evidence in this case would show that the fight was between deceased and Hinson Coulter, the father of the two boys. Baymond Coulter was not present and did not participate therein. The evidence offered in behalf of appellant would show that when the two shots were fired at the guineas, deceased drew a pistol, cursed and fired the ball passing between Baymond Coulter and his father, Hinson Coulter. If Baymond Coulter knew of the difficulty between his father and deceased, and deceased fired the shot as testified to by them, the most natural inference' would have been that deceased was shooting at his father and not him. Baymond Coulter had had no difficulty with deceased, while his father had just had an altercation with deceased, and yet this charge requires the jury to find, before appellant would be entitled to an acquittal, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>deceased shot at Raymond Coulter before Raymond Coulter acted. The jury could not, under the evidence in this case, see why deceased would desire to shoot at or kill Raymond Coulter, and yet, under the evidence, hearing the two shots, they might have arrived at the conclusion that deceased shot at Hinson Coulter, with whom he had just had a serious difficulty. These charges as given do not present the issues made by the testimony in this case, and because the charge does not fairly and succinctly present that issue, this cause should be reversed and remanded, and we have indicated sufficiently our view of the law of this case in commenting on these two charges, and it will not be necessary to discuss the other grounds in the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\"><em>The </em>judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b545-7\">OH REHEARIHG.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">October 29, 1913.</p>\n<author id=\"b545-9\">HARPER, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AT4\">At the last term of this court this cause was reversed and remanded, and the State has filed a motion for rehearing, contending that we were in error in the following particulars. First, he says there is no testimony that Lynch, if he shot, shot at any person except Rarunond Coulter. This record does not disclose that Raymond Coulter had had any trouble prior to that date, but it does disclose that on that day appellant\u2019s father, also the father of Raymond Coulter, had had a difficulty with Mr. Lynch, and it was the State\u2019s contention, Hinson Coulter with his boys, were on the way to the mill to renew the difficulty. According to the testimony offered in behalf of the defendant, Rajunond Coulter had fired twice at some guineas; when deceased Lynch began to curse and shot in the lot where Raymond Coulter, appellant and his father were all situate. Hinson Coulter, the father, testified: \u201cHenry and Raymond and Amos and Elisha War all went into the lot together. I heard Raymond shoot at some guineas there two or three times in his ma\u2019s garden. The lot fence and the garden fence was all one string. It joins and one string makes both strings of the lot and the garden. I don\u2019t whether it was before Raymond\u2014it must have been just as he shot the last time\u2014I heard somebody cursing in front of the lot towards the big road. I turned right around and stepped to the \"wagon tongue, and Raymond was coming up there, and we were nearly side by side, and I saw Arch, and just as we got in full view of him he shot, and it knocked up the dust between mine and Raymond\u2019s feet, and I just ducked back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-11\">Henry Coulter, appellant, testified, he had no pistol and did not shoot. He testified about Raymond shooting at the guineas; he then heard Mr. Lynch cursing and Raymond' went in that <em>direction; </em>that pa (Hinson Coulter) went up to the wagon with Raymond, and his father ducked when Lynch shot in the lot the first shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-12\">Mrs. Evy War testified about hearing the shots in the back of the lot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>and deceased, her uncle Arch, then began cursing, saying: \u201cHe just grabbed his hat and popped it against his leg and said, \u2018Come on out here, you G\u2014d d\u2014d cowardly sons of b\u2014s I am out here waiting for you, I am going to kill the last G\u2014d d\u2014n one of you.\u2019 He just kept swearing and cursing, and I said to mama, I would make him go to the mill and behave himself, and I holloaed and told Uncle Arch to go on back to the mill and behave himself, and he said, \u2018You needn\u2019t say a G\u2014d d\u2014n word,\u2019 and about that time he pulled his pistol and shot.. He shot right straight in the lot, looked to me like, under the shed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">Mrs. Coulter testified to her husband and the others being in the lot, and that Baymond fired at the guineas, when Mr. Lynch commenced cursing and went that way: \u201cHe just reached up and grabbed a hold of his hat and slapped it against his hip that way (indicating) and holloaed and told them they needn\u2019t be throwing their dares the \u2018G\u2014d d\u2014n cowardly sons of b\u2014s, come out there he was out there ready for them and waiting for them.\u2019 And I ran out to the gate and holloaed and said, \u2018Arch, my folks ain\u2019t bothering you, they are going to the field to work, you go on back to the mill.\u2019 And he said that I needn\u2019t say a word to him, he aimed to kill every G\u2014d d\u2014n one of them when they come on through that lot. He (Lynch) shot right towards the lot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">How if as the State contends appellant knew of the difficulty between deceased and his father, and did not know of any trouble between Baymond and deceased, when this shot was fired, would not the natural and only inference he could draw, be that deceased was shooting at his father, the person \"with whom he had the difficulty; would it not so appear to him, and the State\u2019s able counsel are mistaken in asserting that the evidence, and all the evidence, shows that deceased fired the first shot (if he shot) at Baymond Coulter and no other person.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">Again, counsel for the State inists we erred in holding that the charge on self-defense was erroneous in limiting appellant\u2019s right to act, if it reasonably appeared to <em>Raymond Coulter </em>that deceased was about to shoot him, Baymond Coulter, etc. Appellant can not be bound by the way the matter appeared to Baymond Coulter. The charge should have instructed the jury that if it reasonably appeared to him, <em>Henry Coulter, </em>that deceased was about to or had made an attack on Baymond Coulter, his father, etc., he would have the right. Every person is to be judged as it may appear to him and not as it may appear to some other person. If he acted with Baymond Coulter in the commission of an offense, of course, he would be bound by the act of Baymond Coulter, but in this case it was an issue as to whether he did anything; but if he did shoot, but at the time it reasonably appeared to him that deceased was about to slay his father or brother, he would be guilty of no offense, although his brother might not have so viewed the matter. If a conspiracy was shown beyond doubt the rule might be different, but in this case appellant earnestly insists he was not-acting with Baymond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>Coulter, and there is testimony supporting him, making that an issue in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-3\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
