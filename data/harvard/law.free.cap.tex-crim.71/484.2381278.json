The first ground in the motion is that the court erred in submitting the issue of murder in the first degree; and another is that the evidence is insufficient to sustain the verdict. All understand that with no evidence before us we can not review these questions. The only other ground in the motion for a new trial is that the witness John Salter was incompetent to testify. Ho evidence as to his incompetency accompanies the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-17\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-18\">\n<em>Affirmed,.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
