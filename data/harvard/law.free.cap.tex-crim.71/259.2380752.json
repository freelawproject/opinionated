The law requires this. (C. C. P., art. 646.) The court had no power or authority to try him in his absence over his attorneys\u2019 protest'and objection for him. \u25a0 If he was sick and absent on that account, his case should not have been forced to trial. If the court was satisfied that the appellant was feigning sickness, or was not in fact sick so as to prevent his appearance, he should have forfeited his bond, issued another writ for his arrest, and had him brought into court, and then proceeded with the trial. We can not sanction the practice and action of the court in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">We are not discussing whether or not if the appellant had waived his presence in a misdemeanor case and under such circumstances the court had proceeded to trial. That question is not presented herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">The court in his charge expressly told the jury that the county attorney waived the jail penalty in this case. While it might be entirely proper for the county attorney to urge a higher penalty than the minimum, or urge the jury to inflict a jail penalty as well as a fine, and while it might not be improper for the county attorney, on the other hand, to insist upon a fine only and not upon a jail sentence, we think it not proper for the court to so tell the jury in his charge. This might not present reversible error in this or any other case, but it is better for the court to say nothing of the kind in his charge to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">There is nothing else raised in the case necessary or proper for us to pass upon on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">For the error above pointed out the judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
