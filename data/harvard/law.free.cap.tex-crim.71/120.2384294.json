The charge is as follows: '\u201cYou are the sole and exclusive judges of the facts proven, of the credibility of the witnesses, and the weight and value to be given to their testimony, but the law you receive from the court, and you are bound io be governed thereby.\u201d This was sufficient on that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Appellant contends that the evidence does not support the conviction, first, because it does not show that the,deceased came to his death by the wound inflicted by the defendant, and, second, that the verdict and judgment are contrary to the law and the evidence and not supported by the evidence. We are of opinion that the evidence is sufficient on both propositions. The evidence was conflicting .as to the relation of the parties to the difficulty and who was in the wrong. The State\u2019s evidence shows that appellant was clearly the aggressor in the difficulty which resulted in the death of the deceased. The defendant introduced evidence to the contrary. This was a matter for the jury; they saw the witnesses and heard them testify. Under such circumstances this court would hardly be justified in setting aside the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Finding no reversible error in the record the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
