The deceased was entirely blind in his right eye and appellant knew this. On July 20, 1912, they both went to the town of Paint'Rock, in Concho County. The deceased, while there, went into a store and made some purchases. Appellant later came in the same' store and met him, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>when they spoke and had some incidental conversation. . They at once separated. Appellant and his brother Harvey\"' and a third party, shortly afterwards, were sitting on a bench on the outer edge of the sidewalk in front of the market. The deceased, from the north, came driving down the street of said town, going south, this street running north and south, and when he got opposite appellant some fifteen or twenty feet from him, stopped his buggy and asked appellant to' come out, he wanted to see him. Appellant went to the buggy where they had some conversation and altercation. The substance and effect of this was, as stated by appellant alone, that deceased asked appellant if he had called him a son-of-a-bitch. Appellant denied he had and asked him who told him. Deceased said Lexie Ditto told him. Whereupon appellant said Ditto lied, or was a damn liar; that then deceased said to him, \u201cYou are a damn lying son-of-a-bitch,\u201d and deceased then slapped his left; hand on his pocket and struck at appellant with his right. Appellant jumped back and caught at deceased\u2019s arm or shoulder. Neither struck the other; that thereupon deceased slapped his horse with his lines and started off in a rapid trot. Appellant took after deceased and ran down the street behind deceased\u2019s buggy for some distance. The deceased drove rapidly some seventy-five yards from where the altercation had first occurred, stopping in front of Barbee\u2019s store. He immediately got out of Iris buggy and walked briskly into Barbee\u2019s store, which is about ninety feet long, to about the middle of the store, looking for something. One of the clerks asked him what he wanted and he said an axe handle. The clerk indicated to him where the axe handles were and he thereupon at once took one and walked back out of the front of Barbee\u2019s store onto the sidewalk with it. When appellant saw he could not overtake deceased, when going away from him in his buggy, he ran on to the sidewalk on which the stores fronted and continued down it-until ho got in front of Batchford\u2019s store, next to Barbee\u2019s, where he met his father. His brother Harvey, who was sitting with him when deceased first called him out to his buggy when the altercation occurred, immediately, in a hurry, followed his brother, appellant. Appellant saw-deceased go into Barbee\u2019s store and testified that he saw him coming out of that store with the axe handle, when appellant, his father and brother immediately went into Batchford\u2019s store, passed through it into the rear,\u2014it was also ninety feet long,\u2014without stopping until they got back of the stores, when, as one witness testified, in substance, the three halted and huddled together for a moment when the father passed something to appellant. The three then immediately continued, went into the back of Barbee\u2019s store, walked from the back to the front, the three abreast, the father in the center, appellant to his .right, and the brother to his left. Another witness testified that when they reached the front door of Barbee\u2019s store he was standing in it to one side and that appellant\u2019s father told him to look out, or get out of the way, and that he immediately did so. When they got to the door, without stop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>ping, appellant walked out some eight or ten feet on the sidewalk in front of the door, the father and brother halting back nearer to the door, when appellant, facing north, made one or two steps and proceeded immediately to begin firing his six-shooter at the deceased. One of the witnesses testified that when appellant came out of Barbee\u2019s store he had a pistol in his hand. Another that he tiptoed out to where he did the shooting. A large number of witnesses, who were wholly disinterested, and not related to either party, were present on.the sidewalk where the shooting occurred and saw it all. The effect of their testimony is that when deceased emerged from Barbee\u2019s store with the axe handle that he had it down at his side like a walking cane, and had some conversation with parties at the time about the rain the. day before. Then walked up from in front of Barbee\u2019s to the front of Batchford\u2019s store as if looking for someone; that he then turned and came back to a point in front of Batchford\u2019s store, stopped, facing about east and looked at a party crossing the street; that he made no demonstration with the axe handle and said nothing and did not attempt to raise the axe handle and strike at the appellant, or anyone else, and that while thus standing, the appellant deliberately and rapidly fired his six-shooter at him. three times in rapid succession, each shot of the three striking him in his right side, one just above, the other just below and the other back of tiie right nipple,\u2014all three balls ranging directly from his right to his left side; that with the first shots deceased drew himself up and placed his right arm across his breast, his hand about on his left shoulder, and with the first two shots began to fall and did fall prostrate on the sidewalk with his head close to the outer edge thereof, and his feet back toward\u2019s Batchford\u2019s store where he was standing when first shot; that after he was down, either of the three wounds being necessarily fatal, as the doctors testified and the facts proved, the appellant deliberately took aim and shot him twice again; that when he fell he turned around with his face up and his left side then toward appellant; that one of the balls, evidently the last fired, was then fired through his left arm into his left side while he was lying prostrate on the sidewalk in the last throes of death. To take the whole testimony of the many eyewitnesses, who were all disinterested, it is certain that deceased did not see appellant when he came out of Barbee\u2019s store and was not aware of his presence until he was ruthlessly and without the slightest provocation shot down by appellant. While appellant and his father and brother testified that deceased drew back the axe handle in a striking position towards appellant immediately before the shooting, every other eyewitness, and there were many of them, testified to the reverse. The distance from appellant to deceased when the shooting occurred was shown to be not less than fifteen feet by actual measurement. Some of the witnesses, by actual measurement, make it not less than from fifteen to eighteen feet. Appellant himself, on cross-examination, said: \u201cIt looked to me like his face was turned directly towards me, that was the way it looked to me, <em>but he might not have seen me; </em>I had known Boy Stuart since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>about January, 1905; he was blind in his right eye, and I knew that at that time; he was standing mighty near straight facing me when that shooting began; he might have been leaning a little bit with his right side more towards me.\u201d Nearly every disinterested witness said deceased at no time had his face towards appellant but was facing, looking east, with his right side\u2014his blind side\u2014towards appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">The testimony, as a whole, without contradiction, establishes that the appellant was cool, collected and deliberate all the way through from the time the difficulty first arose in the buggy until after he had slain the deceased. In his own testimony he did not testify that he had any sudden or other passion whatever, nor did he testify that he had any anger, rage, sudden resentment, terror or other passion rendering him incapable of cool reflection. To take his whole testimony, without reciting it, it shows that he was not thus aroused, nor did he claim to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">The court submitted manslaughter to the \u00a1jury. The State contends manslaughter was not raised. In our opinion, after a most thorough and full consideration of the evidence, we are of the opinion that manslaughter was not in the case and should not have been submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">In McKinney v. State, 8 Texas Crim. App., 626, this court, through Presiding Judge White, said: <em>\u201cA </em>killing upon such sudden passion as is mentioned may be murder in the second degree, even though the passion was anger, rage, sudden resentment, or terror, rendering the mind incapable of cool reflection. To make such killing manslaughter, there must actually have existed not only such state or emotion of the mind, but the <em>adequate cause </em>which produced them must also exist. Penal Code, art. <em>602 (1137). </em>Insulting words <em>or </em>gestures, or an assault and .battery so slight as to show no intention to inflict pain or injury, may be sufficient to cause the emotions of the mind known as anger, rage, sudden resentment, or terror, to the extent even of rendering it incapable of cool reflection, and yet a killing under such circumstances would not be manslaughter. Why? Because such insulting words or gestures, or such assault and battery, <em>are not adequate causes </em>(Penal Code, art. 596 (1131), and manslaughter can not be predicated upon any voluntary homicide upon sudden passion not arising from an <em>adequate cause. </em>Penal Code, art. 593 (1128).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">In the recent case of Davis v. State, 70 Texas Crim. Rep., 37, 155 S W. Rep., 546, this court said: \u201cIt may be laid down as an uncontroverted proposition that two things are requisite to constitute manslaughter: First, adequate cause; second, existing passion. If these coexist, the homicide is manslaughter. If they do not combine or coexist, it may be murder in one of the degrees..\u201d Likewise, in Redman v. State, 67 Texas Crim. Rep., 374, 149 S. W. Rep., 670, this court said: \u201cThe statute itself defining manslaughter has two requisites to reduce voluntary homicide to manslaughter, towit, \u2018sudden passion/ and that that \u2018passion must arise from an adequate cause.\u2019 If either of these requisites are lacking, the offense can not be manslaughter, but must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>be murder in one or the other degrees.\u201d The law is not only thus settled by the decisions of this court, but is unquestionably so settled by our manslaughter statute. Kelly v. State, 151 S. W. Rep., 304; Clore v. State, 26 Texas Crim. App., 624; Hill v. State, 11 Texas Crim. App., 456; Neyland v. State, 13 Texas Crim. App., 536; Blackwell v. State, 29 Texas Crim. App., 194; Miller v. State, 31 Texas Crim. Rep., 609; Ex parte Jones, 31 Texas Crim. Rep., 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-3\">While the court should not have submitted manslaughter, his having done so was favorable to appellant and he has no ground of complaint therefor. Eggleston v. State, 59 Texas Crim. Rep., 542; Alexander v. State, 63 Texas Crim. Rep., 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">This court has repeatedly and expressly held that to call a person a son-of-a-bitch is not adequate cause. Simmons v. State, 23 Texas Crim. App., 653; Levy v. State, 28 Texas Crim. App., 203; Barbee v. State, 34 Texas Crim. Rep., 129; Timon v. State, 34 Texas Crim. Rep., 363. The statute itself states, P. C., art. 1131, what are not adequate causes: \u201cInsulting words or gestures, or an assault and battery so slight as to show no intention to inflict pain or injury, . . . unaccompanied by violence, are not adequate causes.\u201d At most all that deceased said or did towards appellant was, as testified to by appellant, he called him a son-of-a-bitch, or damned son-of-a-bitch, and struck at him with his hand. He committed no battery upon him whatever, and when he did this he immediately departed from appellant. So that there was neither adequate cause, nor was there any sudden passion. In no contingency was appellant, under the law, guilty of manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Even if manslaughter had been in the case none of appellant\u2019s objections to the court\u2019s charge on that subject present any error. While the court correctly told the jury, in accordance with the manslaughter statute that the provocation must arise at the time of the commission of the offense and that the passion is not the result of a former provocation, yet, he fully and completely, as was proper, when a question of that kind arises, told the jury that in passing upon the sufficiency of the provocation and the effects of the passion on appellant\u2019s mind, the past.conduct of the deceased towards the defendant, his threats and bearing,\u2014in fact, all the facts and circumstances in the case should be considered by the jury. Bv no proper construction of the charge was the jury restricted in any way to the consideration of what occurred at the immediate killing and not when the difficulty first began. The whole evidence in this case demonstrates that there was but one difficulty between these parties, not two; that it began at the buggy of the deceased and was immediately and continuously followed up by both parties until, within a space of a very short period of time, the killing occurred. So that the question of cooling time was not in the case, even if the evidence, which it did not, had shown appellant\u2019s passions had been unduly aroused.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Appellant\u2019s criticism of the court\u2019s charge that in submitting manslaughter to them, after giving the necessary facts that must be found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>by the jury from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, \u201cthen you <em>may </em>find him guilty of manslaughter,\u201d is hypercritical. The word <em>may </em>is sometimes used interchangeably with <em>should </em>or <em>must </em>and vice versa. In no event could the use of this word <em>may </em>have been any injury to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">There was no reversible error, under the facts of this case, in the court\u2019s charge on self-defense as claimed by appellant on the question of threats claimed to have been made by deceased towards appellant. As stated above, there was but one difficulty between these parties, all occurring continuously and without any break or cessation from the time it began until the killing occurred. The court was not called upon to charge on that subject at all, even if what appellant testified deceased said to him, when they separated and he was following him up in his buggy, could be considered a threat. In Hancock v. State, 47 Texas Crim. Rep., 3, this court said: \u201cThe charge is further criticised because of this omission to submit the law in regard to threats. The only threats, if any, were made at the time and during the progress of the difficulty and were made in the presence of appellant and directly to him. It was not necessary to charge on the law of threats under this state of case. It was a part and parcel of the transaction itself; one of the remarks made while the first difficulty was in progress, made to appellant himself. It is only necessary to charge the law of threats when those threats have been made prior to the difficulty and communicated.' Whenever the threat is made by the assaulted party to the party making the assault during the progress of the difficulty, it is not necessary to charge these separately. It will be noted there was no attempt to prove any previous trouble between them. The only trouble that had occurred at all began in the saloon, at which place this threat should have been made, if made at all. There was no threat made after leaving the saloon; nor was deceased making any attempt to execute any threat. So there was no error in this omission.\u201d Armstrong v. State, 50 Texas Crim. Rep., 26; Dobbs v. State, 54 Texas Crim. Rep., 550; Davis v. State, 52 Texas Crim. Rep., 149.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">The court did not err in refusing appellant\u2019s fourth special charge. The facts of this case did not call for it and it is not the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Appellant\u2019s only other complaint is that the evidence is insufficient to sustain the verdict. The evidence is not only amply sufficient to sustain the verdict, but the verdict finding him guilty of murder in the second degree is a just and righteous one. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
