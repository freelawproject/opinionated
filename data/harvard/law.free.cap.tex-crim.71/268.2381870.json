We have carefully read and considered it and have reached the conclusion that the evidence is sufficient to sustain the conviction. In addition to our careful study and consideration of this evidence a jury of fair and impartial men, before a. fair and impartial trial judge, heard all this evidence, saw the witnesses, their manner of testifying and their manner, of examination. The jury found him guilty and the judge sanctioned the verdict. Hnder the circumstances we do not feel authorized to disturb the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">The judgment is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
