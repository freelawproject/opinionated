The evidence is not before us, and there are no bills of exception in the record. The charge on accomplice testimony seems to be sufficient. The allegations criticising the charge are of the most general nature and point out no defect. However, the charge seems to be in conformity with the decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-18\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-19\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
