The only question to be decided is appellant\u2019s claim that he elected to be tried under article 572, Penal Code, which made the offense a misdemeanor only. This court has expressly held that the Act of 1907, page 108, making said offense a felony repealed said article 572 in the case of Goolsby v. State, decided May 21, 1913, and Robertson v. State, from McLennan County, recently decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">The evidence clearly established appellant\u2019s guilt. Therefore, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
