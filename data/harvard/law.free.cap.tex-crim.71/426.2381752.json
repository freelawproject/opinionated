These questions have so many times been fully discussed and decided adversely to appellant we deem it unnecessary to further discuss them or cite all of the authorities. But see Sims v. State, 64 Texas Crim. Rep., 435, 142 S. W. Rep., 572, and cases therein cited; and Ferrell v. State, 152 S. W. Rep., 901.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-18\">By such an imperfect bill of exceptions as does not require this court to consider it, appellant, it seems, undertook to prove by the prosecuting witness what he told the deputy sheriff of the details of having sexual intercourse with the appellant and to the officer making him hush because his family was there when he was telling these details. The bill shows no error. Besides the bill in no way shows what the testimony was that he claims was excluded.' The court in approving the bill states that the witness was permitted to testify as to his drunken condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-19\">By a like insufficient bill appellant attempts' to complain that the State, over her objection, was permitted to ask the appellant on her cross-examination in effect if she was not a prostitute. She answered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>that she was not. The fact, if so, can always be drawn out by cross-examination of a witness that she is a prostitute. (McCrary v. State, 38 Texas Crim. Rep., 609; McGrath v. State, 35 Texas Crim. Rep., 413; Hall v. State, 43 Texas Crim. Rep., 479; Bigliben v. State, 151 S. W. Rep., 1044; Bird v. State, 66 Texas Crim. Rep., 611, 148 S. W. Rep., 738; 3 Enc. of Ev., 759; Wilbur v. Flood, 16 Mich., 40.) Besides the witness having testified denying that she was a prostitute, no reversible error is shown. Sweeney v. State, 65 Texas Crim. Rep., 593, 146 S. W. Rep., 883.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"b454-7\">[Behearing denied November 26, 1913.\u2014Beporter.]</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">Appellant asked a peremptory instruction to find her not'guilty be- \u2022 cause the evidence was insufficient to sustain a verdict, and also urges that the evidence is insufficient to do so. It would serve no useful purpose to detail the evidence. We have carefully considered it and in our opinion it is sufficient to sustain the verdict and to show appellant guilty as alleged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">The court gave a full and correct charge, submitting the issues properly to the jury. There being no reversible error, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
