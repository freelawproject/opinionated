Inasmuch as the demurrer presented all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>questions involved in the case, the court, with the consent of the parties, reserved the case for the advice of this court.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"b371-5\">\n<em>Judgment advised for the defendant.</em>\n</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-6\">The answer set up that Frederick T. Covel, the original debtor, had $600 on deposit in the Society for Savings, subject to the conditions stated in his deposit book, being a sum exceeding the plaintiff\u2019s demand ; but that it was part of the proceeds of a pension check received from the United States, which was so deposited on the same day that the check was cashed. To this answer the plaintiff demurred, and the questions arising on the demurrer were reserved for the advice of this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-7\">The deposit book stated that the Society was \u201c formed for the purpose of affording a secure investment to persons of either sex, when circumstances do not afford them the facilities of safely putting their income to use, or of investing it in business ; \u201d that \u201c the principal object of this bank is to provide for the secure keeping of money lodged in it; \u201d that the Society and its directors made no charge for services, and would not be responsible for any losses ; that \u201c the net income of the Society, so far as may be deemed consistent with the interests of the depositors, shall be divided and placed to their credit semi-annually;\u201d that as depositors might \u201cbecome sick or otherwise want their money,\u201d they \u201c may take it out by giving notice to the treasurer one week beforehand, unless the sum proposed to be withdrawn shall exceed two hundred dollars ; in that case four months notice must be given ; \u201d and that \u201c the trustees have a right to pay off any depositor the whole or any part due on his deposit within one month next following any dividend.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b371-8\"><em>William F. Penney, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-9\">I. The property attached is not \u201c pension moneys received from the United States.\u201d The statute, being a statute of exemption, is to be strictly construed. \u201cAs a general legal truth, a statute in derogation of the common rights of creditors ought to receive a strict construction.\u201d <em>Patten </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>4 Conn., 454; <em>Farrell </em>v. <em>Dart, </em>26 id., 381. There is a man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>ifest intention in the act to distinguish between the \u201cpension moneys \u201d themselves and the property in which such moneys are invested. Property in a savings bank deposit is not \u201cpension moneys.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-5\">This court has repeatedly defined and explained the nature of property in such deposits. <em>Savings Bank </em>v. <em>New </em>London, 20 Conn., 117; <em>Bunnell </em>v. <em>Collinsville Savings So</em>ciety, 38 id., 206; <em>Osborn </em>v. Byrne, 43 id., 155.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-6\">II. The funds in question were not \u201c in the hands \u201d of the pensioner. <em>Spellman </em>v. <em>Aldrich, </em>126 Mass., 113; <em>Friend </em>v. <em>Crarcelon, </em>77 Maine, 25; <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Berry, </em>84 id., 541; <em>Cavanaugh et al. </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>84 Ind., 381; <em>Faurote </em>v. <em>Carr et al., </em>108 id., 123; <em>Jardin </em>v. <em>Fairton Sav.

Barbour, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-10\">I. Is pension money which has come into the possession of the pensioner, and been deposited to his credit, and subject to his control, exempt from attachment and execution?</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-11\">There is some authority for holding that Covel\u2019s money on deposit with the defendant in this case is exempt under the operation of the United States statute. The Iowa Supreme Court in <em>Crow </em>v. <em>Brown et al. </em>(1890), reported in Lawyers\u2019 Reports Annotated, book XI., page 110, <em>held </em>that property purchased by a pensioner of the United States government with his pension money, is exempt from execution or attachment for his debts, under the proviso that pension money shall inure wholly to the benefit of the pensioner. See also <em>Folschow </em>v. <em>Werner, </em>51 Wis., 87 ; <em>Reiff v. Mack, </em>28 Atl. Rep., 699; <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Tallada, </em>125 Pa. St., 133.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-12\">II. Our own statute is broader, and exempts pension money after it has reached the pensioner, and while in his hands. This is a remedial statute and ought to be liberally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>expounded in favor of the benovolent object for which it was enacted. <em>Montague </em>v. <em>Richardson et al., </em>24 Conn., 347.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-5\">The Court of Appeals, in the case of <em>Yates County National Bank </em>v. Carpenter, 119 N. Y., 550, extends the exemption of receipts from a pension, under the State law, much farther than the defendant claims here. And see also <em>Stockwell </em>v. Bank, 36 Hun., 583, where it was decided that moneys received from a pension and deposited in a bank in the name of the pensioner were not subject to seizure by his creditors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-6\">Finally, the defendant claims that this money, being exempt from attachment while in Covel\u2019s hands, is also exempt from garnishment. \u201c A garnishee is not chargeable for property in his possession or debts by him owing.to the principal defendant, which are by law exempt from execution or attachment if in the hands of the principal defendant.\u201d American Encyclopaedia of Law, VIII., 1223, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-7\">Judgment should be rendered for defendant.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b373-8\">Baldwin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AsG\">The Revised Statutes of the United States, \u00a7 4747, provide that \u201c no sum of monej' due, or to become due, to any pensioner shall be liable to attachment, levy, or seizure by or under any legal or equitable process whatever, whether the same remains with the Pension Office, or any officer or agent thereof, or is in course of transmission to the pensioner entitled thereto, but shall inure wholly to the benefit of such pensioner.\u201d This statute protects pension money from attachment so long as it remains due to the pensioner, but not after it has been actually paid over, and has come into his possession. <em>Spelman </em>v. <em>Aldrich, </em>126 Mass., 113; <em>Friend </em>v. <em>Garcelon, </em>77 Me., 25 ; <em>Rozelle </em>v. <em>Rhodes, </em>116 Pa. St. 129, 9 Atlantic Reporter, 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">General Statutes, \u00a7 1164, exempts from attachment or execution \u201c any pension moneys received from the United States, while in the hands of the pensioner.\u201d The validity of the plaintiff\u2019s attachment must therefore depend on whether that part of Covel\u2019s pension money which he deposited with the defendant can be considered as still in his hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">The deposit, as soon as made, transferred the title to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>particular bills or specie, which were deposited, from the pensioner to the savings bank. But he also became substantially a part owner of all the assets of the bank. It was an agency for receiving and loaning money on account of its depositors. <em>Savings Bank </em>v. <em>New London, </em>20 Conn., 111; <em>Bunnell </em>v. <em>Collinsville Savings Society, </em>38 id., 203; <em>Osborn </em>v. <em>Byrne, </em>43 id., 155.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">A pension is a bounty for past services rendered to the public. It is mainly designed to assist the pensioner in providing for his daily wants. Statutes protecting his interest in it, until so used, are of a remedial nature and entitled to a liberal construction. <em>Montague </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>24 Conn., 338, 348; <em>Patten </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>4 id., 450, 454; <em>Yates County National Bank </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>119 N. Y., 550, 23 Northeastern Rep., 1108.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">It would be unreasonable to require a pensioner to keep so large a sum as $600 in his personal custody until he had occasion to expend or opportunity to invest it. It would be still in his hands, within the meaning of the law, though left with another for sale-keeping, and would still retain its original character as pension money. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>98 U. S., 343, 358. The natural depositary, in case of a sum so large as $600, would be some kind of a trust or banking institution. The fund in controversy was placed in a savings bank, where, so far as appears, the pensioner had no previous account. -It was a single deposit, entered upon a pass-book, where it constituted the sole credit in his favor, and no dividend from the profits of the bank had or could have been declared upon it, prior to the attachment. He simply exchanged his ownership of $600 for an ownership of such part of the property of the defendant, as corresponded to the proportion between that sum and the total of its net assets ; with the right to take out the amount deposited, in whole or part, on demand, after reasonable notice, provided he withdrew in all no more than his proper share, as a' part owner of the funds of the institution. <em>Osborn </em>v. <em>Byrne, </em>43 Conn., 159. \u2018Presumably the defendant had assets ample to satisfy its depositors in full, and therefore-the pensioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>could, at his discretion, have drawn out the sum deposited, at any time. While in the bank, it was in the hands of an institution conducted for the sole benefit of its depositors, and of which they were the equitable owners ; and although the bills or coin that the pensioner originally left there could no longer be identified, and it might be that they and all the cash funds then belonging to the bank had been loaned out, or otherwise invested, it is our opinion that his pension money can fairly be said to have been still in his hands, within the meaning of our statute of exemptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The Court of Common Pleas is advised to render judgment for the defendant on the demurrer to the second paragraph of the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
