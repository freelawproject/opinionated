J., Torrance, Fenn, Baldwin and Hamersley, Js.</p>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b178-6\">The defendant, an Indiana corporation, was organized as a secret and fraternal society with numerous local branches in this and other States. Among its corporate purposes was the establishment of a \u201cbenefit fund \u201d raised by assessments on the members of the various branches who elected to become participants in that fund, and from which such members were each to receive a sum not exceeding one thousand dollars, payable at such times and in such amounts as the laws of the Order and the certificate of membership prescribed. Eighty per cent of each assessment was remitted by each branch to the treasury of the corporation and the remaining twenty per cent called the \u201creserve fund\u201d was retained and invested by the respective local branches, subject to the call of the corporation in installments at stated intervals for its use in paying its benefit certificates maturing in the future. The defendant having become insolvent, F. was appointed by an Indiana court receiver of all its assets, and subsequently S. was appointed receiver in this State and the \u201c reserve fund \u201d in the custody of the local branches was paid over to him by order of court. The two receivers and the local branches having interpleaded their respective rights to this fund, and the case having been reserved for the advice of this court, it was <em>Held (one Judge </em>dissenting):\u2014</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b178-7\">1. That the contract evidenced by the certificate was one between the holder and the corporation, and that the promise of the latter for the ultimate payment of the stipulated benefit did not depend upon the sufficiency of the \u201c reserve fund \u201d of the particular local branch to which the holder belonged, nor was it secured by any pledge of such fund.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b178-9\">2. That such \u201creserve fund,\u201d whether in the custody of the branches or in the hands of the general officers of the corporation, was a trust fund applicable solely to the payment of certificate holders, and, so long as the corporation was a \u201cgoing concern,\u201d was held in trust for them generally, without distinction between members of different branches.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b178-11\">3. That if the corporation were a \u201c going concern \u201d and able by making assessments and with the aid of these several trust funds held by the local branches, to discharge the trust for the benefit of its certificate holders, it would be the duty of the Connecticut receiver to remit such funds in his hands to the proper general officers of-the Order. But as the corporation was insolvent, disorganized and unable to carry out the purposes of its incorporation, the payment of assessments having stopped and the Order having become practically dissolved, it was incumbent on the courts of this State to see that no injustice would be done <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>to its own citizens who were certificate holders, by remitting the funds to the custody of the Indiana receiver for distribution under the orders of the Indiana court.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b179-5\">4. That it was not clear that, under the orders and decrees of such court as they appeared on the record, the certificate holders in this State would be fully protected in their rights, in case the funds were remitted to the custody of the Indiana receiver; especially since such orders and decrees did not apparently recognize the orders of courts in other States as a justification for the delay of the local branches in those States in accounting to the Indiana receiver, and made no distinction, as to those entitled to share in the funds that might come into his hands, between general creditors of the Order and its certificate holders.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b179-7\">5. That the local branches in Connecticut from whom the receiver in this State collected the funds in controversy, had the right to be amply protected by the court in obedience to whose decree they made such payments; and that this right extended equally to the certificate holders in such branches by whose contribution these funds were created.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b179-9\">6. That the performance of the contract of the Order with its certificate holders having by its fault become impossible, each certificate holder had the right to elect whether to treat the contract as rescinded and demand a return of what he had paid on it, or to treat it as in force and claim damages for its non-fulfillment.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b179-11\">7. That the unanimous election of the Connecticut certificate holders to adopt the former course, had been sufficiently and seasonably made fcnown by the answers and claims filed in their behalf by the several branches and trustees.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b179-13\">8. That as against a foreign receiver and assignee, the members of each branch whose contributions created its \u201creserve fund,\u201d had, under the condition disclosed in the record, an equitable lien upon it, which the courts of their own State could best protect; and that equity would best be promoted by retaining this fund in the hands of the Connecticut receiver for distribution among those .certificate holders of the Order, by whose contributions it was accumulated.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b179-15\">9. That the constitution, laws and rules of the Order did not disclose upon their face that its scheme was fraudulent in offering to certificate holders more than the assessments to be made upon them could justify; and that in the absence of any finding by the trial court showing the existence of fraud in its contracts or management in this State, this court could not presume or infer that its dealings had been of so fraudulent a character as to deprive the Indiana receiver on that ground of all right to claim the funds in controversy.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b179-17\">10. That the standing of the defendant and of its Indiana receiver was not aifeeted by \u00a7 2892 of the General Statutes, prohibiting foreign life or accident insurance companies from doing business in this State unless authorized by the Insurance Commissioner; since \u00a7 2903 excepted every \u201csecret and fraternal society\u201d from such prohibition.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b179-18\">11. Such a corporation does not stand in the same relation to its certificate holders as that occupied by a life insurance company to its policy hold<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>ers, since it relies for the means of paying the stipulated benefits, not on the accumulation of premiums paid, but on assessments to be levied by no fixed rule, upon the different branches of the Order under a system incapable of application after it had ceased to be a \u201c going concern.\u201d</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b180-5\">12. That the claim of F., the Indiana receiver, should be disallowed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b180-6\">13. That the funds in the hands of receiver S. should be distributed, after payment of necessary costs and charges, among tire holders of benefit certificates outstanding and obligatory on the corporation at the date of the commencement of the Indiana receiver\u2019s suit; payments to be made to the certificate holders of each branch in proportion to the amounts paid by them respectively for assessments, less such dividends or benefits, if any, as each certificate holder might have previously received under his certificate.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b180-7\">[Argued January 17th</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A-Q\">decided March 6th, 1894.]</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-8\">Action for the appointment of a receiver of the assets of the defendant corporation in this State; brought to the Superior Court in Fairfield County and tried to the court, <em>Ralph </em>Wheeler, <em>J.; </em>facts found and case reserved for the advice of this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-9\">Upon the plaintiff\u2019s application Edwin L. Scofield was appointed receiver of the funds and estate of the defendant in Connecticut, and thereafter the branches of the Order in this State, pursuant to the order of the Superior Court, paid over to him as such receiver all the funds in their custody. Thereupon the several local branches and James F. Failey, the receiver previously appointed by the Indiana court, where the defendant corporation was organized and had its principal offices, interpleaded their respective claims to the funds turned over to the receiver in this State.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-10\">The other facts are sufficiently stated in the opinion.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b180-11\"><em>Henry 0. Robinson </em>for James F. Failey, the Indiana Receiver.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b180-12\">I. The claim made by the domiciliary receiver is sound by every principle of law and equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b180-13\">The reserve fund, neither in whole nor in part, ever belonged to any branch. The entire membership of the Order owned the entire fund wherever held, and, as such owners, mutually limited their right to call it in to accomplish its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>purposes, to certain periods. These purposes are now lost, and with the loss the limitations fall out, and the owners of the property own it now without limitation upon its use.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b181-5\">There is nothing inconsistent with the claim of title in the Order, in the fact that the branches were authorized to select trustees and that their bonds ran to the branches. The branches were merely the agents of the Order. <em>Schunck </em>v. <em>Withoen and Waisen </em>Fund, 44 Wis., 369; <em>Erdman </em>v. <em>Ins. Co., </em>44 Wis., 376; <em>Lyon </em>v. <em>Sup. Ass. R. S. G. F., </em>153 Mass., 83.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b181-6\">II. The principal receiver is the successor of the corporation which owned the reserve fund. He is also the successor of the parties who created the fund; and is vested by the decree of the domiciliary court with all the funds held by the branches.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b181-7\">To order these funds to be distributed upon State or any other geographical lines would make hotch-pot of the property. The small branches would jostle the large ones, the older certificates would jostle the younger ones, and no single individual would or could get his just share.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b181-8\">III. The rights of receiver Failey are paramount, and the court will assist to enforce them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b181-9\">1 The law is now well settled that, under the principle of comity, the courts of one jurisdiction can recognize the authority and permit the exercise of functions of a receiver appointed in another jurisdiction, except in those cases where a court of the former jurisdiction finds that its <em>own </em>policy will be displaced or the rights of its own citizens invaded or impaired. This is especially true when such receiver is, by the terms of his appointment, to gather the assets wherever found. <em>Hurd </em>v. <em>Elizabeth, </em>41 N. J.

It is altogether unnecessary that the property should be within the jurisdiction of the court making the original appointment. <em>Bank </em>v. <em>McLeod, supra; Haulditch </em>v. <em>Donegal, </em>8 Bligh.

Where the corporation is chartered by a single State and does business through agencies and through branches organized by itself in other States, if it becomes insolvent its assets should be gathered at the domicil and there distributed according to the principles of equity. <em>Relfe </em>v.

Its corporate purposes were defined, in the third of its Articles of Association, as being \u201c to unite in bonds of Union, Protection and Forbearance all acceptable white persons of good character, steady habits, sound bodily health, and reputable calling, who believe in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>Supreme Intelligent Being, the Creator and Preserver of the Universe; to improve the condition of its membership morally, socially and materially, by instructive lessons, judicious counsel and timely aid, by encouragement in business, and by assistance to obtain employment when in need; to establish a Benefit Fund from which members of the said Order who have complied with all its rules and regulations, or the heirs of such member, may receive a benefit in a sum not exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000), which shall be paid in such sums and at such times as may be provided by the laws governing such payment, or in the certificate of membership, and when all the conditions regulating such payment have been complied with.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Its \u201c proper officers <em>\u201d </em>were to have \u201c power, at any time when a liability on account of the sickness, disability or maturity of certificate of a member entitled to a benefit under number three of these Articles occurs, to make the proper and specified assessment, under the prescribed regulation, to meet such liability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">By Article II, see. 3, of the \u201c Constitution \u201d of the Order, duly adopted pursuant to its Articles of Association, one of its objects was particularly declared to be \u201cto establish a Benefit Fund from which those who have held membership in the Order for thirty days or more may, should they so desire, on proper application, and complying with all the rules and regulations governing said Benefit Fund, become participants therein and may receive the benefit of a sum not exceeding twenty-five dollars per week, nor more than <em>one half </em>of the sum total held by each member, when, by reason of disease or accident, they become disabled from following their usual occupation, or an amount of not more than one thousand dollars when they have held a continuous membership in the Order for seven years.

Chief Justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-23\">All the funds now in the bands of the Connecticut receiver were collected by him from local branches of the Order in this State, or from trustees appointed by them, and belonged to the \u201c Reserve- Funds \u201d held for the benefit of Members of the Order who had elected to take benefit certificates.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>It is plain that the contract set forth in these certificates is one between the holder and the Supreme Sitting of the Order of the Iron Hall, and that the promise of the latter for the ultimate payment of the stipulated benefit is not made dependent on the sufficiency of the Reserve Fund of the particular local branch to which the holder belongs, nor secured by any pledge of such fund. If the entire Reserve Fund of any local branch should be lost, by unfortunate investments, whether made by the local trustees, or the \u201c Supreme Trustees\u201d of the corporation, its obligation to meet the certificates held by members of such branch would be unaffected. Of the assessments payable from time to time under Law I, sec. 1, eighty per cent went immediately into the treasury of the corporation, to reimburse it for payments already made on matured certificates, or to be used for the payment of certificates as they might mature, without any discrimination between the members of different branches. The remaining twenty per cent was to be retained and invested subject to be drawn upon, in favor of the Order, only to the extent of one seventh of its total amount annually, which was to be \u201c used by the Supreme Cashier in the payment of benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Ffiph local Reserve Fund was therefore a fund held in trust for the payment, through the general officers of the corporation, in its behalf, and out- of its treasury, of benefits to certificate holders. In the hands of the receiver appointed by the Superior Court, it stands, of oourse, oharged with the same trust,</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">If the corporation were now in a condition to fulfill its obligations to certificate holders, by the aid of the several trust funds held by the local branohes, and to discharge the trusts Upon which it might reoeiye them, aooording to the terms of the certificates and the rules of the Order, it would be our duty to advise that the reoeiver in this State should remit all moneys in his hands to the proper officers of the, Order, But the corporation'is insolvent, and unable to carry out the purposes of its organization ; and has assigned all its right and title to these funds to James F- Failey, a citizen o,f In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>diana, wlio had previously been appointed by a court of that State, receiver of all its estate, wherever situated.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Mr. Failey, as such receiver and assignee, has appeared as a defendant in this cause, and claims the funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Before the courts of Connecticut can sanction such a change of trustees, they must be satisfied that no injustice would thus be done to the citizens of their own State. The local branches and trustees, out of whose charge these funds have been taken by the order of the Superior Gourt, have appeared before us, and in behalf of those whom they represent, unanimously object to any transfer to the Indiana receiver. By the decree of the court under which he, Failey, was appointed, made on August 23d, 1892, he was ordered to collect all Reserve Funds in the hands of any local branches, whether within or without the State of Indiana, and all such branches were ordered to pay the same to him, and enjoined from any other disposition of them. He was also required to report to the court any instance of neglect to comply with the terms of such order, on the part of any person or branch, \u201c when such further order will be made in such behalf as to the court shall in such case seem meet.\u201d All branches making such payments by October 10th, 1892, were to be entitled to share in the distribution of the estate. On December 2d, 1893, another decree was passed in the same suit, confirming that of August 23d, as to the provisions above mentioned, except that the receiver was directed to inform the courts in other States, which had appointed receivers of the corporation, of the terms of both decrees, and request them, and the receivers by them appointed, to account to him, and to pay over to him all moneys in their hands, \u201c to be by him taken and held, together with the funds on hand, as the property of said defendant, the Supreme Sitting of the Iron Hall, which moneys, together with all the other moneys coming to the hands of said receiver herein, shall be hereafter equitably distributed among the creditors and certificate holders of the said defendant.\u201d All members of local branches thereafter properly accounting for and paying over' to him, within a reasonable time, all money and property in their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>possession, or who had accounted, or might within a reasonable time account, in any other State to any local receiver, who thereafter, within a reasonable time, should account for the same to Mr. Failey, as principal receiver, were declared entitled to share in the distribution of the funds in the latter\u2019s hands, when made, equally and ratably \u201c with the creditors and certificate holders of the said defendant corporation.\u201d Any neglect or refusal of any courts or receivers to comply with the request of the Indiana receiver for a transfer to him of the funds in their custody, he was \u201c directed with due speed to report,\u201d whereupon such order was to be made \u201c as at such time may seem proper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AkSP\">These provisions of the decree were predicated on a finding that \u201cattachment and receivership suits have been brought against the defendant, the Supreme Sitting of the Order of the Iron Hall, in very many States and jurisdictions throughout the United States, and that in such proceedings the courts have taken into possession and control the property of the said defendant, the Supreme Sitting of the Order of the Iron Hall, in such States and jurisdictions, and now hold the same under the orders of the various courts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The following facts are also set forth in the same finding:\u2014 At the commencement of the suit in Indiana, which was on July 29th, 1892, there were over a thousand local branches of the Order in different parts of the United States and Canada, of whose members over sixty thousand held benefit certificates. The Order had received nearly six million dollars net, from these certificate holders, and their certificates called for benefits which, at the <em>maximum </em>rate, would amount to about $49,000,000. To meet these obligations the Order had in its treasury, to the credit of the \u201c Benefit Fund,\u201d about a million dollars, according to its books; of which, however, owing to fraud and mismanagement, less than a quarter of a million was available. It also had on hand nearly $350^000, belonging to the \u201cReserve Fund,\u201d and the several local branches had under their control further sums belonging to the same fund, to the aggregate amount of $1,360,000. The other funds of the Order amounted to but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>about a quarter of a million dollars. The several local \u201c Reserve Funds\u201d held in Connecticut amounted to $18,667.05, aud the Connecticut certificate holders who had paid it in, had therefore contributed to the \u201c Benefit Fund\u201d $74,668.20, which had been remitted to the general treasury. They numbered 1098. Four of the Connecticut branches had accounted to the Indiana receiver, and paid over to him, together, over $8,000. Two of them, after his appointment, distributed the \u201c Reserve Funds \u201d in their hands among their members. All of them have ceased to hold regular meetings, and to carry out the purposes of their organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">On February 25th, 1893, Mr. Failey filed in the Superior Court, in the present action, his claim to all the funds in its custody, in which he states that they belong to him as principal receiver, \u201c for the benefit of all the creditors of the corporation, to be distributed according to the constitution and laws of the corporation; and that no particular branch anywhere situated has any claim to the reserve fund, but that the same and all reserve funds belong to the Order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The local branches in Connecticut, from whom or whose trustees the Connecticut receiver has collected the funds in controversy, have a right to be amply protected by the court in obedience to whose decree they have made such payments ; and this'right extends equally to those by whom these funds were originally contributed\u2014the certificate holders, who became such as members of these branches.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">The first Indiana decree proposed to admit to a share in the distribution of the funds coming into the hands of the Indiana receiver, those having property of the Order in their possession who accounted to him by October 10th, 1892. The decree of December 2d, 1893, extended the limit to \u201c a reasonable time \u201d after notice from him of his claims. Such notice was given to the parties to this suit a year or more ago, by the pleadings on fil\u00e9. The Indiana decree does not appear to recognize, as a justification for delay in such accounting, the orders of .courts in other States having jurisdiction of the parties in interest. It seems also to make no distinction, as to those entitled to share in the funds that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>may come into the hands of the Indiana receiver, between general creditors of the Order, and the holders of its benefit certificates.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">In opposition to the claim of Mr. Failey, it has been urged in argument that he is before us in the position of a plaintiff, having no better rights than the Order of which he was appointed receiver, and has since become the assignee; and founding his title to recover the funds in controversy upon a fraudulent compact, namely, the scheme under which the Order was organized aud conducted. The fraud is said to consist in the offer to certificate holders of more than the assessments to be made upon them could justify; and it is argued that if they were parties to the wrong, they occupy in this cause the position of defendants, in possession of the fund, so far as equitable right is concerned, and may therefore invoke the protection of the rule, <em>In pari delicto melior est conditio possedentis. </em>But the certificates contain no promise to pay any particular sum, nor do the constitution or laws of the Order impose any limit on the number of assessments that can be laid. The obligation of the corporation \u2014so far as appears from the face of the papers which express it\u2014would be satisfied by paying the holder of a matured certificate any sum, however small, and its right to enforce contribution from him is only limited by reference to the necessities of the treasury on account of previous payments on other certificates.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">There was no representation that the assessments or other funds of the Order, except the twenty per cent Reserve Fund, were to be left to accumulate, to provide means for the ultimate payment of what might become due on certificates. On the contrary, it was expressly stated that such assessments were to be used to/reimburse the Order for prior expenditures. The obligations of each year were to be discharged by the use of four fifths of the assessments of the year, and the remaining fifth only was to be kept for future recourse. In ordinary contracts of life insurance, where a fixed sum is promised, in consideration of'fixed premiums, paj'able at stated intervals, the maintenance of an adequate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>and accumulating reinsurance reserve is an essential part of of the plan; but what is known as \u201c co-operative insurance \u201d proceeds upon a different theory, and relies mainly upon the assessments and lapses of each year to meet the calls for maturing benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">It has also been argued that if there be no fraud apparent in the constitution, rules, and laws of the defendant Order, yet its whole dealings in this State have been of so fraudulent a character as t\u00e9 deprive its assignee and receiver of any right to claim the funds in controversy by an appeal to the doctrine of comity. The Superior Court has found that the Order was duly incorporated under the laws of Indiana; and it has not found any facts showing as matter of law the existence of fraud .in its contracts or management in this State. It is evident that the rules and laws of the corporation are such as to furnish an easy means for designing men, if placed in official positions, to entrap the unwary by false and alluring representations as to the large returns to be derived from small contributions. The seal of the Order, displayed on the benefit certificates, and on the pamphlet containing the constitution, rules and laws, bears upon its face the device of a safe with the figures \u201c $1,000.\u201d at its top, and beneath it the words <em>\u201cin seven years\u201d </em>One of the rules, which provides that if two assessments are laid in any month, the first shall be laid on the first day of the mouth, and the second on the fifteenth, might easily give a casual reader the impression that in no month could more than two assessments be laid, whereas treble that number could hardly suffice to provide for the maximum benefits. But while these are all circumstances entitled to great consideration, upon any inquiry into the truth of charges of fraud against the officers of the Order, they do not establish its existence as a conclusion of law. Fraud is never presumed. The place to prove it, in a case like this, is in the Superior Court, and the record of the proceedings in that court fails to show that the charge now made was there maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Nor do we think the standing of the corporation, or its receiver before us, is affected by General Statutes, \u00a7 2892, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>reason of the fact that it has done business in this State without authority from the Insurance Commissioner, though it may have been incorporated in another State for the purpose, among other things, of furnishing insurance on the assessment plan. Every \u201c secret or fraternal society \u201d is excepted from the Operation of that statute by General Statutes, \u00a7 2903, and the defendant corporation appears to us to be one answering both these descriptions. \u201cSecret work\u201d by Article XI of the constitution is one of the functions of the \u201c Supreme Sitting,\u201d and the branches are to meet with a \u201c Watchman \u201d at the outer and \u201c Vedette \u201d at the inner door.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">But while restricted as we are to the consideration of questions of law, we cannot say that there was fraud in the original purposes of the defendant corporation, or in its dealings in this State, nor that there was any statutory impediment to its doing business here; the comity which permitted it to come here to organize its local branches and contract with their members, does not require us, in determining the consequences of such contracts, in view of its present position, to overlook the claims of citizens of Connecticut to the protection of its courts. The controversy before us is as to the possession of a trust fund in the hands of the court. The trusts upon which it is held will be the same, whoever may be the trustee. It is made up of several smaller funds, each of which was under the control and management of local trustees in this State, until the court required them to surrender it to its receiver. He now, as regards the claim of Mr. Failey, represents their rights, as well as those of the <em>cestuis que trustent. </em>These local trustees were properly constituted, and no act of maladministration is alleged against them. If their possession could not be disturbed by the Indiana receiver, neither can his be. <em>Cooke </em>v. <em>Warner, 56 </em>Conn. 234, 239. The contract between the certificate holder and the corporation was, by its express terms, made subject to the rules and laws of the Order. For its due performance, on the part of either party, it was necessary that the corporation should maintain its connection with the local branch to which the holder belonged, and continue in active <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>existence as a \u201c going concern.\u201d Payments upon the certificate were to be made out of a \u201c Benefit Fund \u201d raised by assessments levied by the corporation on the several local branches, on account of those of their members who held certificates. The local branch was required to forward 80 per cent of the total amount called for \u201c immediately,\u201d to the \u201c Supreme Treasury \u201d of the corporation, and to notify each certificate member of the call, whereupon he was obliged to pay the amount of his assessment to the branch within thirty days from the date of the original call. Twenty pe\u00edcent of this was to be left with trustees appointed by the branch, and under bonds to its \u201c Chief Justice\u201d and \u201c Vice Justice.\u201d The bonds were all payable to these officers \u201c in trust for said branch,\u201d should the trustee fail to account for the funds, at the end of his term, to his \u201c successor in office or to whoever may be legally appointed to receive the same.\u201d Assessments were to be levied only when previous payments by the corporation out of the Benefit Fund had so reduced it that it required to be replenished. The amount to be paid on each matured certificate was also to be determined, within a certain maximum limit, by the managers of the corporation ; and as it was to be liquidated by means of an order on the \u201cSupreme Cashier,\u201d drawn by the \u201cSupreme Accountant,\u201d and signed by the \u201cSupreme Justice,\u201d it would seem that the corporation intended to reserve some discretionary power to regulate the sum by the state of the treasury.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">It is obvious, as we have already said, that the corporation looked to the calls upon certificate holders in each year, for the means to pay the benefits accruing during the year, and to maintain the \u201cReserve Fund,\u201d which, with the aid of lapses, it was hoped would avoid the necessity of any burdensome multiplication of assessments. In 1892, upon the insolvency of the corporation and the appointment of receivers in different States, the receipts from assessments stopped, the branches generally ceased to meet, and the Order became disorganized, and practically dissolved. The carcass remained, but the life was gone. The end was reached, so far as the rights of certificate holders are concerned, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>ou July 29th, 1892, the day when the suit was instituted in Indiana for the appointment of a receiver. In view of the condition of the corporation at the time, and the probability of such an appointment, no certificate holder could have been expected to make any future payment to it for assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The performance on its part <em>of </em>the contract of the Order with the certificate holders having by its fault become impossible, each of these had the right to elect whether to treat the contract as rescinded and demand a return of what he had paid on it, or to treat it as in force and claim the damages resulting to him from the corporation having put itself in a condition incompatible with the fulfillment of its engagements. 2 Saunders on Pleadings and Evidence, *674; <em>Lyon </em>v. Annable, 4 Conn., 350, 355. The Connecticut certificate holders, represented before us through the several trustees or branches who have appeared or pleaded in the cause, have unanimously elected the former course, and such election has been sufficiently and seasonably made known .by the answers and claims which have been filed. Under these circumstances, we think equity will best be done, as between the parties before us, by retaining the funds in controversy in the hands of the receiver appointed by the Superior Court, for distribution among the certificate holders of the Order, by whose contributions they were originally accumulated. <em>In re Equitable Fund Life </em>Association, 131 N. Y., 354; 30 Northeastern Rep., 114, 120; <em>Lindquist </em>v. Glines, 23 N. Y. Suppl., 272; <em>Peltz </em>v. <em>Supreme Chamber of the Order of Financial </em>Union, 19 Atlantic Rep., 668; <em>Fogg </em>v. <em>Supreme Lodge of Order of Golden Lion, </em>156 Mass., 431; 33 Northeastern Rep., 692, 693.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">For every dollar paid by them to the accountant of their local branches, eighty cents has been transmitted to the general treasury of the Order, to reimburse it for benefits paid to other certificate holders, and twenty cents has been reserved to meet similar claims to mature thereafter. It is to the reserve funds thus constituted that contributors, electing to rescind the contract evidenced by their benefit certificates, have a right to look primarily for repayment of their ad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>vanees. These funds were manifestly left, by the laws of the Order, in the hands of the local branches for their better assurance. As against the demand of a foreign receiver and assignee, we think the members of each branch whose contributions created its Reserve Fund, have, under the conditions disclosed in the record of this cause, an equitable lien upon it, which the courts of their own State can best protect, especially where he claims it for distribution among the creditors of the corporation generally without any distinction in favor of certificate holders.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">In quoting the constitution and laws of the defendant corporation, the edition of 1888 has been followed. We have not found it necessary to consider the effect of the changes of phraseology found in later editions, and which it is claimed were made without authority; since, while they might serve to strengthen the legal title of the corporation to the custody of the various Reserve Funds, they cannot vary the trusts upon which they were created and must be administered.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">The Superior Court is advised to direct the distribution of the funds now in the hands of Edwin L. Scofield, receiver, after payment of necessary costs and charges, among the holders of benefit certificates, issued by the Supreme Sitting of the Order of the Iron Hall, to them as members of branches of the Order organized in Connecticut, and outstanding and obligatory upon said corporation on July 29th, 1892; payments to be made out of the fund received from the trustees of each local branch to the certificate holders of that branch, in proportion to the amounts paid by them respectively for assessments, laid upon them as holders of such certificates, deducting from such dividends, in each case, such amount, if any, as the certificate holder may have previously received from said Order by reason of his rights under his certificate; and to dismiss and disallow the claim of James F. Failey, receiver of said corporation by appointment of the Superior Court for Marion County in the State of Indiana, to said funds or any part thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>In this opinion Andrews, C. J., Torrance and Fenn, Js., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b202-5\">Hamersley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqZ\">(dissenting). In the result announced by the majority of the court I concur, but not with the reasons given in support of that result.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">If the funds in question were accumulated by the defendant corporation in the transaction in this State of a business lawful under our laws, then such funds ought to be placed in the hands of Mr. Failey, the principal and domiciliary receiver appointed by the Indiana court; unless there are facts in the case which establish some clear ground of exception to the general rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">The rule that when a corporation is chartered by a single State and does a lawful insurance business in other States through agencies and becomes insolvent, its assets should be gathered at the domicil, and there distributed according to the principles of equity, is sound and should be universally observed. It is based upon a recognized principle of international comity; and that principle as applicable between our several States, rests on reasons far more cogent than the reasons which support the principle as applicable between nations wholly independent. While it is true that for many purposes our States are independent, as really as if they were for all purposes separate sovereignties, and for this reason the rules of international comity may apply to questions arising between citizens of different States, yet it is also true that the citizens of all the States are fellow subjects of one common government, supreme within the sphere of its operation, and that the necessities growing out of such common government impose upon the several States obligations of the highest authority, inconsistent with that cautious and self-protecting administration of the law of comity that may be safely indulged in by States wholly foreign to each other. The full faith and credit positively given in each State to the judicial proceedings of every other State; the good faith and confidence impliedly required in dealing with such judicial proceedings; the commercial necessity of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>distribution of assets of an insolvent corporation by one court, growing out of the guaranteed freedom and infinite variety of commercial intercourse; the impossibility in many cases of an equitable distribution except by one court; the concurrent jurisdiction, and at times exclusive jurisdiction, of Federal courts in such cases, all suggest cogent reasons for a loyal observance of the rule stated, unless the particular facts present a plain and unquestioned exception to the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">It will not, however, be necessary to inquire whether the particular facts in this case do, or do not, present such exception. Mr. Failey practically appears in this matter as a plaintiff; and, as the foundation of his claim and right to the assistance of this court, sets out in full the organization, constitution and laws of the defendant corporation, and a record containing the findings, orders and decrees of the Indiana court.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">The Durham Branch, in its demurrer, says, that upon the documents set out by Failey, in connection with the findings, and orders of the Indiana court, it appears that the business transacted in this State was unlawful and contrary to public policy; and also in its claim alleges as a fact that the defendant corporation was not organized and qualified to do business in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">The Superior Court has made a finding of facts for the purpose of submitting to this court the whole' record, with the facts set forth in the finding, and of obtaining the advice of this court upon all questions arising upon the pleadings and record; including the questions arising upon the demurrer and the overruling thereof, and the question of what judgment upon the facts found should be rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">In the finding of facts the court finds, in addition to the facts otherwise appearing on the record, that the Indiana court had made certain further findings of fact, conclusions of law, and orders, which should be added to the record set out and relied upon by Failey in his claim, and makes such findings of fact, conclusions of law and orders a part of this record; and also finds that of the funds oil hand $- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>were accumulated in 1889 and subsequently; (it was stated in argument, and not questioned, that this blank should be filled by a sum representing nearly the whole amount accumulated) and that the corporation has never been authorized to do insurance business in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Thus the main and determinative question we are called upon to decide is upon the facts contained in the record and found by the court:\u2014Should the Superior Court now hold that the business transacted in this State by the insolvent corporation was a business contrary to our public policy? This question requires that we should first come to an understanding of the meaning and legal effect of the remarkable mass of words called the constitution and laws of the Order of the Iron Hall. They contain the articles of <em>association\u2014i. e., </em>the charter of the corporation, the constitution adopted by the corporation, the constitution prescribed by the corporation for governing local branches, the general laws adopted by the corporation for its own government, and the few special laws governing delegated meetings of local branches, called district meetings, to be from time to time called by officers of and subject to the control of the corporation; special laws governing the life division\u2014 which do not appear to have been put into operation ; and an official summary of the effect of the constitution and laws in a number of enumerated cases. The meaning of this literature cannot be understood without the most thorough analysis of the whole and every part, and it is too voluminous to be quoted in full; but I am satisfied that a careful examination of the documents establishes the following conclusions:\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">1. The defendant was incorporated in December, 1881, by filing articles of association in pursuance of a general statute of Indiana authorizing the incorporation of three or more persons for the purpose of organizing \u201c divisions or associations of temperance, or other charitable associations or orders.\u201d The members of the corporation so organized consist, for all practical purposes, of its principal officers. The stated meetings of the corporation are biennial or quad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>rennial, and the officers are re-chosen at such meetings. Eight specified officers must receive salaries, and may receive other compensation. A body called the executive committee exercises all powers of the corporation concerning business matters, fixes the salaries and compensation of all officers, and is composed of nine officers, of whom six are of those required to be salaried.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">2. The corporation undertakes to accomplish two distinct, though related objects : First, to organize and govern local branches of a secret social society; second, to establish and carry on an insurance business on the assessment plan, in which the insured must first have been admitted members of the secret society, and must continue in good standing as such members.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">3. While the secret social society is under the absolute control of the corporation, the members of the society are not members of the corporation, and the corporation assumes no liability to furnish them the pecuniary aid usually provided by fraternal and mutual aid societies. The members of the society, as such, are called \u201c social members.\u201d One of their privileges is the right to apply for insurance\u2014 <em>i. e., </em>to become \u201cparticipant in the benefit fund,\u201d and by the laws governing the secret society such insured members have the exclusive right to vote and hold office, the privilege of paying dues being common to all the members. The constitution provides that any person who has held a membership in the society for thirty days or more may, if he so desire, become a participant in the benefit fund. To become such participant he must make application, undergo medical examination, sign the obligations relating to conditions of insurance, etc., in the same manner as in the transaction of any insurance business, and the corporation states in its official summary of its laws that before insurance the insured must become \u201c an acceptable social member of the order, which is purely <em>fraternal; </em>\u201d and that after being a social member thirty days \u201c he may, if he so desire, make application to become a member of the benefit fund; \u201d or, at his option, he may remain a social member for life, and \u201c as such social <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>member he would enjoy all the fraternal and social privileges of the order.\u201d And again, \u201c social members shall pay the same dues as the members of the benefit fund, and cannot vote or hold office, neither are they entitled to any benefits for sickness or disabilitjr.\u201d It is through the local branches of this secret society that the corporation secures its agents, and revenue for pushing its scheme of insurance. Each member, whether insured or not, pays into his local branch various fees and dues, by which all its expenses in maintaining attractive social features and drawing in candidates for the insurance business of the corporation, are provided for. It is also through these local branches that the corporation provides the revenues which it uses for its corporate expenses and to divide as salaries and compensation among the corporators. For such purposes the branches pay the corporation charter and registration fees, profits on the sale of paraphernalia and supplies, and such <em>per capita </em>tax on all members, whether insured or not, as the corporation sees fit to levy. It is necessary to keep in mind these distinctions. The secret society is not the corporation. The society supplies the corporation with funds for tire use of the few corporators, but the corporation is by its laws forbidden to give to members of the society any pecuniary aid in case of sickness, accident or death. No element of benevolence, charity, or mutual aid exists between the corporation and members of the society. The insurance business is a business distinct from the organization of the secret society, and is transacted directly between the corporation and its certificate holders, just as truly as if the business were carried on, as has been done in connection with the Masonic fraternity, by a corporation having no connection with the fraternity, beyond the fact that its field of insurance is confined to the members of the fraternity in good standing. These distinctions between the corporation and the secret society, between the corporation as the organizer of the secret society and as the manager of the insurance business, are clearly deducible from the constitution and laws submitted to us; although those docu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>ments are well calculated and perhaps intended to obscure and conceal such distinctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">4. The insurance business established and carried on by the corporation, consists in issuing certificates whereby the corporation undertakes to pay the bolder $1,000, in seven years, upon condition that the holder shall pay all assessments of $2.50 when called upon in pursuance of the laws made by the corporation, and upon the further condition that he shall continue a member in good standing of the secret society organized and controlled by the corporation. In order to attract the savings of the very smallest earnings, provision is made for issuing similar certificates for the payment of one, two, three, or four fifths of $1,000, upon condition of paying assessments of one, two, three, or four fifths of $2.50. The obligation of the corporation also involves the payment of certain weekly sums in case of the disability of the certificate holder; but as the whole amount so paid can in no case exceed one half of the sum named in the certificate, and in every case must be deducted from the sum agreed to be paid on its termination, this provision does not affect the character of the principal agreement. The obligation also involves the payment-of one half the amount named in the certificate in case of the death of the holder after the first two years of the term ; but this provision only covers a life risk for one and one half, or at most, for five years; and in view of the small percentage of mortality in any one term of five years, cannot seriously affect the principle of the insurance. The substantive business consists in the payment of a fixed sum at the end of seven years. The subsidiary provisions may furnish an excuse for calling the business accident and life, as well as endowment Insurance, but are in fact mere incidental attractions for the prosecution of the main scheme, which the whole literature of the corporation, as well as the seal, indicative of its main object described in the charter, authoritatively announces to be the payment of$1,000, in seven years.\u201d The corporation promises to pay $1,000 in seven years in consideration of the payment of the assessments of $2.50 each, and upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>representation that those assessments shall not in the aggregate equal $1,000. Counsel claim that the corporation does not promise to pay $1,000, but only a sum \u201cnot exceeding $1,000.\u201d I think this error arises mainly from a misapprehension of the .effect of the certificate. That paper, it is true, contains a promise to pay \u201ca sum not exceeding $1,000,\u201d but it contains no promise as to the time or as to any detail. The only promise is to pay a sum \u201cin accordance with and under the provisions of the laws \u201d of the corporation, and this paper is authenticated by the seal of the corporation, which contains the charter, declaration of its main purpose and object, \u201c$1,000 in seven years.\u201d To the laws we must look for the actual promise. The law says:\u2014\u201c There shall be attached to this Order a benefit fund, in which members may participate (except social members), as they may severally elect, either in the sum of $1,000, $800, etc., on which they shall pay the rates and be entitled to the benefits prescribed in the following table : \u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-5\">\u201cTABLE OF BATES AND BENEFITS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-6\">\u201c Amount paid on each assessment, . . $2.50</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-7\">Weekly benefit when sick or disabled, . $25.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-8\">Amount paid on total disability, . . $500.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj4\">Payable at death, ..... $500.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-10\">Benefits paid at end of seven years not exceeding, ......$1,000.00 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">Here is a direct promise that the certificate holder shall participate in the fund \u201cin the sum of $1,000,\u201d and \u201cshall be entitled\u201d to $25.00 a week during sickness, $500 on total disabilitjr, $500 at death ; (the obligation to pay these sums is absolute, it is not a mere promise to pay a sum not exceeding $500), and at the end of seven years benefits not exceeding <em>$1,000\u2014i. e., </em>the benefits remaining unpaid of the sum of $1,000 which he has elected as the sum which specifies his participation in the benefits. No other construction can be given this language except as a subterfuge for palpable fraud \u2014and such construction the court cannot give. And this construction of the direct promise of \u201c $1,000 in seveu years \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>is fully confirmed by a careful examination of the whole body of the laws. The only exception to the obligation is contained in the section which provides that when one assessment\u00bb of $2.50 shall realize an amount less than $1,000, if the certificate be in the amount of $1,000, the certificate holder shall receive no more than the \u201cwhole amount of said assessment.\u201d That is, until the business increases so as to include more than 400 certificate holders, (the number necessary to produce $1,000 at $2.50 each,) each certificate holder whose claim matures must be content with the product of one assessment ; and the insertion of this exception is strong affirmation that the promise to pay the whole sum named in the certificate is binding in every other case.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Counsel also claim that the business scheme of this corporation does not involve the representation that assessments imposed on the certificate holders shall not in the aggregate equal $1,000. There is no foundation for such a claim. We are called upon to declare the legal meaning of a body of laws prepared for the sole purpose of attracting and building up a large business. The purpose for which such laws are framed is as truly an element in their construction as the eontextural meaning of the particular language used to accomplish that purpose. In passing on the character of the business disclosed by laws so framed, we are bound to exercise that knowledge of the patent, well established and universally recognized elements of human nature, and of business transactions which the court must be presumed to possess. In this case the business, the securing of which is the object and sole object of the laws, consists in obtaining from a large number of the public the payment to the corporation of $2.50 from time to time upon the promise by the corporation of paying to each contributor $1,000 at the end of seven years. It is certain that such a business cannot exist without the belief on the part of the contributors that the assessments of seven years will be less than $1,000. By the very fact of offering to the public, for the purpose of obtaining business, the prospectus contained in these laws, the corporation makes the representation that $1,000 is to be obtained in seven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>years by contributing in small sums less than that amount. Such representation is written into their prospectus by the fact of publication, unless it is clearly excluded by the language used. It is true the corporation might have, said: \u201c This business cannot honestly be carried on without collecting from each contributor in assessments the full amount of $T,000.\u201d If this language had been used no business would have been done and the laws would not be before us for construction. Not only is no such language used, but the representation implied in the very fact of presenting this business to the public is plainly set forth in the laws of the corporation. The law providing for the payment of assessments says: \u201c All payments shall be made in accordance with the following sections, and in <em>no other way or </em>manner.\u201d And until the laws are changed no assessment can be made except as provided. The only provision for calling for payment of assessments is that if the treasury requires an assessment shall be made, and that \u201c when it is evident from the claims filed in regular form that two assessments are necessary in any one month, the'n it shall be the duty of the supreme accountant to make the calls for said assessments at the same time, dating the calls one on the 1st and the other on the 15th of the month, except when those dates occur on a Sunday or legal holiday, in which case they shall be -dated the preceding day.\u201d And in its official summary of the laws, intended for those unable to wade through the whole mass of legislation, the corporation says: \u201c When it is necessary to call two assessments in one month, they shall be issued from the office of the supreme accountant on the first day of such month, or as near thereto as may be expedient.\u201d Surely it needs no argument to show that these laws not only confirm the representation made in the very fact of presenting this scheme to the public, but contain the representation that not more than two assessments a <em>month\u2014i. e., </em>$420 in seven years, will be required to obtain the payment of $1,000, and that therefore the laws make no provision for calling further assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">In confirmation of the view taken, attention may be called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>to the fact that the Superior Court has made a part of the record of this case, conclusions of law found by the Indiana court in the proceeding which Failey sets out as the basis of his claim. These conclusions of law are:\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">\u201c 1. That the defendant, in the issuance of certificates of membership in the benefit fund in the finding of facts described, was engaged in doing a health, accident, life and endowment insurance business, and the same was neither charity nor benevolence within the meaning of the statutes and laws of Indiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">\u201c 2. That under the said contracts made by the defendant with persons holding certificates in the benefit fund, the defendant was bound to pay the full or gross amount severally named in said certificates, at the expiration of seven years from the date thereof, if then in force, less the payments (if any) theretofore made on such certificates on account of sickness or disability benefits. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">\u201c 4. That the defendant is not a mutual company, in the sense that the certificate holders in its benefit fund are members of the (Supreme) Sitting of the Order of Iron Hall, as the certificates constitute contracts entered into by the defendant on the one part and certificate holders on the other part, of the legal tenor and effect stated in the second conclusion above.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">We find therefore that the record and facts before us clearly establish the conclusion that the essential business carried on in this State by the corporation, was the issue of certificates promising the payment of $1,000 in seven years, upon condition that the certificate holder shall pay during that time assessments of the fixed sum of $2.50 each, for the purpose of enabling the corporation from the money so paid in assessments, to pay $1,000 as each certificate matures; and that this business necessarily involved the representation that the aggregate of assessments in each case would be less than $1,000; and further involved the representation, in fact made in the conduct of the business in this State, that the aggregates of assessments in each case would not exceed $420. The provision for a so-called \u201creserve fund\u201d does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>not affect the character of this business. That provision simply permits the reservation of one fifth of each assessment, one seventh of the money so reserved, to be used annually in payment of matured certificates for the purpose of reducing the amount of future assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">The difficulty with the business consists in the impossibility of paying \u00a71,000, from assessments amounting to \u00a7420, or any sum materially less than \u00a71,000 ; and this difficulty is not to be avoided by using one fifth ~of the inadequate assessments, at the rate of one seventh a year, for the purpose of reducing the inadequate assessments of the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\"><em>Nor </em>is the character of the business materially affected by so-called \u201c lapses,\u201d <em>i. e., </em>the possibility of a certain percentage of certificate holders forfeiting the assessments paid, by neglect to continue such payments. If the business really depends on sueh lapses, and its object is to pay a large profit to matured certificate holders from money obtained by means of such lapses, then the business is unsound and dishonest. But the lapses are a necessary incident, and do not materially affect the character and result of the business. The percentage of such lapses is established by insurance experience; the main portion of such lapses must be at the beginning, and not at the close of the term; the security of the certificate holder must consist in maintaining, not in diminishing, the number of those liable to assessment; and a slight mathematical process will demonstrate that such lapses cannot prevent the eventual loss to some one involved in a business based on a principle of paying \u00a71,000 for \u00a7500.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">Such a business is clearly distinguishable from legitimate insurance. All insurance has a wagering element, and by the common law of this State wagering contracts are unlawful. In insurance, however, the wager is not the controlling element. The object of the contract is protection; in fire and other insurance of property, protection of the actual value of the property destroyed; in life insurance, protection of the value of a man\u2019s life to his family or his creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">But in any such case, if the element of protection is eliminated, if there is no insurable interest, if the contract is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>mere speculative bet on contingencies, if nothing but the wagering element remains, then the contract becomes obnoxious to the law which pronounces wagers illegal. In these certificate contracts there is no element of protection to property ; it is a purely business speculation. The bait held out to the certificate holder is the hope of getting $1,000 without paying for it. He risks his little stakes of $2.50 (a small sum purposely fixed for bringing the temptation home to a great mass of the people), in the expectation of succeeding in the scramble for a thousand dollars in seven years.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">This business is also distinguishable from that <em>quasi </em>insurance business, which really partakes more of the nature of investment or saving bank business, called endowment insurance. This is a comparatively new branch of insurance business; but in States where the standard of safety and solvency has been established by legislation, the law says, that for a $1,000 seven-year endowment insurance policy, issued at the age of 80, the company shall charge, and the insured shall pay, $125.74 each year until maturity ; and that after deducting the current cost of insurance each year, the whole balance must be carefully invested and compounded at the standard rate of interest. Whether this particular regulation is essential to the conduct of the business or not, it is plain that the business of issuing $1,000 seven-year endowment policies indiscriminately' to all persons between 18 and 65, on payments not exceeding $60.00 a year, cannot be honestly conducted; and such impossibility cannot be altered by calling premiums \u201cassessments.\u201d Life insurance may come to be safely' conducted on the assessment plan, and possibly human ingenuity may devise a scheme for safely conducting endowment business on that plan; but it is a mathematical certainty that the so-called endowment business this corporation has attempted to conduct, can only result in loss to the certificate holders.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Still more clearly should this business be distinguished from that of fraternal and mutual aid societies. The latter have no element of speculation ; they are purely protective, and are based upon the necessity and duty of mutual aid in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>time of trouble; and so act as powerful incentives in promoting that cultivation of thrift and mutual helpfulness which is essential to the prosperity and good order of society. For this reason they are favored by the law, and entitled to its protection. But the former has no element of protection, and is purely speculative. It seeks not to help the unfortunate, but to make profits out of their misfortunes, and tends directly to discourage thrift and promote that speculative spirit which is a serious danger to society. Between these two there is an impassable gulf, and not the least of the injury resulting from the business of this corporation is its direct tendency to discourage and weaken legitimate fraternal and mutual aid societies. This business, therefore, is nominally an insurance business, whose essential characteristics are: 1. The elimination of the protective element of insurance, so that the wagering element ceases to be incidental and becomes the controlling element. 2. The certainty of ending in a money loss to a large number of certificate holders.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Such conclusion is a mathematical certainty. If fourteen men agree to pay equal assessments into a common fund, so that at the end of seven years each one may draw out $1,000, it is evident that each will pay in the amount he draws out. Such agreement is harmless, but will never be entered into. If, however, a company issues its certificates promising to pay $1,000 in seven years upon the payment of such assessments as the certificates mature, and obtains fourteen certificate holders, one eacli year for fourteen years, and continues the business of collecting assessments and paying benefits until the last certificate matures, we have this result:\u2014The first man pays $143 in assessments, and draws out $1,000\u2014a net profit of $857 ; the last man pays $2,593 in assessments, and draws out $1,000\u2014a net loss of $1,593 ; the first six men make a profit of about $3,000 ; the seventh and eighth pay in and draw out the same amount, and the last six lose about $3,000 ; and in any method adopted for putting in execution such a scheme, either the certificate holders draw out the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>amount they pay in, or some members make a profit out of the losses of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">The subsidiary elements introduced by the defendant in its scheme may modify results, but cannot affect the principle. It is an inherent element in every such scheme that whenever the business closes, some one must be a loser. It is also certain that practically the business cannot be carried on without a rapid increase of members. As soon as- the limit of increase is reached the business must close, and so the extent of the loss will be great in proportion to the success of the business. When, to such a scheme is added the fact that the corporation which carries it on makes large gains, proportioned to the extent of its business, and induces the public to take its certificates by the representation that $1,000 will be so gained in seven years through the payment of a much less sum, the fraudulent character of the business becomes yet more apparent and far more dangerous to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">The facts found in the record before us strikingly illustrate the substantial fraud in'which the business set forth in the pleadings must result. It appears from the statement contained in the record of the condition of this company at the time of the appointment of Failey receiver, that the corporation has received several hundred thousand dollars, used for corporate expenses and for division among its officers, and at the time of failure was in receipt of a revenue for such purposes of upwards of $60,000 a year; that a large number of the earlier certificate holders have received net profits averaging about $420 each ; and that the 60,000 remaining certificate holders, if all the money collected for assessments and not paid out on matured certificates, is divided among them, must lose about $2,000,000. Such is the result of a few years successful business, when conducted with all the honesty which such a business will permit. This practically illustrates what the documents before us demonstrate, that the very essence of the business carried on in this State, and which now seeks the aid of the court of equity, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>paying unearned profits to the few from the losses of the many.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">I believe no case has been decided upon the precise question whether such a business is contrary to public policy, but courts have plainly characterized its nature when opportunity has been given. In Massachusetts, in reference to a corporation doing a somewhat similar business, but organized under a peculiar statute of that State, the court says:\u2014\u201c It is not in our power to declare the business contrary to public policy, and a fraud on an unprotected part of the community, since the Legislature have authorized it, but it is well to understand with what kind of business we are dealing. No one who does understand it, we think, would hesitate to agree that all legislative conditions must be complied with strictly.\u201d <em>Fogg </em>v. <em>Supreme Lodge U. O. Golden </em>Lion, 156 Mass., 431. In New Jersey, in holding that a similar business was not within the meaning of the New Jersey statute authorizing the formation of benevolent and charitable institutions, the court says :\u2014\u201c How can it ever be said that the Legislature ever intended to allow the learned and skillful and financially able to make profit, under the guise of benevolence and charity, out of the unlearned and unskilled, and those who are so unfortunate as to suffer from financial disability ? After the fullest and most careful reflection I am unable to discover any method or principle of law by which this scheme can be sustained under this Act. With all due respect to the learned counsel who presented the case for the defendant, it seems to me that the scheme prescribed by the constitution and by-laws in this case, has more the appearance of a lottery than of a charity.\u201d <em>Peltz </em>v. <em>Supreme Chamber Financial </em>Union, 19 Atl. Rep. 671. In Pennsylvania, a corporation organized under a general statute authorizing incorporation for the purpose of \u201c the maintenance of a society for beneficial or protective purposes to its members from funds collected therein,\u201d attempted a somewhat similar business, and the Court of Common Pleas, in revoking its charter, says:\u2014\u201c The leading feature about which all others cluster, is this vicious proposition to give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>a man good money for nothing. This cannot be done as a business matter, honestly and fairly.\u201d And the Supreme Court, in sustaining the revocation of the charter, says :\u2014 \u201c The auditor and the court below have sufficiently demonstrated that the only persons likely to be benefited by the scheme set forth in the charter are the officers themselves. It manifestly belongs to that class of associations, by far too numerous, the practical effect of whose operations is to enrich a few at the expense of confiding and ignorant people. Such corporations are \u2018 unlawful and injurious to the community.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re National Indemnity and Endowment Co., </em>142 Penn. St., 450.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">We have before us now, a corporation which has-carried on in this State the insurance business described, not as a system of mutual aid between the members of a mutual aid society, but independently, the society such as it is, simply defining the field of insurance; and the question is distinctly raised\u2014Is that business contrary to our public policy? In determining this question we are embarrassed by no unfortunate legislation directly or impliedly authorizing such business. It is a fundamental principle of our law that courts will not undertake to administer justice in behalf of one whose claim is based upon a violation of law, whether that law be a statute, a legal principle, or a rule of conduct based upon accepted views of sound ethics and public interest, which has been incorporated into our system of jurisprudence by force of the well established judicial recognition which defines our unwritten law. Courts are established to settle rights founded in law. They have no jurisdiction of violations of the law, except for the purpose of punishment. This principle is found in the earliest records of our law, and has been enforced and illustrated in innumerable eases.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">That the transactions in question are in violation of law is plain. In the first place, the record finds that the corporation \u201c has never been authorized to do insurance business in the State of Connecticut.\u201d Sec. 2892 of the General Statutes says:\u2014It shall not be lawful for any foreign corporation, organized for the purpose.of furnishing life or accident in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>suranee, or indemnity upon the assessment plan, to do any business in this State unless authorized by the Insurance Commissioner. Counsel claims that this prohibition has no application, because of a subsequent section which says it shall not be construed to apply to any \u201c secret or fraternal society, nor to any association organized for benevolent and charitable purposes whose members are employed by one or by one or more similar corporations,\u201d etc. I think an examination of the whole law clearly shows that the words \u201c secret or fraternal society \u201d include only the well known class of associations formed for dispensing aid or benefits to their members, and that the exception does not apply to a corporation doing an assessment insurance business distinct from the benevolent operations of any secret or fraternal society. It will hardly be claimed that the mere word \u201csecret \u201d is efficacious to exclude from the operation of the act any corporation that may choose to call its janitor a \u201c watchman \u201d or its doorkeeper a \u201cvedette.\u201d But there is no exception to \u00a7 2905; and that section provides that no foreign insurance corporation shall, directly or indirectly, transact business in this State until it shall have first appointed, in writing, the Insurance Commissioner of this State its lawful attorney, on whom process may be served. The record shows that this has not been done. I do not wish, however, to \u2022seek a ground for violation of public policy in the mere failure to comply with such requirements, when the actual transactions have been in violation of rules of conduct touching \u25a0the gravest interests of society, and which are as well established law as if expressed in the form of a statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The insurance business of this defendant cannot exist -without resulting in a fraud. In cannot be conducted without untrue representations. It is essentially of a wagering nature. Its direct and necessary tendency is an unmitigated public injury. The evils resulting from mere wagering purchases -of stock, and which the law condemns as absolutely illegal, are slight compared with the disaster that must follow schemes of insurance which can only be started by appeals to the gambling spirit of a whole people, and can only end <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>in widespread loss. The rules of a public policy which condemn this business are well settled by judicial decisions, and this case really involves no new application of such rules; but if, in fact, it were a case of new application, the public injury is so great, and the violation of plain principles of law so clear, that the court should not hesitate to make the application. In <em>Egerton </em>v. <em>Brownlow, </em>4 House of Lords Cases, p. 161, Lord Lyndhurst says:\u2014\u201c The inquiry must, in each instance where no former precedent had occurred, have been into the tendency of the act to interfere with the general interest. The rule, then, is clear; whether the particular case comes within the rule, it is the province of the court in each instance acting with due caution, to determine.\u201d And Lord Chief Baron, Sir Frederick Pollock, in the same case, page 149, says :\u2014\u201c After all these authorities, am I not justified in saying that, were I to discard the public welfare from my consideration, I should abdicate the functions of my office\u2014I should shrink from the discharge of my duty? * * * I think I am bound to look for the principles of former decisions, and not to shrink from applying them with firmness and caution to any new and extraordinary case that may arise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The question before us is not raised by the conflicting claims of the certificate holder and the corporation as to the validity or legal effect of a particular contract, but it is raised by the application of this corporation, through its receiver, asking the aid of a court of equity, for the purpose of settling its affairs, to put him in the possession of money due on account of business transacted in this State. The facts set out in this application, and the finding of the Superior Court, clearly show that the business so transacted, was essentially fraudulent and in violation of our public policy. The courts of this State cannot assist those who prosecute their business contrary to its settled policy, either in the prosecution of that business, or after its prosecution has ceased. Courts of equity will give no aid even in adjusting the accounts in a partnership formed for such purpose. <em>Watson </em>v. Murray, 23 N. J. Eq., 257; <em>Anderson </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>Powell, 44 Iowa, 20; <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Fletcher, </em>7 Graft., 1. And <em>a fortiori </em>they will give no aid to a foreign corporation, in obtaining possession of property claimed to have been acquired through such violation of law. The claim of Mr. Failey must therefore be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">There is no question raised as to the jurisdiction of the Superior Court to distribute the funds now in the hands of Scofield, receiver. There appear to be no creditors, and no parties in interest, except the contributors to these funds. It is alleged and shown that the only protection against the dissipation of these funds through a multiplicity of suits, lies in their distribution by order of court. It is doubtless true that in the complications now existing, the funds can be most speedily and justly distributed through receiver Scofield. Possibly the view I have taken of the case may involve some modifications of the directions for distribution announced by the court, but such modifications would not be of sufficient practical importance to justify discussion, or to furnish ground for dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">For the reasons stated, I concur in the advice given to the Superior Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
