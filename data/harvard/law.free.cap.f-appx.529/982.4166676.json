Hood argues that he should benefit from the reduction in penalties for crack offenses enacted by Amendment 750 and the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-20\">A district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s prison term if the defendant was \u201csentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). But \u201c[w]here a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base-offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B) (providing that a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction is not authorized if the amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guidelines range\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-21\">Amendment 750 lowered the base-offense levels for particular crack cocaine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>quantities under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 750. A career offender\u2019s guidelines range is determined by \u00a7 4B1.1, not \u00a7 2D1.1, so his sentence may not be reduced based on an amendment to the \u00a7 2D1.1. <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327, 1330. Because Hood was a career offender and was sentenced based on the career offender guidelines range found in \u00a7 4B1.1, he is not entitled to a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on Amendment 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">Hood argues that under <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), he is entitled to relief even though his guidelines range was determined by his career offender status. That argument is foreclosed by <em>Lawson, </em>which held that <em>Freeman, </em>a decision that dealt with a defendant who entered into Rule 11 plea agreement, did not overrule <em>Moore </em>and extend \u00a7 3582 relief to defendants sentenced based on the career offender guidelines. <em>Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1320-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-8\">Hood is also not entitled to relief under the FSA because he was sentenced in 2003. The FSA became effective on August 3, 2010. The FSA\u2019s reduced statutory penalties are applicable to those sentenced after the Act took effect, but not to those sentenced beforehand. <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 377 (11th Cir.2012) (\u201cThe Supreme Court in <em>Dorsey [v. United States, </em>567 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012)] carefully confined its application of the FSA to pre-Act offenders who were sentenced after\u201d that date.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
