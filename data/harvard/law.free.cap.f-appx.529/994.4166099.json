After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-19\">In 2011, while he was on federal supervised release, Austin was convicted in Florida state court of burglary and grand theft. A federal district court revoked his supervised release and sentenced him to a term of federal imprisonment consecutive to his state sentence. In 2012, while still serving his state sentence, Austin filed a \u00a7 2241 petition alleging that his federal sentence began when he was temporarily transferred to federal custody for supervised release revocation proceedings and, consequently, he was entitled to credit against his federal sentence for time spent in state custody. The district court found Austin failed to exhaust his administrative remedies and dismissed the petition without prejudice. This is Austin\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-20\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241.\u201d <em>Skinner v. Wiley, </em>355 F.3d 1293, 1294 (11th Cir.2004). Prisoners seeking \u00a7 2241 relief must exhaust their administrative remedies. <em>Id. </em>at 1295. A prisoner may \u201cseek formal review of an issue relating to any aspect of his/her own confinement,\u201d including credit due for time served, under the BOP\u2019s Administrative Remedy Program. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 542.10(a); <em>see also United States v. Lucas, </em>898 F.2d 1554, 1555-56 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-21\">Austin concedes that he did not exhaust his administrative remedies before filing his \u00a7 2241 petition but argues he should be excused from pursuing them. Because he was in state custody and the BOP\u2019s administrative process is unavailable to \u201cinmates confined in ... non-federal facilities,\u201d Aus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>tin did not seek redress through the BOP\u2019s process.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>28 C.F.R. \u00a7 542.10(b). Austin urges that he should be excused from the exhaustion requirement, but we lack authority to excuse him because the requirement is jurisdictional. See <em>Gonzalez v. United States, </em>959 F.2d 211, 212 (11th Cir.1992). The district court therefore correctly dismissed Austin\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">. It appears that Austin is now in federal custody serving his federal sentence. He is therefore now free to seek redress under the BOP's administrative process.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
