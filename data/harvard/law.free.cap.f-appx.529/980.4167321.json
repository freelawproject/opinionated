The district court imposed an upward variance of three months from the applicable guidelines range of 46 to 57 months imprisonment after determining that Griffin had given perjured testimony at his revocation hearing. Griffin contends that his sentence was unreasonable because the district court focused solely on the fact that he had lied under oath and, in so doing, failed to consider any other factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), including the recommended guidelines range and his criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-10\">We review a sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release for reasonableness, applying a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>See United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Silva, </em>443 F.3d 795, 798 (11th Cir.2006). We first look at whether the district court committed any significant procedural error and then at whether the sentence is substantively reasonable under the totality of the circumstances, typically with reference to the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008). The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of showing that it is procedurally or substantively unreasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-12\">When a term of supervised release is revoked under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e), a district court may impose a term of imprisonment after considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, which include the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the applicable guidelines range, and the need to afford adequate deterrence, promote respect for the law, and protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3583(e)(3), 3553(a). However, when revocation and imprisonment are mandatory under \u00a7 3583(g) because a defendant has violated the terms of his supervised release by possessing a controlled substance, \u201cthe statute does not <em>require </em>consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>224 F.3d 1237, 1241 (11th Cir.2000). The only statutorily imposed limitation on mandatory terms of imprisonment under \u00a7 3583(g) is that they not \u201cexceed the maximum term of imprisonment authorized under [\u00a7 35831(e)(3),\u201d which in this case was five years. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-13\">Because Griffin was subject to mandatory revocation of his supervised release under \u00a7 3583(g) for possessing marijuana, a controlled substance, the district court was not required to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in imposing his sentence. <em>See Brown, </em>224 F.3d at 1241. Even so, the district court implicitly considered some of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors when it noted that it had imposed an above-guidelines sentence because Griffin had lied on the stand and continued to flout the law despite his earlier convictions and sentences. The court also did not abuse its discretion in impos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>ing an upward variance of three months because Griffin\u2019s sentence did not exceed the five-year maximum term authorized by statute. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3), (g). And even if Griffin\u2019s sentence were expressly assessed under the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, it is still substantively reasonable given his undisputed act of perjury, his violation of the conditions of his supervised release, and his extensive criminal history, which includes prior convictions for multiple counts of grand theft and burglary, discharging a firearm in public, the sale or possession of cocaine, robbery, battery, and unlawfully possessing a firearm as a convicted felon. Griffin has not shown that his sentence was procedurally or substantively unreasonable under the controlling standards and, thus, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
