The district court properly granted summary judgment on Williams\u2019s race discrimination claim because he failed to show either direct evidence of intentional discrimination or a convincing mosaic of circumstantial evidence that would allow a jury to infer discrimination. The evidence in this case was insufficient to allow a finding that the decision maker was not really independent, but was just a cat\u2019s paw. For background, see <em>Crawford v. Carroll, </em>529 F.3d 961, 979 n. 21 (11th Cir.2008) (history of decision maker acting contrary to subordinate recommendations).</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-10\">On Williams\u2019s retaliation claim, we will assume the district court erred in partially disregarding Williams\u2019s affidavit under the sham affidavit theory.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Even upon consideration of this affidavit, Williams failed to establish a retaliation claim because Cleaver-Brooks provided a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason (acts the employer saw as policy violations) for his termination, which Williams failed to rebut. <em>See Goldsmith v. Bagby Elevator Co., </em>513 F.3d 1261, 1277 (11th Cir.2008) (burden is on plaintiff to show that the employer\u2019s proffered reasons were pretext for prohibited, retaliatory conduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-15\">\u201cAn employer may fire an employee for a good reason, a bad reason, a reason based on erroneous facts, or for no reason at all, as long as its action is not for a discriminatory reason.\u201d <em>Silvera v. Orange Cnty. Sch. Bd., </em>244 F.3d 1253, 1262 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1002-11\"> This Court \"may affirm the district court\u2019s judgment on any ground that appears in the record, whether or not that ground was relied upon or even considered by the [district court].\u201d <em>Thomas v. Cooper Lighting, Inc., </em>506 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir.2007)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
