He argues that: (1) he was entitled to withholding of removal and relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d) based on his well-founded fear of persecution; and (2) he was entitled to release from detention under <em>Zadvydas v. Davis, </em>533 U.S. 678, 121 S.Ct. 2491, 150 L.Ed.2d 653 (2001), because it was unlikely that the government would be able to effect his deportation in the near <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>future. After thorough review, we vacate and remand.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">We review jurisdictional issues <em>de novo. Williams v. Chatman, </em>510 F.3d 1290, 1293 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">When an alien is ordered removed, the Attorney General is required to remove the alien from the United States within 90 days. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(1)(A). The removal period begins on the latest of either: (1) the date the order of removal becomes administratively final; (2) if the removal order is judicially reviewed and a court orders a stay of removal, the date of the court\u2019s final order; or (3) if the alien is detained or confined, the date the alien is released from detention or confinement. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(1)(B). In <em>Zadvydas, </em>the Supreme Court held that six months was a presumptively reasonable period of time to allow the government to remove an alien after the removal period commences. 533 U.S. at 701, 121 S.Ct. 2491. After this time, once an alien shows that \u201cthere is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future,\u201d the government must rebut that showing. <em>Id. </em>If removal is not reasonably foreseeable, the continued detention is unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 699, 121 S.Ct. 2491. The Supreme Court further held \u201cthat \u00a7 2241 habeas corpus proceedings remain available as a forum for statutory and constitutional challenges to post-removal-period detention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 688,121 S.Ct. 2491.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">However, after <em>Zadvydas, </em>Congress passed the Real ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, Div. B, 119 Stat. 231, which limits aliens\u2019 ability to seek relief through \u00a7 2241. In particular, the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) now provides that the filing of a petition for review in the court of appeals, is \u201cthe sole and exclusive means for judicial review of an order of removal\u201d and \u201cfor judicial review of any cause or claim\u201d under CAT. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(5); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(4). Furthermore, the INA provides that no court shall have jurisdiction under \u00a7 2241 to review questions of law or fact \u201carising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from the United States.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(9). In <em>Madu v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>we held that an assertion by a petitioner that he was not subject to a removal order was distinct from a challenge to an order of removal, and therefore, the Real ID Act did not apply, and the district court was not divested of jurisdiction. 470 F.3d 1362, 1363, 1368 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-10\">As for Linares\u2019s claim challenging his order of removal, a petition for review is the sole means for judicial review, and it was proper for the district court to dismiss this claim for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(5); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(4); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(9). However, Linares brought a second, distinct claim, in which he argued that he was entitled to release based on violation of his due process rights by continued detention. Linares\u2019s claim regarding continued detention appears to be independent from his challenge to his removal. Prior to the REAL ID Act, this kind of claim could be brought under \u00a7 2241. <em>Zadvydas, </em>533 U.S. at 688, 121 S.Ct. 2491. Like the petitioner in <em>Madu, </em>whose challenge regarding whether he was subject to an order of removal was deemed distinct from a challenge to his order of removal, Linares\u2019s challenge to his continued detention is similarly distinct from a challenge to his removal order. <em>See </em>470 F.3d at 1363, 1368. Because Linares is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>not challenging his removal order, the Real ID Act would not apply, and his claim can still be brought under \u00a7 2241. <em>See id. </em>Therefore, the district court would have jurisdiction over the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">Accordingly, we vacate and remand for the district court to determine whether Linares is entitled to relief under \u00a7 2241 based on his continued detention. The district court should consider in the first instance when Linares\u2019s removal order became administratively final, how long Li-nares has been detained, and whether his continued detention is unreasonable under <em>Zadvydas.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1006-7\">. Nevertheless, because Rafael Linares did not file his motion for a preliminary injunction first in the district court, the motion for a preliminary injunction he filed in this Court is DENIED without prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
