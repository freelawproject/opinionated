We affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-8\">Stuart\u2019s claims do not fall within the class of suits for which the United States has waived its sovereign immunity under the FTCA. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Kubrick, </em>444 U.S. 111, 117-18, 100 S.Ct. 352, 62 L.Ed.2d 259 (1979) (noting that the FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity must be strictly construed). Section \u00a7 2680(k) of the FTCA provides that the United States has not waived its sovereign immunity with respect to \u201c[a]ny claim arising in a foreign country.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(k). The FTCA does not define \u201cforeign country.\u201d But the Supreme Court has construed that term to mean any foreign \u201cregion or tract of land\u201d \u2014 even one that \u201chas no recognized government.\u201d <em>Smith v. United States, </em>507 U.S. 197, 201, 113 S.Ct. 1178, 122 L.Ed.2d 548 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-12\">Under that controlling definition, Stuart\u2019s claims arose in a foreign country. Stuart alleges immigration officials acted improperly at a preclearance site in the Bahamas, denying him entry to the United States based on purportedly false information. As a matter of law, however, the Bahamanian preclearance site where Stuart\u2019s claims arose is not within the United States. <em>See, e.g., </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1225a. Rather, that site, and others like it, are located within their foreign host country, <em>see id., </em>and preinspection is performed completely \u201cat the port or place in the foreign territory,\u201d <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 235.5(b); <em>see also Bishop v. United States, </em>174 Ct.Cl. 31, 355 F.2d 617, 618 (1966) (describing the history of extraterritorial immigration inspections in the Bahamas and elsewhere).</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-13\">Thus, because Stuart\u2019s claims arose in the Bahamas, and because the Bahamas is a \u201cforeign country\u201d under \u00a7 2680(k) of the FTCA, Stuart\u2019s claims are jurisdictionally barred.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Smith, </em>507 U.S. at 202-03, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>113 S.Ct. 1178; <em>see also United States v. Sherwood, </em>312 U.S. 584, 586, 61 S.Ct. 767, 85 L.Ed. 1058 (1941) (holding that waiver of sovereign immunity is a jurisdictional perquisite, and that such immunity must be waived unequivocally). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order dismissing Stuart\u2019s amended complaint is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1015-9\">. We review the district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of jurisdiction de novo, <em>Carter v. Rodgers, </em>220 F.3d 1249, 1252 n. 3 (11th Cir.2000), and we may affirm on any ground supported by the record, <em>Bircoll v. Miami-Dade Cnty., </em>480 F.3d 1072, 1088 n. 21 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1015-10\">. Stuart's remaining claims were properly dismissed as facially implausible. <em>See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678-79, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). Some of those claims are foreclosed by binding precedent. <em>See, e.g., F.D.I.C. v. Meyer, </em>510 U.S. 471, 486, 114 S.Ct. 996, 127 L.Ed.2d 308 (1994) (limiting <em>Bivens </em>actions to suits against officers in their individual capacities \u2014 -not federal agencies or officers in their official capacity); <em>see also Heckler v. Ringer, </em>466 U.S. 602, 616, 104 S.Ct. 2013, 80 L.Ed.2d 622 (1984) (holding that mandamus is appropriate only when, among other things, the defendant owes the plaintiff a clear, nondiscretionary duty); <em>United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, </em>428 U.S. 543, 551, 96 S.Ct. 3074, 49 L.Ed.2d 1116 (1976) (upholding the constitutionality of fixed immigration checkpoints). Others require dismissal because they are either (1) barred under the doctrine of consular nonreviewability, <em>see Saavedra Bruno v. Albright, </em>197 F.3d 1153, 1159 (D.C.Cir.1999); (2) based on federal criminal statutes or immigration regulations that do not provide private causes of action, <em>see Central Bank of Denver v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, </em>511 U.S. 164, 190, 114 S.Ct. 1439, 128 L.Ed.2d 119 (1994); or (3) not actionable under the FTCA, <em>see Ochran v. United States, </em>273 F.3d 1315, 1317 (11th Cir.2001) (stressing the FTCA \"was designed to provide redress for ordinary torts recognized by state law\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
