Holding Graham responsible for 17.43 grams of cocaine base, the district court initially calculated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>an adjusted offense level of 26 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. Graham, however, was a career offender who was subject to a maximum term of 40 years\u2019 imprisonment under \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(iii). Accordingly, he was subject to an offense level of 84 and a total offense level of 31 after the application of a three-offense-level reduction for accepting responsibility. When combined with a criminal history category of VI, this produced a Sentencing Guidelines range of 188 to 285 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">Graham now argues that he is eligible for a sentence reduction in light of <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), notwithstanding his status as a career offender, because his sentence was \u201cbased upon\u201d \u00a7 2D1.1, which was modified by Amendment 750 to the Guidelines. He further argues that the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (FSA), Pub. L. No. 111-220,124 Stat. 2372, retroactively applies to him and that by reducing his statutory-maximum penalty to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment, the FSA reduces his Guidelines range to 151 to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-6\">We review de novo the scope of the district court\u2019s authority under the Guidelines. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may not reduce a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment that has been imposed unless: (1) the sentence was based upon a sentencing range that the Sentencing Commission subsequently lowered; (2) the district court considers the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors; and (3) the \u201creduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-7\">When determining whether a reduction is warranted, a court should first determine the Guidelines range that would have applied had the relevant amendment been in effect at the time of the defendant\u2019s sentencing. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1); <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 759-60 (11th Cir.1998). If the relevant amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable Guidelines range, a sentence reduction is inconsistent with the Guidelines policy statement, and is therefore not authorized by \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). Section 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a sentence reduction where a relevant Guidelines amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but, through the operation of another guideline, does not alter the sentencing range upon which his sentence was based. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. 1 (A)(ii); <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330. Thus, defendants who are sentenced as career offenders are ineligible for sentence reductions under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327. <em>Moore </em>remains binding law despite <em>Freeman, </em>regardless of whether Freeman\u2019s plurality or concurring opinion contained the holding. <em>See United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir.) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 568, 184 L.Ed.2d 371 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-12\">We addressed the FSA\u2019s applicability in the context of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings in <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374 (11th Cir.2012) (per curiam). There, we rejected Berry\u2019s argument that he was eligible for a sentence reduction under the FSA because the FSA was not a Guidelines amendment promulgated by the Sentencing Commission, but a statutory amendment by Congress. <em>See id. </em>at 377. Moreover, even assuming that an FSA claim is properly raised in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, we concluded that Berry\u2019s claim failed because the FSA did not retroactively apply to defendants who, like Berry, were sentenced prior to its enactment. <em>See id. </em>at 377-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>The district court was not authorized to reduce Graham\u2019s sentence because he was sentenced as a career offender. Likewise, the FSA does not authorize a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and, in any case, it does not retroactively apply to defendants who, like Graham, were sentenced prior to its enactment. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
