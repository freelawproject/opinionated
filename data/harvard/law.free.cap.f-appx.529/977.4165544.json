Johnson\u2019s sentence was the mandatory minimum under \u00a7 924(e)(1), which states that a person who violates \u00a7 922(g) and has three previous convictions for a violent felony or serious drug offense, shall be imprisoned for not less than fifteen years. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-9\">Johnson\u2019s only argument on appeal is that his sentence \u201cruns afoul of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments],\u201d because the indictment did not identify the three prior convictions that supported the application of \u00a7 924(e)(l)\u2019s mandatory minimum. However, as Johnson acknowledges, his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). In that case, the Supreme Court held that prior convictions \u201crelevant only to the sentencing of an offender found guilty of the charged crime\u201d do not need to be charged in an indictment or proven beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury. <em>Id. </em>at 228^47,118 S.Ct. at 1223-33. <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cremains good law.\u201d <em>United States v. Weeks, </em>711 F.3d 1255, 1259 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-11\">For these reasons, Johnson\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
