J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZQ\">This appeal is from a judgment of the Municipal Court for the Eureka Judicial District (hereinafter municipal court). The appeal was initially taken to the Appellate Department of the Humboldt County Superior Court (superior court). The sole question presented to the superior court was whether appellant Terry Malloy had made a timely request for findings in the municipal court action. The superior court held that the request had not been timely, and affirmed the judgment, but certified to this court that transfer here was \u201cnecessary to secure uniformity of.decision\u201d on the issue. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 911; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 61 et seq.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This court ordered the transfer pursuant to Rule 62. We consequently reexamine the question of timeliness.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">\n<em>Procedural Sequence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">The municipal court judgment emerged from a complicated factual and procedural background which involved three actions brought in that court. One of them may be disregarded because it is not directly pertinent to the appeal. The other two may be summarized as a single \u201caction\u201d because they were consolidated in the municipal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">The action was tried by the municipal court in two separate phases conducted on April 23 and June 26, 1979.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Written findings of fact and conclusions of law were not requested before or during either phase. Pursuant to an order made at the conclusion of the second phase, the action was submitted on June 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>On July 26, the court filed a memorandum decision (\u201cNotice of Intended Decision .. . \u201d) in which it reviewed the complicated evidence and the procedural history of the action; set out some equally complicated arithmetical calculations; and ordered in effect that respondent Zenker-Felt Imports was entitled to recover a money judgment against appellant in the amount of $3,545.54. Written findings of fact and conclusions of law were not mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">On August 2, appellant served and filed a formal request that written \u201cfindings of fact and conclusions of law be made in this action.\u201d On August 22, the court filed a \u201cRuling ...\u201d in which the request was effectively denied as \u201cuntimely.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court thereupon made no findings, but entered a judgment in respondent\u2019s favor pursuant to the memorandum decision filed on July 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal to the superior court. He contended on the ensuing appeal that his request for findings had been timely; that he was accordingly entitled to findings; and that the municipal court had committed reversible error in denying the request and entering the judgment without them. In a detailed opinion filed on June 24, 1980, the superior court held that the request had not been timely; affirmed the judgment; and certified the cause to this court as described above.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">\n<em>Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Whether written findings of fact and conclusions of law are required in a superior or municipal court, and the timeliness of a request for them in either court, are controlled by section 632 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The statute provides in its third paragraph that findings are \u201cdeemed waived\u201d (i.e., that they are not required) in a municipal court action \u201cunless expressly requested by one or more of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>the parties at the time of the trial . . ..\u201d (See fn. 4, <em>ante.) </em>Appellant having \u201cexpressly requested\u201d findings five weeks after the conclusion of the \u201ctrial\u201d as such, and several days after the municipal court had announced its intended decision, the question is whether his request was made \u201cat the time of the trial\u201d within the meaning of the language just quoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">Commencing with <em>Engleman </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1954) 125 Cal.App.2d Supp. 882 [270 P.2d 127], the appellate departments of other superior courts have interpreted the language to mean that findings are required in a municipal court action if they are requested at any time before judgment is entered: i.e., that a request for them is timely if it is made before judgment. <em>(Engleman </em>v. <em>Green, supra, </em>at pp. 884-886; <em>Haupt </em>v. <em>La Brea Heating etc. Co. </em>(1954) 125 Cal.App.2d Supp. 888, 889 [270 P.2d 125]; <em>Hardy </em>v. <em>Foster </em>(1954) 125 Cal.App.2d Supp. 890, 891 [270 P.2d 130]; <em>Cannon </em>v. <em>Goble </em>(1954) 127 Cal.App.2d Supp. 833 [273 P.2d 44]; see <em>Diesel Constr. Equip. Co. </em>v. <em>Neveils </em>(1963) 214 Cal. App.2d Supp. 877, 879-880 [30 Cal.Rptr. 163].) These courts have followed the reasoning, first expressed in <em>Engleman, </em>that a request made before judgment is made \u201cat the time of the trial\u201d because \u201cuntil the judgment is entered the trial is not over.\u201d <em>(Engleman </em>v. <em>Green, supra, </em>at pp. 884-885.)</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Appellant cited some of these decisions on his appeal to the superior court. The court acknowledged them in its opinion (citing <em>Engleman, Haupt, </em>and <em>Hardy), </em>but expressly declined to follow them; cited and discussed section 632 and the pertinent Rules; held that appellant\u2019s request for findings was not timely according to \u201cour interpretation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>applicable law\u201d; and affirmed the judgment on that ground. The superior court\u2019s departure from the <em>Engleman </em>line of decisions prompted its certification that transfer was \u201cnecessary to secure uniformity of decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">We agree with the superior court. We therefore hold that a request for findings in a municipal court action is untimely and ineffective unless it is made \u201cat the time of the trial\u201d in the literal and conventional sense of that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">This result is based on our interpretation of section 632 itself. It provides in its first paragraph that findings are not \u201crequired\u201d in any trial court \u201cexcept as . .. provided\u201d in the statute. (See fn. 4, <em>ante.) </em>The second paragraph provides in effect that findings are required in a <em>superior </em>court action only if a party requests them when the court has announced its intended decision and \u201c[w]ithin the time after such announcement permitted by rules of the Judicial Council.\u201d (See <em>ibid.) </em>The Legislature has thus prescribed in the second paragraph that whether findings are \u201crequired\u201d in a superior court action may not be determined until <em>after </em>the court\u2019s announcement of its intended decision, and that they may neither be requested nor waived <em>before </em>that.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">The third paragraph of the statute commands precisely the opposite interpretation as to an action in a municipal court. It provides in effect that findings are required in that court <em>only if </em>they have been \u201cexpressly requested by one or more of the parties at the time of the trial.\u201d The paragraph does not refer to the municipal court\u2019s announcement of its intended decision. Read in contrast to the second paragraph of the statute addressed to superior courts, the third paragraph unmistakably imports that findings are required in a municipal court only if they are \u201cexpressly requested\u201d <em>before </em>its announcement of intended decision. Because the words \u201cat the time of the trial\u201d necessarily refer to a \u201ctime\u201d before the announcement, we perceive that the Legislature intended them to mean the \u201ctrial\u201d in the literal sense of that term: i.e., the proceeding at which evidence is received and the action is submitted for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">The pertinent distinction between the second and third.paragraphs of section 632 has been recognized by the Judicial Council in the rules it has adopted for the respective trial courts pursuant to the seventh paragraph of the statute. (See fn. 4, <em>ante.) </em>Rule 232, which applies in superior courts only, provides in effect that findings may not be request<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>ed or waived until <em>after </em>the court has announced its intended decision as required by the second paragraph of section 632.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Rule 520, which applies only in the municipal courts, effectively provides the converse: i.e., that findings must be requested <em>before </em>the announcement and may not be requested afterward.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Rule 520 thus demonstrates that the Judicial Council has similarly interpreted the third paragraph of section 632 as providing that findings in a municipal court action must be requested at the \u201ctrial\u201d in the literal sense of that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">The Judicial Council is established by a section of the Constitution which further provides that \u201c[t]o improve the administration of justice the council shall ... adopt rules for court administration, practice and procedure, not inconsistent with statute, and perform other functions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>prescribed by statute.\u201d (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 6.) The council has adopted Rule 520 in the performance of a \u201cfunction\u201d prescribed by section 632, which it is obligated to effectuate and enforce in the \u201cadministration of justice.\u201d The council\u2019s interpretation of the statutory term \u201cthe time of the trial\u201d is consequently to be accorded the benefit of the familiar rule that the contemporaneous construction of a statute by an administrative agency charged with its enforcement is entitled to \u201cgreat weight\u201d unless it is \u201cclearly erroneous or unauthorized.\u201d <em>(Rivera </em>v. <em>City of Fresno </em>(1971) 6 Cal.3d 132, 140 [98 Cal.Rptr. 281, 490 P.2d 793]; <em>Judson Steel Corp. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 658, 668-669 [150 Cal.Rptr 250, 586 P.2d 564]; <em>State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1979) 88 Cal.App.3d 43, 53 [152 Cal.Rptr. 153].)</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">The last-quoted qualification invokes the opposing rules that administrative construction of a statute is not conclusive, and that the final responsibility for its interpretation rests with the courts alone. <em>(Mooney </em>v. <em>Pickett </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 669, 681 [94 Cal.Rptr. 279, 483 P.2d 1231]; <em>State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>88 Cal.App.3d 43 at p. 54.) As we have seen, however, the Judicial Council\u2019s interpretation of the critical statutory term (\u201cthe time of the trial\u201d) is wholly consistent with the language of the statute itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The superior court reached this interpretation of the statutory term in the present case, relying in part on the contrasting provisions of Rules 520 and 232. The court also reasoned that the term (\u201cthe time of the trial\u201d) was to be construed according to its \u201ccustomary meaning,\u201d which is \u201cthat it refers to the period of time, in the courtroom, during which the trial itself is taking place\u201d (citing <em>Halligan </em>v. <em>Glazebrook </em>(1969) 59 Misc.2d 712 [299 N.Y.S.2d 951]). We agree with this analysis and adopt it.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">This result is obviously contrary to the rule formulated by the appellate department of the superior court in <em>Engleman </em>v. <em>Green, supra, </em>125 Cal.App.2d Supp. 882, and followed by other courts at that level. (See <em>id., </em>at pp. 884-886; <em>Haupt </em>v. <em>La Brea Heating etc. Co., supra, </em>125 Cal. App.2d Supp. 888 at p. 889; <em>Hardy </em>v. <em>Foster, supra, </em>125 Cal.App.2d Supp. 890 at p. 891; <em>Cannon </em>v. <em>Goble, supra, </em>127 Cal.App.2d Supp. 833.) The <em>Engleman </em>rule has been criticized on the plausible ground that it is inconsistent with the realities of municipal court practice. (See Cal. Civil Procedure During Trial (Cont.Ed.Bar 1960) \u00a7\u00a7 21.30-21.31, pp. 544-545.)</p>\n<p id=\"b577-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>The rule also reflects the <em>Engleman </em>court\u2019s simplistic reasoning that \u201cat the time of the trial\u201d means \u201cany time before judgment\u201d because \u201cuntil the judgment is entered the trial is not over.\u201d <em>(Engleman </em>v. <em>Green, supra, </em>125 Cal.App.2d Supp. 882 at pp. 884-885.) That reasoning was applied without analysis of section 632 as it read when <em>Engleman </em>was decided in 1954 (see <em>id., </em>at p. 882; see also fn. <em>4, ante), </em>or of its interpretation by the Judicial Council in the rules then in effect. (See fns. 5 and 6.) Examined in light of those controlling sources, the <em>Engleman </em>rule is clearly wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">It has stood without challenge for many years, a fact which necessarily evokes the variant of stare decisis which may be termed the \u201crule of long acceptance.\u201d (See 6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971), <em>op. cit. supra, </em>Appeal, \u00a7 682, pp. 4597-4598, and cases there cited.) An appellate court questioning the validity of precedent established by its peer courts will commonly defer to this rule in order to avoid creating a conflict in the law where none exists. (See, e.g., <em>Injectronics, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commodore Business Machines, Inc. </em>(1979) 100 Cal.App.3d .185, 188 [160 Cal.Rptr. 667].) Our responsibility in the present case is to resolve a conflict which has now been created among other appellate courts whose decisions do not bind us. (Cf. <em>Auto Equity Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 450, 455-456 [20 Cal.Rptr. 321, 369 P.2d 937].) Given the choice clearly commanded of us by section 632, we decline to sustain the <em>Engleman </em>rule on the basis of its long acceptance. <em>Engleman </em>v. <em>Green, supra, </em>125 Cal.App.2d Supp. 882, and its progeny, are accordingly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">In the present case, however, the municipal court\u2019s memorandum decision expressed its determination of complicated factual and arithmetical issues. Section 632 reaches them in terms of the monetary values involved, which exceed $1,000. (See \u00a7 632, third par., quoted in fn. 4, <em>ante.) </em>Their resolution by written findings of fact and conclusions of law would comport with the interests of justice. Appellant Malloy requested findings after the memorandum decision was filed, but he thereby invoked the <em>Engleman </em>rule at a time when it had not been challenged or questioned. In fairness to him, and to other litigants who may be similarly situated in municipal court actions throughout the state, we further hold that this decision shall operate with prospective effect only. (Cf. <em>Aced </em>v. <em>Hobbs-Sesack Plumbing Co. </em>(1961) 55 Cal.2d 573, 580 [12 Cal.Rptr. 257, 360 P.2d 897]; <em>County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Faus </em>(1957) 48 Cal.2d 672, 680-681 [312 P.2d 680]; see <em>Mau </em>v. <em>Superior </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number><em>Court </em>(1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 875, 878-881 [161 Cal.Rptr. 895]; 6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d. ed. 1971), <em>op. cit. supra, </em>Appeal, \u00a7\u00a7 704-705, pp. 4620-4622.) Reversal is accordingly required in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">The judgment of the municipal court is reversed. The cause is remanded to that court with directions to make written findings of fact and conclusions of law and to render a new judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Christian, J., and Anderson, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b571-11\">The terms Rule and Rules refer to the California Rules of Court throughout this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b571-12\">Dates mentioned after this point refer to the calendar year 1979 except where indicated otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b572-8\">This document read as follows: \u201cRULING ON REQUEST FOR FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW [.] [\u00b6] The trial in this matter was heard on April 23...
