J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5k\">Plaintiffs Robert Pringle, operator of the Covina Cinema (hereafter Cinema), and Darlene Pritchard, a patron of the Cinema, appeal from the denial of a preliminary injunction enjoining defendant City of Covina from \u201carresting or prosecuting or instituting civil actions\u201d against the Cinema under its adult entertainment zoning ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">The Cinema is a motion picture theatre in Covina. In 1977, the Cinema offered a repertory theatre program consisting of a variety of films, including an occasional showing of films containing sexually explicit matter which consequently were rated \u201cX\u201d by the Motion Picture Association of America.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>On July 14, 1977, the city manager wrote a letter to the Cinema expressing the community\u2019s concern regarding the exhibition of \u201cX-Rated\u201d films. Then, on July 18, 1977, the city council instructed the city attorney to prepare an interim emergency ordinance prohibiting \u201cadult\u201d films in the city while zoning regulation of various \u201cadult\u201d land uses could be studied. On July 25, the interim ordinance was unanimously adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">The Covina Cinema continued, after the adoption of the interim ordinance, to show the films already on its calendar, including on July 26, 1977, the \u201cX-Rated\u201d films \u201cEmanuelle\u201d and \u201cThe Joys of a Woman.\u201d Members of the Covina Police Department viewed the films and prepared misdemeanor charges against the theatre management which were forwarded to the Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s office; but no legal proceedings were ever initiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">In August 1977, the Cinema manager announced that no more \u201cX-Rated\u201d films would be shown after the expiration of the existing calendar on September 6. Unfavorable publicity, generated by the actions of city officials, had discouraged patrons from attending the Cinema and made the repertory film policy economically unrewarding.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">In September 1977, Pringle became the lessee and operator of the Cinema.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">In June 1978, defendant enacted a comprehensive zoning ordinance<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> prohibiting the location of \u201cadult entertainment businesses\u201d within 500 feet of a residential area and other specified uses. The Cinema is located within that distance of such uses. The ordinance declares that its purpose is \u201cto insure that [the] adverse effects [arising from their \u2018serious objectionable operational characteristics\u2019] will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the surrounding neighborhood and will not unreasonably interfere with or injure nearby properties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>An adult motion picture theatre is defined as \u201can enclosed building with a capacity of fifty or more persons <em>used </em>for presenting material <em>distinguished or characterized </em>by an <em>emphasis </em>on depicting or describing \u2018Specified Sexual Activities\u2019 or \u2018Specified Anatomical Areas\u2019.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Covina Mun. Code, \u00a7 17.04.026.2.) (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">Plaintiffs instituted this action (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983) for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that the ordinance violated federal and state guarantees of freedom of speech, due process and equal protection. They claimed that the ordinance was unconstitutional on its face and, as construed to apply \u201cto the operation of a neighborhood theatre which shows a variety of films including a few films which, although not obscene, explicitly depict sexual activity arguably within the scope of the ordinance.\u201d They further argued that the terms \u201cdistinguished or characterized by an emphasis\u201d and \u201cused\u201d were too vague and chilled freedom of expression.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">In their verified complaint, plaintiffs sought \u201ctemporary injunctive relief in order [to] exhibit and view constitutionally protected films according to their own taste and judgment.\u201d They alleged that \u201c[i]f not restricted by the. . .Ordinance, [Pringle] would occasionally exhibit films which, although not obscene, explicitly depict sexual activity\u201d and Pritchard \u201cwould again view on a selective basis films at the Covina Cinema which explicitly depict sexual activity. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">In his declaration, Pringle stated that the \u201cOrdinance prevents [him] from selecting for exhibition films which [he] would otherwise choose, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>because [he] cannot know what films will bring the... Cinema within the definition of an Adult Motion Picture Theater... and consequently subject [him] to civil and criminal sanctions for ... violation of the Ordinance\u201d; the Covina police have threatened to arrest him for violating the ordinance if an \u201cX-Rated\u201d film were shown; and he desires to select for exhibition at the Cinema a variety of films, including some which are rated \u201cX\u201d but would not generally be considered \u201chard-core\u201d pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">In support of their motion for a preliminary injunction, plaintiffs pointed out that the relief they sought Was limited. It \u201cwould apply only to the Covina Cinema [so that] the zoning scheme of the city would otherwise remain intact,\u201d and \u201cwould simply restore the status quo which existed prior to the adoption of the ordinance when the Covina Cinema did exhibit on an occasional basis films such as \u2018Last Tango in Paris.\u2019\u201d The only \u201c\u2018X-Rated\u2019 films that would be presented would be serious, artistic \u2018X-Rated\u2019 films of the variety previously exhibited by the Covina Cinema\u201d and these \u201cwould constitute only a small portion of the total program of the theater.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">In its opposition papers, defendant city contended that the ordinance was a valid zoning regulation under <em>Young </em>v. <em>American Mini Theatres </em>(1976) 427 U.S. 50 [49 L.Ed.2d 310, 96 S.Ct. 2440]. Defendant claimed that <em>Young </em>had addressed all plaintiffs\u2019 vagueness objections except the meaning of the word \u201cused\u201d in the adult theatre definition. Defendant construed \u201cuse\u201d as any \u201c[o]ne showing of a film described in the ordinance.\u201d Defendant also argued that any uncertainty in the ordinance was readily subject to severance or a narrowing construction by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">The superior court denied plaintiffs\u2019 request for a preliminary injunction. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">\n<em>Contention</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">Plaintiffs contend that the preliminary injunction should have been granted because the ordinance contains impermissibly vague terms which chill freedom of expression by deterring the exhibition of films that may or may not be within its ambit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">\n<em>Summary</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">The superior court improperly denied a preliminary injunction. The definition of an adult movie theatre contains vague statutory language. To preserve the ordinance\u2019s validity, it must be narrowly construed to apply only to theatres in which the preponderant programming consists of films in which the dominant theme is the depiction or description of the ordinance\u2019s enumerated sexually explicit activities. However, since our opinion placing such a narrow construction upon the ordinance will adequately protect plaintiffs\u2019 pending trial, we need not reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">\n<em>The Ordinance Must Be Narrowly Construed</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">It is a basic principle of due process that an ordinance is unconstitutionally vague if its prohibitions are not clearly defined. (See <em>Grayned </em>v. <em>City of Rockford </em>(1972) 408 U.S. 104, 108 [33 L.Ed.2d 222, 227, 92 S.Ct. 2294].) There must be ascertainable standards. \u201cMen of common intelligence cannot be required to guess at the meaning of the enactment. [Fn. omitted.]\u201d <em>(Winters </em>v. <em>New York </em>(1948) 333 U.S. 507, 515 [92 L.Ed. 840, 849-850, 68 S.Ct. 665].)</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">Moreover: \u201cThe general test of vagueness applies with particular force in review of laws dealing with speech. \u2018[Stricter standards of permissible statutory vagueness may be applied to a statute having a potentially inhibiting effect on speech; a man may the less be required to act at his peril here, because the free dissemination of ideas may be the loser.\u2019\u201d <em>(Hynes </em>v. <em>Mayor of Oradell </em>(1976) 425 U.S. 610, 620 [48 L.Ed.2d 243, 253, 96 S.Ct. 1755].)</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">As the United States Supreme Court has pointed out: \u201c[W]here a vague statute \u2018abut[s] upon sensitive areas of basic First Amendment freedoms,\u2019 it \u2018operates to inhibit the exercise of [those] freedoms.\u2019 Uncertain meanings inevitably lead citizens to \u2018\u201csteer far wider of the unlawful zone\u201d .. .than if the boundaries of the forbidden areas were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>clearly marked.\u2019 [Fns. omitted.]\u201d <em>(Grayned </em>v. <em>City of Rockford, supra, </em>408 U.S. at p. 109 [33 L.Ed.2d at p. 228].)</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Similarly, our California Supreme Court has observed: \u201c[V]ague statutory language, resulting in inadequate notice of the reach and limits of the statutory proscription, poses a specially serious problem when the statute concerns speech, for uncertainty concerning its scope may then chill the exercise of protected First Amendment rights. (See <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>City of New Orleans </em>(1974) 415 U.S. 130, 133-134 [39 L.Ed.2d 214, 219-220, 94 S.Ct. 970]; <em>Gooding </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(1972) 405 U.S. 518, 521 [31 L.Ed.2d 408, 413, 92 S.Ct. 1103].)\u201d (Pryor v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 238, 251 [158 Cal.Rptr. 330, 599 P.2d 636].)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">A conclusion, however, that the language of the ordinance does not meet constitutional standards of specificity is not necessarily dis-positive of the case. <em>(Pryor </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>25 Cal. 3d at p. 253.) In <em>Young </em>v. <em>American Mini Theatres, supra, </em>427 U.S. 50, 61 [49 L.Ed.2d 310, 320, 96 S.Ct. 2440], in discussing a vagueness attack on the Detroit ordinance which contained an identical definition of an adult theatre, the court said that it saw \u201cno reason why the ordinances were not \u2018readily subject to a narrowing construction by the state courts.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">We must construe this legislation, if reasonably possible to preserve its constitutionality. <em>(Kash Enterprises Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d 294, 305.) As our Supreme Court explained in <em>Pryor, supra, 25 </em>Cal. 3d at page 253: \u201cThe judiciary bears an obligation to \u2018construe enactments to give specific content to terms that might otherwise be unconstitutionally vague.\u2019 <em>(Associated Home Builders etc., Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Livermore </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 582, 598 [135 Cal.Rptr. 41, 557 P.2d 473, 92 A.L.R.3d 1038].) Thus we have declared that \u2018A statute will not be held void for uncertainty if any reasonable and practical construction can be given its language.\u2019 <em>(American Civil Liberties Union </em>v. <em>Board of Education </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 203, 218 [28 Cal.Rptr. 700, 379 P.2d 4].) If by fair and reasonable interpretation we can construe [this ordinance] to sustain its validity, we must adopt such interpretation ...</p>\n<p id=\"b143-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>With these principles in mind, we now consider plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the Covina ordinance contains impermissibly vague terms and therefore \u201cchills freedom of expression by deterring the exhibition of films that may or may not be within its ambit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">We first turn to plaintiffs\u2019 argument that they cannot determine by any objective standard when a film is \u201cdistinguished or characterized by\u201d an \u201cemphasis\u201d on the enumerated sexual activities. In the absence of a limiting interpretation, there is merit to plaintiffs\u2019 claim, especially in view of the history of this ordinance. Pringle declared that he had been warned by Covina police that any \u201cX-Rated\u201d film would violate the ordinance. Defendant in its answer denied that it construed the ordinance to prohibit the showing of all \u201cX-Rated\u201d films. Yet defendant has not offered any alternative construction which could give further guidance to the Cinema and eliminate uncertainty as to what type of films can be shown without risking a misdemeanor prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Instead, defendant claims that plaintiffs\u2019 vagueness arguments were answered in <em>Young </em>v. <em>American Mini Theatres, supra, </em>427 U.S. 50, and <em>Walnut Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>City Council </em>(1980) 100 Cal.App.3d 1018 [161 Cal.Rptr. 411]. We disagree. The majority in <em>Young </em>held that the Detroit theatres which \u201cpropose[d] to offer adult fare on a regular basis\u201d (427 U.S. at p. 59 [49 L.Ed.2d at p. 319]) and had not \u201cindicated any plan to exhibit pictures even arguably outside the coverage of the ordinances\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 59, fn. 16 [49 L.Ed.2d at p. 319]) lacked standing to raise the vagueness issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">The court in <em>Young </em>said: \u201cWe find it unnecessary to consider the validity of [the vagueness] arguments in the abstract. For even if there may be some uncertainty about the effect of the ordinances on other litigants, they are unquestionably applicable to these [litigants].\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 58-59 [49 L.Ed.2d at p. 319].) And \u201csince the limited amount of uncertainty in the ordinances is easily susceptible of a narrowing construction, we think this is an inappropriate case in which to adjudicate the hypothetical claims of persons not before the Court.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 61 [49 L.Ed.2d at p. 320]).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\"><em>Walnut </em>simply followed <em>Young </em>in finding that a theatre which conceded that \u201cit did show and plans to continue showing movies which fall within the ambit of the ordinance\u201d \u201clack[ed] the requisite standing to challenge the ordinance for vagueness or overbreadth.\u201d (100 Cal.App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>3d at p. 1021; see also <em>Northend Cinema, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Seattle </em>(1978) 90 Wn.2d 709 [585 P.2d 1153, 1157]; <em>Airport Book Store, Inc. </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1978) 242 Ga. 214 [248 S.E.2d 623, 628].)</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">Here, however, we clearly are presented with an actual, not hypothetical, claim of uncertainty deterring the exercise of protected speech. The litigants herein are a neighborhood theatre operator and patron who wish occasionally to exhibit and view artistic serious films which have been rated \u201cX\u201d by the Motion Picture Association of America. However, rather than risk prosecution, the Cinema is deterred from showing any \u201cX-Rated\u201d film, no matter how nationally recognized, as part of a repertory program.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">We must, therefore, attempt to eliminate the uncertainty by narrowly construing the language \u201cdistinguished or characterized by an emphasis\u201d in order to sustain the statute\u2019s validity. Dictionary definitions can be helpful. A common meaning of the word \u201cdistinguished\u201d is \u201cconspicuous; marked.\u201d (Random House Dict. (1966) p. 417.) The word \u201ccharacterize\u201d has been defined as \u201cto describe the <em>essential </em>character or quality of\u201d (Webster\u2019s New Internat. Dict. (3d ed. 1967) p. 376; italics added); and \u201ccharacter\u201d has been described as \u201c[t]he <em>dominant </em>quality\u201d (Webster\u2019s New World Thesaurus (paperback ed., 1974) p. 61; italics added). Moreover, \u201cemphasis\u201d has been defined as \u201cstress or relative importance given to a certain part or feature of a literary work (as by its <em>prominent position in the whole </em>or its fullness of presentation).\u201d (Webster\u2019s New Internat. Dict., <em>supra, </em>pp. 742-743; italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">By combining these definitions, we construe the phrase \u201cdistinguished or characterized by an emphasis\u201d to refer to the dominant or essential theme. Accordingly, adult films under the ordinance include only films whose dominant or predominant character and theme is the depiction of the enumerated sexual activities or anatomical areas.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\"><em>Hart Book Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Edmisten </em>(4th Cir. 1979) 612 F.2d 821, 834, pointed out that such language would withstand a vagueness challenge, stating: \u201cThe reference to the \u2018predominant\u2019 character of publications or films has been sustained in <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>431 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>767, 770-73, 97 S.Ct. 2085, 52 L.Ed.2d 738 (1977) [and] is like the \u2018dominant theme\u2019 test in <em>Roth </em>v. <em>United States, </em>354 U.S. 476, 489, 77 S.Ct. 1304, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498 (1957)</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">We next consider the meaning of the word \u201cused\u201d in the Covina ordinance\u2019s definition of an adult theatre as a building \u201cused for presenting\u201d sexually explicit material. The ambiguity lies in the ordinance\u2019s failure to indicate what proportion of a theatre\u2019s programming would constitute \u201cuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">As was noted by the Supreme Courts of Colorado and Maine: \u201c\u2018The verb \u201cuse\u201d or \u201cused\u201d has two meanings recognized by all lexicographers and unconsciously differentiated in common speech: (1) To employ or be employed or occupied. In this sense the word would include a single isolated instance of use. (2) To practice customarily or (in the case of a place or thing) to be the subject of customary practice, employment or occupation.\u2019\u201d <em>(Murphy </em>v. <em>Traynor </em>(1943) 110 Colo. 466 [135 P.2d 230, 232]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Gastonguay </em>(1919) 118 Me. 31 [105 A. 402, 403].)</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">In the trial court, defendant responded to plaintiffs\u2019 vagueness attack by claiming that a single exhibition of any one adult film constituted a \u201cuse\u201d in violation of the ordinance. But, such an interpretation would necessarily render this ordinance constitutionally invalid. \u201cMotion pictures, the medium of expression involved here, are fully within the protection of the First Amendment.\u201d <em>(Young </em>v. <em>American Mini Theatres, supra, </em>427 U.S. at pp. 76-77 [49 L.Ed.2d at p. 330] (conc. opn. of Powell, J.).) Reasonable regulations of the time, place and manner of protected speech are permitted by the First Amendment where those regulations are necessary to further significant governmental interests. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 63, fn. 18 [49 L.Ed.2d at p. 322].) Thus, this regulation can only be justified \u201cif it is within the constitutional power of the Government; if it furthers an important or substantial governmental interest; if the governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression; and if the incidental restriction on alleged First Amendment freedoms is no greater than is essential to the furtherance of that interest.\u201d (U<em>nited States </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien </em>(1968) 391 U.S. 367, 377 [20 L.Ed.2d 672, 680, 88 S.Ct. 1673]; see also <em>Young, supra, 427 </em>U.S. at pp. 79-80 [49 L.Ed.2d at pp. 331-332] (conc. opn. of Powell, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">A zoning regulation based on a \u201csingle isolated instance of use\u201d would fail this test. It could not be \u201cjustified by the city\u2019s interest in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>preserving the character of its neighborhoods.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 71 [49 L.Ed.2d at p. 326].) While defendant certainly has an important and substantial interest in maintaining the stability of its neighborhoods, we cannot conclude that defendant could reasonably have determined that a single showing of a sexually explicit film produces adverse \u201csecondary effect[s]\u201d destructive of the general quality of life in the neighborhood. (See <em>Young, supra, 427 </em>U.S. at pp. 71, fn. 34, 80 [49 L.Ed.2d at pp. 326, 331-332] (conc. opn. of Powell, J.).) Indeed, we would have to conclude that \u201cthe ordinance was not rationally tailored to support its asserted purpose\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 83 [49 L.Ed.2d at p. 334]) as a necessary zoning regulation to prevent neighborhood blight but was instead a \u201cmisconceived attempt directly to regulate content of expression\u201d by \u201cusing the power to zone as a pretext for suppressing expression\u201d (id., at p. 84 [49 L.Ed.2d at p. 334]).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">To preserve the ordinance\u2019s validity, the term \u201cused\u201d must, therefore, be construed to mean \u201c[t]o practice customarily.\u201d  \u201cCustomarily\u201d means <em>\u201cusually, </em>habitually, according to the customs, general practice or usual order of things, regularly.\u201d (Black\u2019s Law Dict. (4th ed. 1951) p. 462; italics added.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Moreover, \u201cusually\u201d is commonly defined as \u201cmore often than not; most often: as a rule: Ordinarily.\u201d (Webster\u2019s New Internat. Dict., <em>supra, </em>p. 2524.) Accordingly, a <em>preponderance </em>of the films shown must have as their dominant theme the depiction of the ordinance\u2019s enumerated sexual activities in order for a theatre to be deemed an \u201cadult motion picture theatre\u201d within the ambit of the zoning ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">\n<em>A Preliminary Injunction Should Have Been Granted</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">Plaintiffs alleged that the Cinema would only present serious, or artistic \u201cX\u201d rated films of the variety it previously exhibited and these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>films would only constitute a small portion of its program. As we have construed this ordinance, it does not apply to the Cinema\u2019s proposed programming. Lacking such an authoritative restrictive interpretation, plaintiffs suffered irreparable injury pending trial since the ordinance deterred the exhibition of these films. The superior court, therefore, should have narrowly construed the ordinance and granted the limited preliminary injunction plaintiffs sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">In view of our construction of the statute, however, a preliminary injunction pending trial is no longer necessary. As a result of this opinion, the ordinance cannot be enforced against the Cinema unless, contrary to its representations and previous policy, the Cinema presents a preponderance of films in which the dominant theme is the depiction of the ordinance\u2019s enumerated sexual activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The judgment (order) is remanded to the superior court for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Cobey, J., and Allport, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied February 20, 1981, and respondent\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied March 25, 1981.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b137-11\">The types of films exhibited included foreign films, unusual domestic films, \u201cclassics,\u201d and \u201ccult\u201d films. At the July 25, 1977, city council meeting, the then theatre operators (assignors of the present operator Pringle) testified that they only showed \u201cX-Rated\u201d films rated by the Motion Picture Association of America, had shown 300 films of which only 7 were \u201cX-Rated\u201d (about 5 percent of their programming) and each of these films were from major distributors and had played in every area around <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Covina. According to plaintiffs\u2019 verified complaint, during the period from July 13, 1977, to September 6, 1977 (around the time of the enactment of the first interim ordinance), only 7 of 84 films (8.3 percent) were rated \u201cX.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b138-9\">Ordinance No. 1386 (adopted June 19, 1978) which superseded the 1977 interim ordinance and added provisions to title 17 of the Covina Municipal Code was in force when the preliminary injunction was denied.
