DeMiglio seeks a writ of mandate directing respondent court to set aside an order compelling him to provide further answers to interrogatories served on him by real parties in interest, Ralph S. Wittick and Stan Castles.  The sole issue we consider is whether Code of Civil Procedure section 1013, which extends \u201cthe time within which [a] right may be exercised or act be done,\u201d upon service by mail, applies to rights or acts arising incident to a hearing on a motion noticed pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1005. We hold that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">On August 29, 1979, real parties served on petitioner by mail a \u201cNotice of Motion to Dismiss Complaint, or in the Alternative for Further Answers to Interrogatories.\u201d The notice was filed the next day and received by petitioner on September 4. It specified a hearing date of September 11. Petitioner wrote to real parties\u2019 attorney, advising him that he could not appear on that date and relating his understanding that 15 days\u2019 notice was required. Real parties presented the letter to the trial court at the hearing on September 11, at which neither petitioner nor his attorney appeared. The court denied the motion to dismiss, granted the motion to compel further answers and awarded real parties sanctions of $250. On April 30, 1980, after a hearing on the issue of notice, the court reaffirmed the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">As applicable here, Code of Civil Procedure section 1005<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> required only that \u201cnotice of a motion.. .must be given at least 10 days before the time appointed for the hearing. ... \u201d Real parties complied with the requirement but petitioner claims that at the hearing on the motion he had a right to contest the motion and that, by virtue of the notice by mail, section 1013<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> extended \u201cthe time within which such right may be exercised\u201d and, consequently, extended time for the hearing at which the right accrued. Since the right to be heard is ancillary to a hearing on a noticed motion, petitioner\u2019s claim necessarily entails the uniform application of section 1013 to notices of motion served by mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">To determine the interrelationship of sections 1005 and 1013, we look to their legislative histories.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>Sections 1005 and 1013 have run parallel legislative courses from their beginnings as, respectively, sections 517 and 522 of the Practice Act of 1851 (Stats. 1851, ch. 5, \u00a7\u00a7 517, 522, pp. 132, 133.) Then, section 517<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> provided for notice of a motion, the extent of which was dependent upon the location of the hearing on the motion. Section 522<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> provided, without limitation as to the nature of the action noticed, for added notice by mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">In 1872 the Code of Civil Procedure was adopted and sections 517 and 522 became sections 1005<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 1013<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the code. In the transition, the provisions were significantly amended. The period of notice of a hearing on a motion was expressly extended upon service by mail (\u00a7 1005). But, the notice-by-mailing statute (\u00a7 1013) was limited to cases in which the notice predicated \u201ca right [to] be exercised, or an act.. .to be done.. . .\u201d The mailing provisions of the two sections were made identical.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">The inference from these congruent actions is compelled that the general notice-by-mailing statute (\u00a7 1013) did <em>not </em>apply to notices of motion (\u00a7 1005), that section 1005 provided the only notice required for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>motions subject to it and that the words of limitation in section 1013 did not encompass rights incident to a hearing on a noticed motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">From 1872 to 1963 the notice-by-mailing provisions of sections 1005 and 1013 were amended from time to time but parity was maintained. (See Historical Notes, 18 West\u2019s Ann. Code Civ. Proc. (1980 ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 1005 and 1013, pp. 588-589 and 628-629.) In 1963 section 1005 was amended to the form applicable here <em>{ante, </em>fn. 1) by repeal of its notice-by-mailing provisions without alteration of the words of limitation of section 1013. Plainly, what was removed from section 1005 was not added to section 1013, leaving the unmistakable inference that service of notice by mail was not to increase the period of notice provided by section 1005.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Given this history, we need not resort to liberal canons of interpretation (C<em>alifornia Accounts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 483, 486-488 [123 Cal.Rptr. 304]), or to linguistic exercises involving section 1013\u2019s words of limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">Recent amendments to section 1005, effective January 1, 1981, reaffirm its status independent of section 1013. They provide again for added notice upon service by mail of a noticed motion and expressly preclude application of section 1013\u2019s words of limitation \u201cto a notice of motion governed by this section.\u201d (Stats. 1980, ch. 196, \u00a7 1, p. 418; see Leg. Counsel\u2019s Dig. of Sen. Bill No. 1664.)</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">These amendments provide no benefit to petitioner for they are prospective and can only affect notice of a hearing to be held after their effective date. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3; cf. <em>Strauch </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1980) 107 Cal.App.3d 45 [165 Cal.Rptr. 552].)</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">The petition for writ of mandate is denied. The alternative writ and stay are discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">Paras, Acting P.
