We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1526-31\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1526-32\">This lawsuit arises out of a stock transaction that has come to be known as \u201cgreenmail.\u201d In short, Holstein alleges that a group of individuals and entities headed by Bass Brothers Enterprises, Inc. (\u201cBass group\u201d) bought a large number of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1449\">*1449</page-number>shares in Texaco, Inc., on the open market. When the Bass group had accumulated a substantial block of shares \u2014 about 9.9% of the outstanding total \u2014 it purportedly threatened Texaco management with a tender offer for control of the company unless management policies were altered. In that event, the Bass group apparently would replace existing Texaco management. Ultimately, the incumbent Texaco management agreed for Texaco to buy out the Bass group\u2019s shares at a premium over market price.</p>\n<p id=\"b1527-6\">Several shareholders of Texaco sought to challenge the transaction, most in derivative actions under principles of state corporations law relating to fiduciary duties, in various state and federal courts. Mollie Pin, the original plaintiff in this case, filed a complaint that set forth only state law causes of action. Pin, however, sold her shares of Texaco stock while the action was pending, and her counsel moved for her to be dismissed as plaintiff. However, rather than let the lawsuit expire, Pin\u2019s counsel moved to allow Holstein, another Texaco shareholder, to intervene. The proposed complaint in intervention at that time, like the original complaint, alleged only a violation of state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1527-7\">At about the same time, a Delaware state court, where numerous other derivative actions challenging this transaction were pending, certified a class action. A settlement was reached by the parties and approved by the trial court regarding all state law causes of action; that action, unless reversed on appeal,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> effectively dis-proposed settlement was reached by the parties and approved by the trial court regarding all state law causes of action; that action unless reversed on appeal,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> effectively disposed of the state law claims asserted in Holstein\u2019s motion to intervene. However, the state court\u2019s order expressly declined to foreclose litigation of federal securities law claims. Shortly after the hearing on the proposed settlement, Holstein\u2019s counsel filed an amended motion to intervene on behalf of Holstein, which added to the state law cause of action one count under \u00a7 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cAct\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Rule 10b-5, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5, and one count under \u00a7 13(e) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78m(e),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Rule 13e-4,17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.13e-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1527-15\">The district judge denied the motion to intervene. He concluded that intervention was inappropriate because neither of Holstein\u2019s proposed federal claims stated a cause of action. Further, he sanctioned Holstein\u2019s counsel under Fed.R.Civ.P. 11 for filing the \u201cdecidedly frivolous\u201d motion to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b1528-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1450\">*1450</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1528-4\">The issue in this case, one of civil procedure, is whether the trial court\u2019s denial of Holstein\u2019s motion to intervene under Fed. R.Civ.P. 24 was proper. Holstein raises two objections to the district court\u2019s order. As a threshold matter, he complains that the district court\u2019s decision suffers \u201cprocedural infirmities\u201d because the order was entered before discovery on the federal claims had been completed. However, the plain fact is that Rule 24(c) obligates a district judge to make an assessment of whether the proposed intervenor\u2019s complaint states a cause of action, at least when the motion to intervene is opposed, and where, as here, the complaint in intervention adds substantive claims that no other party asserted. <em>Diehl v. United States, </em>438 F.2d 705, 711 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 830, 92 S.Ct. 67, 30 L.Ed.2d 59 (1971); 7A C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, <em>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure </em>\u00a7 1914, at 569 (1972) (\u201cproposed pleading must state a good claim for relief\u201d); <em>see also Rhode Island Federation of Teachers v. Norberg, </em>630 F.2d 850, 854-55 (1st Cir. 1980) (\u201cintervention under Rule 24 is conditioned by the Rule 24(c) requirement that the intervenor state a well-pleaded claim or defense to the action\u201d); 3B J. Moore, <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>fl 24.14, at 24-162 (1982) (proposed complaint of intervenor \u201cmust state a well pleaded claim or defense\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1528-5\">Thus, as a threshold matter, the district judge must determine whether the inter-venor\u2019s complaint states a cause of action before he turns to a consideration of the factors listed in Rule 24(a) and (b) governing whether intervention is appropriate. The determination of whether the proposed intervenor\u2019s complaint states a cause of action is controlled by the \u201cgeneral rules on testing a pleading\u201d; the factual allegations of the complaint are assumed to be true, <em>Hishon v. King &amp; Spalding, </em>467 U.S. 69, 73, 104 S.Ct. 2229, 2232, 81 L.Ed.2d 59 (1984), and the pleading is construed liberally in support of the pleader. 7 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1914, at 569-70; <em>see Mendenhall v. M/V Toyota Maru No. 11, </em>551 F.2d 55, 56 (5th Cir.1977). But \u201c[i]t is a problem of substantive law, of course, as to whether a good claim or defense is stated.\u201d 3B J. Moore, <em>supra, </em>H 24.14, at 24-163. Thus, Holstein\u2019s contention that the district judge should have allowed discovery on his claims before ruling on the motion to intervene is as irrelevant as it would be if made in the context of a motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed.R. Civ.P. 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b1528-8\">Holstein further challenges the district court\u2019s determination that his proposed complaint failed to state a cause of action. Holstein\u2019s complaint alleges the following facts, which we must assume to be true.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On January 19, 1984, the separate members of the Bass group filed Schedule 13D\u2019s with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), indicating that they had acquired over five percent of Texaco\u2019s outstanding common stock. On February 28, 1984, the Bass group stated in another 13D filing that it had increased its stock in Texaco to 9.9 percent. Although \u201cnone of the Bass group had caused or threatened to cause any harm to Texaco,\u201d after learning of the Bass group\u2019s acquisition of Texaco shares \u201cTexaco management negotiated, approved and consummated a scheme and agreement with the Bass [group] to use Texaco cash and securities ... to repurchase the stock held by the Bass group, at an inflated price.\u201d Complaint 111112-13. Texaco management acted \u201cin order to eliminate the voting power of the 9.9 percent block of common stock that had been accumulated by the Bass group,\u201d and \u201cin order to create a large block of voting preferred stock subject to the sole control of Texaco management for the primary purpose of perpetuating Texaco manage<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1451\">*1451</page-number>ment in office.\u201d <em>Id. </em>1113. These acts are said to have constituted \u201cfraud and deceit upon the remaining shareholders,\u201d in violation of \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5: the Bass group, by \u201cthreatening to challenge the positions and policies of Texaco management, extorted substantial amounts of corporate money and other assets of Texaco through manipulation and \u2018green-mail____\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>1122. It is further alleged that Texaco\u2019s purchase of the Bass group\u2019s holdings was a tender offer that did not comply with the requirements of \u00a7 13(e) and Rule 13e-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1529-6\">It may be, as Holstein states in his brief, that \u201c[c]ommentators have virtually unanimously condemned the practice of greenmail and decried its harmful effects upon both corporate health and public investor wealth.\u201d It may be that greenmail is a \u201cdisgrace,\u201d and \u201can extremely serious wrong looking for a remedy.\u201d We express no views on those assertions, as the issue before us is simply whether, under the facts Holstein alleges in his amended complaint, \u00a7 10(b) and \u00a7 13(e) of the Act were intended by Congress to provide a remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1529-7\">A. <em>\u00a7 10(b) Claim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1529-8\">Holstein\u2019s theory of recovery under \u00a7 10(b) is elusive, but must be pinned down in order to determine whether the complaint states a cause of action. In short, Holstein contends that the Bass group, \u201cby threatening to challenge the positions and policies of Texaco management, extorted substantial amounts of corporate money and other assets of Texaco through manipulation and \u2018greenmail\u2019 (blackmail of corporate management for substantial amounts of corporate money or other assets by obtaining a block of securities)\u201d in violation of \u00a7 10(b). Complaint 1123. The complaint also states that Texaco itself violated \u00a7 10(b) when it repurchased the Bass group\u2019s holdings. Complaint 1122. These allegations fall short of the types of wrongful conduct that \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 were intended to remedy. In order to state a cause of action under \u00a7 10(b), a plaintiff must plead <em>facts </em>that would amount to manipulation or deceptive conduct proscribed by that section and Rule 10b-5. <em>Santa Fe Industries, Inc. v. Green, </em>430 U.S. 462, 472-75, 97 S.Ct. 1292, 1300-01, 51 L.Ed.2d 480 (1977); <em>see Segal v. Gordon, </em>467 F.2d 602, 607 (2d Cir.1972). \u201cManipulation\u201d as used in \u00a7 10(b) is \u201cvirtually a term of art when used in connection with securities markets.\u201d <em>Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder, </em>425 U.S. 185, 199, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 1383, 47 L.Ed.2d 668 (1976). \u201cThe term refers generally to practices, such as wash sales, matched orders, or rigged prices, that are intended to mislead investors by <em>artificially </em>affecting market activity.\u201d <em>Santa Fe, </em>430 U.S. at 476, 97 S.Ct. at 1302 (emphasis added). <em>See Gearhart Industries, Inc. v. Smith International, Inc., </em>741 F.2d 707, 724 (5th Cir.1984). The SEC, whose interpretations of \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 are entitled to some deference, recently defined the term: \u201cIn essence, a manipulation is intentional interference with the free forces of supply and demand.\u201d <em>In re Pagel, Inc., </em>Fed.Sec.L.Rep. (CCH) 11 83,909, at 87,751 (S.E.C. Aug. 11, 1985).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The free forces of supply and demand cannot function without \u201cfull disclosure\u201d and accurate representations, <em>Santa Fe, </em>430 U.S. at 477-78, 97 S.Ct. at 1302-03; but \u201conce full and fair disclosure has occurred, the fairness of the terms of the transaction is at most a tangential concern\u201d of \u00a7 10(b). <em>Id. </em>at 478. Accordingly, misrepresentation or nondisclosure \u2014 an interference with the free flow of information on which the forces of supply and demand rely \u2014 is an essential element of a cause of action under \u00a7 10(b). <em>Madison Consultants v. FDIC, </em>710 F.2d 57, 62 (2d Cir.1983); <em>Maldonado v. Flynn, </em>597 F.2d 789, 793 (2d Cir.1979); <em>Martin Marietta Corp. v.

White Weld &amp; Co., </em>53 F.R.D. 450, 452 (S.D.N.Y.1971)); <em>see Decker v. Massey-Ferguson, Ltd., </em>681 F.2d 111, 114 (2d Cir.1982); <em>cf. </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1530-4\">The plain fact is that Holstein\u2019s complaint does not allege that any party to this transaction misrepresented or failed to disclose a material fact,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> therefore, the complaint fails to claim that any party \u201cmanipulated\u201d stock prices as that term is used in federal securities law. As to Texaco, the complaint alleges nothing more than corporate mismanagement and breaches of fiduciary duty that are traditionally a matter of state regulation. There is no assertion that \u201cthe target\u2019s directors either misrepresented the company\u2019s situation or failed to disclose material information,\u201d Note, <em>supra, </em>98 Harv.L.Rev. at 1060. State law provides whatever remedy is available for shareholders\u2019 claims of this type, and \u201c \u2018it is entirely appropriate in this instance to relegate [Holstein] to whatever remedy is created by state law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Santa Fe, </em>430 U.S. at 478, 97 S.Ct. 1303 (quoting <em>Cort v. Ash, </em>422 U.S. 66, 84 (1975)). Accordingly, the complaint plainly fails to state a cause of action against Texaco for violation of \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1530-8\">As to the Bass group, again there is no allegation of misrepresentation or deception. The complaint merely asserts that the Bass group purchased a large block of shares on the open market at market prices, and \u201cextorted\u201d assets from Texaco\u2019s management. There is no allegation that the \u201cextortion\u201d involved misrepresentations or omissions. Nothing \u201cartificial,\u201d or outside the natural functioning of the market, is alleged in the complaint.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although the complaint uses the term \u201cmanipulation,\u201d it merely states in a conclusory manner that the Bass group engaged in manipulation when it \u201cextorted\u201d money from Texaco. But \u201cmanipulation\u201d is not a magic word whose use in a complaint automatically defeats a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1531-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1453\">*1453</page-number>It may be, as Holstein argues, that greenmail is \u201can extremely serious wrong looking for a remedy.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> But absent factual allegations that would amount to manipulative conduct, i.e., misrepresentation or nondisclosure, a complaint under \u00a7 10(b) does not provide a remedy because it does not state a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1531-5\">B. <em>\u00a7 13(e) Claims.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1531-6\">Holstein\u2019s amended complaint asserts that Texaco violated \u00a7 13(e) of the Act and Rule 13e-4 promulgated under it. It states that the transactions between Texaco and the Bass group \u201cconstituted an unlawful tender offer\u201d and that \u201csuch tender offer was not conducted in accordance with Section 13(e) and Rule 13e-4, [because] the remaining shareholders were not afforded an opportunity to tender their shares of stock pro rata to Texaco at the prices offered and paid to the Bass entities.\u201d Complaint If 26. Once again, we must accept the factual allegations of the complaint as true to pass on this appeal, and for the purpose of this opinion we will assume that Holstein has standing to raise this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1531-7\">Section 13(e), commonly known as the Williams Act, \u201cwas adopted in 1968 in response to the growing use of cash tender offers as a means for achieving corporate takeovers.\u201d <em>Piper v. Chris-Craft Industries, </em>430 U.S. 1, 22, 97 S.Ct. 926, 939, 51 L.Ed.2d 124 (1977). It sets forth disclosure requirements and provides specific benefits for tendering shareholders, and contains a broad antifraud provision. <em>Id. See also </em>Rule 13e-4(b)(l). Holstein contends that Texaco violated the Act when it did not offer to repurchase Texaco from all its shareholders at the same premium given the Bass group, Rule 13e-4(b)(3).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1531-10\">The policy behind the Williams Act \u2014 protection of shareholders in a target company by ensuring that they are treated fairly and equally when they decide whether to tender their shares, <em>see </em>HA pt. 1A <em>Business Organizations-Securities Regulation </em>\u00a7 7A.03[1], at 7A-47 (A. Sommer ed. 1985) \u2014seems to have little to do with the situation in the case <em>sub judice. </em>This is not a case in which poorly informed shareholders were induced to tender their shares to Texaco through misleading or incomplete information, which is the evil that \u00a7 13(e) was enacted to remedy. Be that as it may, we agree with the district court that the transaction between Texaco and the Bass group was not a tender offer; therefore, the Williams Act by the terms of Rule 13e-4 is inapplicable to this deal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1531-11\">The Williams Act amendments do not define the term \u201ctender offer,\u201d and the SEC \u201chas steadfastly refused to supply a definition, \u2018since the dynamic nature of tender offers requires administrative and judicial flexibility in determining what types of transactions should be subject to the Act and these regulations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7a-46, 47 (quoting <em>Exch. Act Rel. No. </em>15,-548 (1979)). <em>See also Smallwood v. Pearl Brewing Co., </em>489 F.2d 579, 598 (5th Cir.), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1454\">*1454</page-number><em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 873, 95 S.Ct. 134, 42 L.Ed.2d 113 (1974). Courts apply several tests to determine whether a stock purchase is a tender offer, for application of either \u00a7 13 or \u00a7 14 of the Act. First, the SEC has formulated an eight-factor analysis, first applied in <em>Hoover Co. v. Fuqua Industries, </em>Fed.Sec.L.Rep. (CCH) 1197, 107 (N.D. Ohio June 11, 1979): (1) whether there is an active and widespread solicitation of public shareholders for shares of an issuer; (2) whether the solicitation is made for a substantial percentage of the issuer\u2019s stock; (3) whether the offer to purchase is made at a premium over the prevailing market price; (4) whether the terms of the offer are firm rather than negotiated; (5) whether the offer is contingent on the tender of a fixed minimum number of shares, and perhaps, subject to the ceiling of a fixed maximum number to be purchased; (6) whether the offer is open for only a limited period of time; (7) whether the offerees are subject to pressure to sell their stock; and (8) whether public announcements of a purchasing program concerning the target company precede or accompany a rapid accumulation of large amounts of target company securities. <em>Id. </em>at 96,148. This analysis has been applied by the courts in <em>SEC v. Carter Hawley Hale Stores, Inc., </em>760 F.2d 945, 949-52 (9th Cir.1985); <em>Energy Ventures, Inc. v. Appalachian Co., </em>587 F.Supp. 734, 740 (D.Del. 1984); <em>Zuckerman v. Franz, </em>573 F.Supp. 351, 358 (S.D.Fla.1983); and <em>Wellman v. Dickinson, </em>475 F.Supp. 783, 823-26 (S.D.N.Y.1979), aff<em>'d on other grounds, </em>682 F.2d 355 (2d Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>460 U.S. 1069, 103 S.Ct. 1522, 75 L.Ed.2d 946 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1532-4\">A second test, adopted by the Second Circuit in <em>Hanson Trust PLC v. SCM Corp., </em>774 F.2d 47 (2d Cir.1985), a case under \u00a7 14 of the Act, cautions against the elevation of the SEC's eight-factor analysis to a \u201cmandatory \u2018litmus test.\u2019 \u201d The Second Circuit in <em>Hanson Trust </em>held that \u201cthe question of whether a solicitation constitutes a \u2018tender offer\u2019 within the meaning of \u00a7 14(d) turns on whether, viewing the transaction in light of the totality of circumstances, there appears to be a likelihood that unless the preacquisition filing strictures of that statute are followed there will be a substantial risk that solicitees will lack information needed to make a carefully considered appraisal of the proposal put before them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 57. <em>See also </em>Note, <em>The Developing Meaning of \u201cTender Offers\u201d Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, </em>86 Harv.L.Rev. 1250, 1281 (1973) (\u201ca tender offer should include any offer to purchase securities likely to pressure shareholders into making uninformed, ill-considered decisions to sell\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1532-7\">Holstein\u2019s proposed complaint plainly fails muster under either of these tests. The complaint alleges the following facts. This transaction was made privately to a very small percentage of Texaco\u2019s shareholders. There is no assertion of pressure by Texaco on any member of the Bass group to sell hastily. The complaint implies that the sellers were highly sophisticated. There is no allegation of \u201cactive or widespread advance publicity or public solicitation, which is one of the earmarks of a conventional tender offer.\u201d <em>Hanson Trust, </em>774 F.2d at 58. The complaint does not state that there was a general time limit within which the shares were to be given to Texaco in order for the offer to be accepted. In short, the conclusory allegation of a violation of \u00a7 13(e) of the Act, devoid of any facts that might, if proven true, establish that a tender offer had occurred, plainly fails to state a cause of action. The allegations of the complaint could establish nothing more than a pri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1455\">*1455</page-number>vately negotiated transaction, which does not qualify as a tender offer, and is thus not actionable under \u00a7 13(e). <em>See Hanson Trust, </em>774 F.2d at 56 (listing cases); <em>Business Organizations, supra, </em>at 7A-49 &amp; n. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b1533-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1533-6\">We turn to the issue of the propriety of sanctions under Fed.R.Civ.P. II.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Sanctions under Rule 11 are designed to \u201cdiscourage dilatory or abusive tactics and help to streamline the litigation process by lessening frivolous claims or defenses.\u201d Notes of Advisory Committee for 1983 Amendment. Rule 11 sets forth an objective standard: contentions in a pleading may be made only \u201cafter reasonable inquiry\u201d that the claim is \u201cwarranted by existing law or good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law.\u201d <em>See Ginther v. O\u2019Connell, </em>791 F.2d 1151, 1155 (5th Cir.1986); <em>Hale v. Harney, </em>786 F.2d 688, 692 (5th Cir.1986); <em>Davis v. Ves-lan Enterprises, </em>765 F.2d 494, 497 (5th Cir.1985). However, \u201c[t]he rule is not intended to chill an attorney\u2019s enthusiasm or creativity in pursuing factual or legal theories. The court is expected to avoid using the wisdom of hindsight and should test the signer\u2019s conduct by inquiring what was reasonable to believe at the time the pleading, motion, or other paper was submitted.\u201d Advisory Committee Note to Rule 11. Our review of the district court order is limited to determining whether it abused its discretion in awarding sanctions. <em>Ginther, </em>791 F.2d at 1153; <em>Veslan Enterprises, </em>765 F.2d at 498.</p>\n<p id=\"b1533-7\">We have discussed above the patent insufficiency of the federal law claims in light of the allegations of the complaint. The claims certainly are not warranted by existing law, nor could it be reasonably argued that the claims are warranted by an extension of the law, in light of <em>Santa Fe </em>and the numerous cases construing \u00a7 13(e). Further, a most discouraging aspect of this litigation is the hasty inclusion of the federal law claims, almost one year after the case was commenced, shortly after it appeared likely that the state law claims in the action would be foreclosed by the Delaware settlement. It is entirely sensible to conclude, as did the district court, that the claims \u201cappear to be nothing more than an end run around the anticipated ruling [approving a settlement] in Delaware, which counsel understood would eliminate the purely state claims in the earlier complaint filed in this case.\u201d The district court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1533-11\">Counts I and II were added in a desperate effort to keep this lawsuit alive after the likely approval by the Delaware court of the [Delaware state court] settlement. Oral argument only made it more obvious that intervenor\u2019s counsel is grasping at straws in an effort to keep this lawsuit afloat.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1533-12\">The record supports this conclusion. The brief accompanying Holstein\u2019s motion to intervene is devoid of any discussion of the requirement of Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(c) that an intervenor\u2019s complaint must state a cause of action. There is no explanation whatever of the tardy addition of the federal law counts to Holstein\u2019s complaint.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> There is no allusion to the requirements of a well-pleaded \u00a7 10(b) or \u00a7 13(e) cause of action in that brief. There is no citation to <em>Santa Fe </em>or to the numerous cases applying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1456\">*1456</page-number>Williams Act. (There was, however, a flurry of discovery motions accompanying Holstein\u2019s proposed amended complaint.) Oral argument before the district court on the motion to intervene provided further evidence of the elusive character of the theory of the amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-4\">Under these circumstances, the district judge was fully justified in concluding that counsel failed to investigate reasonably whether the amended complaint in intervention stated a cause of action, and that the claims were not warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension of existing law. Testing, as we must, counsel\u2019s conduct \u201cby inquiring what was reasonable to believe at the time the pleading, motion, or other paper was submitted,\u201d we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion in determining that sanctions were appropriate under Rule 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the order of the district court dismissing Pin\u2019s action with prejudice and denying Holstein\u2019s motion to intervene pursuant to Rule 24 is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1527-8\">.

In his brief on appeal and at oral argument, Holstein added numerous factual allegations to those set forth in the complaint, such as \"secret meetings,\" \u201cprice supports,\" pools, and employing numerous different brokers. The brief on appeal, of course, is not the appropriate place to amend a complaint. <em>Hanson v. Town of Flower Mound, </em>679 F.2d 497, 504 (5th Cir. 1982). Accordingly, we will consider only the factual allegations of the complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1529-9\">. For example, a securities underwriter who controls wholesale pricing \"to such an extent as to preclude an independent competitive market from arising\u201d may engage in manipulative conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 87,750.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1530-5\">. Holstein asserts for the first time on appeal that the Form 13D's filed by the Bass group were misleading, in that it actually intended to greenmail Texaco all along, and did not acquire the Texaco stock simply \"as an investment\u201d as the Bass group\u2019s members stated in the 13D\u2019s. The allegations of false 13D\u2019s does not appear in the complaint. In oral argument before the district court, the judge asked whether there was any misrepresentation in the 13D\u2019s, and counsel for plaintiff answered \u201cNo. I do not know of any misrepresentation or omission that was made by the Bass defendants in those filings.\u201d We do not consider these new allegations of false 13D\u2019s, because of the settled rule of appellate practice that precludes review of issues raised for the first time on appeal. <em>Donovan v. Hamm's Drive Inn, </em>661 F.2d 316, 317 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1530-6\">We note that one commentator suggests that whether 13D\u2019s are false is properly a matter to be considered in an action under \u00a7 13(d) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78m(d). \"The shareholders could claim that the raider intended to greenmail the target all along and therefore violated \u00a7 13(d) when it did not disclose this intention in its 13D filing with the SEC.\u201d Note, <em>supra, </em>98 Harv.L.Rev. at 1060 n. 76. However, several courts have held that \u00a7 13(d) does not provide a private right of action to shareholders for damages. <em>See, e.g., Sanders v. Thrall Car Mfg. Co., </em>582 F.Supp. 945, 960-61 (S.D.N.Y.1983), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>730 F.2d 910 (2d Cir.1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1530-10\">. For this reason, Holstein\u2019s reliance on <em>Alabama Farm Bureau Mutual Casualty Co. v. American Fidelity Life Ins. Co., </em>606 F.2d 602 (5th Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 820, 101 S.Ct. 77, 66 L.Ed.2d 22 (1980), for the proposition that greenmail \"constitutes\u201d manipulation is misplaced. <em>Alabama Farm </em>stands for the settled proposition that \u00a7 10(b) proscribes \"conduct designed to <em>deceive </em>or <em>defraud </em>investors.\" <em>Id. </em>at 612 (emphasis added). \"Deception,\" however, requires misrepresentations or nondisclosure of facts, either by statements or by conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 611-12. Such allegations are entirely absent from the amended complaint in intervention in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1531-8\">. The Office of Chief Economist of the SEC recently prepared a report on greenmail, on which Holstein's counsel relies heavily. <em>Impact of Targeted Share Repurchase (Greenmail) on Stock Prices, </em>Fed.Sec.L.Rep. (CCH) j[ 83,713 (Sept. 11, 1984). The report concludes that greenmail has \"negative net effects\u201d on stock prices. <em>Id. </em>at 87,179. However, that conclusion is not relevant to whether \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 provide a federal remedy for that injury under the allegations of this complaint. Indeed, the report notes that the SEC proposed legislation to restrict target company repurchases. <em>Id. </em>at 87,174. Numerous bills \u2014 all \"based on\u201d the SEC proposal \u2014 were introduced in the 98th Congress to limit or outlaw greenmail. <em>See </em>Note, <em>supra, </em>98 Harv.L.Rev. at 1045 n. 5. The fact that the SEC has proposed these reforms provides implicit support for the conclusion that it does not believe that current federal law provides a remedy for greenmail, and Congress\u2019 failure to amend the statute in light of that interpretation provides limited support that it does not view \u00a7 10(b) as prohibiting greenmail. <em>See Canada Packers, Ltd. v. Atchison, T. &amp; S.F. Ry. Co., </em>385 U.S. 182, 184, 87 S.Ct. 359, 360, 17 L.Ed.2d 281 (1966); N.
