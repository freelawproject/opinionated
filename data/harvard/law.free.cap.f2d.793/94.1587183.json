Messerlian, was convicted after trial and sentenced to ten years imprisonment. The district court denied bail pending appeal. We are asked to review that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-27\">Messerlian, a New Jersey State Trooper, was convicted by a jury of willfully depriv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>ing Joseph Topolosky of his constitutional right to liberty without due process of law by beating him to death in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 242 (Count I); of conspiracy to obstruct justice in an effort to cover up the circumstances surrounding Topolosky\u2019s death, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (Count II); and of falsely testifying before a federal grand jury that he, Messerlian, had not in fact struck Topolosky around the head and neck with his flashlight, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623 (Count III).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Following his conviction and the filing of post-trial motions, Messerlian moved before the district court for bail pending appeal-pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3143(b). Applying the four-part standard established by <em>United States v. Miller, </em>753 F.2d 19 (3d Cir. 1985), the district court expressly found that Messerlian posed no risk of flight or immediate danger to the community, and that Messerlian\u2019s appeal was not taken for purposes of delay. District Court op. at App. 441a. Nevertheless, the district court denied Messerlian bail on the ground that Messerlian\u2019s proposed appeal presented no substantial legal issues which, if determined favorably to Messerlian, would be likely to result in reversal of his conviction or an order for a new trial. District Court op. at App. 444a.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">On May 13, 1986, Messerlian was sentenced by the district court to concurrent terms of ten years imprisonment on Count I, three years imprisonment on Count II, and three years imprisonment on Count III.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court\u2019s original commitment order provided that Messerlian should voluntarily surrender on or before May 29, 1986 to the designated penal institution. However, the district court further provided that if the location of the penal institution to which Messerlian would be incarcerated were established sooner, Messerlian would be obligated to surrender on May 22, 1986. Upon determining where he would be assigned to serve his term of imprisonment, Messerlian was informed by letter that he was to report for confinement by noon on May 22, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-11\">Messerlian moved before the district court for a stay of the district court\u2019s order denying him bail pending appeal. The district court denied Messerlian\u2019s motion and ordered that Messerlian surrender to federal authorities by noon on May 22, 1986. While Messerlian was en route to prison, Messerlian\u2019s newly retained appellate counsel moved before Judge Leonard I. Garth, as a single judge of this court, for a stay of the district court\u2019s order denying bail pending appeal. In an order issued May 22, 1986, the district court\u2019s order denying bail pending appeal was stayed until further action by a three-judge panel of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-12\">Exercising our responsibility to \u201cindependently determine\u201d whether Messerlian is entitled to bail pending appeal, <em>United States v. Smith, </em>793 F.2d 85, at 87 (3d Cir.1986); <em>United States v. Strong, </em>775 F.2d 504, 505 (3d Cir.1985); <em>United States v. Delker, </em>757 F.2d 1390, 1399-1400 (3d Cir.1985), we conclude that the district court erred in finding that Messerlian\u2019s appeal of his conviction fails to raise a substantial issue. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order denying Messerlian bail, and remand to the district court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-14\">In order for a convicted defendant to obtain bail pending appeal pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3143(b)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, the defendant has the burden of establishing</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>(1) that the defendant is not likely to flee or pose a danger to the safety of any other person or the community if released;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-4\">(2) that the appeal is not for purpose of delay;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-5\">(3) that the appeal raises a substantial question of law or fact; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-6\">(4) that if that substantial question is determined favorably to defendant on appeal, that decision is likely to result in reversal or an order for a new trial of all counts on which imprisonment has been imposed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-7\"><em>United States v. Miller, </em>753 F.2d 19, 24 (3d Cir.1985)</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">In responding to Messerlian\u2019s appeal, the government does not contend that Messer-lian poses a threat of flight or danger to the community or that his appeal has been raised for purposes of delay. Thus, the sole issue before us is whether Messerli-an\u2019s appeal on the merits raises a substantial issue which, if determined favorably to Messerlian, would result in reversal of his conviction or a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">This court recently elaborated upon the question of what constitutes a substantial issue on appeal in <em>United States v. Smith, </em>793 F.2d 85 (3d Cir.1986). We realize that the district court did not have the benefit of our decision in <em>Smith </em>at the time it was called upon to determine the bail question.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">In <em>Smith, </em>we discussed two interpretations of the meaning of \u201csubstantial issue\u201d which have been developed by other courts of appeals. In <em>United States v. Giancola, </em>754 F.2d 898 (11th Cir.1985), the Eleventh Circuit concluded that a substantial question is a \u201c \u2018close\u2019 question or one that very well could be decided the other way.\u201d 754 F.2d at 901. The <em>Giancola </em>modification of <em>Miller </em>has been adopted by the First, Second, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Tenth Circuits. In <em>United States v. Handy, </em>761 F.2d 1279, 1281-82 (9th Cir.1985), on the other hand, the Ninth Circuit concluded that a substantial question is one that can be characterized as \u201cfairly debatable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-13\">In announcing the judgment of the court in <em>Smith, </em>Judge Mansmann, with District Court Judge Poliak concurring in the choice of standard, but dissenting as to its application,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> adopted the <em>Handy </em>\u201cfairly debatable\u201d standard. Judge Hunter, who agreed that bail should be denied, but who dissented from the <em>Handy </em>formulation of \u201csubstantial issue\u201d, advocated adoption of the <em>Giancola </em>\u201cclose question or one that is very likely to be decided the other way\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-14\">In the present appeal, we are bound by <em>Smith. </em>However, under either the <em>Giancola </em>or <em>Handy </em>standard, we are satisfied that Messerlian has presented substantial issues on appeal within the formula of <em>Smith. </em>The briefs prepared by his present counsel pursuant to an expedited briefing schedule have satisfied us that Messerlian has raised substantial issues which are not only \u201cfairly debatable\u201d <em>(see Smith </em>and <em>Handy supra), </em>but which are also \u201cclose\u201d <em>(see Giancola supra), </em>as to the manner in which the jury was instructed on the relevant law on the issue of specific intent under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 242. In his motion before us Messerlian contends that the district court\u2019s charge to the jury failed to distinguish between the use of excessive force with an intent to inflict summary punishment, which Messerlian claims would constitute a constitutional violation, and the mere intentional use of excessive force caused by over-reaction or excessive zeal, which Messerlian argues would not be a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 242. Messerlian calls our particular attention to the district court\u2019s discussion of its proposed jury charge during the charging conference, where the district court stated it would not distinguish \u201cbetween [mere] excessive force and [a] federal constitutional violation.\u201d App. 831-32; 963-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>Moreover, evidence disclosed to the defense after trial that the Philadelphia Medical Examiner, Dr. Marvin Aronson, might have testified that an earlier car accident between Topolosky\u2019s automobile and another vehicle caused the injuries which resulted in Topolosky\u2019s death, presents substantial issues on appeal. In a fifty-five page opinion, the district court examined, and ultimately rejected, Messerlian\u2019s post-trial contentions that the government\u2019s failure to reveal Dr. Aronson\u2019s allegedly exculpatory testimony to the defense violated Mes-serlian\u2019s right to a fair trial under <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963) and Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16. Further, the district court held that Dr. Aronson\u2019s proposed testimony did not constitute new evidence which might have affected the jury\u2019s verdict. Therefore, the district court denied Messerlian\u2019s motion for a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">We believe that Messerlian\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s ruling on these issues raises substantial legal questions within the teachings of <em>Miller </em>and <em>Smith </em>which could affect all three counts upon which Messerlian was convicted. In reaching this conclusion, we expressly intimate no views with respect to the merits of Messerlian\u2019s appeal on these issues. We do no more than decide that within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3143(b), as construed by <em>Miller </em>and <em>Smith, </em>the issues which Messerlian will raise on appeal are sufficiently substantial to satisfy the requirements of that statute. Under <em>Smith </em>and <em>Handy, </em>they are \u201cfairly debatable\u201d. Under <em>Giancola, </em>they are \u201cclose\u201d questions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Accordingly, we will vacate the district court\u2019s order denying bail and we will remand the determination of bail conditions to the district court so that the district court may determine what, if any, conditions of release are required to assure Mes-serlian\u2019s presence pending this court\u2019s determination of his appeal on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">In this connection, we note that when the district court order was stayed until further action by a panel of this court, the government represented to Judge Garth, as a single judge, that it had no objection to Messerlian continuing to remain free on his own recognizance pending this panel\u2019s decision on Messerlian\u2019s motion for bail pending appeal. It will be for the district court to determine in the first instance whether that condition remains sufficient within the requirements of the Bail Act pending Mes-serlian\u2019s appeal on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">The district court\u2019s order of May 13,1986 will be vacated, and the issue of bail pending appeal will be remanded to the district court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b175-7\">.
