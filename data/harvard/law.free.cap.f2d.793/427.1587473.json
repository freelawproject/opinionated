CAMPBELL, Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b507-20\">Plaintiffs-appellants Mary and Thomas Marino appeal from an order of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts dismissing their complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction over defendant-appellee Hyatt Corporation. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-22\">The complaint alleges, in substance, as follows. Plaintiffs are Massachusetts residents and defendant Hyatt is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Chicago, Illinois. In the spring and summer of 1982, plaintiffs made reservations and contracted to stay at defendant\u2019s Hyatt Regency Hotel in Maui, Hawaii, through the Rite Way Travel Agency in Methuen, Massachusetts. In July of 1982, plaintiffs traveled to Maui, where they took up lodgings at the Hyatt Regency. On or about July 21, 1982, Mary Marino was injured when she slipped and fell in the bathtub of the hotel room she was sharing with her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-23\">Plaintiffs brought this action for damages in the Superior Court for Essex County, Massachusetts, in a complaint dated July 10, 1985. On August 7, 1985, Hyatt' removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. On August 12, Hyatt moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction over it. The district court granted Hyatt\u2019s motion on October 17, 1985, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-24\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-25\">The central issue on this appeal is whether the district court erred in deciding that it lacked personal jurisdiction over defendant Hyatt under the Massachusetts long-arm statute, Mass.Gen.Laws ch. 223A, \u00a7 3(a) (1984).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section 3 provides in relevant part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>\n<em>Transactions or conduct for personal jurisdiction</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-4\">A court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a person, who acts directly or by an agent, as to a cause of action in law or equity arising from the person\u2019s (a) transacting any business in this commonwealth; ____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">There seems little doubt that Hyatt, a foreign corporation headquartered in Chicago, \u201ctransaet[s] ... business in th[e] commonwealth\u201d within the meaning of section 3(a). The complaint alleges, and Hyatt does not dispute, that among the hotels Hyatt owns and operates is one in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and that Hyatt regularly advertises and solicits business within the Commonwealth. <em>See, e.g., Bond Leather Co. v. Q.T. Shoe Manufacturing Co., </em>764 F.2d 928, 932 (1st Cir.1985); <em>Ross v. Ross, </em>371 Mass. 439, 441, 358 N.E.2d 437, 439 (1976).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">But it is not enough for the purposes of section 3(a) that a defendant transact business in Massachusetts. The cause of action itself must \u201caris[e] from\u201d the defendant\u2019s transacting of business in Massachusetts. We find no merit in plaintiffs\u2019 argument that this court, in effect, read the \u201carising from\u201d language out of the statute by our decision in <em>Nova Biomedical Corp. v. Moller, </em>629 F.2d 190 (1st Cir.1980). That case merely held that the \u201carising from\u201d requirement was not essential to a finding that the assertion of personal jurisdiction over a defendant comported with due process. <em>Id. </em>at 193 n. 3. The correct principle of Massachusetts law remains, as we most recently stated in <em>Gray v. O\u2019Brien, </em>777 F.2d 864 (1st Cir.1985),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-12\">Although the \u201ctransacting of any business\u201d clause should be construed broadly \u201cand applies to any purposeful acts by an individual, whether personal, private, or commercial,\u201d ... the exercise of jurisdiction under the Massachusetts long-arm statute will nonetheless fail if the cause of action did not arise from defendant\u2019s transaction of business in Massachusetts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ani\"><em>Id. </em>at 867 (citations omitted). Here, therefore, it must be shown not merely that Hyatt engages in business within Massachusetts but that plaintiffs\u2019 personal injury claims, based on Mrs. Marino\u2019s slip and fall in the bathtub of the Hyatt hotel in Maui, Hawaii, arose from one or more of Hyatt\u2019s business transactions within Massachusetts. <em>See Good Hope Industries, Inc. v. Ryder Scott Co., </em>378 Mass. 1, 10 n. 17, 389 N.E.2d 76, 82 n. 17 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-13\">To make such a showing, plaintiffs rely exclusively on facts alleged in their complaint.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They allege there that, prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>Mrs. Marino\u2019s accident in Hawaii, they transacted business with Hyatt in Massachusetts by making reservations in its hotel (presumably the one in Hawaii) through a travel agent in Methuen, Massachusetts. They also allege, referring presumably to the same reservation transaction, that Hyatt \u201centered into a contract with the Plaintiffs, while the Plaintiffs were in Massachusetts, contracting to supply services to the Plaintiffs, specifically, a contract to provide the Plaintiffs with a room to stay in in its hotel in Maui, Hawaii.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">Plaintiffs argue that these parts of the complaint indicate that their personal injury claims, stemming from Mrs. Marino\u2019s slipping in the bathtub at the Maui, Hawaii, Hyatt hotel, arose from the reservation contract entered into in Massachusetts. In making this argument, plaintiffs rely particularly on our decision in <em>Hahn v. Vermont Law School, </em>698 F.2d 48 (1st Cir. 1983).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There Hahn, a Massachusetts resident, sued in the Massachusetts district court for declaratory and injunctive relief and damages for breach of contract against Vermont Law School, a Vermont corporation, and Thomas Ross, a teacher at the school, after Ross gave Hahn a failing grade. The district court declined to exercise jurisdiction over Vermont Law School under section 3(a) of the Massachusetts long-arm statute because, although the law school had transacted business in Massachusetts by sending recruiters into the Commonwealth, Hahn\u2019s cause of action did not arise out of this transaction of business, there being no indication that the recruiters had visited any Massachusetts colleges while Hahn was an undergraduate.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-11\">On appeal, this court reversed the district court\u2019s finding that there was no personal jurisdiction over Vermont Law School under section 3(a). We noted that the school had also transacted business in the Commonwealth when it mailed application information to Hahn in Massachusetts and then mailed him an offer of admission which he had accepted, because this activity resulted in the contractual relationship which formed the basis for Hahn\u2019s claim. We said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-12\">Although the Massachusetts courts have not defined the scope of the \u201carising from\u201d requirement of the long-arm statute, we have no doubt that it has been satisfied when the cause of action is for an alleged breach of contract and the business transacted was instrumental in the formation of the contract. Any determination of whether VLS [Vermont Law School] has breached the contract will depend upon the terms of the contract, and such terms may include statements contained in the application information and acceptance letter VLS mailed to Hahn____ It does not require the expansive reading which we have noted other courts apply ... to find that this cause of action arose from the transaction of business in Massachusetts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-15\"><em>Hahn, </em>698 F.2d at 51 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-16\">Plaintiffs argue that <em>Hahn </em>compels the assertion of personal jurisdiction over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Hyatt in the case at bar, because their cause of action arises out of the contract they allegedly entered into in Massachusetts for their Hawaiian hotel room.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, plaintiffs have not cited, and our research has failed to disclose, any Massachusetts or Hawaii cases<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> holding that, where a plaintiff is injured by the negligent failure of a hotel owner to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition, the plaintiff\u2019s action sounds in contract as well as in tort. <em>But cf. Bearse v. Fowler, </em>347 Mass. 179, 180-81, 196 N.E.2d 910, 911 (1964) (sustaining directed verdict for defendant in \u201caction of tort or contract\u201d brought by motel guest allegedly injured by negligence of defendant without discussing plaintiff\u2019s contract theory).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">The few cases we have found permitting a plaintiff to proceed in contract against a hotel owner for the infliction of personal injury all involve <em>intentional </em>interference with the hotel guest\u2019s right to the quiet enjoyment of his room, and are in this respect at least factually distinguishable from the case at bar. <em>See Crawford v. Hotel Essex Boston Corp., </em>143 F.Supp. 172 (D.Mass.1956) (hotel guest assaulted by house detective) (applying Massachusetts law); <em>McClean v. University Club, </em>327 Mass. 68, 97 N.E.2d 174 (1951) (plaintiff removed from room in private club despite his request for medical attention); <em>Frewen v. Page, </em>238 Mass. 499, 131 N.E. 475 (1921) (action in contract against hotel manager for assault, false imprisonment, and slander).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">No case has been called to our attention, moreover, holding that the mere reserving of a hotel room not only promises a room on a given date but also creates, when made, whatever covenant pertaining to the safety of the premises may later come into existence after registration at the hotel and actual occupancy of a room. It seems most likely that it is when a guest checks in, signs the hotel register, makes satisfactory credit arrangements if any are required, and receives a definitely assigned room and a key, that any implied covenant pertaining to the safety of the occupied premises comes into being. Unlike the contract in <em>Hahn, </em>698 F.2d 48, plaintiffs\u2019 advance reservation agreement with Hyatt would hardly be an important, or perhaps even a material, element of proof in their slip and fall case. We accordingly do not think that plaintiffs\u2019 personal injury claim against Hyatt can be said to \u201caris[e] from\u201d that contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">To accept plaintiffs\u2019 contrary argument would be to render the \u201carising from\u201d requirement of the Massachusetts long-arm statute a virtual nullity. Plaintiffs have the burden of demonstrating that personal jurisdiction exists over Hyatt. <em>Kowalski v. Doherty, Wallace, Pillsbury &amp; Murphy, Attorneys at Law, </em>787 F.2d 7, 8 (1st Cir. 1986). Vague allegations of having made reservations through a Massachusetts travel agent, and of Hyatt\u2019s having contracted in Massachusetts \u201cto supply services to the Plaintiffs, specifically, a contract to provide the Plaintiffs with a room to stay in in its hotel in Maui, Hawaii\u201d say no more than that the hotel agreed to hold a room for a particular time. If plaintiffs meant to allege more \u2014 for example, that Mrs. Mari-no\u2019s injuries were caused by the hotel\u2019s breach of some specific promise made to plaintiffs in Massachusetts \u2014 they should have so stated. We recognize that, in a case such as this, where the question of personal jurisdiction is submitted on the pleadings, plaintiffs\u2019 written allegations of jurisdictional facts are to be construed in their favor. <em>Kowalski, </em>787 F.2d at 9. However, this does not relieve plaintiffs of the burden of making out a prima facie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>showing that jurisdiction exists, <em>id. </em>at 8, and we agree with the district court that plaintiffs here have failed to meet this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">We conclude that it would be a case of the tail wagging the dog to hold that plaintiffs\u2019 claims for personal injuries suffered in a Hawaii hotel \u201caris[e] from\u201d their alleged Massachusetts contract with Hyatt making a hotel reservation. <em>See Pearrow v. National Life &amp; Accident Insurance Co., </em>703 F.2d 1067 (8th Cir.1983) (plaintiff\u2019s cause of action in negligence did not arise out of foreign defendant\u2019s solicitation of business in Arkansas within meaning of Arkansas long-arm statute); <em>Krone v. AMI, Inc., </em>367 F.Supp. 1141 (E.D.Ark.1973) (plaintiff\u2019s cause of action for personal injuries against foreign hotel operator did not arise out of reservation contract made in forum state within meaning of Arkansas long-arm statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b507-18\">. Plaintiffs have abandoned their argument, made in the district court, that Mass.Gen.Laws <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>ch. 223A, \u00a7 3(b) (1984) provides a basis for personal jurisdiction over Hyatt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b508-8\">. Because of Hyatt\u2019s business activities in Massachusetts, there may well have been personal jurisdiction had service of process been made in accordance with Mass.Gen.Laws ch. 223, \u00a7 38 (1984). <em>See Howse v. Zimmer Manufacturing Co., </em>757 F.2d 448, 451-52 (1st Cir.1985). Section 38 provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-9\">[i]n an action against a foreign corporation, except an insurance company, which has a usual place of business in the commonwealth, or, with or without such usual place of business, is engaged in or soliciting business in the commonwealth, permanently or temporarily, service may be made in accordance with the provisions of [Mass.Gen.Laws ch. 223, \u00a7 37 (1984)]..'..</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">Section 37, which relates to service on domestic corporations, allows, <em>inter alia, </em>service of process on a domestic corporation\u2019s \"president, treasurer, clerk, resident agent .... cashier, secretary, agent, or other officer in charge of its business.\u201d However, plaintiffs apparently did not comply with the requirements of section 38; it appears from the record that they did not serve process on an officer or agent of Hyatt within the Commonwealth, but served process on Hyatt directly at its headquarters in Chicago. Plaintiffs make no argument that section 38 applies. We, therefore, limit our inquiry to whether personal jurisdiction was obtained by compliance with section 3(a) of Mass.Gen.Laws ch. 223A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b508-15\">. The complaint alleges in relevant part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-16\">8. In Spring and Summer of 1982, the Defendant transacted business with the Plaintiffs, when the Plaintiffs made reservations in Defendant\u2019s hotel through a travel agent, Rite Way Travel Agency, a travel agency located in the Methuen, Mall [sic], Methuen, Massachusetts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-17\">9. The Defendant, Hyatt Corporation, in Summer of 1982, at some time prior to July 21, 1982, entered into a contract with the Plaintiffs, while the Plaintiffs were in Massachusetts, contracting to supply services to the Plaintiffs, specifically, a contract to provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>the Plaintiffs with a room to stay in in its hotel in Maui, Hawaii.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-6\">10. At all pertinent times hereto, the Defendant, Hyatt Corporation, was transacting business with the Plaintiffs in this Commonwealth, via its dealings with the travel agency, Rite Way Travel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-7\">11. The Defendant Hyatt Corporation and the Plaintiffs, by and through said travel agency, consumated [sic] their transaction in Massachusetts in the Summer of 1982, at a time prior to July 21, 1982.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Besides their complaint, plaintiffs submitted nothing else, by way of affidavit or otherwise, to show that their cause of action arose from Hyatt\u2019s transacting business in Massachusetts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b509-9\">. Plaintiffs also rely on <em>Campbell v. Frontier Fishing &amp; Hunting Ltd., </em>10 Mass.App. 53, 405 N.E.2d 989 (1980). Although <em>Campbell </em>bears some factual resemblance to the case at bar, jurisdiction there was predicated on Mass.Gen. Laws ch. 223, \u00a7 38 (1984), <em>see </em>note 2, <em>supra, </em>not Mass.Gen.Laws ch. 223A, \u00a7 3 (1984), and the <em>Campbell </em>court itself suggested that the two statutes are susceptible of entirely different interpretations. In reversing the superior court\u2019s allowance of defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss for want of personal jurisdiction, the Massachusetts Appeals Court in <em>Campbell </em>held that the superi- or court had <em>erred </em>in making the existence of jurisdiction under chapter 223, section 38, dependent on the question of jurisdiction under chapter 223A, section 3. Thus, we find <em>Campbell </em>inapposite.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b510-6\">. The complaint is divided into three counts. Count one seeks damages for Hyatt's allegedly negligent creation and maintenance of a dangerous condition, count two seeks damages for Hyatt\u2019s alleged breach of a contractual duty to provide plaintiffs with safe accommodations, and count three seeks damages for loss of consortium.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b510-9\">. We need not and do not decide whether, in characterizing a cause of action for the purposes of section 3(a), the Massachusetts courts would apply the law of Massachusetts or the <em>lex loci delicti.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
