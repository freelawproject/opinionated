The plaintiff, Seismic International Research Corporation (SI), was formed by Stanley D. Bra-sel to provide consulting services and computer processing of geophysical data for the oil and gas industry. The defendant, South Ranch Oil Co., Inc. (SROC), was a general partner in numerous limited partnerships. It drilled oil and gas wells, operated drilling rigs, and developed drillable prospects.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-22\">SI entered into several contracts to perform seismological work for SROC. Some time later, SROC directed SI to stop work on the contracts and not to do anything more for SROC that would cost SROC any more money. Thereafter, SI sued SROC for its failure to pay the remaining balances due under the contracts. SROC countersued for recovery of amounts already paid. While this suit was pending, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>Mr. Brasel died. The dispute proceeded to a jury trial in which SI prevailed and was awarded $239,334.56. SI appeals from two post-trial orders: one denying Si\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees and another denying Si\u2019s motion to compel assignment of certain royalty interests to the estate of its deceased president, Mr. Brasel. SROC cross-appeals the denial of certain jury instructions, the imposition of certain discovery sanctions, and the denial of a directed verdict. We first consider SROC\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">SROC claims that the trial court committed reversible error because it refused to instruct the jury on SROC\u2019s claim for tor-tious interference with a fiduciary relationship. SROC bases its tort claim on an undisclosed $28,000 payment that SI made to Norman Stafford, an SROC employee. Mr. Stafford was SROC\u2019s only geophysicist. He was assigned to monitor Si\u2019s performance and to approve bills for its work. SROC claims that the $28,000 payment was a kickback designed to induce Mr. Stafford to approve SI bills even though work was not properly completed. SI admits it made the $28,000 payment, but contends the payment was a sales commission for Mr. Stafford\u2019s help in locating a buyer for Si\u2019s field crews.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">The record indicates the trial court\u2019s reason for refusing to instruct on the tort claim. SROC anticipated the claim well before trial; it is mentioned in SROC\u2019s First Amended Answer and Counterclaims. Record, vol. 3, at 594. SROC\u2019s attorneys, however, failed to submit the tort-claim instructions to the court three days before trial, as required by the Order at Pretrial. <em>See </em>Record, vol. 1, at 48 (Order at Pretrial). Instead, they submitted the instructions the day the trial began. The court ruled that this submission was too late, and entered a minute order denying SROC\u2019s motion to add the tort-claim instructions because of \u201cfailure to adhere to Local Rule 14.\u201d Record, vol. 4, at 931; vol. 9, at 551.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">SROC strenuously argues that it presented sufficient evidence for the court to instruct on its tort claim. But it does not argue that the court misapplied Local Rule 14 or abused its discretion in denying the instructions because they were filed late. Indeed, no mention of Local Rule 14 is made in the briefs. Counsel\u2019s failure to focus on the reasons the trial court denied the requested instructions leaves us without a basis for assigning error to the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">SROC further argues that the district court committed reversible error by instructing the jury that SROC was bound by Norman Stafford\u2019s actions and omissions. SROC argues specifically that the court created this impression through its instructions on four doctrines of contract modification: waiver, oral modification, interpretation by conduct, and ratification. SROC does not appear to allege that the instructions themselves misstate relevant law. Rather, it argues that the jury was not fully informed that SROC should not have been bound by an allegedly bribed employee. In essence, SROC argues that the trial court should have supplemented the contract-modification instructions with an explanation of how the $28,000 payment to Mr. Stafford affected SROC\u2019s contractual obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">Considering the jury instructions as a whole, <em>see, e.g., McGrath v. Wallace Murray Cory., </em>496 F.2d 299, 301 (10th Cir.1974), we do not believe that the jury was misled. The contract modification instructions were accompanied by a good-faith instruction informing the jury that each party had an implied obligation under the contract \u201cto act in good faith and with fair dealing.\u201d Record, vol. 4, at 950. This instruction informed the jury that it could find SI to have breached its contract if the jury accepted SROC\u2019s kickback argument. Furthermore, counsel for SROC had ample opportunity to comment during closing argument on the court\u2019s instructions on waiver, oral modification, interpretation by con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>duct, and ratification. Indeed, SROC\u2019s attorney did so, explaining that Mr. Stafford\u2019s receipt of the undisclosed $28,000 payment should affect the jury\u2019s application of the contract-modification doctrines. <em>See </em>Record, vol. 9, at 529-30. Therefore, we do not believe the court erred in refusing to supplement the instructions that dealt with contract modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">SROC also argues that the district court erred in instructing the jury that SROC had to prove a material breach to recover on its contract counterclaims. This argument apparently refers to jury instruction number 10, which contains the phrase: \u201c[I]n order to prevail upon its claim, the defendant must prove that the plaintiff\u2019s performance was neither in literal compliance with the contract nor in substantial compliance with the contract.\u201d Record, vol. 4, at 951. SROC states that the instruction was given in error because it prevented SROC from recovering damages \u201cfor whatever breaches it was able to prove.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Brief at 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Jury instruction number 10 was not given in error. That instruction was a correct statement of the law where a party seeks to excuse its performance altogether. <em>See Joyce v. Davis, </em>539 F.2d 1262, 1266 (10th Cir.1976); <em>Kole v. Parker Yale Development Co., </em>536 P.2d 848, 849-50 (Colo. App.1975). Moreover, instructions 11 and 12 properly informed the jury as to the amount of damages that should be recovered. They stated that where a party has substantially, but not literally, complied with its contractual obligations, the proper measure of damages is the contract price less the cost of completing performance. In other words, those instructions informed the jury that it could award damages for any breaches it found. Because jury instructions must be considered as a whole in connection with all other instructions given, <em>see, e.g., McGrath, </em>496 F.2d at 301, SROC\u2019s argument that instruction number 10 misled the jury is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">In addition, SROC argues that the trial court abused its discretion when it orally issued a protective order in favor of SI. The order prevented SROC from copying \u201cvector scan\u201d work which SI had allegedly done for SROC. The court entered the order because counsel for SROC had earlier misrepresented to the court that it had been granted relief from the Pretrial Order. The court later commented on its decision when it denied a motion to reconsider the protective order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-9\">MR. BERRY [counsel for SI]: Yes, your Honor. If you will recall, your Honor, there was a problem with the representation made about an order that the Court made. When you came from your chambers\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-10\">THE COURT: A lawyer from St. Louis that flat either lied to me or hadn\u2019t done his homework. Yes, I remember it very well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-11\">MR. BERRY: And when you came from your chambers, your Honor, you said\u2014 THE COURT: I said whatever other motions you have got, I\u2019m going to hold adversely to his position just as sort of a penalty for misleading or attempting to mislead the Court. Yes, that lawyer just flat misstated what the court had ordered in a prior [ruling].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-12\">Record, supp. vol. 8, at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-13\">The record indicates that the court did not carefully weigh the severity of the penalty imposed by the sanction against the harm produced by the misstatement of SROC\u2019s counsel. Sanctions under Rule 16(f) or preexisting common law should be entered only after a careful consideration of both the misleading activity by counsel and the severity of the punishment imposed by the sanctions. <em>See Joplin v. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., </em>671 F.2d 1274, 1276 (10th Cir.1982) (dismissal for failure to file pretrial statement). Moreover, a court should, when possible, enter sanctions against counsel, and not the parties they represent. <em>See Herzfeld &amp; Stern v. Blair, </em>769 F.2d 645, 647 (10th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Despite the court\u2019s apparent failure to employ a balancing test, we do not believe its decision to prohibit SROC from copying the \u201cvector scan\u201d documents is reversible error. SROC had the opportunity to inspect the documents and subpoena them for trial. Indeed, SI made the \u201cvector scan\u201d documents available for inspection. <em>See </em>Record, vol. 1, at 59. Because SROC had access to these documents, the trial court\u2019s sanctions, though not carefully weighed at the time they were imposed, constitute harmless error. <em>See </em>Fed.R. Civ.P. 61; <em>Nulf v. International Paper Co., </em>656 F.2d 553, 561 (10th Cir.1981) (\u201cErrors which could not have prejudiced the unsuccessful party afford no right of reversal of the judgment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"A5n\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"ApR\">Finally, SROC argues that a directed verdict should have been granted in its favor. Applying our stringent standard for granting such a motion, we are unable to say \u2014 after viewing all the evidence in the light most favorable to SI, the nonmoving party \u2014 that the case should have been removed from the jury in this strongly contested trial. <em>See Sharon Steel Corp. v. Lakeshore, Inc., </em>753 F.2d 851, 853-54 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Prudential Federal Savings and Loan Association v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 312, 88 L.Ed.2d 289 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">In its appeal, SI argues that the trial court erred in refusing to order SROC to convey certain overriding royalty interests to the estate of Stanley D. Brasel. Si\u2019s claim is based on the judgment of the jury in favor of SI for the full amount claimed on the Northwest Oklahoma contract. That contract was accompanied by an \u201cAgreement of Contract and Services,\u201d which stated that SROC would convey the royalty interests directly to Mr. Brasel. Record, vol. 6, plaintiff\u2019s exhibit 2. Although SI prevailed on its contract claim, the trial court denied Si\u2019s request for specific performance of the agreement to convey those interests to the estate of Mr. Brasel. This denial was based on the trial court\u2019s apparent judgment that Mr. Brasel was a party to the contract and that his estate thus had to bring suit directly to receive payment of the royalty interests. <em>See </em>Record, supp. vol. 9, at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-13\">We reject the trial court\u2019s position. Because we have the contract before us, we are not limited to reviewing under the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard the trial court\u2019s apparent determination that Mr. Brasel was a party to the contract. <em>See Southwestern Stationery &amp; Bank v. Harris Corp., </em>624 F.2d 168,170 (10th Cir.1980). The document indicates that, although Mr. Brasel signed the \u201cAgreement of Contract and Services,\u201d he did so in the space designated for the representative of SI (just as SROC\u2019s representative signed in the corresponding space designated for SROC). No other individual signed for SI. <em>See </em>Record, vol. 6, plaintiff\u2019s exhibit 2. Indeed, the document\u2019s title indicates Mr. Brasel's representative capacity. It reads, \u201cAgreement of Contract and Services by Stan D. Brasel, Consultant &amp; President of Seismic International Research Corp.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because Mr. Brasel signed the contract in his representative capacity, SI could properly bring suit directly for the estate of Mr. Brasel as a third-party beneficiary.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We see no reason that his estate had to be joined directly as a party in order to receive relief. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 17(a); <em>Prudential Oil &amp; Minerals Co. v. Hamlin, </em>277 F.2d 384, 387 (10th Cir.1960); <em>cf.P&amp;M Vending Co. v. Half Shell of Boston, Inc., </em>41 Colo.App. 78, 81, 579 P.2d 93, 95 (1978) (\u201c[E]ven if the contract involved here was entered into for the benefit of plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>parent corporation, plaintiff was a real party in interest entitled to bring the action without joining its parent corporation.\u201d). Therefore, we hold the trial court erred in failing to grant Si\u2019s equitable claim seeking specific performance of SROC\u2019s agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">SI also seeks an award of attorney\u2019s fees under Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 13-17-101 to -102 (Cum.Supp.1985), which provides for such an award against a litigant whose claims are frivolous or groundless. First, SI charges that SROC\u2019s claim of fraudulent inducement warrants an attorney\u2019s fee award. SROC, however, dropped this claim before trial when discovery produced a document that apparently affected SROC\u2019s view of this issue. <em>See </em>Record, vol. 4, at 873. We hold that this claim was voluntarily dismissed within a reasonable time after discovery of the document; thus Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 13-17-102(5) (Cum.Supp. 1985) precludes an attorney\u2019s fee award based on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Second, SI argues that SROC brought frivolous or groundless claims when it joined Mr. Brasel and when it alleged that SI and Mr. Brasel breached their fiduciary duties. SI, however, falls far short of demonstrating that these claims were \u201cnot supported by any credible evidence at trial,\u201d or that there was \u201cno rational argument based on the evidence or law\u201d to support these claims. <em>Western United Realty, Inc. v. Isaacs, </em>679 P.2d 1063, 1069 (Colo.1984) (en banc). We are not persuaded by mere assertions in Si\u2019s brief that SROC exercised bad faith or that it made no attempt to determine the sufficiency of its evidence. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Brief at 18-19. SI makes no citation to the record regarding the absence of merit of SROC\u2019s claims against Mr. Brasel or of its breach-of-fiduciary-duty claim. <em>See id. </em>at 18-20. (SI does point out that SROC dropped its claims against Mr. Brasel after the evidence was presented at trial, <em>id. </em>at 18-19, but this fact does not prove that the claims were meritless: SROC may have dismissed its claims against Mr. Brasel for tactical reasons unrelated to the merits of the claims.) Thus, SI does not demonstrate that the trial court erred in denying attorney\u2019s fees on SROC\u2019s claim against Mr. Brasel and on its claims that SI and Mr. Brasel breached their fiduciary duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">Finally, SI asserts that SROC brought a groundless or frivolous claim when it charged that SI induced Mr. Stafford to breach his fiduciary duty by paying him $28,000. We reject this argument as patently flawed. Even though procedural errors of SROC\u2019s counsel kept SROC from pursuing this claim at trial, <em>see supra, </em>part I, the claim was supported by \u201ccredible evidence.\u201d <em>See Western United Realty, </em>679 P.2d at 1069-70. SI did not deny that it made an undisclosed $28,000 payment to Mr. Stafford when he was approving Si\u2019s contract work for SROC. Thus the claim was not frivolous or groundless.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b311-11\">. Counsel for SI confused the issue by misstating to the court that it had not alleged that it was bringing suit on behalf of the estate of Mr. Brasel. <em>See </em>Record, supp. vol. 9, at 6. SI, however, stated in its pleadings that it was suing \"to assign Stan Brasel, or his assigns, overriding interests in the leases\u201d that were the subject of the Northwest Oklahoma contract. <em>See </em>Record, vol. 1, at 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
