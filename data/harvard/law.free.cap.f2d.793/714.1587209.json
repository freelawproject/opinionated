Jones filed suit against her former employer, Flagship International (\u201cFlagship\u201d), under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000 et seq. (\u201cTitle VII\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(d) (the \u201cEqual Pay Act\u201d), and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Flagship hired Jones, a licensed attorney in Little Rock, Arkansas, on July 30, 1979, as the company\u2019s \u201cManager of Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Programs\u201d. Jones\u2019 principal duties were to investigate charges of discrimination brought against the company, to represent the company before state and federal administrative agencies, to \u201cconciliate\u201d such discrimination charges, and to prepare an affirmative action plan. Jones initial salary of $21,000 was increased to $22,050 in November, 1979; to $23,153 in June, 1980; and to $27,000 on August 29, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-18\">At Flagship, Jones was placed under the supervision of Jared Metze, the Vice-President in charge of Personnel. Jones testified at trial that Metze subjected her to sexual harassment throughout her tenure at Flagship. According to Jones, she had been with Flagship for six weeks when she, Metze, and others went on a business trip to Chicago. Although Metze sent the others home, he and Jones continued on business to Detroit before returning to Dallas. Jones testified that Metze had been driving her home from the airport when she expressed concerns about the security of the hotel in Chicago in which they had stayed. At this point, Metze replied that his wife did not know he was back in town, and offered to take Jones to a \u201creputable\u201d hotel in Dallas because she needed the \u201ccomfort of a man.\u201d Jones further testified that she had been so distressed by this incident that she left for Little Rock the next day, remained there for two weeks, and returned only upon Metze\u2019s promise that such an incident would not recur.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-19\">Jones then testified as to two further occurrences several months later. According to Jones, Metze propositioned her during a trip to San Francisco, and, during a trip to Denver, told her that she was \u201coff the hook\u201d because of a friend\u2019s interest in her. Jones stated that she rebuffed these as well as numerous other advances. Metze denied making any advances toward Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-20\">A final \u201csex-related\u201d incident occurred during Flagship\u2019s headquarters office Christmas party in December, 1981. On that occasion Kurt Elmer, the company\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>Executive Chef and Vice-President, created figures of bare-breasted mermaids as table decorations. After receiving several complaints from female employees, Jones asked Metze whether a complaint should be made to Elmer. Metze proposed that Jones prepare a memo on the matter in order to avoid upsetting Elmer at the party. Jones later wrote such a memo, expressing the distaste of female employees for the figures, and received in reply a short polemic from an obviously unrepentent Elmer.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">In addition to sexual harassment, Jones testified that she had been discriminated against in terms of pay and promotion while at Flagship. According to Jones, she made several complaints to Metze and Joseph Primavera, the company\u2019s Assistant Vice-President of Employee Relations and another of Jones\u2019 supervisors, concerning her pay since the spring of 1980. Jones testified that her grievances were ignored.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">Jones mentioned her complaints to Peter Vygantas, the company\u2019s Senior Vice-President for Administration, during a meeting on January 27, 1982. Jones stated that during the course of the discussion Vygan-tas asked for a dollar amount of Jones\u2019 claims. Jones testified that, in order to get the necessary information for Vygantas, she had to derive salary data from the salary record cards of Metze and Catherine Sharp, her immediate predecessor; this, in turn, required Jones to copy data from their personnel files. Jones further testified that she continued to discuss her complaints, including sexual harassment, in subsequent meetings with Vygantas and Metze.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-10\">On February 3, 1982, Jones filed a charge with the EEOC, claiming discrimination in pay and sexual harassment. On February 11, Metze and Vygantas learned of the charge; the latter suspended Jones with pay on the following day. Vygantas testified that the action was necessary because of the conflict of interest created by Jones\u2019 position with the company. Shortly after Jones\u2019 suspension, Barbara McCaf-frey, Metze\u2019s secretary, told Metze that she had seen copies of his personnel file in Jones\u2019 home. Metze informed Vygantas of this information, as well as information that Jones had solicited Dorothy Smith, another female employee, to file a charge of sex discrimination against the company. Vygantas also testified that he had learned from a security investigation interview conducted on March 22, 1986, that Jones had \u201cinvited\u201d Patricia Love, another female employee, to \u201cparticipate\u201d in an action against the company during the course of numerous meetings between Jones and Love in January, 1982.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-11\">As a result of this information, Vygantas terminated Jones\u2019 employment on April 15, 1982. According to Vygantas, this action was necessary because of the \u201clack of confidence the company had in her because she clearly had a conflict of interest in performing her duties,\u201d Jones\u2019 misuse of company property, <em>i.e., </em>Metze\u2019s personnel file, in acquiring information concerning salaries, and Jones\u2019 attempt to encourage others to file charges against Flagship.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Jones then filed a second charge with the EEOC, charging unlawful retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>On October 1, 1982, Jones filed a \u201cclass action complaint\u201d which alleged numerous claims on behalf of blacks, women and herself, including claims of discrimination in terms of pay and promotion, sexual harassment and retaliation. During the class certification proceedings, Flagship moved to dismiss the class allegations of Jones\u2019 complaint. The district court disqualified Jones as a class representative on the basis of <em>Doe v. A. Corp., </em>709 F.2d 1043, 1047-48 (5th Cir.1983) (holding that a corporation\u2019s former house counsel who had rendered legal advice concerning employee benefits to the corporation prior to his resignation was barred by his ethical obligations as a lawyer from prosecuting, as a class representative of other employees, benefits allegedly due under the corporation\u2019s pension and life insurance plans); on November 8, 1983, the court dismissed Jones\u2019 class allegations from the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">On January 11, 1984, Jones sought to amend her complaint to include additional defendants, to plead state law claims for invasion of privacy, defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and to add other federal claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1985, 1986. By order dated February 1, 1984, the district court denied Jones\u2019 leave to amend. Following trial, which commenced on March 12, 1984, and concluded on March 15, 1984, the district court, in its Memorandum of Decision and Judgment, dated January 24, 1985, entered judgment for Flagship. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">THE NATURE OF JONES\u2019 CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">Jones\u2019 claims at trial were grounded on racial and sexual discrimination. The district court found that there was \u201cnot the slightest hint that race was even a factor in any of Flagship\u2019s employment decisions regarding Jones.\u201d It is well established that such a finding is final unless clearly erroneous. F.R.Civ.P. 52(a). A finding is not clearly erroneous unless \u201cthe reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, N.C., </em>470 U.S. 564, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1511, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985) (quoting <em>United States v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 394-95, 68 S.Ct. 525, 541, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948)). By contrast, a district court\u2019s legal conclusion is subject to an appellate court\u2019s plenary review.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-10\">Jones has abandoned her race discrimination claims, and, on appeal, argues that the district court erred in failing to find sex-based discrimination in terms of pay and promotion, sexual harassment and retaliation. Jones also claims that the court abused its discretion in denying her leave to amend her complaint. Finally, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d), as <em>amicus curiae, </em>contends that the court erred in not finding retaliation on Flagship\u2019s part.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-11\">Most of Jones\u2019 complaints fall under Title VII. It is well settled that in a suit arising under Title VII the ultimate burden rests upon the plaintiff to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, unlawful discrimination.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-12\">First, the plaintiff has the burden of proving by the preponderance of the evidence a prima facie case of discrimina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>tion. Second, if the plaintiff succeeds in proving the prima facie case, the burden shifts to the defendant \u2018to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employee\u2019s rejection.\u2019 ... Third, should the defendant carry this burden, the plaintiff must then have an opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the legitimate reasons offered by the defendant were not its true reasons, but were a pre-text for discrimination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-5\"><em>Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 253-54, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 1093-94, 67 L.Ed.2d 207, 215 (1981) (citations omitted). <em>Accord, McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 804-05, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 1825, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">Because Jones\u2019 claims under Title VII allege \u201cdisparate treatment\u201d on the basis of sex, the \u201cfactual inquiry\u201d is \u201c[whether] the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff.\u201d <em>United States Postal Service Board of Governors v. Aikens, </em>460 U.S. 711, 715 (1983) (quoting <em>Burdine, </em>450 U.S. at 253, 101 S.Ct. 1093). \u201cIn other words, is \u2018the employer ... treating some people less favorably than others because of their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin\u2019.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Fumco Construction Corp. v. Waters, </em>438 U.S. 567, 577, 98 S.Ct. 2943, 2949, 57 L.Ed.2d 952 (1975)). With the foregoing standards and burdens in mind, we now turn to Jones\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">I. <em>Sexual Harassment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b797-10\">Sexual harassment is a form of employment discrimination prohibited by Title VII. <em>Simmons v. Lyons, </em>746 F.2d 265, 270 (5th Cir.1984). In determining that Jones failed to make out a claim of sexual harassment, the district court referred to the \u201chostile work environment\u201d and <em>\u201cquid pro quo </em>\u201d paradigms outlined in <em>Henson v. City of Dundee, </em>682 F.2d 897 (11th Cir. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-11\">a. <em>Hostile Work Environment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b797-12\">In order to establish a claim against an employer for a hostile work environment, the plaintiff must show the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-13\">(1) <em>The employee belongs to a protected group, i.e., </em>a simple stipulation that the employee is a man or a woman;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-14\">(2) <em>The employee was subject to unwelcome sexual harassment, i.e., </em>sexual advances, request for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature that is unwelcome in the sense that it is unsolicited or unincited and is undesirable or offensive to the employee;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-15\">(3) <em>The harassment complained of was based upon sex, i.e., </em>that but for the fact of her sex, the plaintiff would not have been the object of harassment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-16\">(4) <em>The harassment complained of affected a \u201cterm, condition or privilege of employment, </em>\u201d <em>i.e., </em>the sexual harassment must be sufficiently pervasive so as to al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>ter the conditions of employment and create an abusive working environment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-4\">(5) <em>Respondent superior, i.e., </em>that the employer knew or should have known of the harassment in question and failed to take prompt remedial action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 903-05.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">In concluding that Jones failed to establish a hostile work environment, the district court recounted Jones\u2019 testimony concerning her trips with Metze to Chicago and Denver and the Christmas party incident. The court found that the harassment complained of was insufficiently pervasive to alter a condition of Jones\u2019 employment and create an abusive working environment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court also noted that Jones failed to demonstrate that she had been adversely affected, and that she admitted to the absence of an adverse affect.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">Jones contends that the district court erred in two respects. First, Jones asserts that \u201ctangible job detriment\u201d or adverse employment effect is not necessary to establish a prima facie case of sexual harassment under Title VII. We agree. <em>See e.g., Henson, </em>682 F.2d at 901 (\u201cunder certain circumstances the creation of an offensive or hostile work environment due to sexual harassment can violate Title VII irrespective of whether the complainant suffers tangible job detriment\u201d); <em>Bundy v. Jackson, </em>641 F.2d 934, 943-44 (D.C.Cir. 1981) (that sexual harassment causing a hostile work environment is prohibited \u201cfollows ineluctably from numerous cases finding Title VII violations where an employer created or condoned a substantially [racially] discriminatory work <em>environment, </em>regardless of whether the complaining employees lost any tangible job benefits\u201d). <em>See generally, Rogers v. E.E.O.C., </em>454 F.2d 234, 238 (5th Cir.1971). The trial court\u2019s ruling, however, is not to the contrary. We conclude, as did the court below, that while an employee need not prove tangible job detriment to establish a sexual harassment claim, the absence of such detriment requires a commensurately higher showing that the sexually harassing conduct was pervasive and destructive of the working environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-11\">In <em>Rogers, supra, </em>this court held that the state of psychological well-being is a term, condition, or privilege of employment within the meaning of Title VII: \u201cOne can readily envision working environments so heavily polluted with discrimination as to destroy completely the emotional and psychological stability of minority group workers.\u201d 454 F.2d at 238. However, the \u201cmere utterance of an ethnic or racial epithet which engenders offensive feelings in an employee\u201d does not affect the terms co\u00f1ditions, or privileges of employment to a sufficiently significant degree to violate Title VII. <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhether sexual harassment at a workplace is sufficiently severe and persistent to affect seriously the psychological well-being of an employee is a question to be determined with regard to the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Henson, </em>682 F.2d at 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-12\">Jones argues that the district court\u2019s ruling, by reciting only three sex-related incidents, understates the pervasiveness of the sexual harassment she experienced at Flagship. According to Jones, the number of \u201csexually harassing\u201d incidents reported establishes a sexually abusive and hostile working environment. Although we agree that the district court\u2019s ruling fails to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>count in detail all of the incidents reported by Jones, we do not disagree with the court\u2019s conclusion that the conduct complained of was not sufficiently pervasive to constitute a hostile work environment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Jones argues, alternatively, that she did suffer adverse employment action and that the court\u2019s ruling to the contrary is clearly erroneous. Jones\u2019 claim is based on the following: (i) that the incident following her trip with Metze to Chicago resulted in severe distress; (ii) that she was adversely affected in terms of pay and promotion; (iii) that Metze increased her responsibilities when she complained; (iv) that Metze fabricated rumors about her; and (v) that the district court erred in finding that she had admitted to not being adversely affected. We find Jones\u2019 points unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">(1) <em>The Trip to Chicago. </em>It appears that Jones confuses tangible job detriment with distress or psychological harm, an intangible detriment. Moreover, assuming that Metze\u2019s proposition caused Jones to return to Little Rock, Arkansas, we cannot discern from the record that this incident caused a tangible job detriment to Jones. On the contrary, Jones\u2019 testimony on this point reveals no adverse employment effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">(2) <em>Pay and Promotion. </em>While an adverse employment decision in this regard would certainly amount to a tangible job detriment, the record is barren of any indication that Jones\u2019 complaints of sexual harassment were related to her equal pay and promotion complaints. This court cannot infer such a relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">(3) <em>Increased Responsibilities. </em>Although Jones claims that Metze increased her responsibilities after she complained of sexually harassing conduct, and refers this court to exhibits indicating those responsibilities, neither the exhibits nor the testimony in the record establish that Jones\u2019 responsibilities increased unduly in relation to her position at Flagship, or otherwise resulted from her sexual harassment complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-11\">(4) <em>Rumors. </em>Jones\u2019 contention that Metze fabricated rumors about her throughout the company is without support. Metze\u2019s cross-examination testimony reveals that he listened to, and, at most, participated in company gossip about Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-12\">(5) <em>Jones\u2019 Admission. </em>According to Jones, her \u201cadmission\u201d to not being adversely affected by the sexually harassing conduct was included in a \u201cfabricated\u201d report prepared by security personnel in connection with a \u201cretaliatory investigation\u201d conducted for the purpose of finding an \u201costensible\u201d reason for terminating her employment at Flagship. While Jones\u2019 assertion may be credible, the trial court found to the contrary. We cannot say.that this determination is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-13\">b. <em>Quid Pro Quo</em></p>\n<p id=\"b799-14\">An employer may not require sexual consideration from an employee as a <em>quid pro quo </em>for job benefits. <em>Henson, </em>682 F.2d at 908. In <em>Henson </em>the court summarized the prima facie elements of a <em>quid pro quo </em>claim under Title VII.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-15\">In order to establish a violation of Title VII on grounds of sexual harassment of this kind, an employee must prove a number of elements, many of which are similar to the proof required to establish the existence of a hostile or offensive work environment:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-16\">(1) <em>The employee belongs to a protected group.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-17\">(2) <em>The employee was subject to unwelcome sexual harassment.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-18\">(3) <em>The harassment complained of was based upon sex.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>(4) <em>The employee\u2019s reaction to harassment complained of affected tangible aspects of the employee\u2019s compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment. The acceptance or rejection of the harassment by an employee must be an express or implied condition to the receipt of a job benefit or the cause of a tangible job detriment in order to create liability under this theory of sexual harassment. </em>As in the typical disparate treatment case, the employee must prove that she was deprived of a job benefit which she was otherwise qualified to receive because of the employer\u2019s use of a prohibited criterion in making the employment decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-4\">(5) <em>Respondeat superior.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 909 (emphasis added) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">As discussed above, Jones failed to demonstrate that the incidents of which she complained resulted in a tangible job detriment. Similarly, the record fails to establish that Jones was required to accept sexual harassment as a condition to the receipt of a job benefit. The district court\u2019s finding that Jones failed to make out a <em>quid pro quo </em>claim for sexual harassment under Title VII is not in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">We, therefore, affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling that Jones failed to establish her claim for sexual harassment under Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">II. <em>Jones\u2019 Pay and Promotion Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"A5m\">a. <em>Equal Pay</em></p>\n<p id=\"b800-9\">Jones asserts that Flagship discriminated against her in pay under both the Equal Pay Act and Title VII. The former statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-10\">No employer having employees subject to any provisions of this section shall discriminate, within any establishment in which such employees are employed, between employees on the basis of sex <em>by paying wages to employees in such establishment at a rate less than the rate at which he pays wages to employees of the opposite sex in such establishment for equal work </em>on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions, except where such payment is made pursuant to (i) a seniority system; (ii) a merit system; (iii) a system which measures earnings by quantity or quality of production; or (iv) a differential based on any other factor other than sex____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-15\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(d)(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-16\">Unlike Title VII, the burden of persuasion may shift from the plaintiff to the defendant in a suit under the Equal Pay Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-17\">The plaintiff\u2019s having made out a <em>prima facie </em>case has different ramifications under the Equal Pay Act than it has under Title VII. Under the Equal Pay Act, the plaintiff has the burden of proof to \u201cshow that an employer pays different wages to employees of opposite sexes \u2018for equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Corning Glass Works v. Brennan, </em>417 U.S. 188, 195, 94 S.Ct. 2223, 2228, 41 L.Ed.2d 1, 10 (1974). If the plaintiff meets this burden, the burden of proof \u201cshifts to the employer to show that the differential is justified under one of the Act\u2019s four exceptions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 196, 94 S.Ct. at 2229, 41 L.Ed.2d at 11. The exceptions are affirmative defenses on which the employer has the burden both of production and of persuasion. <em>Id. </em>at 197, 94 S.Ct. at 2229, 41 L.Ed.2d at 11. In other words, the burden shifts to the employer once a plaintiff shows that she was paid less than a male who was performing substantially the same job.</p>\n<p id=\"AQok\"><em>Plemer v. Parsons-Gilbane, </em>713 F.2d 1127, 1136 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-18\">Thus, in order to establish a claim under the Equal Pay Act, the plaintiff must show (1) that her employer is subject to the Act; (2) that she performed work in a position requiring equal skill, effort and responsibility under similar working conditions; and (3) that she was paid less than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>members of the opposite sex. To establish \u201cequal work\u201d, the plaintiff need only prove that the \u201cskill, effort and responsibility\u201d required in the performance of the jobs is \u201csubstantially equal.\u201d <em>Pearce v. Witchita County, City of Witchita Falls, Texas Hospital Bd., </em>590 F.2d 128, 133 (5th Cir. 1979). The Act necessarily requires a plaintiff to compare her skill, effort, responsibility and salary with a person who is or was similarly situated.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Jones based her pay complaints at trial on salary comparisons with four male employees whom she regarded as having comparable qualifications and responsibilities: Jared Metze, Ken Diebold, Jim Lawther and Joseph Primavera.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\"><em>Metze. </em>Jones compared her position to Metze\u2019s when the latter was \u201cManager of Personnel Relations\u201d from April, 1972, to July, 1974. Metze\u2019s employee record card reveals that he earned $271.16 per week at his hire and $380.80 per week when promoted to Director of Public Affairs. Jones, meanwhile, earned $403.85 per week when hired in 1979. Thus, <em>assuming </em>that Metze\u2019s job was substantially similar to Jones\u2019 job as EEO Manager, the district court correctly concluded that Jones failed to establish that she earned less than Metze for equal work.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\"><em>Diebold. </em>Jones did not introduce Die-bold\u2019s employee record card at trial. Consequently, even if the jobs of Jones and Diebold were substantially similar, Jones failed to show that she earned less than Diebold.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\"><em>Lawther. </em>Flagship hired Lawther as \u201cSpecialist in Employee Relations\u201d three months before Jones joined the company. Lawther and Jones both started at $403.85 per week. Beginning in December, 1980, Lawther earned $20 per week more than Jones following his promotion to \u201cManager of Union Contract Administration.\u201d Lawther, who had been a high school teacher for 12 years, and a teachers\u2019 union representative for two years prior to his hire, was involved in collective bargaining negotiations and affirmative action programs at 46 locations. Based on our review of the record, we cannot disagree with the district court\u2019s finding that Jones and Lawther did not engage in jobs requiring \u201csubstantially equal skill, effort and responsibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b801-13\"><em>Primavera. </em>Jones testified that she had comparable qualifications to Primavera, one of her supervisors. However, as Jones\u2019 testimony demonstrates, Primav-era\u2019s supervisory duties differed from Jones\u2019 EEO duties for the company. Although the court below did not address Jones\u2019 comparison with Primavera, we find that Jones and Primavera did not engage in substantially similar jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-14\">In regard to her equal pay claim under Title VII, Jones was required to show that Flagship intentionally discriminated against her on the basis of her sex.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Jones first testified that the company refused to evaluate her job performance in accordance with company policy \u2014 evaluations, according to Jones, which would have resulted in a salary raise. Flagship, on the other hand, offered evidence to show that Jones\u2019 evaluation for 1981 was postponed due to Jones\u2019 two-month absence for sick leave. Metze testified that he delayed the process in order to help Jones obtain a positive evaluation. We cannot say, based on the record before us, that Flagship\u2019s failure to evaluate Jones in 1981 constituted discrimination in pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>Jones also testified that Flagship paid its employees at the \u201cprevailing market rate\u201d and that she earned less than that \u201crate.\u201d However, as the district court held, there is no requirement that an employer pay its employees at market rate. We must, therefore, affirm the district court\u2019s ruling that Jones failed to establish a discrimination in pay claim under either the Equal Pay Act or Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">b. <em>Failure to Promote</em></p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">In a suit alleging sex discrimination in an employer\u2019s failure to hire or promote, the plaintiff must prove the following to establish a prima facie case: (1) that she was a member of a protected group; (2) that she applied for a position for which she was qualified; (3) that she was rejected; and (4) that after she was rejected, the employer promoted, hired, or continued to seek a member of the opposite sex for the job. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 187, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973); <em>Uveida v. Steves Sash &amp; Door Co., </em>738 F.2d 1425, 1428 (5th Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 791, 88 L.Ed.2d 769 (1986). <em>Plemer, </em>713 F.2d at 1135. Where the plaintiff claims discrimination in promotion on the basis that jobs for which she was qualified were never posted or otherwise opened for formal applications, she must establish that the company had some reason or duty to consider her for the post. <em>Carmichael v. Birmingham Saw Works, </em>738 F.2d 1126, 1133 (11th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">The district court found that Jones did not submit any evidence that she applied for a position for which she was qualified and rejected, and which was later filled by a male employee. Our review of the record, moreover, discloses no evidence that Flagship had a duty or a legitimate reason to consider Jones for another position within the company. Consequently, we affirm the district court\u2019s ruling that Jones failed to make out a discrimination in promotion claim under Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-13\">III. <em>Retaliation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b802-14\">Jones and the EEOC argue that the district court erred in concluding that Jones had failed to make out a prima facie case of retaliation under \u00a7 704(a) of Title VII.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> A plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of retaliation by showing (1) that she engaged in activity protected by Title VII; (2) that an adverse employment action occurred; and (3) that there was a causal connection between the participation in the protected activity and the adverse employment decision. <em>Irby v. Sullivan, </em>737 F.2d 1418, 1426 (5th Cir.1984); <em>McMillan v. Rust College, Inc., </em>710 F.2d 1112,1116 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-15\">The district court found that \u201cJones was clearly engaging in protected activity when she filed a charge of discrimination with the EEOC [and that] [h]er subsequent suspension and termination were adverse employment actions.\u201d The court further found, however, that Flagship\u2019s actions were taken, in part, as a result of Jones\u2019 solicitation of Patricia Love, a female coworker:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-16\">\u201cthe evidence did establish that Jones gave aid and comfort, if not outright encouragement, to Pat Love to pursue her grievances against the company, at a time when Jones\u2019 duty was to discourage and defend such claims____ The court is persuaded, therefore, that Flagship had reasonable grounds, or in good faith thought it did ... for suspending and later terminating Jones.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHY\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>The court ruled that, as a consequence, Jones failed to establish the causation link between the charges and Flagship\u2019s actions, <em>\u201ci.e., </em>that absent retaliation her employment would have continued.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">We conclude that Jones did meet her prima facie burden of showing that \u201cbut for\u201d her filing of charges with the EEOC she would not have been suspended and terminated of her employment. We conclude, however, under the McDonnell\u2014 <em>Burdine </em>allocation of burdens and order of presentation of proof in a Title VII case, that Flagship presented evidence sufficient to rebut Jones\u2019 prima facie case and to support the district court\u2019s conclusion that Flagship did not engage in unlawful retaliation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">Jones and the EEOC maintain that Flagship\u2019s suspension and subsequent termination of Jones\u2019 employment were based solely on Jones\u2019 action in filing discrimination charges with the EEOC. Jones and the EEOC point out that, since Flagship was unaware of any communication between Jones and Love at the time of Jones\u2019 suspension, the district court\u2019s conclusion, <em>viz., </em>that Flagship had \u201creasonable grounds, or in good faith thought it did ... for suspending and later terminating Jones,\u201d is erroneous. While it is true that the court stated that Jones\u2019 suspension and termination were adverse employment actions, a review of the court\u2019s ruling reveals that it treated Flagship\u2019s conduct on the whole as a single adverse action. However, even if Jones\u2019 suspension is viewed as a <em>separate, </em>single adverse employment decision, as Jones and the EEOC urge, it does not follow that Flagship\u2019s action constituted unlawful retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-11\">The district court found that Jones was suspended \u201cto avoid the conflict of interest inherent in Jones\u2019 representation of Flagship before the agency to whom she had made a complaint.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The EEOC contends that, notwithstanding the conflict of interest created, \u00a7 704(a) applies with equal force in protecting an employee charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>with EEO responsibilities from retaliatory conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">We are well aware that the provisions of Title VII must be construed broadly in order to give effect to Congress\u2019 intent in eliminating invidious employment practices. <em>See generally Pettway v. American Cast Iron Pipe Co., </em>411 F.2d 998, 1004-07 (5th Cir.1969). Moreover, since the enforcement of Title VII rights necessarily depends on the ability of individuals to present their grievances without the threat of retaliatory conduct by their employers, rigid enforcement of \u00a7 704(a) is required. <em>Pettway, </em>411 F.2d at 1007. <em>EEOC v. Kallir, Phillips, Ross, </em>401 F.Supp. 66, 72 (S.D.N.Y.1975), aff'<em>d, </em>559 F.2d 1203 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 920, 98 S.Ct. 395, 54 L.Ed.2d 277 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">In assuming her position as Flagship\u2019s Manager of EEO Programs, Jones neither abandoned her right to be free from discriminatory practices nor excluded herself from the protections of \u00a7 704(a). In filing a charge against Flagship on the ground that the company had discriminated against her in terms of pay and sexual harassment, Jones was exercising a protected right under Title VII, as the district court found. <em>Pettway, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">However, we are also well aware that, although eliminating discriminatory employment practices is the goal of Title VII, cooperation and voluntary compliance are the preferred methods of promoting that goal. <em>See generally, Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., </em>415 U.S. 36, 44, 94 S.Ct. 1011, 1017, 39 L.Ed.2d 147 (1974). An employer has a strong interest in having an opportunity to settle equal employment disputes through conference, conciliation and persuasion before an aggrieved employee resorts to a lawsuit. In <em>St. John v. Employment Development Dept., </em>642 F.2d 273 (9th Cir.1981), the court noted that a conflict of interest created by an EEO employee\u2019s filing of charges with the EEOC could justify adverse employer action: \u201cIt may be that the fundamental policies of Title VII require that voluntary compliance be encouraged by allowing am employer\u2019s transfer of a complaining employee to a position without EEOC contact, but otherwise equivalent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 275.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">In the instant case Vygantas, the Flagship officer responsible for Jones\u2019 suspension and discharge, testified that he suspended Jones with pay pending reassignment and an investigation of her claims. The EEOC notes that, unlike the situation contemplated in <em>St. John, </em>Jones was never reassigned and was barred from Flagship\u2019s premises and educational seminar functions. Jones and the EEOC contend that Flagship\u2019s conduct following Jones\u2019 claims against the company, indicate that Flagship\u2019s sole intention was to fire Jones for exercising her rights under Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-10\">We need not address ourselves to the extent to which an employer may act in relieving an employee of her EEO duties without running afoul of \u00a7 704(a), or to whether Flagship\u2019s response, if based on Jones\u2019 filing of charges <em>alone, </em>was sufficiently excessive to constitute unlawful retaliation. The record establishes that Jones\u2019 filing of charges with the EEOC was not the <em>sole </em>reason for Flagship\u2019s action at the time of suspension. Vygantas testified that he suspended Jones with pay not only for the conflict of interest stemming from her position as an EEO officer, but for Jones\u2019 plan to initiate a class action suit against the company.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>Although we realize that the district court did not identify in its ruling Jones\u2019 conduct in this regard as a separate basis to justify Flagship\u2019s action, a review of the entire record leaves no doubt that the court considered the evidence of Jones\u2019 solicitation of Pat Love against the background of Jones\u2019 attempt to file a class action suit. Flagship\u2019s belief of Jones\u2019 plan to file a class action claim on the date of her suspension, and its subsequent belief of Jones\u2019 attempt to solicit others, including Pat Love, to sue or to join Jones in suing the company, will be discussed jointly.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\">Jones and the EEOC argue that the district court never found that Jones actually solicited Love, but merely that Jones \u201cgave aid and comfort, if not outright encouragement, to Pat Love to pursue her grievances against the company at a time when Jones\u2019 duty was to discourage and defend such claims____\u201d Jones and the EEOC maintain that a company\u2019s EEO officer has no duty to discourage discrimination claims, and, moreover, is expected to give aggrieved employees \u201caid and comfort\u201d as a means of conciliating discrimination disputes. While we do not take issue with Jones\u2019 conciliatory role, we view this contention as one taken out of context. It is clear from the lower court\u2019s decision, when read on the whole, that the court was referring to solicitation in the form of aid and comfort and encouragement. We will not quibble with the district court\u2019s choice of words where the meaning is apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-15\">The EEOC next argues that Jones\u2019 \u201caid and comfort\u201d of Love constituted lawful opposition to a \u201cpractice made an unlawful employment practice by [\u00a7 704(a) ].\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). We agree that employee opposition to discriminatory employment practices directed against a fellow employee may constitute activity protected under \u00a7 704(a). In <em>Berg v. LaCrosse Cooler Co., </em>612 F.2d 1041 (7th Cir.1980) the court held that it is a violation of \u00a7 704(a) to fire an employee because he opposed discrimination against a fellow employee, even if he was mistaken and there was no discrimination. <em>See also, Rucker v. Higher Educational Aids Bd., </em>669 F.2d 1179, 1182 (7th Cir.1982) (holding that it is unlawful to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>retaliate against an individual who opposed discrimination against a co-worker).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">However, unlike the employees in <em>Berg </em>and <em>Rucker, </em>Jones was an employee charged with representing her company on equal employment matters. As the EEOC concedes, some conduct, even if in sincere opposition to unlawful employment practices under Title VII, may be so disruptive or inappropriate as to fall outside the protections of \u00a7 704(a). \u201cThere may arise instances where the employee\u2019s conduct in protest of an unlawful employment practice so interferes with the performance of his job that it renders him ineffective in the position for which he was employed. In such a case, his conduct, or form of opposition, is not covered by \u00a7 704(a).\u201d <em>Rosser v. Laborers\u2019 International Union, Local 438, </em>616 F.2d 221, 223 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 886, 101 S.Ct. 241, 66 L.Ed.2d 112 (1980). In determining whether particular conduct constitutes activity protected under \u00a7 704(a), this circuit has required a balancing test: \u201c[T]he courts have required that the employee conduct be reasonable in light of the circumstances, and have held that \u2018the employer\u2019s right to run his business must be balanced against the rights of the employee to express his grievances and promote his own welfare\u2019.\u201d <em>Jeffries v. Harris County Community Action Assoc. </em>615 F.2d 1025, 1036 (5th Cir. 1980) (quoting <em>Hochstadt v. Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology, </em>545 F.2d 222, 223 (1st Cir.1976)). <em>Accord, Payne v. McLemore\u2019s Wholesale &amp; Retail Stores, </em>654 F.2d 1130 (5th Cir. 1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 1000, 102 S.Ct. 1630, 71 L.Ed.2d 866 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">The EEOC maintains that Jones\u2019 dealings with Love did not harm Flagship. We disagree. As Flagship\u2019s Manager of EEO Programs, Jones necessarily played a crucial role in equal employment matters involving the company. Jones knew of Flagship\u2019s position in discrimination cases filed against the company and acted as its representative before administrative agencies, including the EEOC. The need to settle discrimination claims through the process of cooperation and conciliation necessarily required Flagship to repose great confidence in its EEO personnel, in general, and Jones, in particular.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">Jones\u2019 action in (1) filing a discrimination suit against Flagship, (2) suggesting that a class action suit would follow, and (3) soliciting or inviting others to sue or join in a suit against the company not only rendered Jones ineffective in the position for which she was employed, but critically harmed Flagship\u2019s posture in the defense of discrimination suits brought against the company. Moreover, Jones\u2019 right to express her grievances and promote her own welfare did not depend on others joining in her suit. We conclude, therefore, that under the aforementioned \u201cbalancing test\u201d Jones\u2019 conduct in soliciting or inviting others to join in her discrimination claim,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> coupled with her expressed intent to serve at the vanguard of a class action suit, was not protected under \u00a7 704(a) and provided Flagship with a nondiscriminatory basis upon which to suspend and discharge Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-9\">Flagship, having met its burden of production by providing a legitimate, nondiscriminatory basis for its action, rebutted Jones\u2019 prima facie case and shifted the burden of persuasion to Jones to show that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated Flagship, or that Flagship\u2019s \u201cproffered explanation is unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Burdine, </em>450 U.S. at 256, 101 S.Ct. at 1095. <em>McMillan, </em>710 F.2d at 1116. The EEOC contends that the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>failed to assess whether the company\u2019s reasons were pretexts for discrimination. Specifically, the EEOC asserts that Flagship\u2019s investigation was conducted to uncover inculpatory evidence upon which to discharge Jones. According to the EEOC, the district court\u2019s finding that two of Flagship\u2019s proffered reasons \u2014 Jones\u2019 solicitation of Dorothy Smith and Jones\u2019 unauthorized use of Metze\u2019s personnel file\u2014 were not supported by the record, and Love\u2019s \u201cconfused\u201d testimony, demonstrate the absence of any non-retaliatory motive.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">The EEOC\u2019s point misses the mark. As discussed above, the court below was entitled to credit Love\u2019s testimony as supporting Flagship\u2019s position that Jones had engaged in solicitation, which, if true, would have jeopardized the company\u2019s posture with respect to defending discrimination claims. Moreover, Flagship need not have been correct in its basis for suspending and discharging Jones to show that its actions were motivated for non-retaliatory reasons. <em>See, e.g., De Anda v. St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital, </em>671 F.2d 850, 854, n. 6 (5th Cir.1982) (\u201cWhether St. Joseph was wrong in its determination that she should have checked is irrelevant, as long as its belief, though erroneous, was the basis for the termination\u201d); <em>Dickerson v. Metropolitan Dade County, </em>659 F.2d 574, 581 (5th Cir.1981) (Unit B) (\u201cEven if DERM were wrong in its evaluation of the seriousness of the injury and the justifiability of the absences, it did not violate Title VII if it acted on the reasonable belief about the absences\u201d). <em>Accord Jeffries, supra. </em>It is sufficient, as the district court held, that \u201cFlagship had reasonable grounds, or in good faith though it did,\u201d for its suspension and termination of Jones\u2019 employment.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">We hold that, although Jones did establish a prima facie case of unlawful retaliation under \u00a7 704(a), <em>i.e., </em>that but for her filing of charges with the EEOC she would not have been suspended and fired, Flagship presented sufficient, credible evidence to show that its actions were motivated by non-retaliatory reasons, and therefore, to rebut Jones\u2019 case. We hold, furthermore, that Jones failed to show that Flagship\u2019s reasons were a pretext for discrimination. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s ruling that Jones failed to establish that Flagship engaged in unlawful retaliation under \u00a7 704(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">IV. <em>Jones\u2019 Additional Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b807-10\">Jones complains that the district court abused its discretion in denying her leave to amend her complaint 15 months after commencement of this case. Such a ruling is within the sound discretion of the trial court and, given the late date of Jones\u2019 motion, was not inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-11\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b807-12\">In sum, we conclude that Jones failed to show that the sexually harassing conduct complained of resulted in a tangible job detriment or affected a term, condition or privilege of employment to a degree sufficient to establish a sexually abusive or hostile work environment. We hold, therefore, that Jones failed to establish a prima facie case of sexual harassment under Title VII and affirm the district court\u2019s ruling in this respect. We also conclude that Jones failed to demonstrate (1) that she earned less than male employees for substantially equal work; (2) that Flagship intentionally discriminated against her in terms of pay; and (3) that Flagship either rejected her application for another position, or failed to advise her of an opening for which she was qualified. Accordingly, we hold and affirm the district court\u2019s ruling that Jones failed to establish disparate treatment in terms of pay and promotion under Title VII and the Equal Pay Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-13\">Finally, we conclude that, although Jones did establish a prima facie case of unlawful retaliation under \u00a7 704(a) of Title VII, un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>der the <em>McDonnell-Burdine </em>allocation of burdens and order of presentation of proof, Flagship sufficiently rebutted Jones\u2019 case by adducing evidence that it suspended and fired Jones for non-retaliatory reasons. Moreover, we find that Jones did not demonstrate that the reasons proffered by Flagship were pretexts for discrimination. We, therefore, hold that Jones failed to show that Flagship engaged in unlawful retaliation under Title VII, and affirm the district court\u2019s ruling in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b794-16\">. Jones\u2019 claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 is not before this court on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b795-7\">.

In a discharge letter to Jones, Vygantas summarized the basis of his action:</p>\n<p id=\"b795-9\">When commencing my investigation on the claim you had made, we learned that you had surreptitiously copied and taken home all or a part of a personnel file of Mr. J.R. Metze, your immediate supervisor. Further, we discovered that you had shown copies of a portion of the file to at least one employee at your home. When I asked you on February 18, about having Mr. Metze\u2019s file or a copy of thereof, you denied it. Yet, you later admitted to the Company\u2019s Security Representatives investigating your charges against Mr. Metze that you had reproduced his payroll records. As you know, Sky Chefs General Rules of Conduct state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-13\">27. The use of Company time, material or facilities for purposes not directly related to Company business, or the removal or borrowing of Company property without permission is prohibited.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b795-14\">Based on the above information, you have violated this rule. More importantly, your misconduct was a gross violation of the privacy of a co-employee. It is especially intolerable of a management employee such as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>yourself having for business purposes access to privileged information.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">In the course of the Company's inquiry, it was also found while in your job of Manager\u2014 EEO Programs, before you had filed a claim personally, you had solicited other Sky Chefs\u2019 employees to file charges of discrimination against the Company. Such actions on your part are wholly at odds with the responsibilities of your job. As an Attorney, I hope you can appreciate the conflict of interest inherent in soliciting claims against the very client you represent.</p>\n<p id=\"Ar5\">Your misconduct in secretly reproducing your supervisor\u2019s personnel records, coupled with your lack of honesty about the subject, and your attempts to initiate and encourage other charges against Sky Chefs has rendered you ineffective in your present job. Therefore, as previously communicated to your Attorney by Sky Chefs\u2019 Legal Counsel, your employment with Sky Chefs was terminated as of April 15, 1982....</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b797-7\">. In <em>Burdine </em>the Supreme Court stressed the importance of the prima facie case in Title VII actions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-8\">The burden of establishing a prima facie case of disparate treatment is not onerous [and] serves an important function in litigation: it eliminates the most common nondiscriminatory reasons for the plaintiffs rejection.

In contrast to the role of the \"prima facie case\" in the typical disparate treatment context,</p>\n<p id=\"ap8-dedup-0\">the case of sexual harassment that creates an offensive environment does not present a factual question of intentional discrimination which is at all elusive. Except in the exceedingly atypical case of a bisexual supervisor, it should be clear that sexual harassment is discrimination based upon sex. We therefore see no reason to suggest a specific prima facie case for the hostile environment claim. In trying these cases, the district courts should employ normal principles of pleading and proof allocation. These principles may, in some cases, dictate that the allocation scheme vary in the individual case because of superi- or knowledge on the part of one party or other similar factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 905, n. 11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b798-14\">. Implicit in the district court\u2019s conclusion is that Jones established the first three elements of the hostile work environment paradigm.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b799-9\">. Jones has argued that the district court failed to take into account sexually harassing incidents reported by other female employees. Such testimony, though relevant in a class action suit, does not bear on Jones\u2019 individual claim of sexual harassment in the absence of evidence that such incidents affected Jones\u2019 psychological well-being. We note, moreover, that the district court did not credit Jones\u2019 testimony regarding the three major sex-related incidents as factual findings. The court\u2019s ruling appears to recount these incidents only to show that, even if true, such \"harassment\u201d was insufficiently pervasive to constitute a violation of Title VII.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b801-9\">. Title VTI makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer \"to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin____\u2019\u2019 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a). In <em>County of Washington v. Gunther, </em>452 U.S. 161, 101 S.Ct. 2242, 68 L.Ed.2d 751 (1981), the Supreme Court held that failure to allege or prove the equal work standard of the Equal Pay Act did not bar a plaintiff's cause of action under Title VII for discrimination in compensation. However, Title VII does incorporate that portion of the Equal Pay Act which permits dissimilar wages between men and women pursuant to (i) a seniority system, (ii) a merit system, (iii) a system which measures earnings by quantity or quality of production, or (iv) a differential based on any other factor other than sex. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(h).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b802-9\">. Section 704(a), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a), reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-11\">\"It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees ... because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter, or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this sub-chapter.\"</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b802-20\">. Flagship asserted at trial that it also terminated Jones' employment for her solicitation of Dorothy Smith, another female co-worker, to sue the company, and for her breach of company policy in taking Metze\u2019s personnel file home. <em>See </em>footnote 3, <em>supra. </em>The district court found that Jones did not solicit Smith and did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>breach any \"clearly stated\u201d company policy, \"at least as it pertained to Jones.\u201d The court\u2019s findings in this regard are not in error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b803-8\">. The Supreme Court has delineated the burden on a Title VII defendant in rebutting the plaintiff\u2019s prima facie case, and the plaintiff's subsequent and ultimate burden.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-9\">The burden that shifts to the defendant, therefore, is to rebut the presumption of discrimination by producing evidence that the plaintiff was rejected, or someone else was preferred, for a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason. The defendant need not persuade the court that it was actually motivated by the proffered reasons. See <em>Sweeney, supra, </em>[24] at 25, 58 L.Ed.2d 216, 99 S.Ct. 295 [at 295]. It is sufficient if the defendant\u2019s evidence raises a genuine issue of fact as to whether it discriminated against the plaintiff. To accomplish this, the defendant must clearly set forth, through the introduction of admissible evidence, the reasons for the plaintiffs rejection. The explanation provided must be legally sufficient to justify a judgment for the defendant. If the defendant carries this burden of production, the presumption raised by the prima facie case is rebutted, and the factual inquiry proceeds to a new level of specificity. Placing this burden of production on the defendant thus serves simultaneously to meet the plaintiffs prima facie case by presenting a legitimate reason for the action and to frame the factual issue with sufficient clarity so that the plaintiff will have a full and fair opportunity to demonstrate pretext. The sufficiency of the defendant's evidence should be evaluated by the extent to which it fulfills these functions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-13\">The plaintiff retains the burden of persuasion. She now must have the opportunity to demonstrate that the proffered reason was not the true reason for the employment decision. This burden now merges with the ultimate burden of persuading the court that she has been the victim of intentional discrimination. She may succeed in this either directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer\u2019s proffered explanation is unworthy of credence. See <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>411 U.S. at 804-805, 36 L.Ed.2d 668, 93 S.Ct. 1817 [1825-1826].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-14\"><em>Burdine, </em>450 U.S. at 254-56, 101 S.Ct. at 1094-95 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b803-15\">. Jones contends that because her duties were primarily \"conciliatory\u201d and \"non-adversarial,\u201d no actual conflict of interest was created by her actions. Although Jones\u2019 duty may have been to counsel discrimination claimants and to conciliate discrimination claims in a non-adversarial manner, it was her position as a representative of the company in EEO matters, not her methods, which created the conflict of interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b804-7\">. The Ninth Circuit grounded this possible exception to \u00a7 704(a) on the \"business necessity\" doctrine of <em>Griggs v.

In <em>Griggs </em>the Supreme Court held that employment practices which are discriminatory in operation are not prohibited if the employer shows they are related to job performance, <em>i.e. </em>that they are required by \"business necessity.\" <em>Id. See Prewitt v. United States Postal Service, </em>662 F.2d 292, 306 (5th Cir.1981). The Tenth Circuit has also held that business necessity may justify retaliation. <em>See Barela v.

Jones and the EEOC argue that Love\u2019s testimony cannot support the conclusion that Jones solicited or encouraged Love to sue or join in suing Flagship. Although Love\u2019s testimony is not the model of clarity, it is apparent that her understanding at the time of her discussions with Jones was that the latter had asked her to \"join\u201d in Jones\u2019 claim. The court below could have properly determined that Love\u2019s understanding of Jones' request was communicated to Metze, who, in turn communicated this understanding to Vygantas.
