The motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">The named petitioners herein were involved in an agency-wide reduction-in-force (RIF) conducted by the Census Bureau of the Department of Commerce. They signed authorization cards designating AFGE Local 2782 as their representative before the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB or Board) and were so represented by the Union\u2019s designee in those proceedings. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(a)(2). The decisions of the MSPB being adverse, an attorney retained by AFGE Local 2782 represented petitioners in prior appeals to this court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Crispin v. Department of Commerce, </em>732 F.2d 919 (Fed.Cir.1984); <em>Austin v. Department of Commerce, </em>738 F.2d 453 (Fed.Cir.1984) (unpublished opinion); <em>Nightengale v. Department of Commerce, </em>738 F.2d 453 (Fed.Cir.1984) (unpublished opinion). We remanded the cases to the MSPB for full hearings to determine whether the agency had properly established the various competitive levels for the employees\u2019 positions as used in the RIF. On remand, the MSPB again rendered decisions adverse to petitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">Thereafter, an attorney retained by AFGE Local 2782 filed a consolidated appeal in this court purporting to represent the named petitioners. During oral argument, the court questioned whether appeal had been authorized by the petitioners. Counsel admitted he had had no communication with any of them, but instead was employed by the Union to represent them. Counsel was directed to advise the court whether each petitioner had been contacted by the Union regarding the adverse decision of his or her case by the MSPB and had authorized an appeal. The response makes clear that the \u201cnamed petitioners did not, in fact, direct the filing of these petitions after receipt of the MSPB decisions being challenged____\u201d Counsel for petitioners noted, however, that Union representatives believe the individual petitioners, when they signed the MSPB representation forms, understood and desired that the Union would provide representation for any necessary judicial appeals. AFGE Local 2782 has now moved to enter this case as petitioner in an attempt to cure the absence of specific appeal authorization by the individual petitioners, other than Terrie G. Reid,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and we must determine if it has standing to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-15\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b358-16\">A. Whether the Union has standing to be a petitioner in this case requires inquiry into both the constitutional limitations on federal court jurisdiction and prudential limitations on its exercise. <em>Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 498, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 2204-05, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975). The rules of standing are threshold determinants of the propriety of judicial intervention and it is the responsibility of the Union in this case to demonstrate that it is a proper party to invoke judicial resolution of the dispute and the exercise of the court\u2019s remedial powers. <em>Id. </em>at 517, 95 S.Ct. at 2214-15. For this purpose, we will accept the facts set forth in the Union\u2019s motion as true.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-17\">Article III of the Constitution restricts the exercise of federal judicial power to actual \u201ccases\u201d and \u201ccontroversies.\u201d <em>Allen v. Wright, </em>468 U.S. 737, 104 S.Ct. 3315, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>3324, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984); <em>Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, </em>397 U.S. 150, 151, 90 S.Ct. 827, 829, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970). This restriction imposes the requirement on the person seeking judicial relief to allege a \u201cdistinct and palpable injury to himself.\u201d <em>Warth, </em>422 U.S. at 501, 95 S.Ct. at 2206. He must also show that \u201cthe injury \u2018fairly can be traced to the challenged action\u2019 and \u2018is likely to be redressed by a favorable decision.\u2019 \u201d <em>Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Organization, </em>426 U.S. 26, 38, 96 S.Ct. 1917, 1924, 48 L.Ed.2d 450 (1976) ; <em>see also Allen, </em>104 S.Ct. at 3325.</p>\n<p id=\"Axe\">The standing doctrine also embraces several judicially self-imposed limits on the exercise of federal jurisdiction. These prudential restrictions include a general prohibition precluding a litigant from raising another person\u2019s legal rights, a rule barring adjudication of generalized grievances more appropriately addressed in the representative branch, and a requirement that a plaintiff\u2019s complaint fall within the zone of interests protected by the law invoked. <em>Allen, </em>104 S.Ct. at 3324-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">B. With respect to the Article III injury requirement, the Supreme Court has recognized that an association may have standing to assert the claims of its members, even where the association itself has not suffered injury from the challenged action.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advertising Commission, </em>432 U.S. 333, 342, 97 S.Ct. 2434, 2441, 53 L.Ed.2d 383 (1977) (associational standing). The association may be the appropriate representative of its members, entitled to invoke the jurisdiction of a federal court, when:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-8\">(i) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-9\">(ii) the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization\u2019s purpose; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-10\">(iii) neither the claims asserted nor the relief requested requires the partie-ipation of the individual members in the lawsuit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 343, 97 S.Ct. at 2441.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-13\">There can be little doubt the Union satisfies the first two of the <em>Hunt </em>requirements. The Union argues that it also satisfies the third requirement in this case because \u201c(c)ourt of appeals review of administrative decesions [sic] is a perfect example of a case where individual participation is not necessary.\u201d In its view, the record already exists and there is no opportunity for the development of facts personal to each affected employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-14\">The third <em>Hunt </em>factor cannot be glossed over so lightly. In <em>Warth, </em>the Court said that in all cases in which it had recognized association standing, based on injury to the members, the type of relief sought was a \u201cdeclaration, injunction or some other form of prospective relief____\u201d 422 U.S. at 515, 95 S.Ct. at 2213. The association there sought relief in damages for alleged injuries to its members and the damage claims were not common to the entire membership or shared by all in equal degree. In rejecting the association\u2019s standing to pursue this type of relief, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Agd\">whatever injury may have been suffered is peculiar to the individual member concerned, and both the fact and extent of injury would require individualized proof. Thus, to obtain relief in damages, each member of Home Builders who claims injury as a result of respondents\u2019 practices must be a party to the suit, and Home Builders has no standing to claim damages on his behalf.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-17\"><em>Id. </em>at 515-16, 95 S.Ct. at 2214.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-18\">The Union here, if permitted to enter as petitioner, would similarly be seeking particularized relief dependent on the individual circumstances of each employee. While damages are not sought, reinstatement relief (and concommitant back pay) similarly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>requires that the injured union members be parties to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">Furthermore, we are not convinced that the third <em>Hunt </em>requirement can be avoided solely because an appellate court does not engage in fact finding. Indeed, the Union has cited no authority for its broad contention and we find none. The decision herein, even though the cases are consolidated for appeal and argument, must separately address the facts and legal conclusions of the Board with respect to each named petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">C. Turning to the prudential considerations, they also lead to the conclusion that the Union lacks association standing in this case. In this inquiry, the focus is whether the Union is within the intendment of the jurisdictional statute in seeking to assert the legal rights or interests of third persons.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Congress, through the exercise of its legislative power, can resolve the question of prudential limitations on standing one way or the other. <em>Data Processing Service, </em>397 U.S. at 154, 90 S.Ct. at 830. It may, by statute, grant a right of action, either expressly or by clear implication, to persons seeking relief on the basis of the legal rights or interests of third persons. <em>Warth, </em>422 U.S. at 501, 95 S.Ct. at 2206. Logically, Congress can also deny such a right of action. <em>See Gladstone, Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, </em>441 U.S. 91, 99 S.Ct. 1601, 60 L.Ed.2d 66 (1979); <em>Stark v. Wick-ard, </em>321 U.S. 288, 312, 64 S.Ct. 559, 572, 88 L.Ed. 733 (1944) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting) (\u201cwhether judicial review is available at all, and if so, who may invoke it, ... are questions that depend for their answer upon the particular enactment under which judicial review is claimed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-15\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9) (1982),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> this court has exclusive subject matter jurisdiction over final orders and decisions of the MSPB pursuant to, <em>inter alia, </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(b)(1).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Lindahl v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>470 U.S. 768, 105 S.Ct. 1620, 1634, 84 L.Ed.2d 674 (1985); <em>Yarbrough v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>770 F.2d 1056, 1059 (Fed.Cir.1985); <em>Bronger v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>769 F.2d 756, 757 (Fed.Cir.1985) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 882, 88 L.Ed.2d 918 (1986). These provisions do not provide guidance as to who is the proper litigant to invoke this jurisdiction for they do not create the litigant\u2019s legal right to appeal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, when a litigant attempts to invoke this court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction under \u00a7 7703(b)(1), the statutory provision or regulation on which the claim is based must be examined to determine whether the litigant possesses standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-18\">In this case, \u00a7 7703(a)(1) of Title 5 creates an express right of appeal to this court for \u201cemployees\u201d adversely affected or aggrieved by a final decision of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>MSPB as an adjunct to the jurisdictional provision of \u00a7 7703(b)(1). <em>Lindahl, </em>105 S.Ct. at 1634. This section provides standing for <em>judicial </em>appeal of final orders and decisions of the MSPB under \u00a7 7701. The Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Lindahl </em>also implies that standing before the Board may, in limited circumstances (e.g., a MSPB decision under \u00a7 8347(d)(1) instead of \u00a7 7701), be the predicate for standing to appeal to this court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Section 7701(a) permits an employee to seek Board review of \u201cany action which is appealable to the Board under any law, rule or regulation.\u201d To provide for review by the MSPB of employee rights under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502 in a reduction in force, the Office of Personnel Management has promulgated 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.901 (1986).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, we examine these statutory and regulatory provisions, as well as \u00a7 7703(a)(1), to determine whether the Union is, within the intendment of Congress, a proper party to assert the substantive rights of its individual members or sue on their injury. <em>Data Processing Service, </em>397 U.S. at 154, 90 S.Ct. at 830.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">Statutory analysis requires first that we look to the express language of the statute to determine its meaning. <em>United States v. Turkette, </em>452 U.S. 576, 580, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 2527, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981). If it is plain and unequivocal on its face, there is usually no need to resort to the legislative history underlying the statute. <em>United States v. Oregon, </em>366 U.S. 643, 648, 81 S.Ct. 1278, 1281, 6 L.Ed.2d 575 (1961). The function of the court is then limited to enforcing the statute according to its terms, <em>Caminetti v. United States, </em>242 U.S. 470, 485, 37 S.Ct. 192, 194, 61 L.Ed. 442 (1917); 2A C.D. Sands, SUTHERLAND STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION, \u00a7 46.01 (4th ed.1973) [hereinafter 2A Sands], unless a literal interpretation would lead to an incongruous result. For example, if a liter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>al reading of the statute would impute to Congress an irrational purpose, <em>United States v. Bryan, </em>339 U.S. 323, 338, 70 S.Ct. 724, 734, 94 L.Ed. 884 (1950), or would thwart the obvious purposes of the statute, <em>Trans Alaska Pipeline Rate Cases, </em>436 U.S. 631, 643, 98 S.Ct. 2053, 2061, 56 L.Ed.2d 591 (1978), or would lead to a result at variance with the policy of the legislation as a whole, <em>Trustee of Indiana University v. United States, </em>618 F.2d 736, 739, 233 Ct.Cl. 88, 94 (1980), then literal interpretation will be eschewed in favor of resort to the legislative history to ascertain the intent of Congress. <em>United States v. Oregon, </em>366 U.S. at 648, 81 S.Ct. at 1281; 2A Sands \u00a7 46.07.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">The meaning of the term \u201cemployee\u201d as used in \u00a7\u00a7 3502, 7701(a) and 7703(a)(1), enacted as part of the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) of 1978, Pub.L. No. 95-454, \u00a7 205, 92 Stat. 1111, 1138, 1143-44, is not ambiguous.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Congress, in Pub.L. No. 89-554, \u00a7 2105, 80 Stat. 409 (1966), promulgated 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2105(a) which defines an employee, <em>for the purposes of Title 5, </em>as an individual. Other sections of the CSRA, in which the term \u201cemployee\u201d is used and defined for specific purposes, continue the basic definition of an employee as an individual. <em>See, e.g., </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4301(2), 7501(1), and 7511(a)(1) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">In addition, Chapter 71 \u2014 Labor-Management Relations \u2014 of Title 5, distinguishes specifically between Congress\u2019 use of the word \u201cemployee\u201d and its use of the term \u201cperson.\u201d In \u00a7 7103(a)(1), Congress defined \u201cperson\u201d to mean individual, labor organization, or agency, but in \u00a7 7103(a)(2) limited the term \u201cemployee\u201d to mean an individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">In view of the repeated use of employee to mean an individual, it would be contrary to the plain and unequivocal language of the statute to say that the term \u201cemployee\u201d as used in \u00a7\u00a7 3502, 7701(a) and 7703(a)(1) encompasses a labor organization, such as AFGE Local 2782. It would also strain the ordinary meaning of the term \u201cemployee.\u201d 2A Sands, \u00a7 46.01. Moreover, a literal reading of the statute to require appeal by the individual employee does not produce an incongruous result, or frustrate the obvious purpose or the policy of the CSRA as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">In <em>American Federation of Government Employees, Council of Prison Locals, Local 1286 v. United States Department of Justice, </em>738 F.2d 742 (6th Cir. 1984), the court dismissed, for lack of jurisdiction, a petition for review brought by, and in the name of, the aggrieved employee\u2019s union. There an employee\u2019s removal was challenged under the negotiated grievance procedure provided by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7121 (1982). Section 7121(b)(3)(A) provides that the union, in its own behalf or on behalf of any employee, may present and prosecute grievances, and \u00a7 7121(b)(3)(C) provides that only the union may invoke binding arbitration to resolve grievances not satisfactorily settled. Even with this authorized union involvement under a negotiated procedure, the court concluded, based upon the statutory language and legislative history, that Congress intended to limit appellate jurisdiction under \u00a7 7703 to appeals initiated by the aggrieved employee personally. <em>Id. </em>at 747.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the legislative history of the CSRA should be examined, the only expression of congressional intent regarding \u00a7 7703(a)(1) is found at S.Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 62, <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S. CODE CONG. &amp; AD. NEWS 2723, 2784, wherein it is stated that \u201c[t]he wording [of \u00a7 7703(a)] is similar to the general provisions governing the right of review from agency actions found in Section 702 of the Administration [stc] Procedure Act.\u201d AFGE Local 2781 argues that this legislative history supports its position that it has standing under \u00a7 7703(a)(1) since, if organizations can litigate under \u00a7 702 if their members have standing, <em>Save Our Wetlands, Inc. v. Sands, </em>711 F.2d 634, 639 (5th Cir.1983), it is likely that Congress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>intended the same rule to govern under \u00a7 7703(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">We do not find this snippet of legislative history persuasive. Congress must be presumed to have been aware of the broad scope of standing afforded by the term \u201cperson\u201d as used in \u00a7 702 of the APA when it drafted the provisions of the CSRA, yet the CSRA, as enacted by Congress, used a more restrictive term. Since the right of appellate review under \u00a7 7703(a)(1) is phrased in terms of \u201cany employee or applicant for employment,\u201d the logical conclusion is that Congress intended to narrowly circumscribe the party who may initiate appellate review under this provision of the CSRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">An instructive statement on this question is found in S.Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 102-03, <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S. CODE CONG. &amp; AD. NEWS at 2824-25, in the legislative history of Chapter 72 of Title 5, Federal Service Labor-Management Relations, which states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-7\">Where the negotiated procedure covers adverse action and discrimination complaints, the employee has an option to use the negotiated procedure of <em>[sic-see </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7121(e)(1) (1982)] the statutory appeal procedure [\u00a7 7701], but not both. If the employee chooses the negotiated procedure, only the exclusive representative of the unit <em>may act </em>as the employee\u2019s representative. However, if the employee chooses the statutory appeal procedure, the employee may also choose his/her own representative and the union (as the exclusive representative of the unit) would have neither <em>a right </em>nor an obligation to represent the employee. (Emphasis added).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">If a union has no independent right to represent an employee before the MSPB (under the above-referenced statutory appeal procedure of \u00a7 7701), then <em>a priori </em>it has no independent right to initiate MSPB proceedings on behalf of an employee under \u00a7 7701, i.e., it has no standing under \u00a7 7701. It would be anomalous to conclude that a union nevertheless has standing to appeal from the MSPB to this court under \u00a7 7703(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-12\">D. AFGE Local 2782, in support of its position that a union has standing under \u00a7 7703(a)(1), cites two decisions of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia <em>Circuit </em>\u2014 Local <em>2578, American Federation of Government Employees v. General Services Administration, </em>711 F.2d 261 (D.C.Cir.1983), and <em>National Treasury Employees Union v. Merit Systems Protection Board, </em>743 F.2d 895 (D.C.Cir. 1984).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In <em>Local 2578, AFGE, </em>the court considered the sufficiency of an arbitrator\u2019s decision in an appeal under \u00a7 7703<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> which was initiated by the union on behalf of the aggrieved employee. The court, however, did not address the question of whether the union, as the named petitioner, had standing to bring the appeal nor was there any indication that this issue was raised. <em>Local 2578, AFGE </em>is, therefore, not persuasive in connection with the union\u2019s contention in this case that it would have standing to exercise the rights of the petitioners herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-13\">In <em>NTEU </em>a petition was filed with the MSPB by the union for review of an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) regulation pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1205(e)(1)(B). That section provides for MSPB review of OPM rules or regulations upon petition by \u201cany interested person.\u201d The union thereafter appealed the MSPB order upholding the validity of the challenged regulation. The D.C. Circuit determined that under the circumstances of that case the union had standing to seek judicial review of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>\u00a7 1205(e) order as an \u201caggrieved party\u201d within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2344.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> That standard is inapplicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">We conclude that Congress, in using the term \u201cemployee\u201d in \u00a7 7703(a)(1)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and in defining that term to mean an individual, has exercised its legislative prerogative to impose a prudential limitation on the exercise of this court\u2019s jurisdiction over adverse decisions of the MSPB. The unequivocal language of the statute supports this position, and the position is not demonstrably contrary to the legislative history or the policy of the CSRA. \u201cThe remedy for any dissatisfaction with the results in particular cases lies with Congress\u201d and not this court. \u201cCongress may amend the statute, we may not.\u201d <em>Griffith v.

The doctrine of standing focuses on the litigant seeking to invoke the jurisdiction of a federal court, and not on the issues to be resolved. <em>Simon v.

Where the actual or threatened injury required by Article III exists solely by virtue of statutes creating legal rights which have been invaded, the standing question depends on whether the statutory provision on which the claim rests properly can be understood as granting persons in the litigant's position a right to judicial relief. <em>Warth, </em>422 U.S. at 500, 95 S.Ct. at 2206.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b361-4\">. <em>See Cheeseman v.
