Defendant pleaded guilty to one count of being a convicted felon receiving explosives which had been transported in interstate commerce. He contends that the imposition of restitution as part of his sentence is unlawful because the damages upon which restitution is based are not directly attributable to the count on which he pleaded guilty. We disagree and affirm the order of restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-16\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b206-17\">The following facts were elicited by the district court at an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-18\">On April 26, 1984, Mounts and a confederate burglarized the Ray Reams Action Auto Auction in London, Kentucky, taking several items of business equipment. According to testimony, Mounts attempted to blow up Action Auto\u2019s safe, using explosives which he had taken from a mine in an adjoining county. The business suffered severe damage. Mounts fled the scene in a Corvette which he had stolen from Action Auto. Mounts later collided with a pickup truck owned by Robert L. Adams, damaging both vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-19\">Mounts was indicted on five separate counts. Four counts charged Mounts and his co-defendant with offenses relating to their use of explosives, one of which involved the damage inflicted on Action Auto\u2019s building. Count 5 charges Mounts alone with being a convicted felon receiving explosives transported in interstate commerce.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mounts pleaded guilty to count 5 of the indictment. The district court imposed a prison sentence of ten years on that count, and the remaining counts were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>dismissed by the government. The trial judge held a hearing to determine the appropriateness of restitution, and heard testimony on Mounts\u2019 ability to pay and the losses sustained as a result of Mounts\u2019 actions. The court directed Mounts to pay $1,162.50 to Action Auto as a condition of parole pursuant to the restitution provisions of the Victim and Witness Protection Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3579, 3580. This figure is the sum of Action Auto\u2019s loss on the Corvette and half of its approximate loss on the business equipment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court refused to order restitution to Adams for the damage to his pickup truck because the court found that the collision was a separate incident and \u201chad nothing to do with this particular event.\u201d The court, exercising its discretion pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3580(d) and in consideration of the defendant\u2019s assets and his family\u2019s financial resources, also denied restitution to the insurance company which partially reimbursed Action Auto for its losses. Mounts appeals on the ground that the trial judge erred in ordering restitution for losses which were not directly caused by the conduct for which the defendant pleaded guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">The Restitution Order</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">The Victim and Witness Protection Act allows a trial judge, as part of the sentencing process, to order a defendant to make restitution \u201cto any victim of the offense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3579(a)(1) (1982). Neither the term \u201coffense\u201d nor \u201cvictim\u201d is defined in the VWPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">This Court has previously adopted a narrow definition of \u201coffense\u201d holding that \u201c[a] natural construction of this language would require that the defendant make restitution only to victims of the offense for which he was convicted.\u201d <em>United States v. Durham, </em>755 F.2d 511, 512 (6th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">In the same case, however, this Court adopted a broader definition of \u201cvictim.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXL\">This language [18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3579(b)(1) and 3580(a)] clearly indicates that Congress intended restitution to be awarded to persons who suffered injury \u201cas a result of\u201d the offense. The remaining question is whether Congress intended a \u201cvictim\u201d to be a person who suffered injury as a result of actions that are necessary elements of the offense charged, or whether Congress intended a \u201cvictim\u201d to be a person who suffered injury as a result of the defendant\u2019s actions that surrounded the commission of the offense, regardless of whether the actions are elements of the offense charged. We believe Congress intended the latter definition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-12\"><em>Durham, </em>755 F.2d at 513.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-13\">The statute directs that restitution awards be \u201cas fair as possible to the victim....\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3579(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-14\">Here the offense to which the plea of guilty was accepted was a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 842(i)(l), receipt of an explosive by a convicted felon. This section was enacted as a part of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, Pub.L.No. 91-452, 84 Stat. 941 (1971).

No. 1549, 91st Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>1970 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 4007, 4043-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-15\">It is clear from this legislative history that Ray Reams Action Auto Auction was among the contemplated class of victims of misuse of dynamite, and that defendant Mounts was among those who presented a \u201cspecial danger to the public safety and welfare\u201d by the receipt of dynamite. Mounts\u2019 claim that he must plead guilty to or be found guilty of the offense of actual destruction of the building (dismissed under the plea agreement as Count 2) is without merit under the rationale of <em>Durham. </em>Reams was victimized by the misuse of the dynamite that the statute was designed to prevent Mounts from receiving, because of the potentiality of misuse by a convicted felon.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-17\">The damage to Reams\u2019 automobile, stolen in the burglary and subsequently damaged, presents a more difficult problem under the restrictive definition of \u201coffense\u201d in <em>Durham, </em>yet it is easily disposed of under the expansive definition of \u201cvictim.\u201d The burglary, misuse of dynamite in blowing up the safe, and theft of the Corvette for purposes of escape were an uninterrupted series of events surrounding the criminal activity of appellant. Stealing a car to escape the scene of a misuse of explosives unlawfully received is not so attenuated as to elude the definition of <em>Durham, </em>i.e., \u201ca \u2018victim\u2019 [is] a person who suffered injury as a result of the defendant\u2019s actions that surrounded the commission of the offense, regardless of whether the actions are elements of the offense charged.\u201d 755 F.2d at 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-18\">The broad definition of \u201cvictim\u201d we adopt here comports with the remedial purposes of the Victim and Witness Protection Act. Perpetrators of crime should bear the full consequences of their criminal acts to the extent that this is possible. Neither innocent victims nor society should bear any of the resultant costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-19\">We note that Judge Siler held an eviden-tiary hearing and that the preponderance of the evidence favored his finding that appellant received and misused the dynamite and stole the Corvette for purposes of escape. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3580(d). We also note that no constitutional questions are raised by the appeal and we, therefore, do not address them.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-20\">Indigency</p>\n<p id=\"b208-21\">Finally, Mounts argues that the restitution order was improper because he is indigent. While a defendant\u2019s ability to pay is a consideration in the determination of restitution, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3580(a), indigency is not a bar to an order of restitution. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Ruffen, </em>780 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>1493(9th Cir.1986); <em>United States v. Fountain, </em>768 F.2d 790, 802 (7th Cir.1985); <em>United States v. Keith, </em>754 F.2d 1388,1393 (9th Cir.1985); <em>United States v. Brown, </em>744 F.2d 905, 911 (2d Cir.1984). The record of the hearing on restitution clearly demonstrates that the district court considered the defendant\u2019s indigency and earning ability and the needs of his family. The court denied restitution to Action Auto\u2019s insurance carrier upon these considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">The district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b206-12\">. The indictment alleges that on or about April 26, 1984, Mounts and Stanley Witt received and disposed of explosive materials which they had reasonable cause to believe were stolen, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 842(h); damaged a building and other property used in interstate commerce and affecting commerce by means of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>explosive, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(i)-(j); made a \"firearm\u201d without paying the making tax, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5861(f), 5871; and possessed a firearm which had not been properly registered, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5861(d), 5871. Mounts, in addition, was indicted on one count of being a convicted felon receiving explosives which had been transported in interstate commerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 842(i)(l).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b207-9\">.
