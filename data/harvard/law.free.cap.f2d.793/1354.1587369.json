In issuing its judgment the District Court deferred to the view of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals that such tort suits were precluded by the District of Columbia Workers\u2019 Compensation Act of 1928, 36 D.C.Code \u00a7 501 <em>et seq. </em>(1973) (repealed) (the D.C. Compensation Act).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> By its terms the D.C. Compensation Act merely applies the provisions of the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act of 1927, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 901 <em>et seq. </em>(1982) (the Longshoremen\u2019s Act), to the District of Columbia.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This case therefore calls into question the application of Erie<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> principles to the construction by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals of a special type of statute: an Act of Congress that applies exclusively to the District of Columbia but whose substance merely mirrors that of another federal statute that applies to the nation as a whole. Because we find that the D.C. Compensation Act is a \u201clocal\u201d law, we believe deference to the construction of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals was proper under the circumstances. We therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1356\">*1356</page-number>I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-4\">Appellants\u2019 complaint alleges that on or about October 11, 1979 appellant Ronald Hall suffered an employment-related back injury while employed as a cable splicer by appellee C &amp; P Telephone Company (C <em>&amp; </em>P).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Ronald Hall filed for workers\u2019 compensation benefits under the applicable statute, the D.C. Compensation Act. On July 23, 1981 an Administrative Law Judge in the Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, United States Department of Labor, ordered C &amp; P, as Ronald Hall\u2019s self-insured employer, to pay compensation benefits as well as all past and future medical and hospital expenses arising out of the October 11, 1979 accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-5\">Appellants allege that for nearly three years C &amp; P failed to reimburse Ronald Hall on a timely basis for the bulk of his injury-related medical expenses due under the AU\u2019s award.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> They claim that during that time Ronald Hall was subjected to the threat of credit action by his health care providers and that their marriage suffered because of the financial strain produced by appellee\u2019s failure to make timely payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-6\">On May 2, 1984 appellants filed a complaint in the District Court alleging intentional infliction of emotional distress and bad-faith refusal to make timely payments.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Appellee filed a motion to dismiss their complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In support of its motion ap-pellee cited a recent opinion of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, <em>Garrett v. Washington Air Compressor Co., </em>466 A.2d 462 (D.C.C.A.1983). Appellee argued that <em>Garrett </em>effectively held that the exclusivity provisions of the D.C. Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905(a) (1982), barred any court from taking jurisdiction of appellants\u2019 independent civil claims. <em>See </em>defendant-appellee\u2019s Memorandum of Points and Authorities in support of its motion to dismiss filed June 11, 1984 at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-12\">On November 28, 1984 the District Court entered an order granting appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss. In so doing the court expressly relied on Garrett\u2019s analysis of the exclusivity provisions of the D.C. Compensation Act. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-13\">Our decision turns on resolution of two issues: First, whether the District Court properly deferred to the opinion of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals in <em>Garrett </em>construing the preclusive effect of the D.C. Compensation Act. Second, assuming the District Court was bound to follow the <em>Garrett </em>interpretation of the statute, whether appellants\u2019 claims are barred by that construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-14\">II. Deference to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-15\">A. <em>The Legal Standard Governing Deference to Construction of \u201cLocal\u201d Federal Statutes by the D.C. Court of Appeals</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1434-16\">It is now well established that this court will apply <em>Erie </em>principles to the decisions of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. <em>See Lee v. Flintkote Co., </em>593 F.2d 1275, 1278 n. 14 (D.C.Cir.1979). Noting the Court Reform Act\u2019s command that the D.C. Court of Appeals be treated as the \u201chighest court\u201d of the District, the <em>Lee </em>court ruled that <em>Erie </em>principles should apply to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1357\">*1357</page-number>the decisions of the D.C. Court of Appeals so as to limit forum-shopping and promote uniformity in the rules of decision governing local affairs. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1435-4\">Our case, however, does not concern deference to development of common law principles by the D.C. courts. The \u201clocal\u201d law at issue in this case is an Act of Congress that amended the District of Columbia Code. Congress acted pursuant to its plenary authority to exercise legislative power for the District of Columbia. U.S. Const. Art. I, Sec. 8, cl. 17. Moreover, it is a statute that merely applies the terms of another federal statute: the Longshoremen\u2019s Act. The latter is an act of national scope as to which there is a clear federal interest in uniform application. An unadorned statement of deference to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals would be mechanical at best under the circumstances. Although this court has on occasion applied <em>Erie </em>principles to construction of Art. I, Sec. 8, cl. 17 statutes,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> our research reveals no case where deference was accorded a District of Columbia Court of Appeals construction of a \u201clocal\u201d congressional enactment that simply applied the terms of a \u201cnational\u201d statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-5\">The Supreme Court, however, has addressed the analogous question of the deference <em>it </em>will give to the D.C. Court of Appeals\u2019 construction of Art. I, Sec. 8, cl. 17 statutes. In <em>Pemell v. Southall Realty, </em>416 U.S. 363, 94 S.Ct. 1723, 40 L.Ed.2d 198 (1974), the Court reviewed an alleged right to a jury trial for an action brought under 16 D.C.Code \u00a7 1501 <em>et seq. </em>(1973), the statutory provision governing eviction of tenants for nonpayment of rent. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals had held that the statute in question did not provide for a right to a jury trial. Prior to 1970 another provision of the D.C.Code, 13 D.C.Code \u00a7 702, had provided for a right to jury trial in such eviction actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-8\">In deferring to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals\u2019 view of congressional intent, the Supreme Court noted that the purpose of the Court Reform Act of 1970, Pub.L. No. 91-358 \u00a7 142(5)(A), 84 Stat. 552, was to give the District of Columbia a court system \u201c \u2018comparable to those of the states * * *.\u2019 \u201d 416 U.S. at 367, <em>quoting </em>H.R.Rep. No. 91-907, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 23 (1970). The Court reasoned that this legislative intent strongly suggests that federal courts ought to give as much deference to local courts\u2019 interpretation of Acts of Congress \u201cdirected toward the District,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 368, 94 S.Ct. at 1726, as they do to their construction of the common law. The Court therefore explicitly stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4U\">[tjhis new structure plainly contemplates that the decisions of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals on matters of local law \u2014 both common law and <em>statutory </em>law \u2014 will be treated by this Court in a manner similar to the way in which we treat decisions of the highest court of a State on questions of state law. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALhx\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-9\">The District of Columbia Court of Appeals read the congressional repeal of Section 13-702 as barring jury trials on any claim brought under 16 D.C.Code \u00a7 1501 <em>et seq. </em>The Supreme Court deferred to the statutory construction of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, forcing the Court to face the petitioner\u2019s Seventh Amendment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-10\">The Court concluded that it would defer to local courts\u2019 construction of Art. I, Sec. 8, cl. 17 statutes to the same degree that it would defer to their interpretation of common law questions: in either case it would accept the view of the District of Columbia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1358\">*1358</page-number>Court of Appeals unless it found \u201cegregious error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 369, 94 S.Ct. at 1726.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1436-4\">We are aware that there are significant functional differences between the Supreme Court\u2019s review of the decisions of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals and this court\u2019s attempt to apply local law in a diversity case. We also note, however, that the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis was based on the same general perspective as that articulated by this court in <em>Lee v. Flintkote Co., supra, </em>593 F.2d at 1278 n. 14: a prudential willingness to defer to the local courts, as suggested by the purpose and effect of the Court Reform Act of 1970. We are satisfied that the Supreme Court\u2019s view of the purpose of the Court Reform Act should guide us here as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-5\">Thus in applying this standard to this case, we must simply consider the relationship between the Longshoremen\u2019s Act and the D.C. Compensation Act. Because it appears that the Compensation Act is a \u201clocal\u201d law, <em>i.e., </em>a statute passed pursuant to Art. I, Sec. 8, cl. 17, we find that deference to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals was in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-6\">B. <em>The Local Character of the D.C. Compensation Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1436-7\">Although the D.C. Compensation Act merely incorporates the terms of the Longshoremen\u2019s Act, this court has long applied these statutes in operationally distinguishable fashion. Thus in <em>Gudmund-son v. Cardillo, </em>126 F.2d 521 (D.C.Cir. 1942), this court held that it would not apply the doctrine of <em>Crowell v. Benson, </em>285 U.S. 22, 52 S.Ct. 285, 76 L.Ed. 598 (1935), and would therefore defer to administrative determination of \u201cjurisdictional facts\u201d in its application of the D.C. Compensation Act, even if the rule in <em>Crowell </em>did apply to application of the Longshoremen\u2019s Act. This distinction was said to rest on the fact that, notwithstanding their surface similarities, the D.C. Act and the Longshoremen\u2019s Act were two distinct statutes passed with different purposes. Thus, the court insisted, D.C. Compensation Act claims do</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1436-11\">not arise under the Longshoremen\u2019s Act * * * True enough, the language and provisions of the national Act are made applicable to the District, but the two Acts are wholly separate and distinct, for the reason that * * * in the * * * local act * * * Congress was exercising the powers granted in Sec. 8 of Art. I, and these powers, the Supreme Court said in <em>Keller v. Potomac Power Co., </em>261 U.S. 428, 442 [43 S.Ct. 445, 448, 67 L.Ed. 731] [(1942)], include not only the powers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1359\">*1359</page-number>that belong to Congress in respect of territory within a State but the powers of the State as well \u2014 a delegation which * * embraces full and unlimited jurisdiction * * * to provide for the general welfare of citizens within the District of Columbia * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1437-5\">126 F.2d at 525.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-6\">Similarly, in <em>Director, OWCP v. National Van Lines, Inc., </em>613 F.2d 972 (D.C.Cir. 1979), this court indicated that the appellate jurisdiction of this court enjoys a broader sweep under the D.C. Compensation Act than it does under the Longshoremen\u2019s Act. The Longshoremen\u2019s Act states that appeal should be taken in \u201cthe United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the injury occurred * * <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 912(c) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-8\">In <em>National Van Lines </em>the petitioner was injured in a highway accident in New York State. 613 F.2d at 977. The dissent therefore argued that the appeal should have been heard in the Second Circuit. <em>Id. </em>at 988. Although conceding that this was a plausible reading of the language of the statute in a Longshoremen\u2019s Act case, the majority declined to adopt it in <em>National Van Lines. </em>Noting that the case arose under the D.C. Compensation Act, and stressing the need for uniform interpretation of that Act, this court found that it had appellate jurisdiction in any case where the injuries gave rise to claims under the D.C. Act. <em>See id. </em>at 978-979 n. 20.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1437-9\">Finally, we note that the District of Columbia Court of Appeals has explicitly considered the question whether the D.C. Compensation Act is a \u201clocal\u201d law or whether its adoption of the Longshoremen\u2019s Act rendered it a \u201cnational\u201d law. <em>See District of Columbia v. Greater Washington Central Labor Council, </em>442 A.2d 110, 116-117 (D.C.C.A.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>460 U.S. 1016, 103 S.Ct. 1261, 75 L.Ed.2d 487 (1983). In that case the D.C. court faced the issue whether repeal of the old compensation scheme, 36 D.C.Code \u00a7 501 <em>et seq. </em>(1973), by the D.C. Council in 1980 and the enactment of a new workers\u2019 compensation law was valid under 1 D.C.Code \u00a7 233(a)(3) of the Self-Government Act. Under 1 D.C. Code \u00a7 602(a)(3) (1981) the D.C. Council has no power to amend or repeal laws that affect \u201cfunctions or property of the United States.\u201d Reviewing the Supreme Court\u2019s treatment of the D.C. Compensation Act as an analogue of similar state statutes, the District\u2019s assumption of financial responsibility for the administrative cost of the program, and the legislative history of the Act, the D.C. court concluded that the D.C. Act was a \u201clocal\u201d law that did not affect federal functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-12\">We find this analysis persuasive and therefore have little difficulty accepting the proposition that the D.C. Compensation Act is a \u201clocal\u201d law to which we must apply the lesson of <em>Pernell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1437-13\">III. The Applicability of <em>Garrett</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1437-14\">Appellants argue that even if this court must defer to <em>Garrett </em>whenever that decision applies, it need not do do so in this case because it is distinguishable from <em>Garrett </em>on its facts. A review of the complaint in this case and of the holding in <em>Garrett, </em>however, does not support appellants\u2019 position.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-15\">In this case appellants have preserved two fundamental claims: (1) intentional infliction of emotional distress through willful untimely payment of an award, and (2) bad-faith failure to make timely payments. They contend that <em>Garrett </em>is distinguishable because the complaint in <em>Garrett </em>failed to allege a \u201cspecific intent to injure.\u201d Brief for appellants at 25. By contrast, appellants attempt to suggest that the <em>Garrett </em>plaintiff could not allege such a bad intent, but was merely frustrated by the lethargic pace of the administrative process.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1438-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1360\">*1360</page-number>The <em>Garrett </em>court, however, specifically restated the claims of the appellant in that case. They included \u201cbad-faith\u201d failure to pay benefits and refusal to make payments animated by \u201c \u2018deceit, oppression, malice and outrage\u2019 * * 466 A.2d at 463 n. 2 <em>(quoting </em>plaintiff\u2019s complaint). We can see no meaningful difference between a \u201cmalicious\u201d failure to make timely payments and a failure to make timely payments \u201cwith an intent to injure.\u201d We therefore find <em>Garrett </em>to control disposition of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-5\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-6\">The policies underlying the Court Reform Act of 1970 suggest that this court should defer to the decisions of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals construing Acts of Congress that apply exclusively to the District of Columbia. Finding this case on all fours with the decision of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals in <em>Garrett, </em>we believe the District Court properly granted appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss for want of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1433-16\">. In 1980 the D.C. Council enacted a new workers\u2019 compensation scheme independent of the Longshoremen\u2019s Act. <em>See </em>36 D.C.Code \u00a7 301 <em>et seq. </em>(1981 &amp; 1985 Supp.). Because the pertinent events in this case transpired before the effective date of the new law, the old D.C. Compensation Act of 1928 governs this case. <em>See Garrett v. Washington Air Compressor Co., </em>466 A.2d 462, 462 n. 1 (D.C.C.A.1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1433-19\">. This general incorporation of 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 901 <em>et seq. </em>is subject to several exceptions under 36 D.C.Code \u00a7 502 (1973). Those exceptions are not pertinent to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1433-20\">. <em>Erie Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed.2d 1188 (1938).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1434-7\">. Appellee's Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) motion was granted on the pleadings. We therefore credit appellants' statement of the case. <em>Scheuer v. Rhodes, </em>416 U.S. 232, 236, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 1686, 40 L.Ed.2d 90 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1434-8\">. According to appellants\u2019 Supplemental Opposition to Defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss filed Dec. 3, 1984 at 2-3, appellee did pay virtually all of Ronald Hall\u2019s outstanding medical bills following initiation of this suit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1434-9\">. Appellant Laura Hall therefore joined her husband Ronald Hall\u2019s complaint, adding a claim of loss of consortium. Appellants concede that this claim is purely derivative of Ronald Hall's underlying claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress and bad-faith failure to make timely payments. <em>See </em>brief for appellants at 15. Appellants also included a claim of negligent failure to make timely payments. This claim has been abandoned on appeal. <em>See id. </em>at 10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1434-18\">. Appellee also argued that appellants had failed to state a claim and that their suit should be dismissed pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). Because we uphold appellee\u2019s jurisdictional defense we have no occasion to pass on the merits of its Rule 12(b)(6) motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1435-6\">. <em>See, e.g., Electrical Equipment Co. v. Security Natl Bank, </em>606 F.2d 1357, 1360 n. 25 (D.C.Cir. 1979). In <em>Electrical Equipment </em>this court deferred to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals\u2019 construction of \u00a7 38-109 of the D.C.Code of 1973, a provision governing the priority of mechanic\u2019s liens. This provision was enacted by Congress in 1901, <em>see </em>31 Stat. 1385, ch. 854 \u00a7 1245 (1901), and the 1973 codification was itself carried out by congressional action. In deferring to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals\u2019 construction of this provision, this court observed that \u201cin construing the D.C.Code we pay considerable deference to the pertinent recent decisions of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.\u201d <em>See </em>606 F.2d at 1360 n. 25.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1436-8\">. The Supreme Court, however, has since identified at least one additional circumstance in which deference will <em>not </em>be accorded to the decisions of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals construing Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 17 Acts of Congress. In <em>Whalen v. United States, </em>445 U.S. 684, 687, 100 S.Ct. 1432, 1435, 63 L.Ed.2d 715 (1980), the Court observed that it would not defer to the view of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals when resolution of a Double Jeopardy Clause claim turned on whether the relevant statute authorized imposition of successive sentences for rape and felony murder. In so ruling the Court observed that where resolution of a constitutional issue could not be separated from resolution of a question of statutory construction the Court would refuse to defer to the view of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. Justice Rehnquist dissented on this point, arguing that deference to the local court was proper where no egregious error had been committed. 445 U.S. at 707, 100 S.Ct. at 1446.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-9\">We are far from convinced, however, that the \"egregious error\u201d or <em>Whalen </em>exceptions apply to our application of <em>Erie </em>principles in this case. Nor do we believe that the approach taken by the Supreme Court in <em>Standard Oil Co. v. Johnson, </em>316 U.S. 481, 62 S.Ct. 1168, 86 L.Ed. 1611 (1942), providing for independent review of \u201chybrid\u201d local statutes incorporating federal legal standards, applies to our case. It is one thing for the Supreme Court, as the ultimate guardian of federal law, to adopt such exceptions. It is quite another thing for this court to adopt such exceptions as part of its <em>Erie </em>analysis. This is particularly true given the Court Reform Act\u2019s suggestion that we defer to the D.C. Court of Appeals\u2019 construction of local law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-13\">In any event, we need not reach these questions in this case. It is plain that there has been no egregious error here and, although appellants have challenged the constitutionality of a broad reading of the preclusion provisions, this allegation is simply frivolous. Nor is there a substantial federal interest in this case so as to invoke the rule in <em>Standard Oil.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1437-10\">. Under the D.C.
