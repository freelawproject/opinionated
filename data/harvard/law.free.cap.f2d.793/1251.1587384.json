The described contents included a weapon stated to have been described by defendant to the girl friend as an illegal machine gun, and bottles with the word \u201cnitroglycerin\u201d written on them. She stated to the affiant that defendant had told her that he had nitroglycerin in the apartment. She identified a photograph of a machine gun as resembling the gun she had seen in the apartment. Defendant\u2019s landlord told the affi-ant agent that she had seen in the apartment numerous bottles of chemicals and ammunition cans. This information meets the totality of circumstances test of <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-14\">The court submitted to the jury the issue of whether a thermite grenade, labeled on the can as \u201cGrenade Hand Incendiary, TH-3 AN-M14\u201d was a \u201cdestructive device\u201d within 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(a)(8) and 5845(f)(1)(B). There was testimony that the grenade is designed to destroy or disable, by burning, heavy equipment such as cannon or automobiles. It burns at approximately 4,000 degrees F and will burn through steel and melt a cannon barrel. Whether an item labeled as this was, and having the qualities this had, was an \u201cincendiary grenade\u201d under subsection (f)(1)(B) or was within the exception of subsection (f) of a \u201cdevice neither designed nor redesigned for use as a weapon\u201d was a matter for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-16\">The contention that a judgment of acquittal should have been granted on the count charging possession of a machine gun is totally without merit. This was a jury issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-17\">Defendant contends that there was insufficient evidence of the non-registration of the grenade. This argument was not presented to the district court and on appeal is raised for the first time in the reply brief. We will therefore not consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
