The only issue in this collateral attack on the conviction is whether his confession is involuntary because obtained by use of (un-kept) promises of lenity.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-12\">Cole contended that while he was in custody a police officer told him that he should confess, because if he did so he would be charged with manslaughter rather than murder. He confessed and was charged with murder. He also maintained that but for this promise he would not have confessed. After hearing evidence on the question, including the officer\u2019s denial, the trial judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-13\">The Court feels that the words and acts that the police officers as described by the Defendant did not constitute the coercion. There is nothing here to indicate that any of the acts or the words here were likely to produce any acts or words of the police officers that were likely to produce an untrustworthy confession.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-14\">This statement, which must be a victim of problems in transcription, is a conclusion that even if the officer said what Cole claims, the statement did not \u201ccoerce\u201d an \u201cuntrustworthy\u201d confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-16\">The state\u2019s appellate court affirmed the conviction in an unpublished opinion. The portion addressing the motion to suppress the confession states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-17\">[I]t is evident that the trial court accepted defendant\u2019s version that offers of leniency were made. However, even if defendant\u2019s account of offers of leniency are [sic] accurate, a review of case law regarding the voluntariness of confessions after such promises are made reveals that the totality of the circumstances surrounding the giving of the confession must be examined; and, establishing that an offer was made does not, in itself, establish involuntariness. <em>People v. Blaine [Baine </em>] (1st Dist.1980), 82 111. App.3d 604, 608, [38 Ill.Dec. 42] 403 N.E.2d 57, <em>appeal denied, </em>81 Ill.2d 594.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-18\">We have reviewed the circumstances surrounding the giving of the confessions in this case and conclude that the trial court did not err in ruling that defendant\u2019s statements were made voluntarily.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-19\">The district court denied Cole\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus, holding that the state courts\u2019 decision is supported by findings of fact that are binding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). 589 F.Supp. 848, 851-53 (N.D.Ill.1984). The district court reasoned that if the state courts accepted Cole\u2019s contention that there had been promises, yet found the confession voluntary, then they must have concluded that the officer\u2019s statement did not cause Cole to confess. Because a confession is involuntary only if \u201cobtained by\u201d the promises, this implicit finding of no causation made the state courts\u2019 decision invulnerable to attack. <em>Id. </em>at 851-52. The district court granted the state\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied Cole\u2019s application for a certificate of probable cause to appeal. (We later granted a certificate.)</p>\n<p id=\"b236-20\">The district judge assumed that a state court\u2019s finding of voluntariness is presumed correct by virtue of \u00a7 2254(d). Only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>by according the finding of voluntariness a presumption of correctness could the district court infer that the state courts <em>must </em>have found the absence of a causal link between the promise and the confession. Neither court stated that the promise did not induce Cole to confess. The district judge then used the implied finding of no causation to support the express conclusion that the confession was voluntary. This procedure \u2014 inferring lack of causation from the finding of voluntariness, then using lack of causation to demonstrate that the confession was voluntary \u2014 is circular, unless the state court\u2019s conclusion on vol-untariness is presumed correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Since the district court wrote, the Supreme Court has held that \u00a7 2254(d) does not apply to the ultimate conclusion of vol-untariness, although it does apply to subsidiary findings of fact. <em>Miller v. Fenton, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 445, 88 L.Ed.2d 405 (1985). <em>Miller </em>affects not only the appropriate standard of review but also the propriety of the method the district judge used to infer a finding of fact from silent opinions of the state courts. Given the holding of <em>Miller, </em>it is not permissible to infer from the state courts\u2019 conclusion that a confession was voluntary that the state courts \u201cmust have found\u201d one or another subsidiary fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">We do not decide whether Cole\u2019s confession was voluntary. The district court must reexamine that question in light of <em>Miller.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">Vacated and Remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
