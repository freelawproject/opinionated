The district court found that the International and the Local breached their duty of fair representation in connection with the layoff of Marcus Galindo by the Stoody Company (\u201cStoody\u201d). Specifically, the district judge found the Local liable for failing to notify Stoody that Galindo was a union steward, and thus entitled to seniority, and the Local and International liable for failing properly to prepare and present Galin-do\u2019s grievance at arbitration. We affirm the judgment as to the Local based on its failure to notify Stoody and reverse the judgment as to the Local and the International based on the presentation of Galin-do\u2019s grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1584-18\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1584-19\">Marcus Galindo was hired by Stoody in 1978. Galindo\u2019s employment at all times was governed by a collective bargaining agreement (\u201cthe Agreement\u201d) between Stoody and the Local and International. The Agreement provided that any layoffs would be conducted in reverse order of seniority. The Agreement also provided \u201csuper-seniority\u201d status for union stewards:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1584-20\">In the event of a layoff, top seniority for stewards will give them preference for retention in the classification, on the shift and department they were elected to____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1584-21\">The Agreement further stated that \u201cemployees shall be represented by a steward for each foreman or supervisor from their respective department.\u201d Finally, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1507\">*1507</page-number>Agreement required that \u201cthe [Local] will notify the Company within three (3) days of any replacement of stewards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1585-4\">In August 1982, Galindo was transferred to the \u201cstores\u201d department at Stoody. This department had only two employees\u2014 Galindo and a supervisor. In December 1982, Galindo asked Joe Peon, President of Local 803, if he was the steward for the \u201cstores\u201d department. Peon informed Gal-indo that he was a steward.</p>\n<p id=\"b1585-5\">In December and January, Galindo, concerned about rumors of impending layoffs, asked Peon if he had notified Stoody of his stewardship. On each occasion Peon stated that although he had not notified Stoody of Galindo\u2019s stewardship, he would do so. On February 2, 1983, Galindo\u2019s name appeared on a list of employees to be laid off on February 7. When Galindo approached Peon about this situation, Peon said, \u201cYeah, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1585-6\">Peon then sought, but failed, to convince Stoody\u2019s Director of Employee Eelations that he had notified the company that Gal-indo was a steward. Peon then called Adam Marthe, an International representative, and admitted that he had \u201cgoofed\u201d and needed help. At that time, Peon told Marthe that he had forgotten to tell Stoody that Galindo was a steward.</p>\n<p id=\"b1585-7\">After meetings between representatives of Stoody and the Local failed to prevent Galindo\u2019s layoff, the Local, assisted by Marthe, filed a grievance on behalf of Gal-indo. When the matter could not be resolved through the grievance process, the Local decided to take the case to arbitration. In preparation for arbitration, Marthe asked Galindo for a written statement concerning his testimony, but Galindo refused. Additionally, Marthe consulted with the Local\u2019s secretaries who searched for records of the union notifying the company concerning the appointment of stewards, but found none.</p>\n<p id=\"b1585-8\">At the arbitration hearing, Peon and Gal-indo testified that Peon had telephoned Stoody, in Galindo\u2019s presence, and informed a personnel department employee that Gal-indo was a steward. The arbitrator rejected this testimony in an opinion issued on June 1, 1983. In finding that the company was not obligated to recognize Galindo as a shop steward, the arbitrator found that the Union had failed to notify Stoody within three days of Galindo\u2019s \u201cappointment\u201d to a stewardship. The arbitrator also noted in passing that Galindo had never been formally elected a steward.</p>\n<p id=\"b1585-10\">On October 19, 1983, Galindo filed suit in federal district court seeking relief against Stoody, the Local, and the International under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185. The complaint alleged that Stoody had breached the Agreement by laying off Galindo (this claim was dropped before trial). The complaint also alleged that the Local and the International had breached their duty of fair representation by: (1) failing to use effective means to notify Stoody of Galindo\u2019s stewardship; (2) failing to \u201cproperly investigate Stoody\u2019s position concerning notification\u201d; and, (3) advising Galindo that he was not permitted to retain legal counsel at the arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1585-11\">At trial, both Galindo and Peon admitted that they had lied at the arbitration hearing when they testified that Peon had informed Stoody by telephone that Galindo was a steward.</p>\n<p id=\"b1585-12\">The district court held that the Local and the International had breached their duty of fair representation to Galindo in connection with his layoff. At the outset, the court ruled that Galindo was a steward even though he had never been elected and had never performed steward duties. It found that Peon waived the election requirement and that, in any event, an election would have been \u201cmeaningless\u201d because Galindo was the only non-supervisory employee in the department and thus had the only vote. The district court also held that \u201cno occasion [had arisen] for [Galindo] to discharge any of the specific duties of a steward\u201d in the two months between his appointment and layoff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1585-13\">The district court held that the Local\u2019s failure to notify Stoody was a breach of its duty of fair representation. As a separate finding of liability, the court found that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1508\">*1508</page-number>way Marthe had prepared and handled Gal-indo\u2019s arbitration constituted a breach of the duty of fair representation. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1586-4\">Mr. Marthe\u2019s failure to insist upon written statements from the witnesses, his failure to attempt to dissuade the union president from giving perjured testimony, and his failure to investigate past practice adequately and establish past practice with respect to informal notification and the waiving of election, all of this presents a picture of gross and unjustifiable negligence and breach of duty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOK\">The court found that the International was liable for this breach of the duty of fair representation because it undertook to represent Galindo. The court also found that the Local was liable because its duty to fairly represent one of its members, Galin-do, was \u201cnon-delegable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1586-5\">As to damages, the district court awarded lost wages and fringe benefits to Galin-do up to December 1, 1984.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Despite conflicting testimony, the court held that Gal-indo had never accepted or been offered an \u201cequivalent\u201d job, although he did work temporarily at another company. Accordingly, the judge awarded $26,000 to Galin-do for the Local\u2019s failure to notify the company that Galindo was a steward. This amount represented lost wages and fringe benefits from Galindo\u2019s layoff in February 1983 to December 1, 1984, mitigated by earnings at interim jobs. The damages for inadequate representation at the arbitration hearing also represented lost wages and fringe benefits through December 1, 1984, but were calculated from the date of the hearing (May 16, 1983). The district court awarded $22,000 for this second breach; this sum was \u201csubsumed\u201d in the $26,000 award.</p>\n<p id=\"b1586-6\">The Local and the International timely appealed. The appellants contend that the district court erred: (1) in finding that Gal-indo was a steward; (2) in finding that a breach of duty of fair representation had occurred; and (3) in computing damages. Appellants also contend that Galindo\u2019s suit was barred by the statute of limitations and that the issue of their conduct at arbitration was not before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1586-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1586-10\">I. <em>Whether Galindo\u2019s claims are barred by the statute of limitations.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1586-11\">Both parties agree that Galindo\u2019s claims are governed by the six-month statute of limitations of section 10(b) of the National Labor Relations Act. <em>See DelCostello v. International Brotherhood of Teamsters, </em>462 U.S. 151, 172, 103 S.Ct. 2281, 2294, 76 L.Ed.2d 476 (1983); <em>Peterson v. Kennedy, </em>771 F.2d 1244, 1251 (9th Cir.1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 1642, 90 L.Ed.2d 187 (1986). The parties disagree, however, on when the action accrued or, alternatively, whether the statute of limitations is tolled in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1586-14\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1586-15\">Where the facts are not in dispute, the date of accrual of a statute of limitations is a question of law reviewed <em>de novo. See Acri v. International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, </em>781 F.2d 1393, 1395 (9th Cir.1986); <em>see also Aragon v. Federated Department Stores, </em>750 F.2d 1447,1450 (9th Cir.) (whether limitations period is tolled is reviewed <em>de </em>novo), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 229, 88 L.Ed.2d 229 (1985), \u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 790, 88 L.Ed.2d 768 (1986). The dates on which the pertinent actions occurred in this case are not disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1586-20\">B. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1586-21\">The question in this case is whether Gal-indo\u2019s duty of fair representation claims accrued in February 1983, when he found out that Peon had failed to notify the company, or on June 1, 1983, when the arbitrator issued his order. Because Galindo\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1509\">*1509</page-number>suit was filed on October 19, 1983, a finding that his claims accrued in February would bar his action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1587-4\">Although the Court in <em>DelCostello </em>indicated that section 10(b) requires filing of a duty of fair representation claim within six months of the action\u2019s accrual, it did not provide guidance in determining when a duty of fair representation claim accrues. Courts have generally held that the section 10(b) limitations period begins to run when the employee \u201cdiscovers, or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered, the acts constituting the alleged [violation].\u201d <em>Howard v. Lockheed-Georgia Co., </em>742 F.2d 612, 614 (11th Cir.1984) (per curiam) (quoting <em>NLRB v. Don Burgess Construction Co., </em>596 F.2d 378, 382 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 940, 100 S.Ct. 293, 62 L.Ed.2d 306 (1979)). Thus, in a duty of fair representation case, the six-month period generally begins to run when an employee knows or should know of the alleged breach of duty of fair representation by a union. <em>See e.g., Dowty v. Pioneer Rural Electric Cooperative, Inc., </em>770 F.2d 52, 56 (6th Cir.) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 572, 88 L.Ed.2d 557 (1985); <em>Samples v. Ryder Truck Lines, Inc., </em>755 F.2d 881, 887 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1587-7\">This general rule, however, is not consistently applied. This court, in fact, recently acknowledged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1587-8\">The question remains open in this circuit \u201cwhether accrual occurs when the employee learns, or should have learned, that his dispute was finally resolved, ... or whether accrual occurs when the employee learns, or should have learned, that the union may have violated its duty of fair representation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1587-9\"><em>Harper v. San Diego Transit Corp., </em>764 F.2d 663, 669 (9th Cir.1985) (quoting <em>Bari-na v. Gulf Trading &amp; Transportation Co., </em>726 F.2d 560, 562 n. 2 (9th Cir.1984)). A reasoned analysis of the question when a duty of fair representation claim accrues must focus on the context in which the claim arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b1587-12\">The vast majority of duty of fair representation claims arise in the grievance procedure context: the employee claims that a union failed to process a grievance or mishandled its presentation. In determining when the six-month period accrues, the simplest case is one where a union decides not to file a grievance; the cause of action generally accrues when the employee learns or should have learned of the union\u2019s decision. <em>See e.g., Demars v. General Dynamics Corp., </em>779 F.2d 95, 97 (1st Cir.1985); <em>Harper, </em>764 F.2d at 669.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Similarly, where a duty of fair representation suit seeks to overturn an unfavorable arbitration award on the ground that the union committed errors in the arbitration proceedings, the claim accrues when the the employee learns of the arbitrator\u2019s award. <em>See e.g., Dowty, </em>770 F.2d at 56; <em>Samples, </em>755 F.2d at 887 n. 7. In this case, therefore, Galindo\u2019s duty of fair representation claim based on Marthe\u2019s alleged errors in presenting Galindo\u2019s grievance before the arbitrator did not accrue until Galindo learned of the arbitrator\u2019s decision on June 1, 1983; thus, this claim is timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1587-13\">The question of accrual becomes more complex where a duty of fair representation claim is not based on a union\u2019s processing of a grievance. Here, one of Galindo\u2019s claims is that the Local breached its duty of fair representation by failing to notify Stoody that Galindo was a steward. Galindo knew or should have known of this alleged breach no later than February 6, when he was laid off, and perhaps four days earlier when his name appeared on the list of employees to be laid off. Under the general accrual rule, then, this claim accrued in February of 1983 and would be time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1587-14\">The next inquiry is whether the availability of grievance procedures and arbitration proceedings should toll the limitations period. In <em>Adkins v. International Union of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1510\">*1510</page-number><em>Electrical, Radio &amp; Machine Workers, </em>769 F.2d 330 (6th Cir.1985), the Sixth Circuit recently considered this issue. It noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"avs-dedup-0\">The district court held here that, once the employees knew or should have known that a breach had occurred, their action accrued and the limitations period began to run, even if some possibility of nonjudicial enforcement remained. This rule would impel the swift filing \u00f3f hybrid claims at the expense of nonjudicial resolution of those claims. Certainly, the typical hybrid claim is based on the union\u2019s failure to properly process a grievance, so nonjudicial enforcement has already failed. But where the union\u2019s alleged breach of duty is in a non-grievance context, as here, the employees\u2019 good-faith attempt to exhaust their contractual remedies will prevent the accrual of their action. To hold otherwise would undercut the national policy favoring nonjudicial resolution of labor disputes. Although, as the jury found, here any attempt to use the grievance procedure in fact was futile, there was no accrual of the claim for the purposes of the limitation period so long as plaintiffs were making a valid, timely, and nonfriv-olous attempt to pursue their contractual remedies in reasonable good faith.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1588-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 336 (citations omitted).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For similar reasons, the Seventh Circuit recently held that the six-month limitation period on a duty of fair representation claim is tolled while an employee pursues intra-union grievance procedures, even if those procedures are ultimately futile. <em>See Fransden v. Brotherhood of Railway, Airline and Steamship Clerks, </em>782 F.2d 674, 681-84 (7th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1588-9\">The reasoning of the <em>Adkins </em>court is sound. An employee should not be penalized for seeking to resolve his dispute through the grievance process before filing a suit in federal court. Such a result would be particularly unsettling in this case; Galindo would be forced to claim in his duty of fair representation suit that the Local failed to notify Stoody while the Local argues in arbitration that it did notify the company. More importantly, such a rule would encourage the premature filing of duty of fair representation suits in lieu of resort to non-judicial grievance measures.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1588-10\">In sum, a fair representation claim based on how a grievance is presented to an arbitrator accrues when the employee learns of the arbitrator\u2019s decision. A fair representation claim not based on how a grievance is presented to an arbitrator is tolled while good faith attempts are made to resolve that claim through grievance procedures.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, Galindo\u2019s claim that the Local and International mishandled his arbitration did not accrue until June 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1511\">*1511</page-number>1983, when Galindo learned of the arbitrator\u2019s decision. His claim that the Local failed to notify Stoody were tolled until that time. <em>See Adkins, </em>769 F.2d at 336. Galindo\u2019s claims before the district court were thus timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1589-5\">II. <em>Whether Galindo was a Steward.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1589-6\">The appellants argue that Galindo was \u25a0 not a steward because he was not elected and because he never performed steward duties. Accordingly, they argue that they never were under a duty to inform Stoody that Galindo was a steward.</p>\n<p id=\"b1589-7\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1589-8\">The district court\u2019s finding that Galindo was a steward presents a factual determination that we review under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>See United States v. McConney, </em>728 F.2d 1195, 1201\u2014 02 (9th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 101, 83 L.Ed.2d 46 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1589-11\">Appellants contend that the district court failed to defer to the arbitrator\u2019s decision that Stoody did not have to recognize Galindo as a steward because he had not been elected. An arbitrator\u2019s factual determinations generally receive deference by the courts. <em>See Carpenters\u2019 Local Union No. 1478 v. Stevens, </em>743 F.2d 1271, 1275 (9th Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 2018, 85 L.Ed.2d 300 (1985). An arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement that draws its essence from the agreement may not be overturned merely because a court may have interpreted the contract differently. <em>See United Steelworkers of America v. Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp., </em>363 U.S. 593, 597, 80 S.Ct. 1358, 1361, 4 L.Ed.2d 1424 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b1589-14\">B. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1589-15\">There is substantial evidence to support the district court\u2019s finding that Galindo was a steward. Peon, the Local\u2019s president, testified that he had appointed Galindo a steward. Peon also testified that he had the power to make such appointments and in fact had appointed other stewards. Additionally, the chairman of the bargaining committee testified that Peon was responsible for determining who was a steward. Further, in its formal and informal attempts to prevent Galindo\u2019s layoff, appellants continually insisted that Gal-indo was a steward.</p>\n<p id=\"b1589-17\">Appellants argue on appeal that Galindo did not perform any of. the duties of a steward. As the district court found, however, Galindo was a steward for only a few months and had no occasion to handle a grievance or discharge or any other duties of a steward. Further, the fact that Galin-do was the only person in his department did not preclude him from being a steward. Although neither Galindo\u2019s predecessor or successor ever claimed to be a steward, there was at least one other steward, recognized by the company and the union, who represented a one-person department. A steward for Galindo\u2019s department was also proper under the Agreement because Gal-indo\u2019s department had a supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1589-18\">Finally, the appellants argue that Galin-do was not a steward because he was never elected. They note that both the International\u2019s constitution and the Local\u2019s by-laws require election of stewards. Moreover, the Agreement provides super-seniority for stewards \u201con the shift and department they were elected to.\u201d Because Galindo was the only person in his department, however, a formal election would have been unnecessary; Galindo would have been the only possible candidate and the only eligible voter. As the district court found: \u201cElection would have been meaningless in a one-man department, an empty formality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1589-19\">The election question, however, is more problematic in light of the arbitrator\u2019s finding that \u201cthe Agreement contemplates that shop stewards are elected to a term of office.\u201d Appellants argue that the district court should have deferred to the arbitrator\u2019s \u201cinterpretation\u201d on this issue. Several factors, however, counsel rejecting this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1589-20\">Initially, unlike the typical case in which deference to an arbitrator\u2019s decision is in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1512\">*1512</page-number>volved, Galindo does not seek to overturn an arbitration award. The arbitration involved Stoody\u2019s right to lay off Galindo. Here, Galindo\u2019s challenge is not to the merits of that award, but to the union\u2019s representation of Galindo at the arbitration hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1590-4\">Further, as the district court found, the Local did not address the election issue at arbitration. The Local\u2019s position at arbitration was that Stoody was notified that Galindo was a steward. The bulk of the arbitrator\u2019s decision is directed toward the notification issue. The arbitrator did not address the election question except as an afterthought in the last paragraph of his decision. Thus, although Stoody apparently brought up the election issue at arbitration, there is no indication that the arbitrator considered whether an election was necessary in a one-person department or, alternatively, whether the Local waived the election requirement. Because the election issue was not addressed at the arbitration hearing and was not the focus of the arbitrator\u2019s decision, the arbitrator\u2019s findings on this issue should not be dispositive, especially since one of Galindo\u2019s claims is based on the failure of the Local to present this issue.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1590-5\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s finding that Galindo was a steward was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1590-6\">III. <em>Whether the Duty of Fair Representation Claim Based on Marthe\u2019s Presentation of Galindo\u2019s Grievance to the Arbitrator was Properly Before the District Court.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1590-7\">Appellants assert that neither the pleadings nor the pretrial conference order raise the issue whether Marthe\u2019s presentation of Galindo\u2019s grievance to the arbitrator was a breach of the duty of fair representation. They note that the only related claim, that the union failed to properly investigate Stoody\u2019s \u201cposition concerning notification of union stewards,\u201d was expressly dropped before trial. Moreover, they point out that, aside from the claim that the Local advised Galindo that he was not permitted counsel,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Galindo expressly stated that Marthe\u2019s presentation of his grievance at arbitration was not at issue. Nevertheless, the district court found an independent breach of the duty of fair representation \u201cin connection with the way in which the arbitration was investigated, prepared and handled.\u201d Gal-indo contends that this issue was litigated and that the district court properly amended the pleadings to include this theory of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1590-11\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1590-12\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(b) permits the amendment of pleadings to conform to the evidence when the parties expressly or impliedly consent to the trial of unpleaded issues. This rule reflects the liberal policy favoring amendments of pleadings at any time. <em>Consolidated Data Terminals v. Applied Digital Data Systems, Inc., </em>708 F.2d 385, 396 (9th Cir.1983). Whether the trial court properly amended the pleadings pursuant to Rule 15(b) is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Davis &amp; Cox v. Summa Corp., </em>751 F.2d 1507, 1522 (9th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1513\">*1513</page-number>Cir.1985); <em>Save Lake Washington v.

Telex Computer Products, Inc., </em>709 F.2d 1287, 1294 (9th Cir.1983); <em>Consolidated Data, </em>708 F.2d at 396. It is not enough that an issue may be \u201cinferentially suggested by incidental evidence in the record,\u201d <em>Consolidated Data, </em>708 F.2d at 396 (quoting <em>Cole v. Layrite Products Co., </em>439 F.2d 958, 961 (9th Cir. 1971)); the record must indicate that the parties understood that the evidence was aimed at an unpleaded issue. <em>Id. </em>at 397.</p>\n<p id=\"b1591-7\">Here, the record is replete with direct references to whether Marthe\u2019s investigation and representation of Galindo\u2019s grievance before the arbitrator was a breach of the duty of fair representation. Marthe testified at length as to how he prepared for and presented Galindo's grievance at arbitration. Further, in overruling appellant\u2019s objection to Galindo\u2019s cross-examination of Marthe regarding Marthe\u2019s preparation, the court noted that \u201cthe entire case seems to involve the presentation of this grievance and whether some breach of the duty of fair representation was involved therein.\u201d Additionally, appellants\u2019 counsel expressly addressed this issue both in arguing its motion to dismiss the case and in closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1591-8\">Accordingly, appellants were not prejudiced by the post-trial amendment because they clearly understood that the issue of Marthe\u2019s presentation of Galindo\u2019s grievance was before the court. The district court, therefore, did not abuse its discretion by entering findings on this issue. <em>See Davis &amp; Cox, </em>751 F.2d at 1522.</p>\n<p id=\"b1591-10\">IV. <em>Whether the District Court Correctly Found a Breach of the Duty of Fair Representation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1591-11\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1591-12\">Whether a union\u2019s conduct amounted to a breach of its duty of fair representation presents a mixed question of law and fact that we review <em>de novo. See United States v. McConney, </em>728 F.2d at 1204; <em>see also Johnson v. United States Postal Service, </em>756 F.2d 1461, 1465 (9th Cir.1985) (court applied <em>de novo </em>standard of review to \u201cultimate findings\u201d of a trial court\u2019s grant of a union\u2019s motion to dismiss a duty of fair representation case). <em>But see Robesky v. Qantas Empire Airways Ltd., </em>573 F.2d 1082, 1091 (9th Cir.1978) (suggesting that breach of duty of fair representation is a question for the trier of fact); <em>Warren v. International Brotherhood of Teamsters, </em>544 F.2d 334, 341 (8th Cir.1976) (applying clearly erroneous standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b1591-14\">B. <em>Duty of Fair Representation Standard</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1591-15\">To establish a breach of a union\u2019s duty of fair representation, an employee most show that the union\u2019s conduct was \u201carbitrary, discriminatory, or in bad faith.\u201d <em>Vaca v. Sipes, </em>386 U.S. 171, 190, 87 S.Ct. 903, 916, 17 L.Ed.2d 842 (1967); <em>Peterson v. Kennedy, </em>771 F.2d 1244, 1253 (9th Cir.1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 1642, 90 L.Ed.2d 187 (1986); <em>Castelli v. Douglas Aircraft Co., </em>752 F.2d 1480, 1482 (9th Cir.1985). In the grievance context, this standard prohibits a union from ignoring a meritorious grievance or processing that grievance perfunctorily. <em>Vaca, </em>386 U.S. at 191, <em>Castelli, </em>752 F.2d at 1483. A union, however, need not process a meritless grievance. <em>See Johnson, </em>756 F.2d at 1465.</p>\n<p id=\"b1592-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1514\">*1514</page-number>Because unions must retain discretion to act in what they perceive to be their members\u2019 best interests, we have narrowly construed this doctrine. <em>See Peterson, </em>771 F.2d at 1253; <em>Johnson, </em>756 F.2d at 1465. Thus, a union\u2019s representation of its members \u201cneed not be error free.\u201d <em>Castelli, </em>752 F.2d at 1482. We have repeatedly held that mere negligent conduct by a union does not constitute a breach of the union\u2019s duty of fair representation. <em>Peterson, </em>771 F.2d at 1253.</p>\n<p id=\"b1592-4\">In some cases, however, \u201can act of omission by a union may be so egregious and unfair as to be arbitrary, thus constituting a breach of the duty of fair representation.\u201d <em>Castelli, </em>752 F.2d at 1482 (citing <em>Robesky, </em>573 F.2d at 1090). The distinction between an error that is \u201carbitrary\u201d and one that is merely negligent has vexed this court. <em>See Peterson, </em>771 F.2d at 1253; <em>Dutrisac v. Caterpillar Tractor Co., </em>749 F.2d 1270, 1272 (9th Cir.1983). Various cases have elaborated a number of possible standards<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> for determining when an omission rises to the level of arbitrariness. In <em>Peterson, </em>we recently attempted to synthesize the various standards set forth in previous cases. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1592-5\">There are some significant general principles that emerge from our previous decisions. In all cases in which we found a breach of the duty of fair representation based on a union\u2019s arbitrary conduct, it is clear that the union failed to perform a procedural or ministeral act, that the act in question did not require the exercise of judgment and that there was no rational and proper basis for the union\u2019s conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1592-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1254; <em>see Dutrisac, </em>749 F.2d at 1274 (\u201c[W]e limit our holding that union negligence may breach the duty of fair representation to cases in which the individual interest at stake is strong and the union\u2019s failure to perform a ministerial act completely extinguishes the employee\u2019s right to pursue his claim.\u201d), <em>cited in Evangelista v. Inlandboatmen\u2019s Union of Pacific, </em>777 F.2d 1390,1399 n. 5 (9th Cir.1985); <em>see also Eichelberger v. NLRB, </em>765 F.2d 851, 855 n. 7 (9th Cir.1985) <em>(\u201cDutrisac </em>may further be limited to situations where a true ministerial act is involved.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1592-9\">Under <em>Peterson </em>and <em>Dutrisac, </em>then, the crucial inquiry is whether the union\u2019s error involved a judgmental or ministerial act. Additionally, the union\u2019s conduct must prejudice a strong interest of the employee. <em>See Dutrisac, </em>749 F.2d at 1274; <em>Eichelberger, </em>765 F.2d at 855.</p>\n<p id=\"b1592-10\">C. <em>The Failure to Notify Stoody</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1592-11\">Under the <em>Peterson </em>standard, or any other test, it is hard to imagine a more clear case of arbitrary conduct than Peon\u2019s failure to notify Stoody that Galindo was a steward. This was a mere \u201cministerial\u201d act that required no judgment. There is no rational explanation for Peon\u2019s failure simply to write or telephone Stoody. Moreover, the act was severely detrimental to a strong individual interest; had Stoody been notified, Galindo would probably not have been laid off. <em>See Dutrisac, </em>749 F.2d at 1274 (finding breach of duty of fair representation where union failed to pursue timely a meritorious grievance); <em>Tenorio v. NLRB, </em>680 F.2d 598, 602 (9th Cir.1982) (finding breach of duty of fair representation where union rejected grievance without hearing employees\u2019 explanation of facts leading to their discharge). Peon\u2019s error is especially egregious in light of the rumors of impending layoffs and Galindo\u2019s repeated queries as to whether Peon had notified Stoody. Although Galindo attempted to retain his job through informal meetings between representatives of Stoody and the Local, grievance proceedings, and arbitration, Peon\u2019s failure to notify Stoody effectively extinguished Galindo\u2019s seniority rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1515\">*1515</page-number>Accordingly, Peon\u2019s unjustified failure to notify Stoody that Galindo was a steward constitutes \u201carbitrary\u201d conduct. The district court thus properly held this to be a breach of the Local\u2019s duty of fair representation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1593-5\">D. <em>Presentation of Galindo\u2019s Claim at Arbitration</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1593-6\">The district court also found that Marthe\u2019s presentation of Galindo\u2019s claim before the arbitrator constituted a breach of the duty of fair representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1593-7\">This court has repeatedly acknowledged that unions are afforded wide latitude in determining how to handle a grievance; in fact, \u201ca union\u2019s conduct may not be deemed arbitrary simply because of an error in evaluating the merits of a grievance ... <em>or in presenting the grievance at an arbitration hearing. \u201d Peterson, </em>771 F.2d at 1254 (emphasis added) (citing <em>Dutrisac, </em>749 F.2d at 1273); <em>see Ness v. Safeway Stores, Inc., </em>598 F.2d 558, 560-61 (9th Cir.1979) (per curiam) (no breach where union decided to convene adjustment board with one of its members missing). Thus, the district court\u2019s reliance on \u201cMr. Marthe\u2019s failure to insist upon written statements\u201d and \u201chis failure to investigate past practice [of stewardship notification] adequately\u201d is misplaced. At worst, these are negligent errors of judgment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Similarly, the apparent failure of Marthe to bring up the election issue at arbitration reflects a judgmental decision by Marthe; he may have decided not to call attention to that issue for tactical reasons. Moreover, because the thrust of the arbitrator\u2019s decision involved Peon\u2019s failure to notify Stoody, the arbitrator\u2019s award would not have been affected by a finding that an election was unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1593-11\">Marthe\u2019s overall representation of Galin-do at the arbitration was, at worst, negligent.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In fact, the district court concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1516\">*1516</page-number>that his combined errors were \u201cgross and unjustifiable negligence.\u201d His representation cannot be deemed an irrational failure to perform a \u201cministerial\u201d act.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, the district court erred in finding that Marthe\u2019s handling of Galindo\u2019s grievance was a breach of the duty of fair representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1594-4\">Y. <em>Whether the District Court Properly Computed Galindo\u2019s Damages.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1594-5\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1594-6\">A district court\u2019s computation of damages is a finding of fact reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>See Woods v. United States, </em>724 F.2d 1444, 1451 (9th Cir.1984). Whether the district court selected the correct legal standard in computing damages is reviewed <em>de novo. See McConney, </em>728 F.2d at 1201.</p>\n<p id=\"b1594-7\">B. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1594-8\">\u201cThe fundamental purpose of unfair representation suits is to compensate for injuries caused by violations of employees\u2019 rights.\u201d <em>International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers v. Foust, </em>442 U.S. 42, 49-50, 99 S.Ct. 2121, 2126-27, 60 L.Ed.2d 698 (1979). Accordingly, a union is liable to an employee for compensatory damages flowing from the union\u2019s conduct. <em>See Bowen v. United States Postal Service, </em>459 U.S. 212, 224-31, 103 S.Ct. 588, 595-99, 74 L.Ed.2d 402 (1983); <em>Vaca v.

International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, </em>572 F.2d 710, 718-19 (10th Cir.1978) (approving award of compensatory damages against union where court instructed the jury to consider wages and fringe benefits), <em>rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>442 U.S. 42, 99 S.Ct. 2121, 60 L.Ed.2d 698 (1979); <em>Richardson v. Communications Workers of America, </em>486 F.2d 801, 806 (8th Cir.1973) (approving similar instruction in suit against employer and union); <em>see also Pitts v. Frito-Lay, </em>700 F.2d 330, 334-35 (6th Cir.1983) (lost wages awardable if chargeable to union conduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b1594-13\">The damages awarded by the district court included lost wages through December 1, 1984, offset by wages earned at other employment. The district court expressly \u201callowed a sum for the loss of fringe benefits which plaintiff would have earned at Stoody during the period covered by the damage award.\u201d The appellants challenge this award on three grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1594-14\">First, they contend that their liability for lost wages should have ended in May 1983, when Galindo allegedly received an offer of employment from Porvene-Rol-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1517\">*1517</page-number>A-Roof. Appellants, analogizing this case to NLRB back-pay awards for unfair labor practices, contend that Galindo\u2019s refusal to accept the offer curtailed its damage liability. <em>See Phelps Dodge Corp. v. NLRB, </em>313 U.S. 177, 199-200, 61 S.Ct. 845, 855, 85 L.Ed. 1271 (1941); <em>Canova v. NLRB, </em>708 F.2d 1498, 1506 (9th Cir.1983). In this case, however, the district court expressly accepted Galindo\u2019s testimony that he did not receive such an offer. Although appellants challenge this finding on appeal, it was for the district court to determine whether an offer was made. <em>See Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1512-13, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985) (credibility determination of district court entitled to great deference and \u201ccan virtually never be clear error\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1595-5\">Appellants also contend that its lost-wage liability should have ended when Galindo obtained temporary interim employment. This contention is meritless and contrary to the NLRB cases to which appellants analogize; interim employment <em>reduces, </em>but does not <em>cut off, </em>back-pay liability. <em>See Phelps-Dodge, </em>313 U.S. at 198, 61 S.Ct. at 854; <em>Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union v. NLRB, </em>547 F.2d 598, 602 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1078, 97 S.Ct. 823, 50 L.Ed.2d 798 (1977). Because damages for duty of fair representation suits are intended to make the plaintiff whole, the district court properly held that Galindo\u2019s interim earnings should only be deducted from his lost earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1595-6\">Finally, appellants contend that the court erred in awarding a sum representing lost fringe benefits. We recognize that fringe benefits are an important part of an employee\u2019s overall compensation package. Accordingly, a damage award in a duty of fair representation suit should include those fringe benefits which the employee would have actually received had his or her employment not been wrongfully terminated. <em>See Foust, </em>572 F.2d at 718-19; <em>see also Local 2750, Lumber &amp; Sawmill Workers v. Cole, </em>663 F.2d 983, 987 (9th Cir.1981) (damages awarded against employer for breach of contract that failed to include loss of seniority pay and vacation benefits \u201cdid not make discharged employee whole\u201d). Where an employee\u2019s fringe benefits include medical and life insurance, a plaintiff should be compensated for the loss of those benefits if the plaintiff has purchased substitute insurance coverage or has incurred, uninsured, out-of-pocket medical expenses for which he or she would have been reimbursed under the employer\u2019s insurance plan.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1595-9\">In this case, however, the district court awarded Galindo the value of the medical and life insurance premiums that Stoody would have paid on his behalf had his employment not been interrupted without a showing that Galindo would have received any payments thereunder, or that he actually incurred expenses for substitute medical or life insurance coverage. Such an award was improper because lost insurance coverage, unless replaced or unless actual expenses are incurred, is simply not a monetary benefit owing to the plaintiff. To include such an award, then, would make a plaintiff more than whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b1595-10\">Accordingly, the district court should determine on remand the amount of any actual expenses incurred by Galindo as a result of lost medical and life insurance benefits. Galindo is, of course, entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1518\">*1518</page-number>any lost seniority pay, vacation pay, or any other fringe benefits that he would have actually received. <em>See Cole, </em>663 F.2d at 983.</p>\n<p id=\"b1596-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1596-5\">Galindo\u2019s claim based on Peon\u2019s failure to notify Stoody that Galindo was a steward was timely filed. The trial court properly found that Galindo was a steward and that Peon\u2019s failure to notify Stoody was a breach of the Local\u2019s duty of fair representation. The judgment against the Local on this claim is therefore affirmed. The damage award of $26,000 is also affirmed except to the extent that the district court is required on remand to recompute the award consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1596-6\">The claim based on Marthe\u2019s preparation and presentation of Galindo\u2019s grievance at arbitration was properly before the district court. The court erred, however, in finding a breach of duty of fair representation based on Marthe\u2019s preparation and presentation of Galindo\u2019s grievance. Accordingly, the judgment against the Local and International on this ground is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1596-7\">AFFIRMED in part; REVERSED AND REMANDED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1586-7\">. On this date, the Local and Stoody negotiated a new collective bargaining agreement which eliminated stewards in one-man departments. The district court found that even if Galindo had retained his job in February, 1983, he would have been laid off on December 1, 1984 under the new Agreement. This cut-off date is not challenged on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1587-10\">. <em>But cf. Barina v. Gulf Trading and Transportation Co., </em>726 F.2d 560, 562 n. 2 (9th Cir.1984) (suggesting that a claim does not accrue until the last date at which the union could have brought the grievance under the collective bargaining agreement).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1588-5\">. <em>See also Proudfoot v.

The countervailing argument, of course, is that federal law also favors early resolution of labor disputes. <em>See DelCostello, </em>462 U.S. at 168, 103 S.Ct. at 2292. We believe, however, that the policy of non-judicial resolution of labor disputes should outweigh the policy of prompt resolution of labor disputes in cases where the pursuit of contractual remedies would toll the statute for only a few months.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1588-12\">.

International Association of Machinists, </em>781 F.2d 1393, 1396 n. 1 (9th Cir.1986). Similarly, resort to the grievance process should toll the limitations period only if the grievance is related to the alleged breach of duty of fair representation. <em>See Vallone v.

Great Dane Trailers, Inc., </em>388 U.S. 26, 33-34, 87 S.Ct. 1792, 18 L.Ed.2d 1027 (1967); <em>Paintsmiths, </em>620 F.2d at 1330; <em>J.L. Foti Construction Co. v. Laborers\u2019 International Union of North America, </em>742 F.2d 994, 999 (6th Cir.1984). Because of the importance of union stewards in administering collective bargaining agreements, super-seniority benefits for stewards are presumptively valid if those benefits are limited to lay-off and recall; benefits beyond layoff and recall, however, are generally invalid. <em>See Paintsmiths, </em>620 F.2d at 1330, <em>Dairylea Coopera-five, </em>219 N.L.R.B. 656, 658 (1975), <em>enf'd, NLRB v. Milk Drivers &amp; Dairy Employees Local 338, </em>531 F.2d 1162 (2d Cir.1976); <em>see also Permaline Corp. of America v. Sign Pictorial &amp; Display Union Local 230, </em>639 F.2d 890 (2nd Cir.1981) (invalidating provisions requiring union approval before stewards could be discharged, even for cause).</p>\n<p id=\"b1593-13\">Here, the super-seniority benefits afforded Galindo under the Agreement are presumptively valid because they were limited to layoff and recall. Because appellants have failed to show that Galindo was not a legitimate steward, they have failed to establish that Galindo\u2019s stewardship was illegal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1593-14\">. In fact, Marthe requested written statements from Peon and Galindo (they refused) and inquired at the Local\u2019s office as to records of prior stewardship notification (he found none). It appears that Marthe performed at least a \"minimal investigation\u201d in preparing for arbitration. <em>Cf. Tenorio, </em>680 F.2d at 601 (union failed to conduct minimal investigation); <em>see also Eichel-berger, </em>765 F.2d at 857 n. 10 (\u201cThe ruling of <em>[Tenorio] </em>finding a negligent failure to investigate ... was expressly limited to those particular circumstances.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1593-15\">. The district court also focused on Marthe\u2019s \"failure\u201d to dissuade Galindo and Peon from falsely testifying at the arbitration hearing. The record indicates, however, that Marthe did not know that Peon and Galindo would testify falsely. Marthe stated that he did not know of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1516\">*1516</page-number>fabrication and in fact told Peon and Galindo to tell the truth at arbitration. This was corroborated by Peon, who stated that he never told Marthe that he intended to lie and that Marthe told him to testify truthfully.</p>\n<p id=\"b1594-10\">Moreover, even assuming that Marthe should have known of the fabrication, his decision to proceed at arbitration on the theory that Peon notified Stoody is a judgmental decision. This tactic may have been ethically improper if Marthe in fact knew that the evidence was false. Because it did not involve a ministerial act, however, Marthe\u2019s conduct, though possibly over-zealous, was not \"arbitrary.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1594-11\">. Further, Marthe\u2019s conduct in presenting the grievance at arbitration did not prejudice Galin-do's rights. Because of Peon's failure to notify Stoody, Galindo\u2019s grievance against Stoody was essentially meritless from the outset. Since appellants could have refused to take a meritless grievance to arbitration, <em>see Johnson, </em>756 F.2d at 1465, their attempt to present the grievance in a meritorious light is not a breach of their duty of fair representation. <em>Cf. Eichelberger, </em>765 F.2d at 855 n. 7 (union\u2019s failure to perform ministerial act not a breach of the duty of fair representation if employee\u2019s grievance was mer-itless, although it may have been if the grievance were legitimate).</p>\n<p id=\"b1594-16\">We do not mean to imply, however, that the grievance was frivolous or not brought in good faith for the purposes of tolling the statute of limitations. <em>See Adkins, </em>769 F.2d at 336 (suit tolled during \u201ca valid, timely, and non-frivolous attempt to pursue [one\u2019s] contractural remedies in reasonable good faith\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1594-17\">. The issue in <em>Bowen </em>and <em>Vaca </em>was the apportionment of damages between the union and the employer in a successful \"hybrid\u201d suit (alleging a breach of the duty of fair representation against the union and breach of a collective bargaining agreement against the employer). Because Galindo\u2019s claim against Stoody was dropped, apportionment is not at issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1595-7\">. <em>See Foust, </em>572 F.2d at 718 &amp; n. la (suggesting that plaintiff is limited to actual expenses incurred as a result of lost insurance coverage); <em>cf. Syvock v. Milwaukee Boiler Manufacturing Co., </em>665 F.2d 149, 161 (7th Cir.1981) (in a case under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to award lost insurance benefits where plaintiff had not purchased alternate coverage); <em>Bonura </em>v. <em>Chase Manhattan Bank N.A., </em>629 F.Supp 353, 359 (S.D.N.Y.1986) (suggesting that awards under ADEA should be limited to out-of-pocket expenses). <em>But cf. Fariss v. Lynch-burg Foundation, </em>769 F.2d 958, 965 (4th Cir. 1985) (indicating plaintiff in an ADEA case might recover the cost to employer of providing insurance even where no substitute insurance is purchased); <em>Jacobson v. Pitman Moore, Inc., </em>582 F.Supp. 169, 179 (D.Minn.1984) (award of lost insurance benefits in ADEA case not limited to actual expenses).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
