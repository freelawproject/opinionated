In its brief on appeal Safeco contended that interest did not begin running until 30 days after entry of a final judgment. At oral argument Safeco conceded that plaintiffs were entitled to prejudgment interest and that the only difference between Safeco and plaintiffs on this. subject was whether interest began running 30 days after the proof of loss was filed or 60 days after proof of loss was filed, depending on which of two versions of Safeco\u2019s policy was in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-25\">Bearing in mind Safeco\u2019s concession, and our inability to say that the court erred in choosing 30 days after proof of loss was filed as the trigger date, we grant plaintiffs\u2019 petition for rehearing. We vacate our holding concerning prejudgment interest and affirm the judgment of the district' court with respect to prejudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-26\">Petition for rehearing GRANTED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
