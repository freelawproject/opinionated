Petitioner filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging a notice of deficiency issued by the respondent, Commissioner of Internal Revenue. The court concluded that no issues of material fact precluded granting respondent\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The court determined that the wages earned by petitioner are taxable; the altered Treasury Form 1040 filed by petitioner did not constitute a return under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6011 (1982); and that petitioner therefore owed additional tax for willfully filing a late return in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6651(a)(1), 6653(a) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-24\">Upon review of the record, we conclude no genuine issue of material fact precluded the Tax Court from granting summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>judgment to respondent. In our view, petitioner\u2019s wages are taxable as gross income, <em>see Eisner v. Macomber, </em>252 U.S. 189, 207, 40 S.Ct. 189, 193, 64 L.Ed. 521 (1920), and petitioner\u2019s altered 1040 form does not constitute a \u201creturn\u201d in compliance with 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6011(a) (1982). <em>See Counts v. Commissioner, </em>774 F.2d 426, 427 (11th Cir. 1985) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">The decision of the Tax Court is hereby affirmed without sanctions against petitioner, based upon the Tax Court decision reported at 82 T.C. 766 (1984).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
