Corrigan and Corrigan Enterprises, Inc., in United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, alleging that the defendants had breached their fiduciary duty to the Trust under ERISA and under state common law. Following a jury verdict in favor of the Trust and a remittitur, the district court entered a judgment awarding the Trust $552,611.87 actual damages and $1,250,000 punitive damages. Corrigan and Corrigan Enterprises appeal, asserting that the district court committed numerous errors. The Trust cross-appeals. We reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for new trial on both liability and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1535-19\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1535-20\">The Sommers Drug Store Company was incorporated in Delaware in 1947. Until its sale in 1977, the company engaged primarily in the retail pharmaceutical business. Its principal offices were in San Antonio, Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b1535-21\">Walter N. Corrigan became president of Sommers and a member of its board of directors in the mid-1950s. At about the same time, Sommers established a pension plan for its employees, consisting of an Employee Profit Sharing Plan and the Employee Profit Sharing Trust. Under the terms of the pension plan agreement as amended in 1976, Sommers, acting through its board of directors, had the power to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1458\">*1458</page-number>appoint the plan administrator and the trustees of the Trust. The plan administrator had the power to value the assets held by the Trust. The trustees had the power to \u201cmanage, control, sell, exchange or lease\u201d assets held by the Trust \u201cat such prices and upon such terms and conditions as they deem desirable.\u201d Sommers retained the power to \u201csuspend or discontinue its contributions under the Plan, and to terminate, at any time, the Trust created under this Agreement.\u201d Walter Corrigan served as a trustee of the Trust from its inception until May 27, 1976. He became a trustee again on January 1, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b1536-4\">During the period of his employment at Sommers, Walter Corrigan gradually acquired the company\u2019s stock. By 1977 he owned approximately 47% of the outstanding shares. The Trust held about 16% of the outstanding shares. Sommers operated forty drug stores in San Antonio, Austin, and Beaumont, Texas. The company\u2019s wholly owned subsidiary, Crockett Realty Company, owned three tracts of land, the East Houston Street and Gembler Road properties in San Antonio and a coast house in Port Aransas, Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b1536-5\">In the early and mid-1970s Sommers\u2019 board of directors explored the possibility of merging the company with or selling it to one of several national drug store companies that had expressed interest. These explorations did not bear fruit until 1977, when the board entered into negotiations with Malone &amp; Hyde, Inc., a Tennessee corporation. To facilitate a deal with Malone &amp; Hyde, the board decided to recommend shareholder approval of a reverse stock split, under which 250 shares of $1 par stock would be converted into one share of $250 par stock, with Sommers purchasing fractional shares. The shareholders approved this plan on June 27, 1977. The reverse split reduced the number of shareholders from 66 to 16. Som-mers paid $40 per pre-split share for the fractional shares. Following the split, Walter Corrigan held approximately 52% of Sommers\u2019 outstanding shares, and the Trust held roughly 20%.</p>\n<p id=\"b1536-6\">In July 1977 Malone &amp; Hyde reached an agreement with Sommers under which Malone &amp; Hyde would purchase all of Som-mers\u2019 drug store assets and its trade name. Sommers would remain responsible for its debts. Sommers also would retain ownership of the Crockett Realty Company, which was to lease the East Houston Street property to Malone &amp; Hyde for three years. Malone &amp; Hyde was to hire Walter Corrigan for ten years at $100,000 per year.</p>\n<p id=\"b1536-7\">The Sommers shareholders, including the Trust, approved the proposed sale in August 1977. The transaction was consummated not long afterward; Sommers received cash in excess of five million dollars and was responsible for debts exceeding two million dollars. Sommers changed its name to Corrigan Enterprises, Inc., in accordance with the agreement to surrender its trade name.</p>\n<p id=\"b1536-8\">Sometime after the reverse stock split, Walter Corrigan and Sommers/Corrigan Enterprises began offering to buy the stock held by the other fifteen shareholders at $40 per pre-split share, or $10,000 per post-split share. Several shareholders took advantage of this offer. After the sale of Sommers\u2019 assets to Malone &amp; Hyde, the Trust\u2019s trustees began considering whether to sell the Trust\u2019s shares. A debate ensued among the Trust beneficiaries over whether the offered price was adequate. Ultimately, the trustees decided to accept the offer. The beneficiaries approved this decision at a meeting on December 16, 1977. The sale was consummated on March 6, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b1536-9\">This action was filed in October 1980. The original complaint stated causes of action for securities fraud and breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA. Subsequent amendments added claims for breach of common-law fiduciary duty and for RICO violations. The plaintiffs\u2019 fourth amended complaint, filed during trial, dropped all except the ERISA and common-law claims. The common-law claim was amended to allege that the defendants had breached a duty to the Trust to liquidate Corrigan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1459\">*1459</page-number>Enterprises and distribute the proceeds pro rata to the shareholders.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Both the ERISA and the common-law counts retained the allegation that the defendants had breached a duty to disclose material information to the plaintiffs. The district court held that ERISA preempted the state law claim, and the case was submitted to the jury on the ERISA claim alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b1537-4\">The jury found that both Walter Corri-gan and Corrigan Enterprises had breached their fiduciary duty to the Trust under ERISA. The jury fixed the fair market value of the Trust\u2019s stock at $1,146,846 and assessed punitive damages of $1,000,000 against Walter Corrigan and $1,500,000 against Corrigan Enterprises. The district court granted defendants\u2019 motion for a re-mittitur and entered judgment in favor of the Trust for $552,611.87 actual damages and $1,250,000 punitive damages, $500,000 against Walter Corrigan and $750,000 against Corrigan Enterprises.</p>\n<p id=\"b1537-5\">On this appeal, we reverse the district court\u2019s judgment on liability because of an improper jury instruction, on actual damages because of insufficient evidence, and on punitive damages because under ERISA the Trust may not recover such damages. We discuss the ERISA preemption issue raised by the Trust\u2019s cross-appeal to guide the district court on remand. We pretermit consideration of the other issues raised by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1537-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1537-7\">A. <em>Jury Instruction on Fiduciary Duty</em></p>\n<p id=\"AlE\">The district court instructed the jury as follows on the issue of the appellants\u2019 fiduciary duty under ERISA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1537-8\">For purposes of ERISA, a person is a fiduciary with respect to a plan to the extent he exercises any discretionary authority or discretionary control respecting management of the plan or exercises any authority or control respecting management or disposition of its assets. Under ERISA the trustee or trustees shall have exclusive authority and discretion to manage and control the assets of the plan. Whether Walter Corrigan or Corrigan Enterprises, Inc. exercised any authority or control respecting management or disposition of the plan\u2019s assets, depends, therefore, upon whether either Defendant exercised authority or control over the trustees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1537-11\">Appellants contend that this instruction permitted the jury to find that Corrigan and Corrigan Enterprises were fiduciaries with respect to the sale of the Trust\u2019s stock merely by virtue of their status as, respectively, officer, director, and principal shareholder of Corrigan Enterprises and former employer of the trustees. In reviewing a jury instruction, \u201cwe view the charge as a whole, in the context of the entire case, and we ignore technical imperfections____ We will reverse \u2018[if] the charge as a whole leaves us with a substantial and ineradicable doubt whether the jury has been properly guided in its deliberations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pierce v. Ramsey Winch Co., </em>753 F.2d 416, 425 (5th Cir.1985) (quoting <em>McCullough v. Beech Aircraft Corp., </em>587 F.2d 754, 759 (5th Cir.1979)). Applying this standard to the charge before us, we conclude that the district court committed reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1537-14\">ERISA \u00a7 3(21)(A), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(21)(A) (1982), states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1537-16\">[A] person is a fiduciary with respect to a plan <em>to the extent </em>(i) he exercises any discretionary authority or discretionary control respecting management of such plan or exercises any authority or control respecting management or disposition of its assets ... or (iii) he has any discretionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the administration of such plan. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1537-17\">The phrase \u201cto the extent\u201d indicates that a person is a fiduciary only with respect to those aspects of the plan over which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1460\">*1460</page-number>exercises authority or control. <em>See Brandt v. Grounds, </em>687 F.2d 895, 897 (7th Cir. 1982). For example, if an employer and its board of directors have no power with respect to a plan other than to appoint the plan administrator and the trustees, then their fiduciary duty extends only to those functions. <em>See Gelardi v. Pertec Computer Corp., </em>761 F.2d 1323, 1325 (9th Cir. 1985); <em>Leigh v. Engle, </em>727 F.2d 113,133-35 (7th Cir.1984); 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2509.75-8 D-4 (1985) (Department of Labor interpretation of \u00a7 3(21)(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1538-4\">In this case, the trustees had exclusive authority under the terms of the Trust to \u201cmanage, control, sell, exchange or lease\u201d the Trust\u2019s assets. Corrigan and Corrigan Enterprises were given no such authority, and their authority in other matters did not make them fiduciaries with respect to matters over which they had no authority. Thus, as the district court stated in its instruction, the appellants\u2019 status as fiduciaries with respect to the sale of the Trust\u2019s stock depends on whether they controlled the trustees\u2019 decision to sell.</p>\n<p id=\"b1538-5\">The instruction did not go far enough, however, in spelling out the nature of the control required before Corrigan and Corri-gan Enterprises could be considered fiduciaries. First, the district court should have instructed the jury that the defendants could be found fiduciaries with respect to the sale of the trust\u2019s stock <em>only </em>if they controlled the trustees\u2019 decision to sell. Second, the court should have instructed the jury that it could not infer that the defendants controlled the trustees\u2019 decision merely from the defendants\u2019 status as the trustees\u2019 former employer (in the case of Corrigan Enterprises) or as an officer and director and principal shareholder of the employer (in the case of Walter Corrigan). Nor could the jury infer control merely from the defendants\u2019 power to appoint the trustees. To permit an inference of control from these relations alone would vitiate the notion of limited fiduciary responsibility established by the \u201cto the extent\u201d language in ERISA \u00a7 3(21)(A). Rather, the district court should have instructed the jury that it could find the requisite control only if the defendants, either through the use of their positions or otherwise, caused the trustees to relinquish their independent discretion in deciding whether to sell the Trust\u2019s stock and to follow instead the course prescribed by the defendants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1538-8\">In light of the district court\u2019s improper instruction on the fiduciary issue, we reverse the district court\u2019s judgment of liability on the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1538-9\">B. <em>Fair Market Value</em></p>\n<p id=\"ayd-dedup-0\">The jury determined that the fair market value of the Trust\u2019s stock was $1,146,846, precisely the amount offered by the Trust\u2019s expert witness, Dan Hanke. This represents approximately $108.68 per pre-split share, or $27,171.15 per post-split share for each of the Trust\u2019s shares. By contrast, the defendants\u2019 expert, Dr. Sam Hadaway, concluded that the value per presplit share was $25 before the Malone &amp; Hyde transaction and $34 afterward. The district court entered judgment for $552,-611.87 actual damages, representing the fair market value determined by the jury, less the $400,000 purchase price paid to the Trust by the defendants, less a remittitur for the percentage interest of those beneficiaries who had opted out of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1538-10\">Appellants argue that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding of fair market value.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Their principal contention is that Hanke\u2019s testimony lacked probative value because his valuation was based on liquidation or asset value rather than fair market value. We must sustain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1461\">*1461</page-number>the jury\u2019s fair market value determination if, viewing the record as a whole and in the light most favorable to appellees, reasonable jurors could have made the finding that the jurors made in this case. <em>See Carlton v. Shelton, </em>722 F.2d 203, 205 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>467 U.S. 1206, 104 S.Ct. 2389, 81 L.Ed.2d 347 (1984); <em>cf Boeing Co. v. Shipman, </em>411 F.2d 365, 374-75 (5th Cir. 1969) (en banc) (applying standard to motions for directed verdict and j.n.o.v.). Because the jury relied so heavily on Hanke\u2019s valuation, however, we must examine his testimony carefully to determine if the record supports the jury\u2019s finding. <em>See Copper Liquor, Inc. v. Adolph Coors Co., </em>506 F.2d 934, 951 (5th Cir.1975).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1539-4\">Hanke determined Sommers\u2019 fair market value by summing the values of all the company\u2019s assets,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> dividing by the total number of outstanding shares,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and multiplying the per-share value by 40, the number of post-split shares held by the Trust. Appellants contend that the resulting figure represents the liquidation or asset value of the Trust\u2019s shares, but not their fair market value. On cross-examination Hanke acknowledged that market value and asset value were different measures, but he asserted that in this case they were the same.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We conclude that Hanke\u2019s testimony was so conclusory and lacking in analysis that no jury could reasonably have relied on it in determining the fair market value of the Trust\u2019s stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b1539-13\">Although ERISA does not define the term \u201cfair market value,\u201d it is defined in other contexts as the price that a willing buyer would pay a willing seller, both having reasonable knowledge of the pertinent facts. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Cartwright, </em>411 U.S. 546, 551, 93 S.Ct. 1713, 1716, 36 L.Ed.2d 528 (1973) (applying defi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1462\">*1462</page-number>nition in the estate tax context); <em>Almota Farmers Elevator &amp; Warehouse Co. v. United States, </em>409 U.S. 470, 474, 93 S.Ct. 791, 794, 35 L.Ed.2d 1 (1973) (applying definition in takings context); <em>Klapmeier v. Telecheck International, Inc., </em>482 F.2d 247, 252 (8th Cir.1973) (applying definition in securities fraud context); <em>Transwestern Pipeline Co. v. O\u2019Brien, </em>418 F.2d 15, 17 (5th Cir.1969) (applying definition in takings context). We conclude that this definition is appropriate for purposes of ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1540-4\">Determining fair market value for the stock of a closely held company can be difficult; typically no readily available market exists in .which to determine what willing buyers are prepared to pay. This problem has arisen most frequently in the estate tax context, and it is to that area of law that we turn for guidance. The Internal Revenue Service\u2019s estate tax regulations provide that closely held stock for which there is no available market price should be valued according to \u201cthe company\u2019s net worth, prospective earning power and dividend-paying capacity, and other relevant factors.\u201d 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.2031-2(f)(2) (1985). Among the \u201cother relevant factors\u201d are</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1540-5\">[t]he good will of the business; the economic outlook in the particular industry; the company\u2019s position in the industry and its management; the degree of control of the business represented by the block of stock to be valued; and the values of securities of corporations engaged in the same or similar lines of business which are listed on a stock exchange.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1540-6\"><em>Id.; see also </em>Rev.Rul. 59-60, \u00a7 4.01, 1959-1 C.B. 237, 238-39 (offering a similar list of factors to be weighed in valuing closely held stock).</p>\n<p id=\"b1540-7\">Hanke\u2019s valuation ignored most of these factors. Of particular significance, he failed to consider that the Trust\u2019s stock represented a minority position in Corrigan Enterprises. He also neglected to consider the prices at which shares of comparable companies were traded on the national exchanges. He did not take account of the prices at which Sommers\u2019 stock had changed hands in a series of tender offers between 1970 and 1977, one of the factors mentioned in Rev.Rul. 59-60. <em>See </em>Rev.Rul. 59-60, \u00a7 4.02(g), 1959-1 C.B. 237, 241-42; <em>see also Fitts\u2019 Estate v. Commissioner, </em>237 F.2d 729, 731 (8th Cir.1956) (\u201cIn determining the value of unlisted stocks, actual sales made in reasonable amount at arm\u2019s length, in the normal course of business, within a reasonable time before or after the basic date, are the best criterion of market value.\u201d); <em>Duncan Industries, Inc. v. Commissioner, </em>73 T.C. 266, 276 (1979) (same). Nor did Hanke consider whether a discount for lack of marketability should be applied to the Trust\u2019s stock. <em>See Estate of Andrews v. Commissioner, </em>79 T.C. 938, 953, 957 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1540-9\">We do not suggest that consideration of these factors would necessarily have changed Hanke\u2019s valuation of the Trust\u2019s shares. Indeed, in support of his apparent approach, we note that under Rev.Rul. 59-60, \u201c[t]he value of the stock of a closely held investment or real estate holding company [which Corrigan Enterprises arguably was] ... is closely related to the value of the assets underlying the stock.\u201d Rev.Rul. 59-60, \u00a7 5(b), 1959-1 C.B. 237, 243. But Hanke\u2019s utter failure to consider other relevant factors, or to explain his reasons for disregarding them, renders his testimony unworthy of credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1540-10\">We reverse the district court\u2019s judgment of actual damages and remand to the district court for new trial along with the issue of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1540-11\">C. <em>Punitive Damages</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1540-12\">The district court permitted the jury to award punitive damages against Corrigan and Corrigan Enterprises. The appellants contend that punitive damages may not be awarded under ERISA. The courts of appeals have split on the issue. <em>Compare Kuntz v. Reese, </em>760 F.2d 926, 938 (9th Cir.1985) (punitive damages available in \u201cappropriate cases\u201d under ERISA \u00a7 409(a)), <em>with Powell v. Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Telephone Co., </em>780 F.2d 419, 424 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1463\">*1463</page-number>(4th Cir.1985) (punitive damages not available under ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(3)), <em>and Dependahl v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., </em>653 F.2d 1208, 1216 (8th Cir.) (dictum that punitive damages not available under ERISA), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 968, 102 S.Ct. 512, 70 L.Ed.2d 384 (1981). The Supreme Court recently held that an individual beneficiary cannot recover extracontractual damages, either compensatory or punitive, under ERISA \u00a7 409(a) for improper processing of benefit claims. <em>See Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Russell, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 3085, 3094, 87 L.Ed.2d 96 (1985); <em>see also Dedeaux v. Pilot Life Insurance Co., </em>770 F.2d 1311, 1313 n. 3 (5th Cir.1985) (citing <em>Russell </em>in dictum for proposition that ERISA \u201cneither expressly nor implicitly authorizes\u201d award of punitive damages). The Court expressly left open the two issues with which we are concerned: (1) whether a plan can recover punitive damages under ERISA \u00a7 409(a) against a trustee for breach of fiduciary duty, <em>see </em>105 S.Ct. at 3092 n. 12; and (2) whether punitive damages may be recovered under ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(3), <em>see </em>105 S.Ct. at 3089 n. 5. Because we are unsure under which provision the Trust has proceeded, we examine both issues. Our analysis persuades us that punitive damages are not recoverable under either approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b1541-6\"><em>1. ERISA \u00a7 409(a). </em>\u2014 ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(2), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(2) (1982), permits a civil action to be brought \u201cby the Secretary, or by a participant, beneficiary or fiduciary for appropriate relief under\u201d ERISA \u00a7 409. ERISA \u00a7 409(a) provides that anyone who breaches a fiduciary duty to a plan</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1541-7\">shall be personally liable to make good to such plan any losses to the plan resulting from each such breach, and to restore to such plan any profits of such fiduciary which have been made through use of assets of the plan by the fiduciary, <em>and shall be subject to such other equitable or remedial relief as the court may deem appropriate, </em>including removal of such fiduciary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1541-8\">ERISA \u00a7 409(a), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1109(a) (1982) (emphasis added). The Supreme Court relied on this provision\u2019s emphasis on the plan to deny extracontractual recovery to an individual beneficiary. <em>See Russell, </em>105 S.Ct. at 3089-90. Here any recovery will benefit the plan as a whole, so we must consider whether the phrase \u201cother equitable or remedial relief\u201d includes punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1541-10\">The language of the statute suggests that punitive damages should not be allowed. \u201cEquitable or remedial\u201d relief generally includes all of the kinds of relief available to restore the plaintiff\u2019s losses or protect him from future harm \u2014 recission, <em>e.g., Gilliam v. Edwards, </em>492 F.Supp. 1255, 1267 (D.N.J.1980), removal of the trustee, <em>e.g., Katsaros v. Cody, </em>744 F.2d 270, 281 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 565, 83 L.Ed.2d 506 (1984), appointment of a receiver, <em>e.g., Marshall v. Snyder, </em>572 F.2d 894, 901 (2d Cir.1978), and other similar relief: Punitive damages do not fall within the broad category of \u201cequitable or remedial\u201d relief; rather than restoring the plaintiff\u2019s losses and protecting him from future harm, punitive damages are designed to punish the wrongdoer and deter others from similar misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1541-13\">The legislative history of ERISA supports the view that punitive damages do not fit within the category of \u201cequitable or remedial\u201d relief. The various committee reports indicate that Congress intended to import into ERISA the fiduciary principles of the law of trusts, adapted as necessary for employee benefit plans. <em>See </em>H.Rep. No. 533, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. (1973), <em>reprinted in </em>1974 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 4639, 4649, 4651; S.Rep. No. 127, 93d Cong., 1st Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>1974 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4838, 4865, 4869; 120 Cong.Rec. 29,928, 29,932 (1974) (statement by Sen. Harrison Williams introducing conference report), <em>reprinted in </em>1974 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 5177, 5186. Under the law of trusts, trustees generally are not liable for punitive damages for breach of fiduciary duty. <em>See, e.g., Powell, </em>780 F.2d at 424 (collecting authorities). <em>But cf. Rivero v. Thomas, </em>86 Cal.App.2d 225, 194 P.2d 533, 542 (1948) (punitive dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1464\">*1464</page-number>ages permitted against trustee who defrauded beneficiary); <em>Sharts v. Douglas, </em>94 Ind.App. 201, 163 N.E. 109, 112 (1928) (en banc) (same); <em>Gould v. Starr, </em>558 S.W.2d 755, 771 (Mo.App.1977) (acknowledging majority rule but permitting punitive damages), <em>cert. denied, </em>436 U.S. 905, 98 S.Ct. 2236, 56 L.Ed.2d 403 (1978). The Restatement (Second) of Trusts supports this view. Section 205 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1542-4\">If the trustee commits a breach of trust, he is chargeable with</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1542-5\">(a) any loss or depreciation in value of the trust estate resulting from the breach of trust; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1542-6\">(b) any profit made by him through the breach of trust; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1542-7\">(c) any profit which would have accrued to the trust estate if there had been no breach of trust.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1542-8\">Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7 205 (1959); <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 \u00bf106 (providing same remedies for breach of duty of loyalty); 3 A. Scott, The Law of Trusts \u00a7\u00a7 205-206 (1967) (recognizing the three measures of recovery in Restatement (Second) \u00a7 205). Clauses (a) and (b) in \u00a7 205 correspond to the measures of recovery permitted by ERISA \u00a7 409(a), which requires the breaching fiduciary to \u201cmake good to such plan any losses to the plan resulting from each such breach\u201d and \u201cto restore to such plan any profits of such fiduciary which have been made through use of assets of the plan by the fiduciary.\u201d Neither of these clauses permits recovery of punitive damages. Nor does clause (c) of \u00a7 205, which has no analogue in ERISA \u00a7 409(a), permit punitive damages. Other sections of the <em>Restatement </em>apply the principles of \u00a7 205 to particular breaches, but none authorizes a different or additional measure of damages. The <em>Restatement, </em>therefore, suggests that the law of trusts does not permit punitive damages for breach of fiduciary duty. It follows that ERISA, which incorporates the principles of trust law, does not do so either.</p>\n<p id=\"b1542-9\">In holding that punitive damages may be awarded under ERISA for actual malice or wanton indifference by a fiduciary, the Ninth Circuit relied on statements in the House and Senate reports that Congress intended to provide \u201c \u2018the full range of legal and equitable remedies available in both state and federal courts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Russell v. Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co., </em>722 F.2d 482, 491 (9th Cir.1983) (quoting H.Rep. No. 533 at 17, <em>reprinted in </em>1974 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 4655; S.Rep.

As the Supreme Court noted in reversing the Ninth Circuit, however, the committee reports refer to early versions of the bill that ultimately was enacted. These early bills provided for \u201cappropriate relief, legal or equitable, to redress or restrain a breach of any responsibility, obligation, or duty of a fiduciary.\u201d H.R. 2, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. \u00a7 693 (1974); S. 4, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. \u00a7 603 (1973). This provision was rephrased and the word \u201clegal\u201d dropped in the final bill. Thus, we can give little weight to the reports\u2019 references to \u201clegal\u201d relief. <em>See Russell, </em>105 S.Ct. at 3092 &amp; n. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b1542-13\">Our analysis of the language and legislative history of ERISA \u00a7 409(a) persuades us that Congress did not intend to permit plans to recover punitive damages under that section against fiduciaries for breach of their fiduciary duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1542-14\"><em>2.

The Supreme Court left open in <em>Russell </em>the issue whether this provision permits recovery of extracontrac-tual compensatory or punitive damages. <em>See </em>105 S.Ct. at 3089 n. 5. For the reasons discussed at length in the preceding subsection, we conclude that it does not. In brief, the phrase \u201cequitable relief,\u201d as it is used in the law of trusts, does not encom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1465\">*1465</page-number>pass punitive damages.

Section 514(c)(1) defines \u201cState law\u201d as \u201call laws, decisions, rules, regulations, or other State action having the effect of law,\u201d a definition broad enough to include state common law. ERISA \u00a7 514(c)(1), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(c)(1) (1982). The preemption section includes a savings clause, which excludes from preemption \u201cany law of any State which regulates insurance, banking, or securities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 514(b)(2)(A), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(b)(2)(A) (1982). <em>See generally </em>Kil-berg <em>&amp; </em>Inman, <em>Preemption of State Laws Relating to Employee Benefit Plans: An Analysis of ERISA Section 514, </em>62 Texas L.Rev. 1313, 1316-20 (1984) (describing \u00a7 514's provisions). The Trust contends that its state law claims do not \u201crelate to\u201d an employee benefit plan and that the common law upon which its claims rest falls within the savings clause as a law regulating securities. Because we find the Trust\u2019s first argument dispositive, we do not address its savings clause argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1543-14\">The Supreme Court has given the \u201crelate to\u201d phrase in \u00a7 514(a) a broad, common-sense construction. <em>See Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. v. Massachusetts, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 2380, 2389, 85 L.Ed.2d 728 (1985); <em>Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>463 U.S. 85, 97-99, 103 S.Ct. 2890, 2900-01, 77 L.Ed.2d 490 (1983). A state law relates to an employee benefit plan \u201cif it has a connection with or reference to such a plan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 97, 103 S.Ct. at 2900. Moreover, a state law that does not expressly concern employee benefit plans will still be preempted \u201cinsofar as\u201d the law applies to benefit plans in particular cases. ERISA \u00a7 514(a); <em>see Shaw, </em>463 U.S. at 97 n. 17, 103 S.Ct. at 2900 n. 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b1543-17\">Despite its broad construction of \u00a7 514(a), however, the Supreme Court has indicated that it will not extend the \u201crelate to\u201d language to its outer limit. In <em>Shaw </em>the Court noted that \u201c[sjome state actions may affect employee benefit plans in too tenuous, remote, or peripheral a manner to warrant a finding that the law \u2018relates to\u2019 the plan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 100 n. 21, 103 S.Ct. at 2901 n. 21. The Court cited with apparent approval <em>American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. v. Merry, </em>592 F.2d 118, 121 (2d Cir.1979), in which the Second Circuit held that ERISA did not preempt a state\u2019s garnishment of a spouse\u2019s benefit plan income to enforce alimony and support orders.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1543-18\">Several courts have employed this analysis in concluding that ERISA does not preempt state laws of general application that indirectly affect benefit plans. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1466\">*1466</page-number><em>Lane v. Goren, </em>743 F.2d 1337 (9th Cir. 1984), the Ninth Circuit held that ERISA did not preempt a pension plan employee\u2019s state law claim that the plan had fired him for reasons of race and age. The court noted that the state antidiscrimination law affected the plan \u201cin its role as an employer, and in a way that all other employers are affected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1340-41. Similarly, the Second Circuit held in <em>Rebaldo v. Cuomo, </em>749 F.2d 133, 137-39 (2d Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 2702, 86 L.Ed.2d 718 (1985), that ERISA did not preempt a state law setting rates that hospitals must charge private payors, including benefit plans. The court rested its holding on two principal considerations. First, it noted that \u201c[t]he containment of hospital costs is an exercise of a State\u2019s police powers, which should not be superseded by federal regulations unless that was the clear intent of Congress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 138. Second, the court found that the state law in question affected employee benefit plans only in a \u201c \u2018tenuous, remote, or peripheral\u2019 \u201d manner. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Shaw, </em>463 U.S. at 100 n. 21, 103 S.Ct. at 2901 n. 21). The Second Circuit concluded that when \u201ca State statute of general application does not affect the structure, the administration, or the type of benefits provided by an ERISA plan, the mere fact that the statute has some economic impact on the plan does not require that the statute be invalidated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 139.</p>\n<p id=\"b1544-6\">The Ninth Circuit relied on <em>Lane </em>and <em>Rebaldo </em>in holding that ERISA did not preempt a statute authorizing a state labor relations board to order employers who had not bargained in good faith to make their employees whole by paying them the difference between the compensation, including both wages and fringe benefits, that they actually received, and the compensation that they would have received if the employers had bargained in good faith. <em>Martori Bros. Distributors v. James-Mas-sengale, </em>781 F.2d 1349, 1356-59 (9th Cir. 1986). The court rejected the employers\u2019 argument that the statute was preempted because the fringe benefit portion of the make-whole order required reference to existing benefit plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b1544-8\">Other courts have rejected arguments that state laws affected benefit plans in too remote, tenuous, or peripheral a manner to warrant preemption. In <em>Gilbert v. Burlington Industries, Inc., </em>765 F.2d 320, 326-28 (2d Cir.1985), <em>appeal filed, </em>54 U.S. L.W. 3179 (U.S. Oct. 1, 1985), the court distinguished <em>Rebaldo </em>and <em>Merry </em>in holding that ERISA preempted a New York statute that made it a misdemeanor not to pay wages or wage supplements due employees. The court found that the employer\u2019s severance pay plan was a benefit plan within the meaning of ERISA. <em>See id. </em>at 324-26. Turning to the preemption issue, the court noted that \u201cthe state law claims seeking to enforce the severance pay policy would determine whether any benefits are paid, and directly affect the administration of benefits under the plan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 327. Thus, \u201c[ajlthough the regulation of the employment relationship under [the New York statute] is an exercise by the State of its traditional police powers, the state statute does not have such a remote and tenuous connection to Burlington\u2019s severance pay plan so as to allow us to conclude that it does not \u2018relate to\u2019 it.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1544-9\">The Second Circuit reached a similar conclusion in <em>Stone &amp; Webster Engineering Corp. v. Ilsley, </em>690 F.2d 323, 328-29 (2d Cir.1982), <em>aff'd mem. sub nom. Arcudi v. Stone &amp; Webster Engineering Corp., </em>463 U.S. 1220, 103 S.Ct. 3564, 77 L.Ed.2d 1405 (1983). The court held that ERISA preempted a Connecticut workers\u2019 compensation statute that required employers to continue pension plan contributions on behalf of injured employers as long as they were eligible to receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits. The court distinguished <em>Merry, </em>noting that it had dealt with \u201cancient family law concepts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b1544-10\">Finally, in <em>Authier v. Ginsburg, </em>757 F.2d 796 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 208, 88 L.Ed.2d 177 (1985), the Sixth Circuit had to decide whether a plan administrator's state common-law cause of action for discharge in violation of public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1467\">*1467</page-number>policy based on his alleged compliance with ERISA related to an employee benefit plan. <em>Id. </em>at 800. The court concluded that ERISA preempted the administrator\u2019s state law wrongful discharge action. The court distinguished <em>Merry </em>on several grounds: The cause of action for wrongful discharge is not recognized in every state, while the family law doctrines at issue in <em>Merry </em>are; employer-employee relations have not always been the sole concern of the states, while family law matters have; and an ERISA administrator\u2019s remedies for wrongful discharge do not involve an exercise of the \u201cbasic state police power,\u201d while family law matters do. <em>Id. </em>at 800 n. 6. The court concluded that the state law related to benefit plans because Congress intended ERISA enforcement to be solely a matter of federal concern, and \u201c[allowing a fiduciary to bring a state law cause of action for retaliatory discharge ... will create inconsistency in the enforcement of ERISA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 802.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1545-4\">These cases are not easily distilled into a simple test for determining whether a state law of general application affects employee benefit plans in too tenuous, remote, or peripheral a manner to be preempted. The courts appear to consider two principal factors. First, if the state law involves an exercise of traditional state authority, then the courts are less likely to find that it relates t\u00f3 a benefit plan than if it involves a state attempt to regulate an area not traditionally left to the states. <em>See, e.g., Authier, </em>757 F.2d at 800 n. 6; <em>Rebaldo, </em>749 F.2d at 138. <em>But cf. Gilbert, </em>765 F.2d at 327 (even exercise of traditional state police power preempted unless it affects benefit plans in a tenuous, remote, or peripheral manner; court treats inquiries as separate).</p>\n<p id=\"b1545-8\">Second, the courts are more likely to find that a state law relates to a benefit plan if it affects relations among the principal ERISA entities \u2014 the employer, the plan, the plan fiduciaries, and the beneficiaries\u2014 than if it affects relations between one of these entities and an outside party, or between two outside parties with only an incidental effect on the plan. <em>Compare Martori Bros., </em>781 F.2d at 1356-59 (state labor statute affecting relations between employer and employee does not relate to plan despite incidental effect), <em>and Rebal-do, </em>749 F.2d at 138-39 (state hospital cost statute that affects relations between pension plans and hospitals does not relate to plan despite economic impact), <em>and Lane, </em>743 F.2d at 1340-41 (state antidiscrim-ination statute that affects relations between pension plan and employee does not relate to plan), <em>with Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., </em>105 S.Ct. at 2389 (state statute requiring insured plans to provide mental health benefits \u2014 thus affecting relations between plan and beneficiaries \u2014 relates to plan), <em>and Shaw, </em>463 U.S. at 96-100, 103 S.Ct. at 2899-2902 (state statute requiring plans to provide benefits for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1468\">*1468</page-number>pregnancy-based disabilities relates to plan), <em>and Alessi v. Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., </em>451 U.S. 504, 522-26, 101 S.Ct. 1895, 1905-08, 68 L.Ed.2d 402 (1981) (state statute prohibiting use of workers\u2019 compensation benefits to offset pension benefits relates to plan), <em>and Gilbert, </em>765 F.2d at 326-28 (state statute requiring employer to make payments into severance pay benefit plan relates to plan), <em>and Authier, </em>757 F.2d at 799-802 (state wrongful discharge law that affects relations between employer and plan fiduciary relates to plan).</p>\n<p id=\"b1546-4\">We are not convinced that the first of these two considerations \u2014 the traditional or nontraditional nature of the state law\u2014 properly bears upon the question whether a state law of general application affects a benefit plan in so tenuous, remote, or peripheral a way that it cannot be said to \u201crelate to\u201d the plan. The distinction finds no support in \u00a7 514(a)\u2019s \u201crelate to\u201d language. The most plausible statutory basis is \u00a7 514(c)(2), which defines the statutory term \u201cState\u201d as \u201ca State, any political subdivisions thereof, or any agency or instrumentality of either, <em>which purports to regulate, </em>directly or indirectly, the terms and conditions\u201d of benefit plans. ERISA \u00a7 514(c)(2), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(c)(2) (1982) (emphasis added). A traditional state law of general application arguably may not \u201cpurport[ ] to regulate ... the terms and conditions\u201d of employee benefit plans. As we have noted,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> however, we rest our decision solely upon the \u201crelate to\u201d language in \u00a7 514(a); we do not address the effect of \u00a7 514(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1546-5\">Our focus, therefore, is upon the second factor that courts have considered, implicitly or explicitly, in construing the \u201crelate to\u201d language \u2014 whether the state law affects relations among the principal ERISA entities. At first glance, the state common law of corporate fiduciary duty, as applied in this case, appears to do just that. Walter Corrigan is alleged to be a fiduciary of the Sommers Employee Profit Sharing Trust. He is being sued by the Trust and its beneficiaries. Application of the state law would apparently affect relations between the alleged plan fiduciary, the plan, and the plan beneficiaries. Further analysis reveals, however, that the appearance is misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b1546-7\">The state common law of fiduciary duty that the Trust seeks to invoke in this case centers upon the relation between corporate director and shareholder. The director\u2019s duty arises from his status as director; the law imposes the duty upon him in that capacity only. Similarly, the shareholder\u2019s rights against the corporate director arise solely from his status as shareholder. That in a case such as ours the director happens also to be a plan fiduciary and the shareholder a benefit plan has nothing to do with the duty owed by the director to the shareholder. The state law and ERISA duties are parallel but independent: as director, the individual owes a duty, defined by state law, to the corporation\u2019s shareholders, including the plan; as fiduciary, the individual owes a duty, defined by ERISA, to the plan and its beneficiaries. Thus, the state law does not affect relations between the ERISA fiduciary and the plan or plan beneficiaries as such; it affects them in their separate capacities as corporate director and shareholder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1546-8\">It can be argued, however, that although the duties are independent, they will nevertheless saddle the director/fiduciary with inconsistent or conflicting requirements, which in turn will affect his relations as fiduciary with the plan. But we regard this as a remote possibility, at least when, as here, the plan is a shareholder. In most cases, the duty that the director owes to the plan as shareholder will require the same course of conduct as the duty that he owes as fiduciary to the plan under ERISA. Because the ERISA duty \u2014 \u201cthe highest known to law,\u201d <em>Donovan v. Bierwirth, 680 </em>F.2d 263, 272 n. 8 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1069,103 S.Ct. 488, 34 L.Ed.2d 631 (1982) \u2014 imposes a standard of care at least as high as that imposed by the director-shareholder duty, the ERISA duty will gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1469\">*1469</page-number>erally be the director/fiduciary\u2019s principal guide in his relations with the shareholder/plan. In the unlikely event that the director\u2019s duty to the plan as shareholder conflicts with his duty as fiduciary under ERISA, he might have to resign one position or the other. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 276 (for directors/fiduciaries whose company was faced with a hostile takeover bid, \u201cperhaps ... resignation [as fiduciaries] was the only proper course\u201d). But this seems to us a remote possibility with only a minimal effect on benefit plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b1547-4\"><em>Donovan, </em>although not squarely on point, supports our conclusion that the state law at issue in this case does not relate to an employee benefit plan. In <em>Donovan, </em>directors and officers of Grumman were faced with a cash tender offer from LTV Corp. The directors and officers were also trustees of the Grumman employee benefit plan, which held a block of Grumman stock. The directors and officers decided after cursory consideration to resist the LTV offer. In their role as trustees, they decided not to tender the benefit plan\u2019s shares, but instead to have the plan buy more Grumman stock. The obvious effect of the trustees\u2019 decision was to impede the LTV tender offer. The Second Circuit concluded that the district court properly granted a preliminary injunction against the LTV offer on grounds that the trustees had breached their fiduciary duty to the plan under ERISA. The court considered and rejected the contention that because the directors and officers arguably had satisfied their duty to the shareholders to investigate the tender offer, they had necessarily fulfilled their ERISA duties as trustees as well. <em>See id. </em>at 272 n. 8. That the court would consider this argument indicates its belief that the directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 state law duty to shareholders could co-exist with their ERISA duties to the benefit plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1547-7\">Several recent cases holding that ERISA preempts state law claims under circumstances superficially similar to ours can be distinguished. In <em>Light v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Alabama, </em>790 F.2d 1247 (5th Cir.1986), this court held that ERISA preempts a plan beneficiary\u2019s state law breach of fiduciary duty claim against the plan administrator. The state law claim in <em>Light, </em>unlike the one in this case, affected relations between an ERISA plan fiduciary and the plan beneficiaries as such. <em>Powell v. Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Telephone Co., </em>780 F.2d 419 (4th Cir.1985), and <em>Scott v. Gulf Oil Corp., </em>754 F.2d 1499 (9th Cir. 1985), are distinguishable on similar grounds. In <em>Powell, </em>a former employee of Chesapeake &amp; Potomac and beneficiary of its benefit plan sued C. &amp; P., its parent company A.T. &amp; T., and the plan administrator under ERISA for breach of fiduciary duty and under state law for intentional infliction of emotional distress, breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing, breach of contract, and unfair trade practices. The plaintiff alleged that the defendants had harassed her in various ways when she sought disability benefits under the plan. These state law claims, like those in <em>Light, </em>affected relations between the employer, the plan fiduciaries, and the plan beneficiaries. The court found the claims preempted by ERISA. <em>See Powell, </em>780 F.2d at 421-22. In <em>Scott, </em>the Ninth Circuit concluded that plan beneficiaries\u2019 state law claims against their employer were preempted to the extent that \u201cthe conduct challenged by each claim was part of the administration of an employee benefit plan.\u201d <em>Scott, </em>754 F.2d at 1505.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1548-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1470\">*1470</page-number>We conclude that the state common law of corporate fiduciary duty, as applied in this case, affects benefit plans in too tenuous, remote, and peripheral a manner to warrant a finding that it \u201crelate[s] to\u201d the plans. The state law is a law of general application; it imposes a duty on all corporate directors, whether or not they are plan fiduciaries, and it runs in favor of all shareholders, including benefit plans. It does not affect relations among the principal ERISA entities \u2014 the employer, the plan fiduciaries, the plan, and the beneficiaries\u2014 as such, but only in their independent capacities as corporate director and shareholder. In prescribing standards of conduct for corporate directors, the state law will rarely if ever impose conflicting or inconsistent duties on directors who are also plan fiduciaries. We hold, therefore, that ERISA does not preempt the cross-appellant\u2019s state law claims. On remand, the Trust may proceed with those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1548-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"AWrb\">We hold that the district court erred in instructing the jury on the circumstances under which Corrigan and Corrigan Enterprises could be found to be fiduciaries with respect to the sale of the Trust\u2019s stock. We hold further that there is insufficient evidence in the record to support the jury\u2019s finding of fair market value, upon which the district court\u2019s judgment of actual damages was based. We hold that the Trust cannot recover punitive damages under either ERISA \u00a7 409(a) or ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(3). Finally, we hold that ERISA does not preempt the state law breach of fiduciary duty claims asserted in the Trust\u2019s fourth amended complaint. The judgment of the district court is REVERSED and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1537-9\">. The appellants contend that the district court abused its discretion in permitting the Trust to add the failure to liquidate theory by mid-trial amendment. Although we find troubling the district court\u2019s decision to permit the amendment, we need not consider the issue in light of our disposition of the appellants\u2019 other points.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1538-6\">. The Trust argues on appeal that because Walter Corrigan became a trustee of the Trust on January 1, 1978, and the sale of the Trust\u2019s stock was not consummated until March 6, 1978, the jury on that basis could have found him to be a fiduciary with respect to the sale. This theory was not presented to the jury, however, either in the district court\u2019s instructions or in counsel\u2019s argument. We decline to consider the point for the first time on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1538-12\">. The appellants raised this point in the district court both by motion for directed verdict and by motion for j.n.o.v.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1539-5\">. In addition to Hanke\u2019s testimony, the Trust relies on testimony by James Holmes, a member of the Sommers board of directors until the company\u2019s sale and a former trustee of the Trust. The extent of Holmes\u2019 fair market value testimony is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1539-6\">Q Did you know then the trust percentage roughly twenty percent of the assets was much more than $400,000?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1539-7\">A It had been a million three plus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1539-8\">Tr. 514. This statement, offered without analysis and not even tied to a particular time, has little probative value as to the fair market value of the Trust\u2019s stock in December 1977.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1539-9\">. Among the assets that Hanke included in his total were the ten year, one million dollar employment contract given by Malone &amp; Hyde to Walter Corrigan and the August 1980 sales price of the East Houston Street property, both discounted to present value as of 1977 or 1978. Appellants contend that the employment contract should not have been included in Corrigan Enterprises' assets and that the East Houston Street property should have been valued according to a 1977 appraisal, which was less than half the 1980 sales price. Because we find Hanke\u2019s testimony deficient in other respects, we need not consider these points.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1539-10\">. Hanke divided the total asset value of Corri-gan Enterprises by 197 outstanding shares of stock to obtain a per-share value. The appellants contend that the actual number of outstanding shares in December 1977 was 209, which, divided into the total assets, would produce a lower per-share value than the number that Hanke used. We need not decide which number is correct; we merely note that the issue is open on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1539-15\">. Hanke's testimony on this point was equivocal. At one point during cross-examination he appeared to concede that he had testified to asset value rather than fair market value:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1539-16\">Q And the fact of the matter is that you have not testified this morning in the Courtroom to market \u2014 fair market value, you testified to asset value when you reached your conclusions? Do you agree with that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1539-17\">A I agree with that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1539-18\">Q But the fact remains is that your testimony is asset value and not the fair market value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1539-19\">A All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1539-20\">Q Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1539-21\">A That is correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1539-22\">Tr. 795-96. Later in the cross-examination, however, Hanke seems to have had a change of heart:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1539-23\">Q I thought you told us a while ago that you were not saying that that asset value represented the fair market value of those forty shares?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1539-24\">A Counsel, the approach we took in this evaluation was to approach this as a liquidation in view that there was essentially only two shareholders available and that there was no market for the stock. Under those circumstances, it is my opinion the fair market value is in fact adjusted value when you review the assets.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1539-25\">Tr. 803.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1543-10\">. The Seventh Circuit reached the same result on very similar facts in <em>Savings &amp; Profit Sharing Fund of Sears Employees v. Gago, </em>717 F.2d 1038, 1039-40 (7th Cir.1983). The court cited <em>Merry </em>and <em>Shaw's </em>footnote 21.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1545-5\">. The Second and Ninth Circuits have relied in part on ERISA\u2019s definition of the term \u201cState\u201d in deciding preemption cases. ERISA \u00a7 514(c)(2), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(c)(2) (1982), provides: \u2018The term \u2018State\u2019 includes a State, any political subdivisions thereof, or any agency or instrumentality of either, which purports to regulate, directly or indirectly, the terms and conditions of employee benefit plans covered by this subchapter.\u201d These circuits have suggested that this language may limit ERISA\u2019s preemptive effect beyond any limitation implicit in the \"relate to\u201d language. <em>See, e.g., Martori Bros., </em>781 F.2d at 1359; <em>Rebaldo, </em>749 F.2d at 137; <em>Lane, </em>743 F.2d at 1339; <em>cf. </em>Kilberg &amp; Inman, <em>supra, </em>at 1328-30 (arguing that word \u201cpurports\u201d in \u00a7 514(c)(2) limits ERISA\u2019s preemptive sweep).</p>\n<p id=\"b1545-6\">The Sixth Circuit has indicated its disapproval of the approach taken by the Second and Ninth Circuits, although it expressly declined to decide</p>\n<p id=\"b1545-9\">whether \u00a7 514(c)(2) limits ERISA\u2019s preemption provision. <em>See Authier, </em>757 F.2d at 799 n. 4. The Sixth Circuit noted that reliance on \u00a7 514(c)(2)\u2019s \"terms and conditions\u201d language to limit ERISA preemption \"would be contrary to the legislative history of ERISA. Congress rejected explicitly a proposed preemption provision which reached only specific subjects covered by ERISA in favor of the current broad language of Section 1144(a).\u201d <em>Id.; see also Shaw, </em>463 U.S. at 98-99 &amp; nn. 18-20, 103 S.Ct. at 2900-01 &amp; nn. 18-20 (describing preemption provision\u2019s evolution from narrow conflict of content approach to its broad present form).</p>\n<p id=\"b1545-10\">We rest our decision in this case solely upon the \"relate to\u201d language in \u00a7 514(a). We express no opinion on the possible limitations imposed on ERISA preemption by the definition of \"State\u201d contained in \u00a7 514(c)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1546-9\">. <em>See supra note 9.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1547-5\">. <em>Ellenburg </em>v. <em>Brockway, Inc., </em>763 F.2d 1091 (9th Cir.1985), cited by Corrigan, is also distinguishable. Ellenburg, an employee of Brock-way and beneficiary of its benefit plan, sued under ERISA and under state law to recover early retirement benefits that he claimed had been wrongfully withheld. Among his state law claims, Ellenburg asserted that Brockway and Cunningham, Brockway's director of personnel, had breached their implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The court held that ERISA preempted this claim, noting that the claim \"is brought against Brockway and Cunningham in their capacity as employer, rather than fiduciaries, and seemingly concerns the employment relationship. However, this claim originates from the handling and disposition of Ellenburg\u2019s claim for early retirement benefits and is therefore directly connected with the employee benefit plan____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1095.</p>\n<p id=\"b1548-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1470\">*1470</page-number>The state law claim in <em>Ellenburg </em>arose directly out of the internal operations of the plan. The claim affected relations among the employer, the plan, and the plan beneficiary, notwithstanding its ostensible basis in the employer-employee relationship. The state law claim in this case, by contrast, arises solely from the director-shareholder relationship and involves the plan only through the fortuitous circumstance that the director is a fiduciary and the shareholder a plan.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
