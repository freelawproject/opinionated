Holden, Senior United States j District Judge, granting summary judgment in favor of defendants in an action alleging violations of rights secured by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 <em>et seq., </em>(\u201cADEA\u201d), Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>(\u201cTitle VII\u201d), 42 U.S.C. section 1983, and state contract law.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-13\">Appellant contends that the district court acted improperly by ignoring material facts in the record, by resolving fact questions, and by failing to view the record in a light most favorable to appellant. More particularly, appellant argues that the district court erred in finding that he had failed to file his charges under the ADEA and Title VII with the EEOC within 300 days after receiving final notice of termination and in finding that the case does not present facts on which a jury could find that the limitations period was tolled or that the appellees were estopped from replying on the limitations bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-16\">For the reasons stated below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-17\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b559-18\">Appellant was appointed to a non-tenured faculty position at Lyndon State College (\u201cLyndon\u201d), a part of the Vermont State College system, in 1978. Appellant received a letter of non-reappointment dated July 17, 1981 from the President of Lyndon, appellee Janet Gorman Murphy. The letter stated: \u201cI regret to inform you that upon review of your personnel file I have decided not to reappoint you for the 1982-1983 academic year. Therefore, the 1981-1982 academic year will be your final year at Lyndon State College.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-19\">At the time of this decision, appellant was covered by a collective bargaining agreement in force between Vermont State Colleges and the VSC Faculty Federation, AFT, AFL-CIO. The collective bargaining agreement provided a one-year notice of nonrenewal to faculty members with two years of service and also provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUB\">Reappointment is presumed unless there is a written notification of non-reappointment no later than (a) March 1 of the first year of service, (b) December 15 of the second year of service, (c) September 1 of all succeeding years, or unless the appointment is terminal____ In all cases of non-reappointment written notice of reasons shall be given after the third full year of service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-22\">By letters dated August 14 and 15, 1981, appellant advised appellee Murphy that (1) he was filing a grievance under the collec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>tive bargaining agreement; (2) he believed his termination was based on age, sex, and handicap discrimination; and (3) the July 17, 1981 termination letter was ineffective since it failed to provide reasons for the termination. By letter dated September 16, 1981, appellant was informed that his grievance was denied and that the reason for his termination was a lack of \u201csubstantially above average teaching effectiveness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">During November of 1981, appellant met with appellee Murphy and was told repeatedly by appellee that the non-reappointment decision would not be rescinded.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">At a department meeting held on March 9, 1982, which appellant attended, a fellow faculty member reported that \u201cDean Dethy will not replace Joe Shockley\u2019s position. He feels that Dr. Shockley will return in the Fall. When asked what will happen if Dr. Shockley does not return, Dean Dethy replied that the Recreation Department would only be a four-position Department.\u201d <em>See </em>Minutes of the March 9, 1982 Recreation and Leisure Studies Department Meeting, App. at 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">On May 27, 1982, the Vermont Labor Relations Board upheld Lyndon\u2019s decision to terminate appellant. Following a request for reconsideration, the Board reaffirmed its decision on July 15, 1982. Appellant taught at Lyndon through the academic year that ended in June, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">Appellant filed a charge of sex, age, and handicap discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) and the Civil Rights Division of the Vermont Attorney General\u2019s Office on September 29, 1982. The charge was received by the EEOC on October 1, 1982, but was not filed within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. section 626(d)(2) and 42 U.S.C. section 2000e-5(e) until November 29, 1982. <em>See Mohasco Corp. v. Silver, </em>447 U.S. 807, 814 n. 16, 100 S.Ct. 2486, 2491 n. 16, 65 L.Ed.2d 532 (1980). Appellant received a right-to-sue letter dated May 11, 1983 from the EEOC, and filed his complaint with the district court on August 8, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">Appellees filed the first of two motions for summary judgment on November 2, 1983, asserting that (1) appellant\u2019s ADEA and Title VII claims were barred because not timely filed with the EEOC, <em>see </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(d); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e); (2) appellant\u2019s ADEA claim was barred because not filed with the court within the two-year statute of limitations applicable in ADEA cases, <em>see </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 255, 626(e); (3) appellant\u2019s claims had been adjudicated before administrative agencies, and thus appellant was barred from relitigating those claims by the doctrines of res judica-ta and collateral estoppel; and (4) there remained no genuine issues of material fact. By Memorandum of Decision dated August 21, 1984, Judge Holden denied the motion for summary judgment finding that certain facts may have \u201cclouded\u201d the finality of the July 17, 1981 notice of non-reappointment, and ordered that discovery proceed so as to clarify \u201cconflicting inferences\u201d regarding equitable tolling or estoppel. Memorandum of Decision, 83-CV-289 at 9, 12 (August 21, 1984). Discovery was completed by April 30, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">On May 21, 1985, appellees filed their second motion for summary judgment, renewing their earlier arguments and emphasizing that appellant\u2019s deposition testimony established that there was no basis for tolling the applicable statute of limitations. By Memorandum of Decision dated January 7, 1986, Judge Holden held that the July 17, 1981 letter was a final notice of termination and that \u201c[t]he record, as now constituted, clearly demonstrates ... that [appellant] has not been obstructed in presenting his complaint by any misleading inducement or deceptive conduct on the part of the defendants.\u201d The judge concluded that \u201c[i]n this context of undisputed facts, there is no basis for equitable tolling of the statute of limitations.\u201d Memorandum of Decision, 83-CV-289 at 7 (January 7, 1986). Accordingly, judgment was entered in favor of appellees as to appellant\u2019s claims under the ADEA and Title VII. Appellant\u2019s pendent state contract claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>were dismissed without prejudice while appellant\u2019s cause of action under Section 1983 was dismissed for failure to state a claim. <em>See Shaw v. Merritt-Chapman &amp; Scott Corp., </em>554 F.2d 786, 789 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 852, 98 S.Ct. 167, 54 L.Ed.2d 122 (1977) (court may presume an adjudication on the merits where district court fails to specify otherwise).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">The only issue before this court is whether summary judgment was awarded properly in favor of appellees. The standard for reviewing a grant of summary judgment is the same as that applied by the district court when initially deciding the motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c). <em>See Burtnieks v. City of New York, </em>716 F.2d 982, 985 (2d Cir.1983) (citing C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; M. Kane, 10 Fed. Prac. &amp; Proc. \u00a7 2716 (2d ed. 1983)). When ruling on a motion for summary judgment, a court must \u201cresolve all ambiguities and inferences ... in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion,\u201d <em>United States v. One Tintoretto Painting, </em>691 F.2d 603, 606 (2d Cir.1982) (citations omitted), and may grant the motion only if \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R. Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">Under the ADEA and Title VII, a charge of discrimination must be filed with the EEOC before instituting an action in federal court. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(d); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e); <em>see United Air Lines Inc. v. Evans, </em>431 U.S. 553, 555 n. 4, 97 S.Ct. 1885, 1887 n. 4 (1977); <em>O\u2019Malley v. GTE Service Corp., </em>758 F.2d 818, 820 (2d Cir.1985). Specifically, the ADEA requires that in a \u201cdeferral state,\u201d such as Vermont, a charge must be filed \u201cwithin 300 days after the alleged unlawful practice occurred, or within 30 days after receipt by the individual of notice of termination of proceedings under State law, whichever is earlier.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(d)(2). Title VII prescribes similar time limits for filing with the EEOC, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">Generally, the timeliness of a discrimination claim is measured from the date the claimant receives notice of the allegedly discriminatory act, not from the date the decision takes effect. <em>See Char-don v. Fernandez, </em>454 U.S. 6, 8, 102 S.Ct. 28, 29, 70 L.Ed.2d 6 (1981); <em>Delaware State College v. Ricks, </em>449 U.S. 250, 258, 101 S.Ct. 498, 504, 66 L.Ed.2d 431 (1980); <em>O\u2019Malley v. GTE Service Corp., </em>758 F.2d 818, 820 (2d Cir.1985); <em>Miller v. International Telephone &amp; Telegraph Corp., </em>755 F.2d 20, 23 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 148, 88 L.Ed.2d 122 (1985). Appellees are alleged to have unjustifiably terminated appellant under the guise of an annual performance review. Accordingly, this court must determine when appellant received final notice of termination, the allegedly discriminatory act.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-11\">Appellees contend that the alleged act of discrimination occurred on July 17, 1981, the date of the non-reappointment letter, thereby making the November 29, 1982 filing with the EEOC untimely. Conversely, appellant argues that the July 17, 1981 letter was invalid because it failed to conform to the collective bargaining agreement, and therefore that the act of discrimination did not occur until he was actually discharged in June, 1982. In the alternative, appellant contends that appellees\u2019 acts after sending the termination letter led him to believe that he had not been terminated, and that appellees therefore are estopped from relying on the limitations bar. More particularly, appellant asserts that the district court failed to address the following uncontested, material facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-12\">1. That appellees failed to provide reasons for the termination as required under the collective bargaining agreement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-13\">2. That the Academic Dean indicated at the March 9,1982 department meeting that appellant would be retained;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-14\">3. That faculty are assumed reappointed if not notified to the contrary; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>4. That appellant believed that the July 17, 1981 letter was not a final notice of termination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Like the district court in its Memorandum of Decision dated January 7,1986, this court finds these assertions to be of no great import in view of the unequivocal statements made by appellant during his deposition. Appellant admitted at his deposition that (1) he failed to file his EEOC claim because he was ignorant of the law and because he chose to await the outcome of a formal arbitration hearing before the Vermont Labor Relations Board; (2) appel-lee Murphy was emphatic in denying appellant\u2019s requests for reconsideration of the nonrenewal decision; and (3) a fellow faculty member \u2014 not Dean Dethy \u2014 had made the statement at the March 9, 1982 department meeting that \u201c[h]e feels that Dr. Shockley will return in the Fall.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">This deposition testimony makes clear appellant\u2019s state of mind during the period at issue. The discovery ordered by the district court when denying appellee\u2019s initial motion for summary judgment served the purpose for which it was intended \u2014 it made certain whether or not appellant was aware of the finality of the July 17, 1981 letter of non-reappointment or acted in reliance on appellee\u2019s actions. Appellant revealed during his deposition that he was dilatory in filing not because of some act on the part of appellees, but because of his ignorance of the law and willingness to await the outcome of the grievance procedure. Based on these facts, this court must affirm the findings that the July 17th letter of non-reappointment was a \u201cfinal\u201d notice of termination within the meaning of <em>Delaware State College v. Ricks, </em>449 U.S. 250, 101 S.Ct. 498, 66 L.Ed.2d 431 (1980), and that appellees did not act to mislead appellant. The district court\u2019s finding that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact is correct. The district court did not engage in the resolution of disputed factual questions, but instead relied on the \u201crecord, as now constituted\u201d which contained a clear statement of appellant\u2019s thought processes \u2014 his deposition. The contradictions existing in appellant\u2019s statements do not constitute disputed factual questions; rather they represent vain attempts to divine questions of fact. There being none, no trial is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">ATTORNEY\u2019S FEES</p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">Appellees\u2019 request, pursuant to section 706 of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5, for attorney\u2019s fees both below and on appeal is denied since appellant\u2019s action was not \u201cfrivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.\u201d <em>Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, </em>434 U.S. 412, 421, 98 S.Ct. 694, 700, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-11\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is hereby affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b562-12\">KEARSE, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AkH\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b562-13\">With due respect, I dissent from the decision to affirm the granting of summary judgment dismissing the complaint. My reading of the record persuades me that the district court resolved ambiguities and drew inferences in favor of the defendants, who were the moving parties, rather than in favor of plaintiff as nonmoving party as it was required to do in ruling on a motion for summary judgment. <em>See Adickes v. S.H. Kress &amp; Co., </em>398 U.S. 144, 157, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 1608, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970); <em>United States v. Diebold, Inc., </em>369 U.S. 654, 655, 82 S.Ct. 993, 994, 8 L.Ed.2d 176 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-14\">Plaintiff Joe Shockley, Jr., brought this action under, <em>inter alia, </em>Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq. </em>(1982), and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 <em>et seq. </em>(1982), seeking redress for his allegedly discriminatory discharge from his faculty position by defendants (collectively the \u201cCollege\u201d). Defendants asserted a statute-of-limitations defense grounded on the proposition that plaintiff had been given notice of termination by letter from the College president in July 1981 (\u201cJuly 1981 Letter\u201d), stating that plaintiff would not be reappointed for the 1982-83 academic year; they contended that in order to pursue his present claims plaintiff was required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>have filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) within 300 days of the July 1981 Letter, <em>i.e., </em>in the spring of 1982. Since the EEOC complaint was not filed until September 1982, defendants contended that the claims were time-barred, and they twice moved for summary judgment on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">From the outset, plaintiff took the position that his time to file his EEOC complaint should not be deemed to date from the July 1981 Letter because he had believed the letter was not a final notice of termination. He based this belief in part on the fact that other faculty members had received such letters and had been reappointed, and on the fact that the chairman of his department reported, in a department meeting on March 9, 1982 (\u201cMarch 1982 meeting\u201d), that the college dean had stated that he did not intend to fill plaintiff\u2019s position because he believed plaintiff would be returning in the fall of 1982. In support of his contention, plaintiff submitted the minutes of the March 1982 meeting, which reflected that the department chairman had made the statement described by plaintiff; an affidavit submitted by defendants supported the contention that other faculty members had received notices similar to that received by plaintiff and had been reappointed.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">In a Memorandum of Decision dated August 21, 1984 (\u201c1984 Decision\u201d), the court denied defendant\u2019s first motion for summary judgment. The court correctly discussed the principles governing the granting of summary judgment motions, <em>id. </em>at 8-9, noted plaintiff\u2019s factual contentions and the documentary support for them, and concluded that summary judgment on the statute-of-limitations defense was inappropriate because there existed an issue of fact as to whether the College was equitably estopped from relying on the July 1981 Letter to start the running of the limitations period:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-6\">[T]he clarity of Dr. Shockley\u2019s termination notice date of July 17, 1981 was clouded by several events which could have led plaintiff to believe that he could be rehired____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-9\">... [EJquitable grounds for tolling are present. That others in Dr. Shockley\u2019s position who received letters of non-reappointment were eventually reappointed and the Academic Dean\u2019s statement in Dr. Shockley\u2019s presence that he expected Dr. Shockley to return in the fall are sufficient grounds for tolling the running of the EEOC filing requirements until plaintiff\u2019s final day of actual employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-10\">Summary judgment is particularly inappropriate where, as here, conflicting inferences emerge from the facts. <em>Robertson v. Seidman &amp; Seidman, </em>609 F.2d 583, 591 (2d Cir.1979). Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party, it is clear that summary judgment must be denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">1984 Decision at 12-13 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-12\">Discovery ensued, including the taking of plaintiff\u2019s deposition, and in May 1985 defendants again moved for summary judgment on statute-of-limitations grounds. This time they argued that plaintiff\u2019s deposition answers showed that he had not delayed the filing of his EEOC complaint because he believed the July 1981 Letter was not a final notice of termination but instead had delayed filing because he wanted to await the outcome of a grievance proceeding he had instituted. Defendants sought to support this argument by noting that plaintiff had learned in the spring semester of 1982 of the right to file such a complaint, and by describing and quoting plaintiff\u2019s deposition testimony as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahk\">Plaintiff was then asked why once he found out, by reading a book, that he could file charges, he waited until the fall of 1982.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-13\">\u201cQ After you read in a book that you had a right to file charges, did you consider doing so at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-14\">\u201cA Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-15\">\u201cQ And is there some reason why you didn\u2019t do so in the spring of \u201982 as opposed to this fall of \u201982? Can you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>recall why you waited until late September to file those charges?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-4\">\u201cA Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-5\">\u201cQ What was the reason?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-6\">\u201cA I was waiting to hear the results of the labor board hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqy\">(Defendants\u2019 Memorandum of Law in Support of Second Motion for Summary Judgment at 6; footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">In a Memorandum of Decision dated January 7, 1986 (\u201c1986 Decision\u201d), the district court granted defendants\u2019 renewed motion for summary judgment, accepting defendants\u2019 argument that this testimony showed, dispositively, that the College\u2019s conduct, including the department chairman\u2019s statement at the March 1982 meeting that the dean expected plaintiff to return in the fall of 1982, had not misled plaintiff into thinking that the July 1981 Letter was not a final notice of termination. The court stated that when \u201c[ajsked why he did not file charges until the fall of 1982, the plaintiff explained the reason for the delay: T was waiting to hear the results of the labor board hearing.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5. The court concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-8\">[i]n opposition to the defendants\u2019 motion, the plaintiff does not refute his deposition testimony. He does not claim he was misled by the defendants\u2019 behavior. He merely asserts the issue presents a question of fact____ The only reason that has been presented to the court for the plaintiff\u2019s failure to file his charge is his ignorance of the law and his intentional delay to await the outcome of his state grievance proceeding. This is not enough____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-11\">The record, as now constituted, clearly demonstrates by the plaintiff\u2019s own testimony that he has not been obstructed in presenting his complaint by any misleading inducement or deceptive conduct on the part of the defendants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-12\">1986 Decision at 6-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-13\">In my view, the court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment on the basis of plaintiff's deposition testimony is flawed logically, doctrinally, and factually. First, the logical connection between the testimony as given and the inference that defendants and the court drew from it is lacking. The question was why plaintiff waited until fall to file his EEOC complaint rather than filing it in the spring. His answer was that he wanted to await the outcome of a labor board proceeding. This answer is in no way the equivalent of a concession that plaintiff was not misled by the College into believing there was no spring 1982 deadline; nor is there anything inconsistent between believing that there is no spring deadline (thus permitting one to wait until fall) and waiting until fall to gain new information. In order to treat plaintiff\u2019s deposition testimony as a concession, defendants and the court have in effect treated as equivalents questions or contentions that are entirely different. Thus they have either treated the question</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-15\">(A) \u201cWhy did you wait until fall?\u201d as if it had</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aiw-dedup-0\">been</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-17\">(B) \u201cWhy did you not meet the spring deadline?\u201d;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACb\">or treated plaintiff\u2019s contention that he was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-19\">(A) \u201cpermitted to wait until fall\u201d as being that he was</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-21\">(B) \u201crequired to wait until fall\u201d;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AjX\">or read his contention that he was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-22\">(A) \u201cnot required to file in the spring\u201d as being</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-23\">that he was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-24\">(B) \u201crequired not to file in the spring.\u201d In none of these pairs is (A) the equivalent of (B). In these pairings, (A) reflects the question asked and the plaintiff\u2019s contention. In granting summary judgment, however, the court read (A) as meaning only (B). Given the court\u2019s failure to distinguish (A) from (B), apparently the only way plaintiff could have avoided summary judgment here was to answer the question \u201cWhy did you wait until fall\u201d with the nonresponsive answer, \u201cI did not think I had a spring deadline because the College\u2019s actions had led me to believe the July 1981 Letter was not a final notice of termi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>nation.\u201d This answer would have been nonresponsive, of course, because the absence of a deadline is not a <em>reason </em>to wait; it is a condition that <em>permits </em>one to wait.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-4\">So far as the record before us discloses, plaintiff was not asked any question to which a responsive answer would have indicated that he was not led by the College to believe there was no spring 1982 deadline. Plaintiff was not asked whether he recognized a spring deadline; he was not asked on what he relied in assuming, if he did, that there was no spring deadline; he was not asked why, if he recognized a spring deadline, he did not meet that deadline in filing his EEOC complaint. He was asked only why he waited until fall. His answer that he waited because he wanted to learn the result of his labor board proceeding was directly responsive to this question, and to infer that this meant he thought there <em>was </em>a spring deadline is both contrary to summary judgment principles, which require that inferences be drawn in favor of the nonmoving party, and contrary to logic: The fact that plaintiff deliberately waited until fall \u2014 for whatever reason \u2014 is far more consonant with the inference that <em>he thought he did not </em>have a spring deadline.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Finally, in stating that plaintiff had not claimed he was misled by the College or otherwise sought to refute defendants' inference that the College\u2019s conduct played no role in his allowing the spring 1982 deadline to pass, the court ignored plaintiff\u2019s affidavit in opposition to defendants\u2019 second summary judgment motion. In that affidavit, dated June 12, 1985, plaintiff stated in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-6\">2. I did not consider the July 17,1981 letter from [the College] to me as an irrevocable notice of termination for several reasons, including the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-7\">b. I knew of several other faculty members who had received similar letters and had been retained. This was common knowledge among the faculty before and after I received the July 17, 1981 letter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-8\">c. When I was. hired by [the College] I was told in writing by President Murphy that the department chairman would represent my interests with the administration. John DeLeo was department chair in March, 1982 when he advised the department, during a meeting held to discuss staffing decisions, than <em>[sic </em>] Dean Ray Dethy had determined that I would be retained for the academic year 1982-83.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">The events described in these statements had been substantiated by documentary evidence submitted in connection with defendants\u2019 first summary judgment motion. Thus, even assuming that the court were correct in its characterization of plaintiff\u2019s deposition testimony as eschewing any reliance on the conduct of the College as having induced his belief that there was no spring 1982 deadline, the court was plainly wrong in its assertion that plaintiff had come forth with nothing to refute such a characterization.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">Because Shockley had alleged, and supported, facts sufficient to support a finding of equitable estoppel, the question of whether the College had misled him, causing him not to recognize a spring 1982 deadline for the filing of his EEOC complaint, and should therefore be equitably estopped from relying on the statute of limitations, was a question of fact to be decided by the factfinder at trial. <em>See Dill-man v. Combustion Engineering, Inc., </em>784 F.2d 57, 61 (2d Cir.1986); <em>Cerbone v. International Ladies\u2019 Garment Workers\u2019 Union, </em>768 F.2d 45, 47 (2d Cir.1985); <em>Aronsen v. Crown Zellerbach, </em>662 F.2d 584, 595 (9th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1200, 103 S.Ct. 1183, 75 L.Ed.2d 431 (1983); <em>Coke v. General Adjustment Bureau, </em>640 F.2d 584, 595 (5th Cir.1981). The district court\u2019s denial of summary judgment in its 1984 Decision was correct, and the development of the record to include plaintiff\u2019s innocuous response to the obliquely interpreted question of why he waited until the fall to file his claim did not resolve the factual issues and thus did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>make summary judgment any more appropriate in 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">Accordingly, I would vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for trial of at least the issue of equitable estop-pel.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
