EDWARDS, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b396-13\">Sandra Bisbey challenges the refusal of the District Court to hold the District of Columbia National Bank (\u201cthe Bank\u201d) liable for a violation of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act of 1984 (\u201cthe Act\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court found that the Bank, in its resolution of Ms. Bisbey\u2019s inquiry about her account, erroneously failed to deliver or mail to her an explanation of its investigative findings. However, the trial court concluded that the Act did not contemplate a finding of civil liability for this type of procedural mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-17\">We reverse the District Court. Although there is no evidence of bad faith in this case, it is nonetheless clear that Bank officials failed to comply with provisions of the Act. Therefore, the case must be remanded for a determination of civil liability and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-18\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b396-19\">A. <em>Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b396-20\">Ms. Bisbey opened a checking account with the defendant Bank in January 1981. Subsequently, she authorized the Bank to debit her checking account for fund transfer directives submitted monthly by the New York Life Insurance Company (\u201cNYL-IC\u201d) for payment for her insurance premiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-21\">In September 1981, Ms. Bisbey\u2019s account lacked sufficient funds to cover the NYLIC directive, and no transfer was made. Thus, the September request was resubmitted by NYLIC in October, along with the latter month\u2019s directive. Appellant\u2019s funds were insufficient to satisfy either submission, both of which were covered by the Bank. As a result, two overdraft notices were sent to Ms. Bisbey, each in the amount of her monthly insurance premium. The appellant, having forgotten her nonpayment in September, believed that the Bank had erroneously made two payments in October.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-22\">At this point, Ms. Bisbey informed a customer representative of the Bank that she believed that an error had occurred with regard to these preauthorized transfers. Upon request by the Bank, she confirmed her inquiry by letter. Approximately ten days later, an official of the Bank tele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>phoned appellant and orally explained that there had been no improper duplication of her premium payments. Ms. Bisbey, however, still considered the matter unresolved, and she filed suit under the EFTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">B. <em>Procedural History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">In her complaint, plaintiff alleged that the Bank unlawfully failed to properly inform her about the result of its investigation into the alleged duplication error in her checking account.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She sought compensatory, treble and liquidated damages; the Bank filed a counterclaim for costs and attorney\u2019s fees, alleging that the plaintiff had brought suit in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">In relevant part, the opinion of the District Court held that the Bank had failed to comply with its statutory obligation to provide written notice of its findings when it concluded that no electronic funds transfer error had occurred. However, the trial court determined that section 915 of the Act,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which provides for civil liability and attorney\u2019s fees for certain violations, was, by its own terms, not applicable to the mistake at issue. Finally, neither party was deemed to have acted in bad faith; thus, the District Court found that an award of attorney\u2019s fees was unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">Section 908(d) of the Act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-10\">If [a] financial institution determines after its investigation ... that an error did not occur, it shall <em>deliver or mail to consumer an explanation of its findings within 3 business days </em>after the conclusion of its investigation, and upon request of the consumer promptly deliver or mail to the consumer reproductions of all documents which the financial institution relied on to conclude that such error did not occur. <em>The financial institution shall include notice of the right to request reproductions with the explanation of its </em>findings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-16\">This section imposed a duty upon the Bank to \u201cdeliver or mail\u201d the results of its investigation to Ms. Bisbey and to advise her of her right to request reproductions of all documents which it relied upon to conclude that no error occurred.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The oral notice given to appellant was insufficient with respect to the required \u201cexplanation,\u201d and it did not even purport to give \u201cnotice of the right to request reproductions\u201d as required by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-17\">The Bank\u2019s foregoing failures to comply with the statute give rise to civil liability under section 915 of the Act. That section provides that \u201cany person who fails to comply with any provision of [the Act] with respect to any consumer, except for an error resolved in accordance with section 908, is liable to such consumer\u201d for actual damages or for a symbolic award. Thus, under the plain terms of the Act, civil liability attaches to <em>all </em>failures of compliance with respect to <em>any </em>provision of the Act, including section 908.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-18\">An examination of other provisions of the Act supports this analysis. We note, for example, that section 908(e) specifies certain egregious <em>violations of section 908 </em>which would result in an award of treble damages, such as a failure to provisionally recredit a consumer\u2019s account while simul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>taneously failing to perform a good faith investigation. The singling out of these particular violations and their focus on willful unlawfulness for an award of treble damages suggests that other failures to comply with the statute in the application of section 908 give rise to standard civil liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">The Bank contends that the only \u201cfail[ure]s to comply\u201d to which civil liability should adhere are those which <em>may be </em>cured by the error resolution process of section 908. And, appellee maintains, it is unlikely that such procedural mistakes as occur in the course of an attempt to utilize the error resolution process would, in turn, be resolved by that same process.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">This argument is patently flawed. There are \u201cfail[ure]s of compliance\u201d with the Act which cannot be or are unlikely to be resolved under section 908 \u2014 such as a violation of section 908 itself \u2014 and which nonetheless give rise to civil liability. For example, section 910 sets forth the liability of financial institutions for damages caused by certain acts and omissions with regard to electronic fund transfers. These acts and omissions plainly constitute \u201cfail[ure]s to comply\u201d with the Act, yet they do not fall within the statutory definition of \u201cerror\u201d for purposes of utilizing the error resolution procedures set forth in section 908.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But surely a financial institution cannot escape civil liability for a breach of section 910 merely because the breach cannot be resolved under section 908 pursuant to the \u201cerror\u201d correction procedures. Civil liability attaches due to the \u201cfail[ure] to comply\u201d with the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Section 915 provides for an exception to civil liability for \u201can error resolved in accordance with section 908.\u201d Plainly, this exception has no play in this case. The Bank\u2019s failures to comply <em>(i.e. </em>the failure to \u201cdeliver or mail ... an explanation\u201d <em>and </em>the failure to give \u201cnotice of the right to request reproductions\u201d) were never cured. Therefore, these failures cannot be viewed as \u201cerrors resolved in accordance with section 908\u201d within the exception to civil liability enunciated in section 915. The District Court\u2019s ruling to the contrary is simply wrong as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-13\">If the Bank had made a mistake in transferring funds from appellant\u2019s account and then had redressed the error pursuant to section 908 (without otherwise failing to comply with section 908), then the exception to section 915 would have to come into play. In such a case, the Bank could not be charged with civil liability for the mistaken transfer of funds because the \u201cerror\u201d would have been fully cured pursuant to section 908. In this case, however, there is no problem with mistaken fund transfers; rather, the problem here has arisen because the Bank failed to comply with provisions in the Act when addressing a lawful inquiry about <em>possible </em>mistaken fund transfers.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-14\">It may seem odd that the Bank is held liable for a transaction that benefited the plaintiff. Ms. Bisbey\u2019s account contained insufficient funds to cover either of the premium requests submitted by NYLIC. Though she had no overdraft agreement, the Bank did not charge an overdraft fee. Thus, the effect of the Bank\u2019s payments was to provide her, at no cost, with insurance coverage she would not have had otherwise. Upon Bisbey\u2019s inquiry, the Bank gave her a correct report but neglected to send it in writing, as the statute requires. Ms. Bisbey conceded below that she had suffered no damage and the District Court\u2019s surmise that she may have been benefited<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> seems correct. Despite this, the litigation has continued for nearly three years, and the statute compels a finding that the Bank is liable. Doubtless the discretion give the District Court to award only nominal damages and a \u201creasonable\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>attorney\u2019s fee<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> was designed to mitigate the results of strict liability in cases such as this, involving a technical and non-damaging violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The \u201cfail[ure]s to comply\u201d with the EFTA in the instant case are plain; moreover, they are failures to which civil liability attaches for they have not been resolved in accordance with section 908. We therefore remand this ease to the District Court for a determination of civil liability and attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to section 915.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b396-23\">. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1693 <em>et seq. </em>(Supp. II 1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b397-11\">. She also claimed that the Bank impermissibly failed to provisionally credit her checking account in the disputed amount pending resolution of her inquiry; however, that claim was decided adversely to her by the trial court and is not before us on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b397-12\">. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1693m (Supp. II 1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b397-13\">. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1693f(d) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b397-14\">. Although it did not cross-appeal the decision against it on this issue, the Bank suggests that the phrase \"deliver or mail\" encompasses oral delivery of the results of an investigation and argues that this theory provides an alternative ground for dismissal of the case. We disagree. This section also requires that, at the customer\u2019s request, reproductions of documents be delivered or mailed, obviously requiring a physical transfer of documents by mail or by hand. We find it highly improbable that these phrases would possess different meanings when used so closely in conjunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-20\">In any event, the Bank has no explanation for its failure to give appellant \"notice of the right to request reproductions,\" as required by the last sentence in the cited section.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b398-7\">. For example, under certain circumstances, a failure to make an electronic fund transfer is a violation of section 910, but that omission does not conform to any of the definitions of \"error\u201d in section 908.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b398-15\">. <em>See Bisbey v.
