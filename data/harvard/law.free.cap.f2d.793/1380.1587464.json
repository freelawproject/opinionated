By contrast, neither an undersecured creditor (one whose collateral is worth less than the amount of its debt) nor an unsecured creditor is entitled to receive such interest as part of its allowed claim. This case presents the question whether Congress in 1978, in codifying the principles which had developed under the common law to ensure that a secured creditor\u2019s interest in the value of its collateral would be adequately protected during the pendency of a reorganization proceeding, intended that' an undersecured creditor would be entitled to receive during the proceeding periodic cash interest payments on the value of the collateral, even though a claim for interest on the debt would not be allowed at the conclusion of the proceeding. The Ninth and Fourth Circuits hold that an undersecured creditor is entitled as a matter of law to periodic interest payments during the proceeding. <em>In re American Mariner Industries, Inc., </em>734 F.2d 426 (9th Cir.1984); <em>Grundy National Bank v. Tandem Mining Corp., </em>754 F.2d 1436 (4th Cir. 1985). The Eighth Circuit holds that an undersecured creditor is not entitled to such payments as a matter of law, but may be so entitled depending on the circumstances. <em>In re Briggs Transportation Co., </em>780 F.2d 1339 (8th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1382\">*1382</page-number>While recognizing the cogent arguments that have been adduced in support of both such positions, we are not persuaded that Congress intended in 1978 to make fundamental changes in the adequate protection rules as they had developed before 1978, or to alter, through adequate protection provisions, the settled rules regarding the accrual and payment of interest during the pendency of a bankruptcy proceeding. Further, a rule requiring periodic postpetition interest payments to undersecured creditors would often have a substantial adverse impact on the orderly procedures for the distribution of a debt- or\u2019s estate upon liquidation or reorganization; would frequently result in a premature reallocation of the unencumbered assets of an estate from unsecured to undersecured creditors; and would materially alter the rule that all creditors generally share some of the risk in a reorganization proceeding that a successful reorganization will not be feasible. We think it unlikely that Congress would have adopted such a rule \u2014 entailing, as it does, major changes in the way in which a reorganization proceeding is conducted \u2014 without clear, unequivocal statements to that effect in the bankruptcy statute or, at the least, in its legislative history. No such statements appear. To the contrary, the statute and its legislative history strongly suggest, and we hold, that Congress did not intend to provide undersecured creditors with periodic postpetition interest payments on the value of their collateral as an element of adequate protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-7\">Debtor Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates, Ltd. (\u201cTimbers\u201d) appeals from an order of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas affirming the decision of the Bankruptcy Court ordering payment to United Savings Association of Texas (\u201cUnited\u201d) of cash amounts representing lost \u201copportunity costs\u201d on the amount of United\u2019s secured claim. \u201cOpportunity costs,\u201d according to United, are the funds it would earn if it were allowed to foreclose its lien, sell the collateral and reinvest the proceeds.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> United cross-ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1383\">*1383</page-number>peals, asserting that the formula adopted by the Bankruptcy Court for determining the amount of payments is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-4\">The underlying facts are not complicated. Timbers is a limited partnership that owns a 188-unit apartment complex in northwest Houston. United holds a ten-year note executed by Timbers in June 1982, in the original principal amount of $4,100,000, secured by a deed of trust on the apartment complex and an assignment of rents. Monthly payments for the first three years of the note were to be $45,842.06, including an interest rate of fourteen percent, plus $7,956 monthly escrow for taxes and insurance. No payment has been made on the note since August 1984. United noticed a foreclosure on the Timbers property at some point, but on March 4, 1985, Timbers filed a petition under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code of 1978 (\u201cCode\u201d or \u201cBankruptcy Code\u201d), 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101-1330, automatically staying the foreclosure. United and Timbers entered into an agreed order that required Timbers to pay United the net income produced by the apartments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-5\">On March 18, 1985, United moved in the Bankruptcy Court for relief from the automatic stay under \u00a7 362(d)(1)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cfor cause, including the failure [by Timbers] to provide adequate protection of [United\u2019s] security interest.\u201d The Bankruptcy Court held an evidentiary hearing on the motion. Evidence introduced at the hearing indicates that on April 16, 1984, the principal balance of the note was $3,929,319.28 and unpaid accrued interest amounted to $437,-069.49, for a total of $4,366,388.77. Expert testimony introduced by Timbers fixed the \u201cfair market value\u201d of the property at $4,250,000, while United\u2019s expert placed its fair market value at $3,614,000 to $4,230,-000. Timbers\u2019 expert also testified that the \u201cliquidation value\u201d of the property was $2,650,000. Both experts agreed that the property value would appreciate to a modest extent, but United was at the time of the hearing, and for the purpose of this appeal remains, an undersecured creditor. There was no evidence that future appreciation would be able to provide security for interest accruing postpetition under the terms of the note. Neither party presented evidence on the likelihood of successful reorganization.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-8\">United argued at the hearing that absent the automatic stay, it would foreclose on and sell the property and reinvest the proceeds at the market rate. It argued that because Timbers had not provided it with \u201cadequate protection\u201d of its \u201cinterest\u201d in the present value of the proceeds, the stay should be dissolved. The Bankruptcy Court, in a detailed opinion, agreed in large part with United, and on April 24, 1985, ordered monthly payments of $50,456: $7,956 for the escrow, to commence immediately, and $42,500 for United\u2019s \u201clost opportunity cost\u201d to commence on September 4, 1985, based on a value on foreclosure of $4,250,000 and a 12% interest rate. 49 B.R. 454 (Bankr.S.D.Tex.1985). The lost opportunity payments are in an amount only slightly less than the monthly principal and interest payment due under the note \u2014 $45,-842.06. The court ordered that the lost opportunity payments \u201cmay be made from rental receipts otherwise subject to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1384\">*1384</page-number>agreed cash collateral order herein,\u201d but did not limit Timbers\u2019 obligation to the amount of the net rental income. The Bankruptcy Court relied in large part on the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>American Mariner. </em>On appeal, the District Court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-5\">Many commentators and courts view the issue before us as one of policy and economics. One side opines that the failure to award postpetition interest payments will restrict the availability of secured credit to the detriment of businesses that cannot obtain credit otherwise. The other concentrates on the deleterious effects that post-petition interest payments will have on the possibility of reorganizations. It seems that the debate has become not what the Bankruptcy Code requires, but what it should require. If we were Members of Congress, or if bankruptcy law were not controlled by a statute, we might find the economic debate of primary significance. However, as judges, we must be governed by congressional intent as set forth in the Bankruptcy Code. \u201cThe relevant question is not whether, as an abstract matter, the rule advocated ... accords with good policy. The question we must consider is whether the policy [advocated] is that which Congress effectuated by its enactment of\u201d the statute at issue. <em>Badaracco v. Commissioner, </em>464 U.S. 386, 398, 104 S.Ct. 756, 764, 78 L.Ed.2d 549 (1984). \u201cCourts are not authorized to rewrite a statute because they might deem its effects susceptible of improvement.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1462-6\">The issue we face is simply one of statutory interpretation: Does \u201cadequate protection\u201d under \u00a7 362(d)(1) contemplate that an undersecured creditor will receive post-petition interest periodically in cash or some other form to compensate it for \u201clost opportunity\u201d when its right to foreclose is temporarily suspended by the automatic stay? Our role in interpreting statutes is limited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1462-12\">While the judicial function in construing legislation is not a mechanical process from which judgment is excluded, it is nevertheless very different from the legislative function. Construction is not legislation and must avoid \u201cthat retrospective expansion of meaning which properly deserves the stigma of judicial legislation.\u201d <em>Kirschbaum v. Walling, </em>316 U.S. 517, 522 [62 S.Ct. 1116, 1119, 86 L.Ed. 1638]. To blur the distinctive functions of the legislative and the judicial processes is not conducive to responsible legislation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1462-13\"><em>Addison v. Holly Hill Fruit Products Co., </em>322 U.S. 607, 618, 64 S.Ct. 1215, 1221, 88 L.Ed. 1488 (1944) (Frankfurter, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-14\">The familiar starting point in statutory interpretation is the plain meaning rule: \u201cthe meaning of the statute must, in the first instance, be sought in the language in which the act is framed, and if that is plain, ... the sole function of the courts is to enforce it according to its terms.\u201d <em>Cami-netti v. United States, </em>242 U.S. 470, 485, 37 S.Ct. 192, 194, 61 L.Ed. 442 (1917). In interpreting a statute, it must be recalled that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1462-15\">[E]ach part or section [of a statute] should be construed in connection with every other part or section so as to produce a harmonious whole. Thus it is not proper to confine interpretation to the one section to be construed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1462-16\">2A N. Singer, <em>Sutherland Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 46.05, at 90 (rev. 4th ed. 1984 &amp; Supp.1985).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1462-17\">With these principles in mind, we turn to an examination of the language of the relevant provisions of the Code. In general, a creditor may receive funds from a debtor after a bankruptcy petition is filed during the two distinct periods of the proceeding: at its termination and during its pendency. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1385\">*1385</page-number>First, we review the sections that determine the amount of a claim that the court may allow at the termination of the proceeding, when the bulk of the estate\u2019s assets historically has been distributed, and whether that claim may include an amount for interest accruing during the proceeding. \u00a7\u00a7 502, 506. Second, we examine the provisions requiring adequate protection of a secured creditor\u2019s interest in its collateral during the proceeding, \u00a7\u00a7 361-362(d)(l), which under certain circumstances may require payments to a secured creditor from the- estate before the proceeding is concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-5\">A. The Allowed Secured Claim and Interest \u2014 \u00a7\u00a7 502 and 506.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-6\">After a debtor files a bankruptcy petition, a creditor may file a proof of claim against the estate in the amount that it asserts is owed to it by the debtor. The claim is deemed to be \u201callowed\u201d if no party in interest objects, \u00a7 502(a), or if the court after notice and a hearing allows the claim, in the amount owing as of the date that the petition was filed, \u00a7 502(b). An allowed claim of a creditor secured by a lien on property of the debtor is an \u201callowed secured claim\u201d to the extent of the value of that creditor\u2019s interest in the property, and is an unsecured claim to the extent that the amount of the allowed secured claim is less than the amount of the allowed claim. \u00a7 506(a). The value of the collateral is determined in light of the purpose of the valuation and of the proposed disposition or use of the collateral. \u00a7 506(a). A creditor with an allowed secured claim may receive, upon termination of the proceeding or at such earlier time as may be allowed by the court, either the collateral or the value of the collateral up to the amount of the allowed secured claim. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 506(a), 726(a), 1129. To the extent that an allowed claim is unsecured by a lien on property of the estate, the creditor\u2019s allowed claim may be paid out of unencumbered assets of the estate in accordance with the priority schedule set forth in \u00a7 507(a). In summary, therefore, an undersecured creditor in effect wears two hats because it has two types of claims at the conclusion of a proceeding: an allowed secured claim in an amount equal to the value of its collateral, and an unsecured claim for any deficiency, which is treated as is any other unsecured claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1463-10\">As a general rule, creditors are not allowed a claim for interest accruing on their debts during bankruptcy proceedings. Since the middle of the 18th century, bankruptcy law has provided that interest on debts does not accrue after a bankruptcy petition is filed. <em>Sexton v. Dreyfus, </em>219 U.S. 339, 344, 31 S.Ct. 256, 257, 55 L.Ed. 244 (1911) (\u201cFor more than a century and a half the theory of the English bankrupt system has been that everything stops at a certain date. Interest was not computed beyond the date of the commission.\u201d). The rule developed \u201cnot because of the words of the statute, but as a fundamental principle\u201d of equity. <em>Id. </em>The reason for the rule as it developed was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJE\">Exaction of interest, where the power of a debtor to pay even his contractual obligations is suspended by law, has been prohibited because it was considered in the nature of a penalty imposed because of delay in prompt payment \u2014 a delay necessitated by law if the courts are properly to preserve and protect the estate for the benefit of <em>all </em>interests involved____ \u201c[T]he delay in distribution is the act of the law; it is a necessary incident to the settlement of the estate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1463-12\"><em>Vanston Bondholders Protection Committee v. Green, </em>329 U.S. 156, 163, 67 S.Ct. 237, 240, 91 L.Ed. 162 (1946) (quoting <em>Thomas v. Western Car Co., </em>149 U.S. 95, 116-17, 13 S.Ct. 824, 833, 37 L.Ed. 663 (1893)). In other words, allowing the accrual of postpetition interest in favor of one creditor would be \u201cinequitable\u201d to other creditors. <em>Vanston, </em>329 U.S. at 164, 67 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1386\">*1386</page-number>S.Ct. at 240; <em>cf. Ticonic National Bank v. Sprague, </em>303 U.S. 406, 411, 58 S.Ct. 612, 614, 82 L.Ed. 926 (1938) (\u201cIt is in order to assure equality among creditors as of the date of insolvency that interest accruing thereafter is not considered.\u201d). Justice Stewart reiterated this rationale in <em>Nicholas v. United States, </em>384 U.S. 678, 86 S.Ct. 1674, 16 L.Ed.2d 853 (1966):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1464-4\">We believe that the decisions of this Court in <em>Sexton </em>and <em>[New York v.] Super </em>[, 336 U.S. 328, 69 S.Ct. 554, 93 L.Ed. 710 (1949),] reflect the broad equitable principle that creditors should not be disadvantaged <em>vis-a-vis </em>one another by legal delays attributable solely to the time-consuming procedures inherent in the administration of the bankruptcy laws. In the context of interest-bearing debts, the equitable principle enunciated in <em>Sexton </em>and <em>Super </em>rests at bottom on an awareness of the inequity that would result if, through the continuing accumulation of interest in the course of subsequent bankruptcy proceedings, obligations bearing relatively high rates of interest were permitted to absorb the assets of a bankruptcy estate whose funds were already inadequate to pay the principal of the debts owed by the estate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1464-5\">384 U.S. at 683-84, 86 S.Ct. at 1679.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-6\">The rule barring accrual of postpetition interest on secured debt did not apply in certain situations where the reason for the rule was itself inapplicable. First, an oversecured creditor was entitled, depending on the equities of the situation, to claim postpetition interest, but only to the extent that the principal of the debt plus accrued interest did not exceed the value of the collateral securing the debt and the interest.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Vanston, </em>329 U.S. at 164-65, 67 S.Ct. at 240-41; <em>Sexton, </em>219 U.S. at 346, 31 S.Ct. at 258; <em>Coder v. Arts, </em>152 F. 943, 950 (8th Cir.1907), <em>aff'd, </em>213 U.S. 223, 29 S.Ct. 436, 53 L.Ed. 772 (1909). Further, secured creditors (and unsecured creditors, as well) might be entitled to postpetition interest if the debtor\u2019s estate ultimately proved to be solvent. <em>American Iron &amp; Steel Mfg. Co. v. Seaboard Airline Railway Co., </em>233 U.S. 261, 266, 34 S.Ct. 502, 504, 58 L.Ed. 949 (1914) (\u201cif as a result of good fortune or good management, the estate proved sufficient to discharge the claims in full, interest as well as principal should be paid\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1464-11\">This rule regarding accrual of postpetition interest arose when the bankruptcy laws did not provide for reorganization and consisted only of a mechanism to liquidate an estate equitably. <em>See American Iron and Steel Mfg. Co., </em>233 U.S. at 266, 34 S.Ct. at 504. Nevertheless, as the bankruptcy laws developed to provide for reorganizations, the rule was extended to Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898 (\u201cAct\u201d) arrangement proceedings so that \u201cthe accumulation of interest must be suspended as of the date the Chapter XI petition was filed,\u201d <em>Nicholas, </em>384 U.S. at 686, 86 S.Ct. at 1681, and to corporate reorganization proceedings under Chapter X of the Act, <em>id. </em>at 686 n. 14, 86 S.Ct. at 1681 n. 14.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1465-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1387\">*1387</page-number>The Code expressly continued these prevailing rules.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Under \u00a7 502(b)(2), a claim against an estate will not be allowed to the extent that \u201csuch claim is for unmatured interest\u201d as of the date of the filing of the petition. Section 506(b) continues the pre-Code rule applicable to the oversecured creditor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1465-4\">(b) To the extent that an allowed secured claim is secured by property the value of which, after any recovery under subsection (c) of this section, is greater than the amount of such claim, there shall be allowed to the holder of such claim, interest on such claim, and any reasonable fees, costs, or charges provided for under the agreement under which such claim arose.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1465-5\">The Code continues to treat oversecured and undersecured creditors differently as to their entitlement to a claim for postpetition interest at the end of a reorganization proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-6\">In summary, the interest provisions of the Code and its predecessors, as interpreted by the Supreme Court for almost a century, are premised on the equitable principle that the unencumbered assets of a debtor\u2019s estate will not be used to benefit one class of creditors at the expense of another class. Such would be the case if unencumbered assets, otherwise available for the payment of unsecured claims, were used to pay postpetition interest on un-dersecured debt. Allowing a claim for postpetition interest by an oversecured creditor, on the other hand, is not inconsistent with that equitable principle, because only assets encumbered by the creditor\u2019s lien will be used to fund the payment of postpetition accrued interest.'</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-12\">B. The Automatic Stay and Adequate Protection Payments \u2014 \u00a7\u00a7 361 and 362.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-13\">Upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition, \u00a7 362(a) of the Code imposes an automatic stay on actions by creditors to collect their claims from a debtor. Section 362(a) temporarily bars a creditor from, among other things, foreclosing on a debtor\u2019s property to enforce a security interest. The purpose of the automatic stay is to \u201cgive[] the business a breathing spell and time to work constructively with its creditors\u201d to propose a plan of reorganization, as well as to prevent creditors from \u201cobtaining preferential treatment by quick action.\u201d <em>House Report, supra, </em>at 174.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1465-14\">Under \u00a7 362(d), a creditor may obtain relief from the stay (1) \u201cfor cause, including the lack of adequate protection\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1388\">*1388</page-number>of the creditor\u2019s interest in the collateral, or (2) when a \u201cdebtor does not have an equity in\u201d the property and \u201cthe property is not necessary to an effective reorganization.\u201d If a creditor files a complaint seeking relief from the stay under \u00a7 362(d), the burden of proof, or the risk of non-persuasion, is on the debtor for all issues except the issue of the debtor\u2019s equity in the property, \u00a7 362(g). Therefore, in a proceeding arising under \u00a7 362(d)(1), the debtor must prove that the secured creditor\u2019s interest is adequately protected, or the automatic stay will lift.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-4\">The phrase \u201cadequate protection of an interest in property\u201d set forth in \u00a7 362(d)(1) is not defined in the Code. However, \u00a7 361 lists three ways that \u201cadequate protection may be provided.\u201d Under \u00a7 361(1), a debt- or may be required to make a cash payment or periodic cash payments to a creditor, to the extent that the stay \u201cresults in a decrease in the value of\u201d the creditor\u2019s interest in the property. This method would seem to be particularly appropriate when collateral is depreciating at a steady rate. Under \u00a7 361(2), a creditor may be given a lien on unencumbered property, again to the extent that the stay \u201cresults in a decrease in the value of\u201d the creditor\u2019s interest in the property. This would appear to protect a secured creditor when a debtor proposes to use cash collateral or may consume other collateral at an uneven rate, such as inventory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-5\">Under \u00a7 361(3), a catch-all provision, the court may \u201cgrant other relief ... as will result in the realization by [the creditor] of the indubitable equivalent of\u201d the creditor\u2019s interest in the property. A guarantee or bond by a third person not involved in the proceeding might provide such protection. Section 361(3) expressly states, however, that providing a creditor with an administrative priority claim as a form of adequate protection is precluded, although an administrative priority is automatically provided by \u00a7 507(b) in the event that the form of adequate protection actually provided by the court ultimately proves to be insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-8\">Clearly neither subsection (1) nor (2) authorizes periodic payments to a creditor whose collateral is not decreasing in value. The issue presented in this case is whether subsection (3) was intended by Congress to permit the periodic payment to an underse-cured creditor of postpetition interest on the value of its collateral when that creditor would not have a claim for postpetition interest at the conclusion of the proceeding, or whether Congress simply intended subsection (3) to permit a bankruptcy judge to fashion methods of protection against a decline in value of collateral alternative to those set forth in subsections (1) (cash payments) and (2) (replacement liens).</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-9\">The origin of the phrase \u201cindubitable equivalent\u201d that appears in \u00a7 361(3) arguably provides support for a conclusion that \u00a7 361(3) goes beyond protection against a decline in value of the collateral and requires payment of postpetition interest.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The phrase first appeared in Judge Learned Hand\u2019s leading opinion in <em>In re Murel Holding Co., </em>75 F.2d 941 (2d Cir. 1935), which held in the context of the proposed confirmation of a plan proposed by a debtor over the dissent of a secured creditor (commonly called a cram-down) that the dissenting secured creditor was entitled to the present value of his secured claim in cash or \u201ca substitute of the most indubitable equivalence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 942. The court noted that the usual way the equivalent of a claim is provided following confirmation of a plan of reorganization is by paying the creditor post-confirmation interest on the amount of the claim. By using the \u201cindubitable equivalent\u201d phrase in \u00a7 361, Congress conceivably imported the standard for the confirmation of a plan over the dissent of a class of secured credi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1389\">*1389</page-number>tors into the adequate protection provisions of the Code, requiring protection of the present value of a creditor\u2019s secured claim during the stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-5\">Reliance on the phrase to award postpetition interest payments as protection of a creditor\u2019s interest, however, begs the question: \u201cindubitable equivalent\u201d in \u00a7 361(3) refers to a substitute for a particular interest; it does not define the interest. Subsections (1) and (2) state that the creditor is protected against a decline in the value of the collateral occasioned by the use, sale or lease of the collateral by the debtor during the stay. Subsection (3) does not state what interest is to be protected during the automatic stay. In the context of the entire section, it is certainly possible that subsection (3) simply gives the court means of providing adequate protection that are alternatives to those set forth in (1) and (2), periodic cash payments and replacement liens, to compensate a creditor for a decline in value of its collateral.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> If that is the case, subsection (3) does not expand the range of substantive creditor interests protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-6\">Indeed, overreliance on <em>Murel </em>in this situation may be barred by the language of <em>Murel </em>itself. The court stated that the Act required <em>post-plan </em>interest payments to provide a secured creditor with complete compensation. However, the court plainly added that \u201c[n]o doubt less [than complete compensation] will be required- to hold up the suit for a short time until the debtor shall have a chance to prepare; much depends upon how long he has had already, and upon how much more he demands.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 943.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1467-12\">Our examination of the language of the adequate protection provisions suggests that they were intended to protect a secured creditor against a decrease in the value of its collateral due to the debtor\u2019s use, sale or lease of that collateral during the stay. There is little in the language of the statute to support a requirement that a debtor make periodic postpetition interest payments to an undersecured creditor, particularly when the Code makes it unmistakably clear that an undersecured creditor is not entitled to a claim for such interest at the conclusion of the proceeding. However, in using the \u201cindubitable equivalent\u201d language in \u00a7 361(3), Congress conceivably intended to protect the <em>present value </em>of a secured creditor\u2019s collateral during the stay, rather than simply its <em>value. </em>Accordingly, we must conclude that \u00a7 361 is not only ambiguous on its face but also when considered in light of the interest provisions of the Code. We have already considered briefly the legislative history of the interest provisions of the Code, <em>see supra </em>note 8, and we turn now to the legislative history of the adequate protection provisions for further enlightenment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-14\">Helpful to an understanding of what Congress intended by the phrase \u201cadequate protection\u201d in the Code is a review of the law existing at the time the Code was enacted in 1978 and the preenactment history of the stay provisions, because Congress expressly indicated that it intended to codi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1390\">*1390</page-number>fy certain aspects of the existing common law and rules. Further, \u201c[t]he normal rule of statutory construction is that if Congress intends for legislation to change the interpretation of a judicially created concept, it makes that intent specific.\u201d <em>Mid-lantic National Bank v. New Jersey, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 755, 760, 88 L.Ed.2d 859 (1986). That rule is \u201cfollowed ... with particular care in construing the scope of bankruptcy codifications.\u201d <em>Id. See also United States v. Whiting Pools, Inc., </em>462 U.S. 198, 208, 103 S.Ct. 2309, 2315, 76 L.Ed.2d 515 (1983) (construing provision of Bankruptcy Code to be \u201cconsistent with judicial precedent predating\u201d Code at least when \u201c[njothing in the legislative history evinces a congressional intent to depart from\u201d pre-Code practice). Committee hearings and the House and Senate committee reports accompanying respective versions of the proposed Code and statements by congressional leaders also provide important indications of congressional intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-4\">A. Pre-enactment History.</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-5\">The rules Congress set forth in \u00a7 361 and \u00a7 362 regarding the automatic stay and the circumstances under which it might be lifted were not particularly innovative. Rather, even absent express statutory authority, the Supreme Court held as long ago as 1845 that the bankruptcy court had the equitable power to restrain creditors from enforcing liens after a bankruptcy petition was filed. <em>Ex parte Christy, </em>44 U.S. (3 How.) 292, 11 L.Ed. 603 (1845); <em>see also Mueller v. Nugent, </em>184 U.S. 1, 14, 22 S.Ct. 269, 274, 46 L.Ed. 405 (1902). And creditors\u2019 interests were not ignored before a lack of adequate protection was expressly codified as a reason for lifting the stay: \u201cCase law had made adequate protection of the secured creditor a major consideration long before the [draft predecessor of the Code] proposed to codify it as a requirement.\u201d Webster, <em>Collateral Control Decisions in Chapter Cases: Clear Rules vs. Judicial Discretion, </em>51 Am.Bankr.LJ. 197, 237 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-11\">Protection of secured creditors\u2019 rights was frequently considered by the Supreme Court in connection with constitutional concerns raised by secured creditors. These cases primarily address creditors\u2019 rights at the time of confirmation of a plan, but the principles they enunciate are equally applicable to stays at the outset, and provide guidance on the limits of the equitable powers of the court that remain valid. 2 <em>Collier on Bankruptcy </em>11362.01, at 362-11, 362-12 (15th ed. 1980). In general, the Fifth Amendment requires only that the value of the secured position of a creditor be maintained during the stay.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1391\">*1391</page-number>Within this constitutional limit, general rules evolved in the courts governing the exercise of their equitable power to grant<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> or lift a stay. The courts developed four factors to determine whether to vacate a stay:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1469-5\">(1) Would continuation of the stay result in an undue risk of material harm to the secured creditor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1469-6\">(2) Was there a reasonable possibility of reorganization or rehabilitation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1469-7\">(3) Was the property in question needed by the debtor or necessary to rehabilitation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1469-8\">(4) Was there any equity in the property that might be realized for the benefit of the debtor or its creditors?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1469-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 362-22, 362-23. Although \u201c[a] positive answer on the first point ... was almost invariably fatal to the debtor,\u201d in determining \u201cwhether to vacate the stay, courts tended to emphasize the need for judicial flexibility and the need to apply equitable considerations in determining the \u2018balance of the hurt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 362-23. The weight of the factors depended to some extent on the chapter of the Act governing the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1469-10\">In a Chapter X proceeding, involving a corporate reorganization, the stay was usually vacated if its continuance would result in \u201cmaterial harm\u201d to a secured creditor, but the other factors were frequently important. <em>Id. A </em>creditor was not materially harmed by the stay when the value of its lien was maintained during the pendency of the stay. In the case of depreciating collateral, this typically required periodic cash payments or other transfers of value equal to the depreciation to be provided to the creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1469-15\">However, in <em>In re Yale Express System, Inc., </em>384 F.2d 990 (2d Cir.1967), the court arguably softened that requirement. <em>Yale Express </em>involved collateral (truck trailers) depreciating through use by the debtor. The court held that \u201cto such extent as [the secured creditor] has been damaged by the use of its property pending the reorganization, it is entitled to equitable consideration in the reorganization plan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 992. In other words, the secured creditor apparently was entitled only to an administrative priority to compensate for depreciation; <em>Yale Express </em>seems to hav\u00e9 adopted the dubious assumption that administrative expenses would be paid in full.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In <em>In re Bermec Corp., </em>445 F.2d 367 (2d Cir.1971), the court retreated from <em>Yale Express. </em>To protect the creditor\u2019s interest in the collateral, the court ordered that the debtor periodically pay the secured creditors in cash for the \u201ceconomic depreciation\u201d of the collateral, <em>id. </em>at 369,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> rather than force the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1392\">*1392</page-number>creditor to accept a more risky administrative priority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-4\">A Chapter XI petition proposed an arrangement, or \u201cany plan by a debtor for the settlement, satisfaction, or extension of the time of payment of his unsecured debts, upon any terms.\u201d 8 <em>Collier on Bankruptcy </em>H 4.01, at 343 (14th ed. 1976). Chapter XI\u2019s express stay provision, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 714 (1976) (repealed 1978), allowed the court to enter a stay \u201cfor cause shown,\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and under the rules, the stay could be lifted \u201cfor cause shown,\u201d Rule ll-44(d). Because under Chapter XI a secured claim could not be affected by the arrangement, \u201cstronger grounds should be required to continue the stay against a lienor in a Chapter XI case than would be required in a proceeding ... under present Chapter X, and it should particularly be shown that continuation of the stay will cause no substantial injury to the lienor.\u201d 8 <em>Collier on Bankruptcy </em>H 3.22, at 256 (14th ed. 1976). <em>See Lance, Inc. v. Dewco Services, Inc., </em>422 F.2d 778, 782 (9th Cir. 1970).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1470-5\">Chapter XII of the Act governed cases involving real property arrangements by persons other than corporations.

Criticism of Pre-Code Stay Provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-7\">The automatic stay provisions of the Bankruptcy Act had the salutary goal of \u201cprotection of the estate of the bankrupt against the ravages that would be inflicted on the estate if grab law were allowed to govern.\u201d Kennedy, <em>The Automatic Stay in Bankruptcy, </em>11 U.MiehJ.L.Ref. 175, 187 (1977) [hereinafter cited as <em>Automatic Stay </em>/]. However, the estate\u2019s interests were not overriding; the stay was to be lifted \u201cfor cause,\u201d including material harm to a secured creditor. Thus Congress and the courts attempted to strike a balance between the interests of debtors, unsecured creditors and the public in the rehabilitative process, and secured creditors\u2019 rights to foreclose on collateral upon default.</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-13\">In light of the harm that could befall secured creditors due to the stay, the bankruptcy rules provided that stay relief requests were to receive \u201cpriority\u201d in the bankruptcy courts. However, it appears that Congress\u2019 aspiration to expedite stay relief litigation was not realized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aak-dedup-0\">Unfortunately, it has been said that this provision of the rule is more honored in the breach than in the performance. It may be extremely difficult in an active bankruptcy court to disrupt scheduled proceedings to conform with the requirements of Rule ll-44(d).

A request for relief from the stay was initiated by a complaint in an adversary proceeding, which \u201ccaused significant difficulties in the administration of bankruptcy estates,\u201d because the debtor often asserted complex affirmative defenses or counterclaims. Peitzman &amp; Smith, <em>The Secured Creditor\u2019s Complaint: Relief from the Automatic Stays in Bankruptcy Proceedings, </em>65 Calif.L.Rev. 1216, 1259 (1977).

Commission Proposals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1471-7\">In response to numerous calls for reform of the bankruptcy laws, Congress established the Commission on Bankruptcy Laws of the United States in 1970. After two years of research and public and private meetings, the Commission submitted a report on the bankruptcy laws and draft legislation to correct perceived inadequacies in the Act, particularly in the area of administration. The draft legislation accompanying the Report proposed to codify the common law standards for adequately protecting secured creditors during the pendency of the automatic stay. <em>Report of the Commission on the Bankruptcy Laws of the United States, </em>H.R.Doc. No. 137, pt. II, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. 236-37 (1973) [hereinafter cited as <em>Commission Report </em>].<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The official comments accompanying the proposed legislation explained the purpose of the section:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1471-3\">1.

This is analgous [sic] to the \u201ccram down\u201d provision of \u00a7 7-303(7). <em>Conditions which may be imposed by the court, when appropriate, include (1) requiring other security of an equivalent value; (2) if there is no equity or the equity is marginal, requiring additional security to the extent of the anticipated decrease in the value of collateral as a result of use; and (3) giving a priority if it is clear that the proceeds of the liquidation of the property of the estate available to pay the claim will be sufficient.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1471-14\"><em>Id. </em>at 236-37 (emphasis added).

Committee Hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1472-4\">The Commission\u2019s draft legislation and alternative legislation drafted by the National Conference of Bankruptcy Judges were introduced in 1973 and 1974 and reintroduced in 1975.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Congress held extensive hearings on the draft legislation throughout 1975 and 1976. <em>See Bankruptcy Act Revision: Hearings on H.R. 31 and H.R. 32 before the Subcomm. on Civil and Constitutional Rights, House Comm, on the Judiciary, </em>94th Cong., 2d Sess.

For example, several witnesses advocated speed and flexibility in the reorganization process so that the proceedings could be concluded \u201cin a matter of months rather than years.\u201d <em>House Hearings, supra, </em>at 437.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Further, several contended that the Commission proposal did not adequately protect creditors against a decline in value of the collateral, particularly \u201csoft\u201d or \u201cself-liquidating\u201d collateral such as cash, accounts receivable, chattel paper, contract rights, and inventory.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1395\">*1395</page-number>witnesses supported the Commission\u2019s general proposal to codify the common law standard protecting against depreciation during the stay, but suggested that various examples of how to provide protection to the secured creditor, which the Commission had set forth in its Comments, be codified.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1473-12\">The simple fact is that in thirty-five days of in-depth hearings before the House subcommittee resulting in over 2700 pages of testimony from more than 100 witnesses, as well as in Senate hearings that were nearly as extensive, the subject of periodic postpetition interest payments for underse-cured creditors was not raised in the testimony or prepared statement of a single witness.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Not one of the many witnesses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1396\">*1396</page-number>for secured creditors even mentioned the award of postpetition interest payments or sought compensation for the delay required by the stay.

Amendments and Committee Reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b1474-5\">Following the committee hearings, the Commission\u2019s proposals were redrafted and reintroduced in the House and Senate. Thereafter, the legislation that became the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 went through further revisions before its final enactment by Congress. Accordingly, statements in the legislative history must be carefully compared to the version of the bill to which they referred. As in most analyses of legislative history, \u201c[t]he best method ... is to begin with the most recent statement of authority and delve backward through the legislative process.\u201d Klee, <em>Legislative History, supra, </em>28 DePaul L.Rev. at 957. However, we will begin by reviewing post-hearing amendments and the House and Senate Judiciary Committee reports although they are not the most recent statements of authority, because the final version of the bill may be more readily understood if the chronological development of its components is known.</p>\n<p id=\"b1474-6\">Proposed \u00a7 362(d) of the House bill favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee on September 8, 1977, H.R. 8200, provided that the automatic stay could be lifted \u201cfor cause, including the lack of adequate protection of an interest in property\u201d of a creditor. The House Report stated that \u201c[t]he interests of which the court may provide protection ... include equitable as well as legal interests,\u201d citing as an example \u201ca right to recover property under a consignment.\u201d <em>House Report, supra, </em>at 338, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1978, p. 6294. Section 361 was designed \u201cto illustrate means by which [adequate protection] may be provided and to define the contours of the concept.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Report summarized the concept of adequate protection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1474-10\">The concept is derived from the fifth amendment protection of property interests. <em>See Wright v. Union Central Life Ins. Co., </em>311 U.S. 273 [61 S.Ct. 196, 85 L.Ed. 184] (1940); <em>Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank v. Radford, </em>295 U.S. 555 [55 S.Ct. 854, 79 L.Ed. 1593] (1935). It is not intended to be confined strictly to the constitutional protection required, however. The section, and the concept of adequate protection, is based as much on policy grounds as on constitutional grounds. Secured creditors should not be deprived of the benefit of their bargain. There may be situations in bankruptcy where giving a secured creditor an absolute right to his bargain may be impossible or seriously detrimental to the bankruptcy laws. Thus, this section recognizes the availability of alternate means of protecting a secured creditor\u2019s interest. Though the creditor might not receive his bargain in kind, the purpose of the section is to insure that the secured creditor receives in value essentially what he bargained for.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1474-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 339, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1978, p. 6295.</p>\n<p id=\"b1474-12\">The Report discussed four \u201cneither exclusive nor exhaustive\u201d examples or means of providing adequate protection set forth in the House\u2019s proposed \u00a7 361. Codification of the examples was apparently in response to the suggestions of numerous witnesses for secured creditors that the section drafted by the Commission gave too much discretion to the bankruptcy judge. Proposed \u00a7 361(1), assertedly patterned on the protection devised in <em>In re Yale Express, </em>but actually closer to that set forth in <em>In re Bermec, </em>would permit \u201cperiodic cash payments by the estate, to the extent of a decrease in value of the opposing entity\u2019s interest in the property involved.\u201d <em>House Report, supra, </em>at 339, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1978, p. 6295. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1397\">*1397</page-number>\u201c[WJhere, for example, the property in question is depreciating at a relatively fixed rate,\u201d periodic payments would \u201ccompensate for the depreciation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Proposed \u00a7 361(2) provided for \u201can additional or replacement lien on other property to the extent of the decrease in value of the property involved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That would \u201cprovide the protected entity with a means of realizing the value of the original property, if it should decline during the case____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 339-40, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.

Because the method would be \u201crisky,\u201d it was only to be used \u201cwhen there is relative certainty that administrative expenses will be able to be paid in full in the event of liquidation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1475-7\">Proposed \u00a7 361(4), a catch-all provision, would have allowed the court to grant \u201csuch other relief as will result in the realization by the protected entity of the value of its interest in the property involved.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>29</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The report offered as an example a \u201cguarantee by a third party outside the judicial process of compensation for any loss incurred in the case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1475-8\">The Report noted that all four methods \u201crely ... on the value of the protected entity\u2019s interest in the property involved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, \u201c[t]he section does not specify how value is to be determined, nor does it specify when it is to be determined. These matters are left to case-by-case interpretation and development.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>30</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1475-11\">The House Report was somewhat cryptic in its general discussion of \u201cthe contours of the concept\u201d of adequate protection. The paragraph of the report that has provided the most support for the <em>American Mariner </em>line of cases is contained within this discussion, the statements that \u201c[sjecured creditors should not be deprived of the benefit of their bargain,\u201d <em>House Report, supra, </em>at 339, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 1978, p. 6295, and that adequate protection is intended to result in \u201crealization\u201d by the secured creditor \u201cof the value of its interest in the property involved,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 340, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1978, p. 6296. The report does not explain the \u201cbenefit of their bargain\u201d of which secured creditors should not be deprived. In the context of the entire report, however, it seems likely that the bargain referred to is the bargain to receive the collateral or its value upon default. Although the stay temporarily prevents that aspect of the bargain from being fulfilled, a creditor should not be prejudiced by a debtor\u2019s continued use of collateral during the proceeding. That bargain must be protected by compensating for a decline in the value of the collateral through its use during the pendency of the stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1476-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1398\">*1398</page-number>Meanwhile, the Senate was- considering companion legislation, in which the language of proposed \u00a7\u00a7 361 and 362(d) differed somewhat. Section 362(d) in the Senate proposal stated in part, as did the House version, that a party could obtain relief from the automatic stay \u201cfor cause, including the lack of adequate protection of an interest in property of such party in interest.\u201d The version of \u00a7 361 contained in the Senate proposal, S.2266, differed substantially from that in the House version, H.R. 8200, in that it did not incorporate the third and fourth subsections in the House\u2019s \u00a7 361; it specified only two ways of providing adequate protection. First, the Senate Committee report explained that \u00a7 361(1) would authorize periodic cash payments to compensate for depreciation, in accordance with the principles set forth in <em>In re Bermec. </em>Second, under \u00a7 361(2) the secured creditor might be protected against a \u201cdecline during the case\u201d by \u201can additional or replacement lien on other property of the debtor to the extent of the decrease in value or actual consumption of the property involved.\u201d <em>Senate Report, supra, </em>at 54, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1978, p. 5840. The Senate Report stated that \u00a7 361 would be \u201cconsistent with the view expressed in <em>Wright v. Union Central Life Ins. Co., </em>311 U.S. 273, 61 S.Ct. 196, 85 L.Ed. 184 (1940), where the Court suggested that it was the value of the secured creditor\u2019s collateral, and not necessarily his rights in specific collateral, that was entitled to protection.\u201d <em>Senate Report, supra, </em>at 54, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1978, p. 5840. The Senate proposal contained no catch-all provision. Accordingly, it seems clear that the Senate version of \u00a7 361 would have protected only against a decline in value.</p>\n<p id=\"b1476-5\">The Senate\u2019s version of \u00a7 361 openly favored secured creditors in one regard: the panel rejected \u201cthe granting of an administrative priority as a method of providing adequate protection to an entity as was suggested in <em>In re Yale Express\u201d </em>and the House\u2019s \u00a7 361(3) \u201cbecause such protection is too uncertain to be meaningful.\u201d <em>Senate Report </em>at 54, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 1978, p. 5840.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The secured creditor was faced with too large a risk in the event of a decline in value of its collateral because the estate might be insufficient to pay all its administrative expenses. Further, the Senate\u2019s proposed \u00a7 362(d) favored secured creditors by placing a thirty-day limit for court action on motions for relief from the stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1476-6\">The Senate passed its bill as a substitute to the House\u2019s version on September 7, 1978. Because of the substantial differences in the House and Senate proposals, largely concerning the status of the bankruptcy courts, the leaders and staff members of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees \u201cmet, negotiated and agreed on many changes\u201d in an effort to reconcile the two versions. 4 W. Norton, <em>Bankruptcy Law and Practice </em>ix n. 1 (1985). No conference committee was appointed. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>32</em></footnotemark><em> </em>There is no formal or informal summary or transcript of these meetings in the published legislative history of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b1476-7\">On September 28, 1978, the House took up the negotiated compromise that would become the new Code. Rep. Edwards\u2019 explanation of the agreed-upon changes on the floor of the House, \u201cas a consensus of these committee leaders, carrpes] a weight in the legislative history equal to a conference report.\u201d <em>Id.; see also </em>124 Cong.Rec. 32,391 (1978) (remarks of Rep. Rousselot) (statement by Rep. Edwards has \u201cthe ef-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1399\">*1399</page-number>feet of being a conference report\u201d).<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The committee leaders agreed to amend proposed \u00a7 362(d) to its current language, and also substantially altered \u00a7 361. The compromise version of \u00a7 361 deleted the House\u2019s method of providing adequate protection of a decline in value with an administrative priority. Further, the compromise inserted the words \u201cindubitable equivalent\u201d for the word \u201cvalue,\u201d which had appeared in \u00a7 361(4) of the House version of H.R. 8200: relief other than periodic cash payments or a replacement lien, but not an administrative priority, might be granted to \u201cresult in the realization by [a secured creditor] of the indubitable equivalent of such entity\u2019s interest in such property.\u201d Rep. Edwards explained the compromise on the floor of the House immediately before the vote on it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1477-5\">Section 361 of the House amendment represents a compromise between H.R. 8200 as passed by the House and the Senate amendment regarding the issue of \u201cadequate protection\u201d of a secured party. The House amendment deletes the provision found in section 361(3) of H.R. 8200 as passed by the House. It would have permitted adequate protection to be provided by giving the secured party an administrative expense regarding any decrease in the value of such party\u2019s collateral. In every case there is the uncertainty that the estate will have sufficient property to pay administrative expenses in full.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1477-6\">Section 361(4) of H.R. 8200 as passed by the House is modified in section 361(3) of the House amendment to indicate that <em>the court may grant other forms of adequate protection, </em>other than an administrative expense, which will result in the realization by the secured creditor of the indubitable equivalent of the creditor\u2019s interest in property____ <em>Adequate protection of an interest of an entity in property is intended to protect a creditor\u2019s allowed secured claim. </em>To the extent the protection proves to be inadequate after the fact, the creditor is entitled to a first priority administrative expense under section 507(b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1477-10\">In the special case of a creditor making an election under section 1111(b)(2), that creditor <em>is entitled to adequate protection of the creditor\u2019s interest in property to the extent of the value of the collateral </em>not to the extent of the creditor\u2019s allowed secured claim, which is inflated to cover a deficiency as a result of such election.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1477-11\">124 Cong.Rec. 32,395 (1978) (emphasis added). Sen. DeConcini made an identical explanation of the bill before the Senate vote. Further, Rep. Butler, who was actively involved in drafting the bill and in negotiating the compromise between the House and Senate versions, stated on the floor of the House just before the vote on the compromise version that under the bill \u201c[cjreditors are provided adequate protection of their interest during the course of a case and limitations are placed on the use of collateral.\u201d 124 Cong.Rec. 32,418 (1978). Rep. Butler explained when adequate protection would be required under the version of \u00a7 361 actually enacted: <em>\u201cIf a creditor is concerned that property is being misused or depreciating, </em>the creditor can demand adequate protection or relief from the automatic stay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 32,419 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1477-12\">These are the clearest and most probative expressions of congressional intent concerning \u00a7\u00a7 361-362(d). The clear implication of Rep. Butler\u2019s statement is that if property is not being misused or depreciating, then a secured creditor is not entitled to adequate protection payments. As for Rep. Edwards\u2019 explanation, if we recall what constitutes an \u201callowed secured claim,\u201d we define the \u201cinterest in property\u201d that \u00a7\u00a7 361-362 are designed to protect. First, an allowed claim may <em>not </em>include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1400\">*1400</page-number>\u201cunmatured interest,\u201d \u00a7 502(b)(2). <em>See </em>Fortgang &amp; King, <em>The 1978 Bankruptcy Code: Some Wrong Policy Decisions, </em>56 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 1148, 1150 (1981) (\u201cPostpetition interest under the Code, as distinguished from the Bankruptcy Act, explicitly is made a <em>nonallowable </em>part of a creditor\u2019s claim.\u201d).<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Second, a \u201cclaim is an allowed secured claim to the extent of the value of the collateral____\u201d Klee, <em>All You Ever Wanted to Know About Cram Down Under the New Bankruptcy Code, </em>53 Am. Bankr.LJ. 133,152 (1979) [hereinafter cited as <em>Cram Down </em>]. Therefore, the remarks of Rep. Edwards strongly suggest that what was intended to be adequately protected by \u00a7 361 is the creditor\u2019s allowed secured claim \u2014 the value of its collateral.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> It seems unlikely that \u00a7 361(3) was intended to require periodic postpetition interest payments when the very interest to be protected \u2014 the allowed secured claim \u2014 cannot itself include postpetition interest.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1478-6\">The evolution of \u00a7\u00a7 361-362 during the legislative process lends further support to this conclusion. The House-Senate meetings produced two compromises in \u00a7 361. The House proposal that \u00a7 361 include the provision regarding an administrative expense priority to compensate for a decline in the value of the collateral, as had been done in <em>In re Yale Express, </em>was deleted by the Senate, and the House-Senate conferees agreed on the deletion because of \u201cthe uncertainty that the estate will have sufficient property to pay administrative expenses in full.\u201d 124 Cong.Rec. 32,395 (1978) (remarks of Rep. Edwards). Further, the conferees agreed to include a general catch-all provision in the compromise version, as had been set forth in the final House version of the bill but not in the Senate version. However, they modified its language to state that the \u201cindubitable equivalent\u201d of the creditor\u2019s interest in the collateral must be protected, rather than the \u201cvalue\u201d of the interest as the House had recommended. Rep. Edwards did not explain the modification of the House bill to include \u201cindubitable equivalent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1478-13\">We are properly reluctant to place significant weight on the unexplained action of the conferees when they added the \u201cindubitable equivalent\u201d language, particularly when the mute change would alter settled law.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> However, it seems likely that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1401\">*1401</page-number>following may have happened: the Senate refused to accept the House\u2019s codification of <em>In re Yale Express, </em>because that would have subjected creditors to too great a risk that they would not be protected against a diminution in value.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> The House, on the other hand, prevailed as to the \u201ccatch-all\u201d provision; the Senate version would have allowed <em>only </em>periodic cash payments or a replacement lien to compensate for depreciation, while the House version recognized \u201cother relief,\u201d such as a guarantee by a third person or a bond. The Senate may have been reluctant to subject creditors to the vagaries of that subsection, so the conferees added the \u201cindubitable equivalent\u201d language to ensure that, if a court did not order less risky periodic payments or a replacement lien to compensate for a decline in the value of the collateral occasioned by the use, sale, or lease of the collateral by the debtor during the stay, the \u201cother relief\u201d unquestionably, or indubitably, would provide the creditor with the equivalent of the value of the property lost. Although, as we have discussed, the indubitable equivalent language was taken from <em>Murel Holding, </em>a cram-down case, no aspect of the legislative history indicates that the Senate\u2019s clearly expressed view as to the interest to be protected, namely the amount of the creditor\u2019s secured claim, was to be affected by the inclusion of the \u201cindubitable equivalent\u201d phrase in the compromise version. The legislative history is devoid of any indication that Congress meant to import wholesale the standards for adequate protection of secured creditors in a cram-down into the adequate protection provisions applicable during the stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1479-6\">The provisions underwent substantial revision in the legislative process, but the fundamental concept of the draft legislation that only depreciation of collateral must be protected against was not explicitly criticized or rejected at any point in the proceedings.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Further, at no point in the proceedings did Congress evince a decision to alter the settled rules regarding adequate protection and postpetition interest which the Commission attempted to codify. It seems likely that \u00a7 361 is merely \u201ca codification of the case law that [had] developed under the [pre-Code] automatic stay rules,\u201d Kennedy, <em>Automatic Stay II, supra, </em>at 43 n. 177, except the rule of <em>In re Yale </em>Express.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Those rules did not permit periodic postpetition interest payments to ah undersecured creditor. If Congress had intended to change those rules, the intention would have been clearly expressed, not left to be inferred from isolated phrases in the legislative history. <em>Midlantic National Bank, </em>106 S.Ct. at 760.</p>\n<p id=\"b1479-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1479-8\">We turn now to other provisions of the Code that bear indirectly on the question, including some \u201cprovisions\u201d that the courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1402\">*1402</page-number>have been forced to improvise, and to basic policies and procedures underlying the Code that will be directly affected by our resolution of the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1480-4\">A. The Cram-down Provisions \u2014 \u00a7 1129.</p>\n<p id=\"ajy-dedup-2\">We have seen that Judge Learned Hand in <em>In re Murel Holding Co., </em>75 F.2d 941 (2d Cir.1935), held in the context of a proposed confirmation of a plan of reorganization, proposed by a debtor over the dissent of a secured creditor (one form of cram-down), that the dissenting secured creditor was entitled to the present value of its secured 'claim in cash or \u201ca substitute of the most indubitable equivalence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 942. Judge Hand noted that the usual way the equivalent of a claim is provided in a plan of reorganization that contemplates a deferred payout of the claim is by paying a creditor interest on the amount of its claim. In 1978, Congress did codify the holding of <em>Murel, </em>as distinguished from its rhetoric, in the cram-down provisions of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b1480-5\">In \u00a7 1129(b)(2)(A)(i), Congress clearly set forth the requirement of <em>Murel </em>that a secured creditor receive over time the <em>present value </em>of its allowed secured claim in order for a proposed plan of reorganization to gain court approval:<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AV4\">(2) For the purpose of this subsection, the condition that a plan be fair and equitable with respect to a class includes the following requirements:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1480-6\">[ (A)(i) ] (II) That each holder of a claim of such class receive on account of such claim deferred cash payments totaling at least the allowed amount of such claim, of a value, as of the effective date of the plan, of at least the value of such holder\u2019s interest in the estate\u2019s interest in such property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"al6-dedup-0\">When the right of a creditor to payment of its allowed secured claim is delayed in the cram-down situation, Congress expressly ordered compensation for delay, in accord-anee with the holding in <em>Murel; </em>it failed to use similar language in \u00a7 362(d)(1) or in \u00a7 361. This supports a conclusion that Congress knew what it was doing when it expressly ordered that secured creditors receive interest payments for the deferral of their repayments in the cram-down situation, but failed to include language to the same effect in the automatic stay provisions. \u201c \u2018Where Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Wong Kim Bo, </em>472 F.2d 720, 722 (5th Cir. 1972), <em>quoted with approval in Russello v. United States, </em>464 U.S. 16, 23, 104 S.Ct. 296, 301, 78 L.Ed.2d 17 (1983). The cram-down provisions, therefore, strongly suggest that subsection (3) of \u00a7 361 was not intended to authorize present value payments to undersecured creditors to compensate for delay during the pendency of the reorganization proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1480-9\">B. The Missing Provisions \u2014 Necessity and Invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1480-10\">Those courts that have adopted the <em>American Mariner </em>approach and required postpetition interest payments to an un-dersecured creditor on the value of its collateral have been faced with numerous questions for which the Code provides no guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1480-11\">Because the only support in the statute for the payment of interest, the phrase \u201cindubitable equivalent,\u201d does not even use the word \u201cinterest,\u201d and because, some courts are understandably reluctant to speak in terms of interest in light of \u00a7\u00a7 502, 506, which clearly preclude an un-dersecured creditor from receiving postpet-ition interest as part of its claim, many courts have latched onto the concept of compensating for \u201clost opportunity\u201d through the adequate protection provisions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1403\">*1403</page-number><em>See supra </em>note 1. Lost opportunity costs are said to be those amounts that an un-dersecured creditor would have earned if it had been permitted to foreclose on its collateral upon default, sell the collateral, and re-invest the proceeds, which the stay prevents. A formula for adequate protection is thus created, using at its base a hypothetical foreclosure and sale of actual collateral, and a hypothetical re-investment of the proceeds. The problem that courts have struggled with is that the Code provides no instructions on how to fill in the blanks in the formula, namely (1) whether to compensate for lost opportunity costs from the date of the petition, the date of the motion for relief from the stay, or the date of a ruling on the motion; (2) whether to take into account the practicalities of delay in the state foreclosure process and delay in selling the property in order to realize something more favorable than a forced-sale price, during which a creditor would not be able to invest proceeds from its collateral; (3) whether to apply to the hypothetically re-invested proceeds of sale the contract rate of interest, or the current market rate, and, in that case, the long-term or short-term market rate; and (4) whether to apply \u201clost opportunity cost\u201d payments that are actually made to the principal amount of the debt. Necessity being the mother of invention, courts have invented answers. Not surprisingly, the answers have varied markedly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1481-5\">The bankruptcy court in the instant case ordered that postpetition interest payments begin six months after the petition was filed, because the court found that there would be a six-month delay in realizing proceeds from a foreclosure and orderly sale of the property. 49 B.R. at 458. <em>See also American Mariner, </em>734 F.2d at 435 n. 12 (\u201cthe timing of adequate protection should take account of the usual time and expense involved in repossession and sale of collateral\u201d). But in <em>Grundy National Bank, </em>754 F.2d at 1441, the Fourth Circuit held that \u201cinterest should not begin\u201d until the filing of a motion for relief from the stay, rather than the date that the petition was filed, and \u201c[e]ven then the timing of interest should be postponed to take account of the time that would be subsumed in repossession and sale of the collateral.\u201d <footnotemark>42</footnotemark> The Code is silent on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1481-8\">The bankruptcy court in this case did not advert to the fact that the bankruptcy petition was filed on the eve of foreclosure, so that a portion of the six-month period had already elapsed. The court did acknowledge, and indeed recognized as a flaw, the fact that if the stay lifts at the end of the six-month period, the creditor will have to endure for a second time the six-month delay incident to foreclosure and sale, and is thus not actually compensated for lost opportunity. 49 B.R. at 458 n. 9. In effect, under this rule, the length of time that a debtor would have before adequate protection interest payments would commence would depend in part on foreclosure procedures in the forum state and in part on how long it would take the creditor to market the property in an orderly (non-forced sale) way, if the evidence establishes that the creditor would in fact market the collateral in that way. Nevertheless, the court determined that the rule, although \u201cflawed,\u201d is \u201creasonable,\u201d because, in part, delay would further \u201cthe Congressional objective to promote reorganization.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In so doing, the court made explicit what has perhaps been implicit in the decisions of numerous other courts engaged in determining when adequate protection interest payments should commence: the reorganization process will be aborted in a fashion inconsistent with the congressional objective of Chapter 11 to promote reorganization, if adequate protection interest payments commence immediately after the imposition of the stay, which is when opportunity costs begin to be incurred. These courts, in effect, compromise what are perceived to be conflicting requirements of the Code. By qualifying the creditor\u2019s right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1404\">*1404</page-number>postpetition interest in various fashions, they are able to further the congressional goal of promoting reorganization. But there is something anomalous about applying in a free-floating manner, with markedly varying results, a rule that depends for its very existence on the rule in <em>Murel Holding, </em>which itself is absolutely rigid in its application, regardless of the consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b1482-4\">Courts have also struggled to set an appropriate rate of interest for the hypothetically re-invested proceeds. <em>American Mariner </em>fixed the rate at the lower of the \u201cmarket rate\u201d and the contract rate. 734 F.2d at 435 n. 12. Although perhaps fairer, this qualification makes little logical sense if \u00a7 361 was intended to fully protect a creditor\u2019s \u201copportunity costs\u201d; the rate should always be the market rate, which will rarely be the same as the contract rate, because the hypothetically foreclosing creditor could rarely re-invest the proceeds at the contract rate. The court in <em>In re Victory Construction Co., </em>9 B.R. 570, 574 (Bankr.C.D.Cal.1981), \u201cfound\u201d a rate of 18% to be appropriate without discussion, in a case where the contract rate was 8%. The bankruptcy court in the instant case determined 12% was \u201cthe applicable rate ... at the time that the creditor could expect to receive the foreclosure proceeds for reinvestment,\u201d six months after the petition was filed, and \u201cassume[d] stable interest rates\u201d absent contrary evidence. 49 B.R. at 458. There seems to be little discussion of whether the rates awarded are for long- or short-term investments. Presumably the bankruptcy court would be obligated to take evidence on the normal investment practices of the creditor seeking relief, as well as the likelihood that interest rates might change if that creditor normally placed its funds in short-term investments, despite the summary nature of automatic stay litigation and the need for speed. Again, the Code offers no advice on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1482-8\">Another difficult question is how to treat \u201copportunity cost payments\u201d in the event of a successful reorganization. Courts addressing the issue seem to be uncertain about what to do with <em>\u201cAmerican Mariner </em>interest.\u201d <em>See generally </em>Fortgang &amp; Mayer, <em>Valuation in Bankruptcy, </em>32 U.C.L.A. L.Rev. 1061, 1088-90 (1985). The court in <em>In re Alexander, </em>48 B.R. 110 (Bankr.W.D. Mo.1985), stated that <em>\u201cAmerican Mariner </em>interest\u201d is \u201cwholly separate\u201d from contract interest and speculated that it \u201cmay or may not go to reduce the other forms of interest which are meantime building.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 119 n. 18.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1482-9\">Finally, courts awarding \u201copportunity cost payments\u201d will ultimately be forced to invent a refund procedure if a debtor is able to \u201ccure\u201d past defaults under \u00a7 1124(2). <em>See </em>Fortgang &amp; Mayer, <em>supra, </em>32 U.C.L.A.L.Rev. at 1089-90. That section allows a debtor upon proposal of a plan to cure defaults and reinstate the original terms of the loan, including the interest rate. In that event, the creditor is \u201cunimpaired\u201d and may not vote on the plan. If postpetition interest payments were ordered at a market rate higher than the contract rate, then a debtor who subsequently is able to \u201cunimpair\u201d the creditor under \u00a7 1124(2) presumably would be entitled to a refund of excess interest paid when the terms of the original loan are reinstated. No refund provision appears in the Code. \u201cAside from the administrative inconvenience of such a course, the need to invent a procedure is proof that Congress never contemplated opportunity cost as adequate protection in light of \u00a7 1124(2).\u201d <em>In re South Village, Inc., 25 </em>B.R. at 998; <em>see In re Manville Forest Products Corp., </em>43 B.R. 293, 301-02 &amp; n. 7 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y. 1984) (\u00a7 1124(2) cannot be reconciled with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1405\">*1405</page-number>postpetition interest payments in the guise of adequate protection payments).<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1483-5\">In <em>In re Victory Construction Co., </em>42 B.R. 145, 155-56 (Bankr.C.D.Cal.1984), the court directly faced the issue of how to treat <em>American Mariner </em>payments when a debtor cured past defaults under \u00a7 1124(2) and a plan was confirmed. The debtor had been making interim \u201cadequate protection payments\u201d at the market rate of 18% of the value of the collateral in return for the stay. The contract rate was 8%. The court recognized that \u201cone\u2019s first thought\u201d would be to give to the debtor, and thereby other creditors, \u201cthe benefit of any excess over the contract rate\u201d if a debtor is able to reinstate the original note. The court, however, had a second thought:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1483-6\">But I do not think that any principle compels this result. From the start, the payment was something other than compensation under the contract. Judge Or-din in <em>Victory II </em>expressly recognized that he was ordering a (supposed) market, rather than the contract, rate. The debtor has paid it on that basis \u2014 and with the recognition that he might never recover any of it at all. [The] debtor may have credit against his adequate protection payments for interest at the contract rate on his ongoing contract obligation, <em>but ... the creditor may retain the balance.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1483-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 156 (emphasis added). In other words, the creditor received a temporary revision of its loan agreement to provide the higher market interest rate, simply because the debtor was in a reorganization proceeding. When the debtor cured past defaults and reinstated the original note, the creditor received precisely what it had bargained for. The \u201cbalance\u201d that the court referred to clearly came from unencumbered assets that could have paid other creditors part of their principal. Although it is said that the purpose of the bankruptcy laws is not to rewrite deals for creditors to improve their investments, the <em>Victory Construction </em>ruling certainly had that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1483-10\">C. Provisions Facilitating Speedy Proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1483-11\">The driving force behind the <em>American Mariner </em>line of cases is clearly the delay of the reorganization process, a delay necessitated by federal law which in effect imposes a monetary loss on all creditors. <em>See Nicholas, </em>384 U.S. at 683, 86 S.Ct. at 1679. Although postpetition interest is not mandated by the Fifth Amendment, <em>see Wright v. Union Central Life Insurance Co., </em>311 U.S. 273, 278, 61 S.Ct. 196, 199, 85 L.Ed. 184 (1940); <em>Briggs, </em>780 F.2d at 1342; <em>American Mariner, </em>734 F.2d at 434 n. 8 (\u201cno such protection is constitutionally required\u201d), courts that award postpetition interest to undersecured creditors seem to be motivated by considerations of fairness: those creditors should not be placed in the deep freeze for an unreasonable period without some compensation for the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1483-12\">Indeed, as noted above, delay was an overriding concern of Congress in recodify-ing the adequate protection and reorganization provisions in 1978. Witness after witness complained that the cumbersome procedures under the Act and inattention by the courts to motions for relief from the stay led to delay that did not serve the purposes of the bankruptcy laws. Congress responded to the complaints with numerous provisions of the Code that were designed to encourage a more rapid resolution of reorganization proceedings. Various sections \u2014 including \u00a7\u00a7 305(a) (permitting dismissal or suspension of proceedings if interests of creditors and debtor would be served, such as when a reorganization or arrangement has been or is being effected in another forum), 1102(b)(1) (permitting continuation of prepetition creditors\u2019 committees), and 1126(b) (streamlining procedures for acceptance of plan, particularly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1406\">*1406</page-number>prepetition solicitation of plan approval)\u2014 encourage speedy out-of-court workouts. Further, the debtor\u2019s exclusive right to file a plan is limited to 120 days, \u00a7 1121(b), unless extended \u201cfor cause,\u201d <em>see House Report, supra, </em>at 223, 231, and even the 120-day period may be reduced by the court \u201cfor cause,\u201d \u00a7 1121(d). Thereafter, a creditor may file a plan, \u00a7 1121(c). A creditor may move to dismiss the petition or convert the proceeding to a Chapter 7 liquidation if the debtor is dilatory, \u00a7 1112; <em>In re Shri-ver, </em>33 B.R. at 188, or may move for appointment of a trustee, \u00a7 1104(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1484-4\">Most important, Congress provided that motions for relief from the stay are entitled to priority: if the court does not act on a motion for relief from the stay within thirty days, the stay automatically lifts.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> The 30-day rule is the \u201cmost direct attack on the problem of delay and dilatoriness in dealing with requests for relief from the stay.\u201d Kennedy, <em>Automatic Stay II, supra, </em>12 U.MichJ.L.Ref. at 40 n. 166. Further, relief from the stay is now sought by means of a motion, rather than by the commencement of an adversary proceeding in which complicated counterclaims and offsets were often raised, requiring time consuming procedures to adjudicate. The legislative history of \u00a7 362(e) makes clear that the brief time periods allowed in \u00a7 362 litigation and the use of a motions procedure were designed to streamline and speed up the process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1484-5\">At the expedited hearing under subsection (e), and at all hearings on relief from the stay, the only issue will be the claim of the creditor and the lack of adequate protection or existence of other cause for relief from the stay. This hearing will not be the appropriate time at which to bring in other issues, such as counterclaims against the creditor on largely unrelated matters. Those counterclaims are not to be handled in the summary fashion that the preliminary hearing under this provision will be. Rather, they will be the subject of more complete proceedings by the trustees to recover property of the estate or to object to the allowance of a claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1484-9\"><em>House Report, supra, </em>at 344, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1978, p. 6300. <em>See also 2 Collier on Bankruptcy </em>11362.08[3], at 362-63 (15th ed. 1985). Finally, \u00a7 362(d) motions require only limited notice to creditors.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1484-10\">One conclusion from the legislative history is unassailable: Congress responded in 1978 to creditors\u2019 complaints about delay. It expressly did so by streamlining the stay relief litigation procedure, by building into the Code assurance that requests for relief from the stay will be considered in a timely manner and by providing all creditors with numerous means of limiting the delay of the reorganization process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1484-11\">If the <em>American Mariner </em>position is accepted and undersecured creditors are entitled to periodic postpetition interest payments, perhaps at a rate higher than the contract rate and which (according to some courts) need not be credited against principal, the end result may, in fact, be delay\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1407\">*1407</page-number>contrary to Congress\u2019 clearly expressed intent to speed up reorganization proceedings. There would be little economic incentive for the undersecured creditor, particularly one whose prospects for a significant distribution on the unsecured portion of its claim are not bright, to cooperate in developing a negotiated plan. In many cases, delay would have little adverse effect on the creditor, and, in fact, the creditor might be rewarded for delay if the court allowed it to retain without adjustment the amount of the <em>American Mariner </em>payments above interest due under the contract. That very delay, however, will almost certainly adversely affect the unsecured creditors, as it is often the unencumbered assets, otherwise available for distribution to unsecured creditors, that are funding the interest payments to the undersecured creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1485-4\">A bankruptcy court, faced with a difficult and unpleasant decision whether, in effect, to terminate a reorganization case with bleak prospects for success, might well prefer to let the case continue and to assuage the undersecured creditor by ordering the payment of postpetition interest. But that very decision is a decision <em>for delay </em>and for increased expense, both in the form of interest and in the form of administrative expense, expense that in most cases will be funded by the unsecured creditors. A decision for delay \u2014 without a meaningful possibility that the delay will ultimately benefit creditors \u2014 is <em>not </em>the decision that Congress has made, and the obligation of the courts is to honor and effectuate the decisions that Congress has made to limit delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1485-8\">D. Interest Provisions \u2014 Procedure in \u00a7 506(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1485-9\">Awarding periodic postpetition interest payments to an undersecured creditor also seems inconsistent with the procedural mechanisms of \u00a7\u00a7 506(b) and 506(c). Under \u00a7 506(c), the debtor may recover from property securing a creditor\u2019s allowed secured claim the reasonable and necessary costs and expenses of preserving or disposing of the property, to the extent of any benefit to the creditor. If, after reducing the amount of the allowed secured claim by the amount of that recovery, the creditor is oversecured, it is entitled to interest at the contract rate on its net allowed secured claim. \u00a7 506(b). The timing of the payment of accrued interest to an oversecured creditor (at the conclusion of the proceeding) is doubtless based on the fact that it is not possible to compute the amount of \u00a7 506(c) recovery (and, accordingly, the amount of the net allowed secured claim on which interest is computed) until the termination of the proceeding.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Consider by contrast the happier lot of the underse-cured creditor under the <em>American Mariner </em>interpretation of \u00a7 361. Such a creditor is entitled to periodic interest payments on the value of its collateral, theoretically at the market rate (which may exceed the contract rate), without deduction for the \u00a7 506(c) recovery that cannot be computed until the termination of the proceeding. For example, in the case of collateral with a relatively short useful life and high costs of preserving the property, an underse-cured creditor may be considerably better off receiving postpetition interest payments at the market rate on the value of the collateral (even if valued on a liquidation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1408\">*1408</page-number>basis), than an oversecured creditor which is able to collect interest at the contract rate at the conclusion of the proceeding on what may by that time be a substantially reduced net allowed secured claim. Such a result, certainly conceivable under <em>American Mariner, </em>seems unusual.</p>\n<p id=\"b1486-4\">E. Compatibility of Periodic Postpetition Interest Payments with Policies of Bankruptcy Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b1486-5\">Probably the most troubling aspects of a construction of \u00a7 361 that would require or allow periodic postpetition interest payments to undersecured creditors are: first, its impact on the orderly procedures for the distribution of the debtor\u2019s estate either upon liquidation or reorganization; second, the resulting reallocation of the unencumbered assets of the debtor\u2019s estate that frequently occurs shortly after the petition is filed; and third, the resulting reallocation of the risk of failure of the reorganization proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1486-6\">To understand all three aspects, it is useful to understand a typical secured financing arrangement. As was noted by Murphy in the law review article included in the record of the House hearings, <em>see supra </em>note 28, in many secured financing arrangements the scheduled principal payments approximate the depreciation of the collateral. Clearly, \u00a7 361(1) and (2) call for adequate protection payments to cover the decline in value caused by depreciation of the collateral. If \u00a7 361(3) is construed to further require postpetition interest payments on the value of the collateral, the total adequate protection payments will in many, perhaps most, cases approximate the principal and interest payments required by the existing terms of the secured debt instruments, because it will only be the interest on the unsecured portion of the secured debt that ceases to accrue. As Murphy pointed out, if the debtor could have made the principal and interest payments on its secured debt, it is unlikely that any proceeding would have been filed in the first place. In many Chapter 11 cases, including this one, the likely result of orders requiring periodic postpetition interest payments to undersecured creditors will be the immediate conversion to Chapter 7 \u2014 a result which seems inconsistent with the congressional policy favoring attempts at reorganization.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1486-10\">Further, since an undersecured creditor will have no claim for postpetition interest at the conclusion of the proceeding, it will be necessary for each such creditor to file a motion for adequate protection under \u00a7 362 immediately after the petition is filed or it will lose interest until it does file. As a practical matter, this means that all potentially undersecured creditors in a reorganization proceeding will file \u00a7 362 motions shortly after the petition is filed,<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1409\">*1409</page-number>debtor will be immediately faced with demands for adequate protection payments by its secured creditors which will often approximate the total principal and interest payments on secured debt which it was required to make before the petition was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1487-5\">Against this factual background, we consider the objectives of the automatic stay. As was eloquently stated in the House Report on \u00a7 362:</p>\n<p id=\"b1487-6\">The automatic stay is one of the fundamental debtor protections provided by the bankruptcy laws. It gives the debtor a breathing spell from his creditors. It stops all collection efforts, all harassment, and all foreclosure actions. It permits the debtor to attempt a repayment or reorganization plan, or simply to be relieved of the financial pressures that drove him into bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1487-7\">The automatic stay also provides creditor protection. Without it, certain creditors would be able to pursue their own remedies against the debtor\u2019s property. Those who acted first would obtain payment of the claim in preference to and to the detriment of other creditors. Bankruptcy is designed to provide an orderly liquidation procedure under which all creditors are treated equally. A race of diligence by creditors for the debtor\u2019s assets prevents that.</p>\n<p id=\"b1487-8\"><em>House Report, supra, </em>at 340, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1978, p. 6296. The scramble for the debtor\u2019s unencumbered assets by its undersecured creditors, which the <em>American Mariner </em>case has precipitated, bears little resemblance to the breathing spell devoid of a \u201crace of diligence\u201d described in the House Report.</p>\n<p id=\"b1487-9\">The key to achieving a fair and equitable distribution of the debtor\u2019s assets contemplated by the House Report and by the Code, whether upon liquidation or reorganization, is complete information about the debtor\u2019s assets, liabilities, past business and prospects. The debtor is required to file comprehensive schedules of creditors, assets and liabilities, current income and expenditures, and a statement of financial affairs, \u00a7 521(1), either with the petition or within 15 days thereafter, unless the time is extended for cause shown, Bankruptcy Rule 1007(c). In the usual case, a meeting of the debtor and its creditors must be held not less than 20 nor more than 40 days after the petition is filed, at which the debtor is examined under oath. Rule 2003. A committee of unsecured creditors is required to be appointed, and one or more committees of other creditors may be appointed to secure adequate representation of various creditor groups. \u00a7 1102(a). These committees participate in the investigation of the affairs of the debtor and in the formulation of a plan of reorganization. The purpose of the extensive information gathering that goes forward while the stay is pending is to put the debtor, its creditors and the court in a position to assess whether a plan of reorganization is feasible or desirable or whether the debtor must be liquidated. If the debtor or a creditor elects to go forward with a plan of reorganization, the Code provides a \u201ccarefully crafted scheme for creditor enfranchisement,\u201d <em>In re Braniff Airways, Inc., </em>700 F.2d 935, 940 (5th Cir.1983), including \u00a7 1125 disclosure requirements, \u00a7 1126 voting requirements, and \u00a7 1129(a)(7), the best interests of creditors test. <em>Cf. In re Continental Air Lines, Inc., </em>780 F.2d 1223, 1226 (5th Cir.1986). Further, under \u00a7 1129(b)(2)(B), the absolute priority rule must be met in order for a plan of reorganization to be \u201cfair and equitable,\u201d a prerequisite to plan approval absent consent. That rule provides that claims and interests must participate in the plan \u201cin complete recognition of their strict priorities, and unless the value of the debtor\u2019s assets sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1410\">*1410</page-number>ports the extent of the participation afforded each class of claims or interests included in the plan,\u201d the plan cannot be fair and equitable. 6A <em>Collier on Bankruptcy </em>II 11.06, at 210 (14th ed. 1977). <em>See Consolidated Rock Products Co. v. Du Bois, </em>312 U.S. 510, 527, 61 S.Ct. 675, 685, 85 L.Ed. 982 (1941); <em>see also House Report, supra, </em>at 415 (\u201c[n]o class may be paid more than in full\u201d). It seems obvious that the relative positions of creditors may be considered by the court, and the rule applied, only after the identity of each creditor, the amount owed and the extent to which the claim is secured or entitled to priority are known, not with precision, but at least with sufficient accuracy to assure that any proposed plan is feasible. Then, and only then, may the estate\u2019s unencumbered assets be divided among the various classes of creditors in accordance with their respective priorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1488-4\">The information gathering and creditor enfranchisement processes described above, which are designed to achieve a fair and equitable distribution of the debtor\u2019s assets, stand in sharp contrast to the abbreviated procedures which were established by Congress for the quick resolution of adequate protection motions. The speed, limited scope, and limited notice that are characteristics of a stay relief hearing strongly suggest that Congress did not intend the \u00a7 362 motion to be used as the vehicle for distributing unencumbered assets of the estate to the extent that would be required if adequate protection during the temporary pendency of the stay requires the complete compensation that is necessary for approval of a plan of reorganization contemplating deferred payments. Nor do those characteristics of a stay relief motion suggest that Congress intended that a series of \u00a7 362 motions filed by all the secured creditors in a case be disposi-tive of the outcome of the case with the frequency that is likely to occur if the debtor is compelled to make adequate protection interest payments approximating the total principal and interest payments on its secured debt. In summary, a construction of \u00a7 361(3) that would require interest payments to undersecured creditors seems inconsistent with the policy of the Code to promote an orderly distribution of the debt- or\u2019s estate after a breathing spell designed to foster a careful assessment of the relative priorities of creditors and of the debt- or\u2019s assets and prospects. Surely if Congress had intended to effect such fundamental changes in the way in which the automatic stay functions and in the way that the debtor\u2019s assets are distributed, it would have indicated that decision with clarity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1488-7\">Finally, the leading Supreme Court cases on postpetition interest, such as <em>Vanston, </em>\u201cindicateQ that secured creditors must also share some of the risks of the rehabilitation process.\u201d O\u2019Toole, <em>supra, </em>56 Am. Bankr.L.J. at 259. As things stood before <em>American Mariner\u2019s </em>interpretation of the adequate protection provisions, each creditor \u2014 secured or unsecured \u2014 bore its own cost caused by the delay inherent in a bankruptcy proceeding. Even an overse-cured creditor, which is theoretically entitled to interest, in effect funded that interest out of the value of its collateral. Before <em>American Mariner, </em>therefore, the risk of failure of a reorganization proceeding was borne by all creditors. The effect of the <em>American Mariner </em>construction of the adequate protection provisions is most often to shift the costs associated with the delay in payment of the secured portion of an undersecured creditor\u2019s claim to the unsecured creditors. Interestingly enough, an oversecured creditor continues to fund its own interest, and, of course, unsecured creditors not only fund their own delay costs, but also most often<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> fund those of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1411\">*1411</page-number>undersecured creditors. With that decision to reallocate costs, there is a corresponding decision to reallocate the risk of failure of the reorganization proceedings. Surely if Congress had intended such a major change in the allocation of the risk of failure of reorganization proceedings to unsecured creditors, it would have so indicated with greater clarity in the Code itself or in the legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b1489-9\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1489-10\">As noted above, the Ninth Circuit in <em>American </em>Mariner<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> and the Fourth Circuit in <em>Grundy National </em>Bank<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> hold that the Code mandates postpetition interest payments to an undersecured creditor as a matter of law. Several bankruptcy courts and district courts,<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> as well as a few commentators,<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> agree. The Eighth Circuit<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> has concluded that an undersecured credi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1412\">*1412</page-number>tor may be entitled to postpetition interest payments depending on the facts of the case, such as the \u201cnature of the collateral and the proposed use of the collateral,\u201d but that it is not so entitled as a matter of law.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Finally, numerous bankruptcy and district courts,<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> as well as the majority of commentators,<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> conclude that under no cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1413\">*1413</page-number>cumstances may a Chapter 11 court award postpetition interest to an undersecured creditor in the form of periodic cash payments for adequate protection under \u00a7\u00a7 361-362(d)(l), or otherwise criticize <em>American Mariner\u2019s </em>analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1491-5\">The impact of <em>American Mariner </em>on this area of bankruptcy law is difficult to overstate. The decision has precipitated an avalanche of \u00a7 362(d) motions, <em>see supra </em>note 49, and, in many cases, has shifted the critical, indeed dispositive, point in the reorganization proceedings to a few weeks immediately following the filing of the petition. Because of the importance of <em>American Mariner, </em>we undertake a review of its analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1491-6\">A primary difficulty with the opinion is that it does not allude to the only published portion of the legislative history explaining the versions of \u00a7\u00a7 361-362(d)(l) as enacted, the explanations of Rep. Edwards and Sen. DeConcini that (i) \u00a7 361(3) was intended to permit \u201cother <em>forms </em>of adequate protection\u201d (emphasis added) than those set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 361(1) and (2), and (ii) the adequate protection provisions only protect a creditor\u2019s allowed secured claim, which cannot include postpetition interest for an underse-cured creditor.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> Nor did the court refer to Rep. Butler\u2019s explanation that adequate protection payments or relief from the automatic stay would be appropriate if a creditor is \u201cconcerned that property is being misused or depreciating.\u201d Further, the court did not even cite, let alone reconcile its rule with, the Code\u2019s interest provisions or the leading Supreme Court cases, including <em>Vanston </em>and <em>Sexton. </em>Indeed, although the issue was framed before the Bankruptcy Appeals Panel as whether \u201can under collateralized secured creditor [is] entitled to postpetition interest upon the value of its collateral as a condition of denying relief from the automatic stay,\u201d 27 B.R. at 1005 (quoting brief of Crocker Na<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1414\">*1414</page-number>tional Bank at 2), the Ninth Circuit avoided the point.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1492-4\">We have already discussed the \u201cindubitable equivalent\u201d language in \u00a7 361(3) and when it was inserted into the Code. <em>American Mariner </em>placed significant, almost controlling, weight on inclusion of the phrase,<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> referring at length to the meaning of the phrase as used in <em>Murel Holding. </em>The Ninth Circuit assumed that the phrase had independent content identical to that in <em>Murel </em>and required an award of interest payments during the stay. The court distinguished <em>Mur el\u2019s </em>statement that \u201c[n]o doubt less will be required to hold up the suit for a short time until the debtor shall have a chance to prepare\u201d on the ground that \u201c[t]his qualification, of course, reflects the absence of a statutory requirement for adequate protection during the stay, not to mention the absence of a requirement for an automatic stay,\u201d 734 F.2d at 434. However, although there was no statutory requirement for adequate protection during the stay, the common law already had such a requirement.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> In fact, Congress indicated that \u00a7\u00a7 361-362(d)(l) essentially were intended to codify pre-Code law. Accordingly, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[t]he early cases, decided before enactment of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, are of little relevance in construing sections 361 and 362,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 434, is difficult to square with settled rules of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1492-9\">The Ninth Circuit also placed significant weight on the language in the House Report that creditors should receive the \u201cbenefit of their bargain\u201d despite the imposition of the automatic stay. The court implicitly assumed that the bargain that a creditor and debtor enter into included compensation for the delay in foreclosure necessitated by federal law. But it seems unlikely that a creditor bargains for compensation for delay necessitated solely by the time-consuming reorganization provisions of the Code, since that would require a conscious assumption that its borrower might file a bankruptcy petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1492-10\">Furthermore, the \u201cbargain\u201d which the creditor enters into incorporates the applicable requirements of federal bankruptcy law. <em>Wright v. Union Central Life Insurance Co., </em>304 U.S. 502, 515, 58 S.Ct. 1025, 1032, 82 L.Ed. 1490 (1938) (\u201cThe mortgage contract was made subject to constitutional power in the Congress to legislate on the subject of bankruptcies. Impliedly, this was written into the contract between petitioner and respondent____\u201d). Two aspects of the law, of course, are the automatic stay provision of \u00a7 362(a) and the interest provisions of \u00a7 502(b)(2) and \u00a7 506(b). The stay and the interest provisions themselves substantially alter the bargain of the parties.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> The <em>actual bargain </em>struck, incorporating the interest provisions of the Code and nearly two centuries of its predeces-</p>\n<p id=\"b1493-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1415\">*1415</page-number>Cite as 793 F.2d 1380 (5th Cir. 1986)</p>\n<p id=\"b1493-3\">sors, is that if the creditor is undercollater-alized when the time comes to \u201ccarve up the bird,\u201d the creditor will receive in respect of the secured portion of its debt only its \u201callowed secured claim\u201d; it will not receive interest unmatured at the date of the bankruptcy filing. For this reason, using the \u201cbenefit of the bargain\u201d language to support the payment of postpetition interest ignores what the parties actually understand to be the bargain. It also ignores the standard enforceability opinion by borrowers\u2019 counsel, which qualifies the enforceability of the debt instrument with the \u201cbankruptcy out\u201d: the instrument will be enforceable \u201cexcept as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,</p>\n<p id=\"b1493-4\">reorganization or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally.\u201d Harter &amp; Klee, <em>supra, </em>48 Fordham L.Rev. at 277-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b1493-5\">Further, it appears that the Ninth Circuit may have misinterpreted the compromise between the House and the Senate that led to the insertion of \u201cindubitable equivalent\u201d into the Code.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> The Senate prevailed on the requirement in its version that a creditor not be forced to take a risk that its collateral would decline due to the penden-cy of the stay. There is simply not a hint in the remarks of Rep. Edwards that the compromise version significantly altered the scope of the interests to be protected set forth in each version of the legislation to that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b1494-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1416\">*1416</page-number>Finally, as we have already discussed, <em>American Mariner </em>is marked by logical inconsistencies, most notably those in its footnote 12, in which it attempts to set guidelines for determining the amount of the payments. Although these guidelines and qualifications have the salutary effect of facilitating reorganizations, they make little logical sense if \u00a7 361 in fact protects and undersecured creditor\u2019s \u201copportunity costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1494-4\">To the extent that the Eighth Circuit\u2019s opinion in <em>Briggs </em>follows <em>American Mariner, </em>it suffers <em>from </em>several of the same flaws. However, <em>Briggs </em>is far narrower than <em>American Mariner. Briggs </em>would require postpetition \u201cinterest\u201d payments depending on the facts of the case, including the length of the stay, the \u201cquality of the collateral,\u201d whether the \u201ccollateral\u2019s lien value is demonstrated to be appreciating, depreciating or remaining relatively stable,\u201d and \u201cwhether taxes and other payments designed to keep the collateral free of statutory liens are being paid or will be paid by the debtor.\u201d 780 F.2d at 1349.

Yet that very flexibility is difficult to reconcile with the language \u201cindubitable equivalent\u201d and with the inflexible requirement of complete compensation of <em>Murel </em>and the cram-down provision on which <em>American Mariner </em>is based.

The only reference to the issue anywhere in the record is in two paragraphs of a law review article by Murphy that was included in the record as a general explanation of the automatic stay provisions under the Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1473-11\">Another possible condition for the continuation of the stay, one which the Commission failed to suggest, is to require the debtor to make interim cash payments to the creditor in an amount sufficient to compensate the creditor on a present basis for its anticipated loss. This was the approach adopted in <em>In re Ber-mec Corp., </em>and has been the basis of most of the settlements between secured creditors and trustees, receivers and debtors under the existing Bankruptcy Act. Despite the attraction of the interim cash payments alternative, it is deceptively simple in several respects. To begin with, most secured financing is sufficiently generous that the scheduled payments approximate the depreciation of the collateral. If the debtor could have made the scheduled payments, it is likely that no proceeding under the Bankruptcy Act would have been necessary in the first place. Second, the court must decide whether the size of the payments should be based on liquidation value of the collateral or its fair market value, fair equivalent value or some other standard. Since it is unlikely the valuation will be exact, it would seem preferable to err on the high side. No real harm is done if the payments are in excess of the amount necessary to protect the secured creditor since each payment increases the debtor\u2019s equity in the collateral, which in turn benefits general creditors. Third, <em>if the interim cash payments alternative is used, perhaps the secured creditor should receive interest or compensation for its cost of funds.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1473-14\"><em>This last idea may seem shocking at first because it has been long recognized in bankruptcy that a secured creditor is entitled to the payment of interest only in the event that it holds surplus security above the amount necessary to cover principal. </em>If there is extra security, the rights of the secured creditor are not being jeopardized and interim payments are unnecessary. Nevertheless, the secured creditor in effect receives interest under the present Bankruptcy Act when the debtor in a Chapter XI proceeding just continues to pay his security obligations substantially according to their terms or works out an alternative payment schedule. If the stay of the marginally secured creditor is properly viewed as an involuntary loan of property to the debtor, there seems little reason not to afford the secured creditor some protection against the ravages of inflation and the fact that his own creditors have not given him an interest moratorium.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AM1K\">Murphy, <em>supra, </em>63 Calif.L.Rev. at 1505-06 (emphasis added), <em>reprinted in House Hearings, su</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1396\">*1396</page-number><em>pra, </em>at 1798-99.

Under <em>American Mariner </em>a substantial increase in the number of \u00a7 362 motions would be expected. In fact, statistics on \u00a7 362 motions filed in the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas bear this out. As an initial matter, we note that the District Court Clerk's office does not maintain statistics on the number of \u00a7 362 motions filed in cases under each of Chapters 7, 11 and 13. However, because substantially all those motions are filed in cases under Chapters 11 and 13, the following statistics on the number of \u00a7 362 motions filed during August 1983 through March 1986 treat all such motions as having been filed in cases under Chapters 11 and 13. In the last five months of 1983, 1175 \u00a7 362 motions were filed, as compared with 1273 new Chapter 11 and 13 cases; that is equivalent to a rate of 92 motions for relief from the stay per 100 new cases. In 1984, the year that <em>American Mariner </em>was decided, 4392 motions for relief from the stay were filed, as against 3239 new filings, or a rate of 135 motions per 100 new cases. In 1985, the rate increased further, to 151 motions per 100 new cases (6408 motions, 4234 new cases). In the first three months of 1986, the rate grew to 163 motions for relief from the stay per 100 new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1409\">*1409</page-number>cases (2375 motions, 1457 new cases). Creditors filed an average of 235 motions for relief from the stay per month in the last five months of 1983; they filed an average of 792 such motions per month in the first three months of 1986, an increase of 237%. New Chapter 11 and 13 filings were 90% higher in the first three months of 1986 than in the last five months of 1983.

In the single asset case <em>sub judice, </em>in which the undersecured creditor is secured not only by real estate but also by an assignment of the rents, postpetition interest is to be paid, under the terms of the bankruptcy court's order, not out of unencumbered assets (there are none) but out of the collateral (i.e., rents) securing the debt, although the debtor\u2019s obligation to pay the interest is not limited to the rents.

Many of these cases, of course, arose in the Ninth and Fourth Circuits, where <em>American Mariner </em>and <em>Grundy </em>are binding precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"54\">\n<p id=\"b1489-14\">. The <em>American Mariner </em>rule has attracted little support in scholarly writings. Periodic post-petition interest payments were first proposed by Patrick A. Murphy in 1975. Murphy, <em>supra, </em>63 Calif.L.Rev. at 1506. Professor Thomas Jackson expanded on the proposal in <em>Bankruptcy, Non-Bankruptcy Entitlements, and the Creditor's Bargain, </em>91 Yale L.J. 857, 874-75 &amp; n. 80 (1982). <em>See also </em>Baird &amp; Jackson, <em>Corporate Reorganizations and the Treatment of Diverse Ownership Interests: A Comment on Adequate Protection of Secured Creditors in Bankruptcy, </em>51 U.Chi.L. Rev. 97, 102 (1984); <em>cf. </em>Comment, <em>Good Faith Inquiries Under the Bankruptcy Code: Treating the Symptom, Not the Cause, </em>52 U.Chi.L.Rev. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1412\">*1412</page-number>795, 814-16 (1985). The leading proponent of this view, Professor Jackson, has not attempted in his published writings to reconcile his interpretation of the adequate protection provisions of the Code with the Code\u2019s language and legislative history. <em>See </em>Baird &amp; Jackson, <em>supra, </em>51 U.Chi.L.Rev. at 99. Indeed, in <em>Bankruptcy, Non-Bankruptcy Entitlements, and the Creditor\u2019s Bargain, </em>Professor Jackson recognized that his model suffers from \"inadequate statutory firmness that permits \u2014 perhaps nurtures \u2014 the belief among bankruptcy judges that adequate protection can be granted without reliance on market-pricing mechanisms.\u201d 91 Yale LJ. at 877. Professor Jackson filed an <em>amicus </em>brief in the <em>American Mariner </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1490-5\">One commentator who appears to support <em>American Mariner </em>is Molbert, <em>Adequate Protection for the Undersecured Creditor in a Chapter 11 Reorganization: Compensation for the Delay in Enforcing Foreclosure Rights, </em>60 No.Dak.L. Rev. 515, 529 (1984), who concludes that interest payments must be given for any period beyond 120 days of the date that the petition was filed due to the \u201cequities\u201d of the reorganization process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1490-6\">Essentially the only writer to attempt to harmonize the proposal with the Code and its legislative history was the student author of Comment, <em>Compensation for Time Value, supra, </em>50 U.Chi.L.Rev. at 309-22, who admitted that \u201d[t]he legislative history does not specifically address whether adequate protection must include time value compensation.\" <em>Id. </em>at 311 n. 25. In sum, the view of most commentators is that there is a \u201cpaucity of support [for this approach] within the Code and its legislative history.\u201d Nimmer, <em>supra, </em>68 Minn.L.Rev. at 10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"55\">\n<p id=\"b1490-7\">. <em>In re Briggs Transportation Co., </em>780 F.2d 1339, 1347-49 (8th Cir.1985). Factors that the court suggested be taken into account include the length of the stay, whether the collateral was depreciating, whether taxes were being paid so as to keep the property free of statutory liens, and the likelihood of successful reorganization. <em>Id. </em>at 1349.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"56\">\n<p id=\"b1490-8\">. A handful of lower courts agree with this approach. <em>In re Peach State Distributing Co., </em>58 B.R. 873, 875-76 (Bankr.N.D.Ga.1986) (court is \"more inclined\u201d to award \"opportunity costs\u201d in cases with low likelihood of successful reorganization, but such payments are not required as a matter of law); <em>InreB &amp; W Tractor Co., </em>38 B.R. 613, 618 (Bankr.E.D.N.C.1984); <em>In re First Century Trust Co., </em>12 B.R. 204, 208 (Bankr.W.D. Tenn.1981); <em>General Motors Acceptance Corp. v. Anderson, </em>6 B.R. 601, 610 (Bankr.S.D.Ohio 1980). A detailed commentary in support of this approach is set forth in Nimmer, <em>supra, </em>68 Minn.L.Rev. at 2 (loss of recoverable value is \u201cbaseline consideration\" in adequate protection determination, and further protection may be appropriate depending on \"the nature and history of the loan transaction, the behavior of the parties, and the prospects of or activity toward reorganization\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"57\">\n<p id=\"b1490-11\">. The great majority of lower courts that considered the issue prior to <em>American Mariner, </em>and several after it, held that a secured creditor is entitled only to protection against a decline in the value of its collateral through use, decay or depreciation. The leading cases in favor of this view are those of Judge Mabey in <em>In re South Village, Inc., </em>25 B.R. 987 (Bankr.D.Utah 1982), and <em>In re Alyucan Interstate Corp., </em>12 B.R. 803 (Bankr.D.Utah 1981).

In support of its conclusion that \"Sections 361 and 362 include exceptional provisions specifically intended by Congress to benefit secured creditors at the expense of the debtor,\u201d 734 F.2d at 431, the court referred to a statement by Rep.

Rep. Edwards\u2019 quote, however, was taken out of context. The statement had nothing to do with adequate protection or periodic postpetition interest payments. Rather, it concerned administrative difficulties, most notably \"professional administrators who do not act for the benefit of creditors.\u201d 123 Cong.Rec. 35,446 (1977) (remarks of Rep.

The <em>American Mariner </em>court analyzed the issue as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1493-11\">Although the Senate version of section 361 proposed to protect \"the value of such entity\u2019s interest in such property,\" the section was considerably <em>more restrictive </em>than the House version. S.Rep. No. 989, 95th Cong.2d Sess. 54, 1978 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 5787, 5840. As a gloss on one of the two methods permitted by the Senate version for providing adequate protection, the Senate Report notes that the method was \u201cconsistent with the view expressed in <em>Wright v. Union Central Life Ins. Co., </em>3 IT U.S. 273, 61 S.Ct. 196, 85 L.Ed. 184 (1940), where the Court suggested that it was the value of the secured creditor\u2019s collateral, and not necessarily his rights in specific collateral, that was entitled to protection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Read in the context of the broad scope attributed to the term \"value\u201d in section 361 and the wide range of interests to be protected, we think the citation to <em>Wright </em>cannot be construed to limit adequate protection to the value of the collateral. Nonetheless, no such gloss appears in the House Report on its version of section 361, and its <em>expansive approach </em>to adequate protection was ultimately adopted by Congress. The only reference to <em>Wright </em>in the House Report is the observation that adequate protection under section 361 is not confined to the constitutional protection required in <em>Wright. </em>H.R. Rep. No. 595 at 339, 1978 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News at 6295.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"acq-dedup-0\">734 F.2d at 430 n. 4 (emphasis .added). The court's conclusion that the Senate\u2019s version of \u00a7 361 was \"restrictive\u201d and the House\u2019s version \"expansive\u201d needs some explanation. The Senate version of \u00a7 361 provided creditors with far more protection than the House version of \u00a7 361, because it did not force them to accept uncertain and risky administrative priorities or unspecified \"other relief,\" as did the House bill. Further, under the Senate\u2019s proposed \u00a7 362(d), relief was to be granted within 30 days of the hearing on the motion for relief, and relief was to be granted whenever the court found no equity in the property. Both these aspects of the Senate\u2019s bill were far more \"pro-creditor\u201d than the House bill. The only \"expansive\u201d aspect of the House bill was the language of the report accompanying it, which was not reflected in the text of H.R. 8200 as passed by the House. A cogent analysis of the language of the House report notes that although the \u201cCode does not make any significant new contribution to the concept of adequate protection, but instead borrows the more effective devices developed by the courts under the Bankruptcy Act [, t]he House Committee Report\u2019s attempted restatement of those principles confuses the issues.\u201d Moller &amp; Foltz, <em>supra, </em>58 N.C.L.Rev. at 900.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
