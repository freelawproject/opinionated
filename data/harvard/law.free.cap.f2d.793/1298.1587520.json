The Norris-La-Guardia Act divests the federal courts of jurisdiction to enjoin specified acts \u201cin any case involving or growing out of any labor dispute.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 104 (1982). The secondary picketing at issue in this case falls within the plain terms of the Act, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 104(e), and whether or not the target of this picketing is \u201csubstantially aligned\u201d with the picketing individuals\u2019 employer is irrelevant. <em>Accord Smith\u2019s Management Corp. v. International Bhd. of Elec. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1299\">*1299</page-number><em>Workers, </em>737 F.2d 788 (9th Cir.1984).

Chicago &amp; N.W.R.R., </em>362 U.S. 330, 339 n. 15, 80 S.Ct. 761, 766 n. 15, 4 L.Ed.2d 774 (1960). Moreover, because the union activity here is not subject to the dispute resolution mechanism of the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 <em>et seq. </em>(1982), neither may an injunction issue under the authority of <em>Chicago &amp; N.W.

For the reasons stated herein, we conclude that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-11\">The Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees (\u201cBMWE\u201d) represents certain railroad workers employed by the Maine Central Railroad Company and the Portland Terminal Company. Since March 1986, BMWE\u2019s members have been on strike against these companies and have been subject to a lock-out. In April, BMWE began picketing at the yards of other railroads. While the striking workers had no direct dispute with these railroads, they sought to pressure them to cease doing business with their employers. The railroads targeted by this \u201csecondary picketing\u201d brought suit below, claiming that BMWE\u2019s activity violated the Railway Labor Act and the Interstate Commerce Act, and sought an injunction. The district judge initially denied relief on the ground that the plaintiff railroads had not demonstrated irreparable harm. The appellant Central Vermont Railway, Inc., then filed a separate motion for preliminary injunction, claiming that <em>its </em>operations had ground to a halt as a result of the picketing. Required thus to reach the legal issues presented, the district court held that the Norris-LaGuardia Act barred injunctive relief. In light of the urgency of this controversy, we agreed to hear Central Vermont\u2019s appeal on an expedited basis.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1377-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-15\">In the early decades of this century, the federal courts undertook the task of abating labor unrest, using various federal and state law doctrines to enjoin workers from participating in concerted activities viewed as wrongful. <em>See </em>F. Frankfurter &amp; N. Greene, The Labor Injunction 5-17 (1930). The choices about desirable public policy that judges necessarily made in applying these legal doctrines to the world of labor relations, however, came to be widely viewed as an exercise in judicial activism. The Congress, \u201cintent upon taking the federal courts out of the labor injunction business,\u201d <em>Marine Cooks &amp; Stewards v. Panama S.S. Co., </em>362 U.S. 365, 369, 80 S.Ct. 779, 783, 4 L.Ed.2d 797 (1960), responded with the Norris-LaGuardia Act, Pub.L. No. 72-65, 47 Stat. 70 (1932) (current version at 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101-115 (1982)). The Act, a singularly powerful instrument, withdrew the federal courts\u2019 jurisdiction to enjoin numerous forms of self-help \u201cin any case involving or growing out of any labor dispute____\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 104 (1982). Among the acts that federal courts have since been powerless to enjoin is \u201cgiving publicity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1300\">*1300</page-number>... any labor dispute, whether by advertising, speaking, <em>patrolling, </em>or by any other method not involving fraud or violence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 104(e) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-4\">Disputing the apparent applicability of this jurisdictional bar to the controversy before us, Central Vermont argues that this case does not \u201cinvolv[e] or grow[ ] out of any labor dispute\u201d under the Act. Central Vermont insists that because it is a neutral bystander, not substantially aligned with the strikers\u2019 employers, the picketing it seeks to have enjoined is not part of a \u201clabor dispute\u201d covered by the Act. This theory draws support from decisions of the Fifth and Eighth Circuits, which interpret the Act as reaching only those activities in furtherance of employees\u2019 economic self-interest; this self-interest, in turn, is regarded as justifying secondary picketing only where the target of the picketing is substantially aligned with the picketing individuals\u2019 employer. <em>See Brotherhood of R.R. Trainmen v. Atlantic Coast Line R.R., </em>362 F.2d 649 (5th Cir.), <em>aff'd by an equally divided Court, </em>385 U.S. 20, 87 S.Ct. 226,17 L.Ed.2d 20 (1966);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Ashley, Drew &amp; Northern Ry. v. United Transp. Union Local No. 1121, </em>625 F.2d 1357 (8th Cir.1980). The Ninth Circuit, however, has recently rejected this interpretation of the Norris-LaGuardia Act. <em>See Smith\u2019s Management Corp. v. Local 357, 1BEW, </em>737 F.2d 788 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-9\">We follow the Ninth Circuit in rejecting the proposed \u201ceconomic self-interest/substantial alignment\u201d test. The test finds no place in the Act\u2019s language and is inconsistent with its expansive terms. We note in particular that the Act\u2019s proscriptions extend beyond cases that immediately \u201cinvolve\u201d labor disputes to those that \u201cgrow out of\u201d such disputes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The statutory language simply provides no warrant for a court to exclude secondary activity from the Act\u2019s purview in accordance with its views of a union\u2019s proper \u201ceconomic self-interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-10\">Central Vermont nonetheless contends that the Act\u2019s drafters intended to incorporate the economic self-interest test. It claims that the test is stated in Justice Brand\u00e9is\u2019 dissenting opinion in <em>Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering, </em>254 U.S. 443, 41 S.Ct. 172, 65 L.Ed. 349 (1921), which, in turn, was influential among the Act\u2019s proponents. In <em>Duplex, </em>the Court construed the anti-injunction provisions of the Clayton Act as limited to the context of \u201cprimary,\u201d employer-employee disputes. In response, Justice Brand\u00e9is advanced the view that the statute broadly shielded \u201cthe right of industrial combatants to push their struggle to the limits of the justification of self-interest____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 488, 41 S.Ct. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1301\">*1301</page-number>184. We cannot believe, however, that the Congress that passed the Norris-LaGuardia Act \u2014 or, for that matter, Justice Brand\u00e9is<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2014 intended for <em>courts </em>to evaluate what activities a union\u2019s legitimate self-interest justifies. That was precisely the state of affairs that they wished to bring to a close.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It seems to us that the vice of the economic self-interest test is that it puts the courts back in the business of second-guessing a union\u2019s decisions about how best to pursue its members\u2019 welfare. <em>See Smith\u2019s Management, </em>737 F.2d at 791; <em>Burlington N R.R. v. BMWE, </em>793 F.2d 795, 804 (7th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-6\">To be sure, it might be thought that the \u201csubstantial alignment\u201d aspect of the test sufficiently reduces judicial discretion in delimiting the scope of the Norris-LaGuar-dia Act with respect to secondary activity. But this standard, apparently imported from the \u201cally\u201d doctrine applied under the secondary boycott provisions of the National Labor Relations Act, is itself of suspect pedigree. We have found no evidence that the drafters of the Norris-LaGuardia Act contemplated such distinctions between permissible and impermissible secondary activity. Absent the guidance of Congress or the attention of an administrative agency with expertise in the field, moreover, judicial efforts to draw such distinctions would be untenable; as the Court has observed, \u201c[n]o cosmic principles announce the existence of secondary conduct, condemn it as an evil, or delimit its boundaries.\u201d <em>Brotherhood of R.R. Trainmen v. Jacksonville Terminal Co., </em>394 U.S. 369, 386, 89 S.Ct. 1109, 1119, 22 L.Ed.2d 344 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-14\">Any doubts that might linger about the breadth of the Act\u2019s withdrawal of jurisdiction, moreover, are dispelled by <em>Jacksonville Bulk Terminals, Inc. v. ILA, </em>457 U.S. 702, 102 S.Ct. 2672, 73 L.Ed.2d 327 (1982). The Supreme Court, in holding that the Act barred injunctive relief against politically motivated work stoppages, specifically rejected the argument that a \u201clabor dispute\u201d exists only when a union acts in its economic self-interest. <em>See id. </em>at 713-15,102 S.Ct. at 2680-81. Concluding that \u201cCongress deliberately included a broad definition\u201d of the controversies subject to the Act\u2019s provisions, <em>id. </em>at 712, 102 S.Ct. at 2680, the Court accorded the Act a literal interpretation. The appellant attempts to distinguish <em>ILA </em>by noting that the case involved a \u201cprimary\u201d employer-employee dispute. <em>ILA </em>also recognized, however, that the Act has been construed to encompass disputes grounded in noneconomic motives \u201c[e]ven in cases where the disputants did not stand in the relationship of employer and employee....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 714, 102 S.Ct. at 2681 (citing <em>New Negro Alliance v. Sanitary Grocery Co., </em>303 U.S. 552, 58 S.Ct. 703, 82 L.Ed. 1012 (1938)). If secondary activity resting on political motives is within the Act\u2019s scope, as the Court suggested, then we think it follows <em>a fortiori </em>that the secondary activity at issue in this case is also covered.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1380-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1302\">*1302</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-4\">Our conclusion that this case \u201cinvolves or grows out of a labor dispute,\u201d however, does not constitute the end of the matter. The Supreme Court has recognized that the Norris-LaGuardia Act\u2019s anti-injunction provisions must be accommodated in certain instances to the mandate of other federal labor statutes. <em>See, e.g., Boys Market, Inc. v. Retail Clerks Union Local 770, </em>398 U.S. 235, 90 S.Ct. 1583, 26 L.Ed.2d 199 (1970).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In this regard, federal courts retain the power to compel compliance with the dispute resolution mechanisms of the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 <em>et seq. </em>(1982) (\u201cRLA\u201d). <em>See Brotherhood of R.R. Trainmen v. Chicago River &amp; I. R.R., </em>353 U.S. 30, 39-42, 77 S.Ct. 635, 639-41, 1 L.Ed.2d 622 (1957); <em>Chicago &amp; N.W. Ry. v. United Transp. Union, </em>402 U.S. 570, 581-84, 91 S.Ct. 1731, 1737-39, 29 L.Ed.2d 187 (1971). This exception to the Norris-LaGuardia Act is a narrow one, however, applicable only where injunctive relief is \u201cthe only practical, effective means\u201d of enforcing the procedural duties imposed upon parties by the RLA. <em>Id. </em>at 583, 91 S.Ct. at 1738. The dispositive issue in this case, then, is whether BMWE was required to attempt to settle its \u201cdispute\u201d with Central Vermont through the statutory mediation procedures before resorting to self-help.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1380-5\">Central Vermont\u2019s controversy with BMWE clearly is not a typical dispute contemplated by the RLA\u2019s settlement procedures. The RLA generally provides for mediation of \u201cmajor\u201d disputes, which concern proposed changes in terms and conditions of employment, <em>see </em>45 U.S.C. \u00a7 155 (First) (1982), and for adjustment of \u201cminor\u201d disputes, which concern the interpretation or application of agreements, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 153 (First) (i). The instant \u201cdispute\u201d is neither of these. The picketing of which Central Vermont complains is being conducted by individuals who are not its employees and with whom it has no bargaining relationship. The <em>amici </em>railroads nonetheless contend that secondary disputes such as this one are \u201cmiscellaneous\u201d disputes subject to mediation. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 155 (First) (mediation is available for \u201cany other dispute [other than a \u2018minor\u2019 dispute] not adjusted in conference between the parties or where conferences are refused\u201d). The language of the statute, however, seems to presuppose an existing employment or bargaining relationship between the disputants: the National Mediation Board\u2019s jurisdiction over \u201cmiscellaneous\u201d disputes is limited to \u201cdisputefs] between an employee or group of employees and a carrier____\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 155 (First).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1380-10\">Not only is it difficult to fit secondary disputes within the RLA\u2019s literal terms, it is not at all apparent what the parties could be expected to attempt to settle in mediation. The railroads suggest that meaningful bargaining could be had over the placement and duration of pickets, the scope of the carriers\u2019 dealings with the strikers\u2019 employers, and indemnity for any liability the carriers may face for breaching their legal obligations. We agree, however, with Judge Greene\u2019s observation in the proceedings below that \u201c[i]t would be a strained reading of the Act to hold that it requires mediation between a carrier and striking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1303\">*1303</page-number>workers of another employer who have no relationship with the carrier other than the pickets themselves.\u201d <em>Central Vt. Ry. v. BMWE, </em>639 F.Supp. 220, 227 (D.D.C.1986). Carriers would have little incentive to settle a dispute with non-employees whose only bargaining chip (the picketing) is taken away by the mediation process itself. Requiring mandatory mediation as a prerequisite to secondary picketing, then, could have the practical effect of banning conduct that Congress left unregulated. <em>See supra </em>note 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-5\">We must conclude that the RLA\u2019s settlement mechanisms simply do not reach beyond the context of primary disputes. <em>Accord ConRail v. BMWE, </em>792 F.2d 303 (2d Cir.1986); <em>Burlington N. R.R. v. BMWE, </em>793 F.2d 795, 798-99 (7th Cir.1986).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We appreciate that this conclusion, together with our analysis of the Norris-LaGuar-dia Act\u2019s scope, may leave carriers without effective recourse against secondary picketing. But that result follows not from a policy choice we make but rather from the indisputable fact that the RLA does not provide a treatment of labor relations in the transportation industry as comprehensive as the National Labor Relations Act does for the rest of American industry. It is not our task to make an imperfect statute perfect.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We hold that because there was no RLA duty to enforce in this case, there was nothing to which the Norris-La-Guardia Act need be \u201caccommodated.\u201d The district court therefore correctly denied Central Vermont\u2019s request for injunc-tive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1377-12\">. Other plaintiff railroads have participated in this appeal as <em>amici curiae.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1378-5\"><em>. </em>To the extent that the Supreme Court\u2019s division in <em>Atlantic Coast Line </em>raised a question about the lawfulness <em>per se </em>of secondary picketing under the Railway Labor Act, we think the question was implicitly resolved three years later in <em>Brotherhood of R.R. Trainmen v. Jacksonville Terminal Co., </em>394 U.S. 369, 89 S.Ct. 1109, 22 L.Ed.2d 344 (1969). <em>Jacksonville Terminal </em>held that states may not ban secondary picketing, and its rationale suggests that Congress left such activity unregulated. <em>See id. </em>at 391-93, 89 S.Ct. at 1122-23.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1378-6\">. The Act\u2019s definitional provisions state that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1378-7\">A case shall be held to involve or to grow out of a labor dispute when the case involves persons who are engaged in the same industry, trade, craft, or occupation; or have direct or indirect interests therein; or who are employees of the same employer; or who are members of the same or an affiliated organization of employers or employees; whether such dispute is (1) between one or more employers or associations of employers and one or more employees or associations of employees; (2) between one or more employers or associations of employers and one or more employers or associations of employers; (3) between one or more employees or associations of employees and one or more employees or associations of employees; or when the case involves any conflicting or competing interests in a \"labor dispute\u201d ... of \"persons participating or interested\u201d therein____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1378-13\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 113(a) (1982).

At the same time, the Court has confirmed that \"unlawfulness under <em>nonlabor </em>legislation [does] not remove the restrictions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act upon the jurisdiction of federal courts.\u201d <em>Order of R.R.

Thus, Central Vermont's contention that the picketing at issue here violates a provision of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11101(a) (1982), does not supply a basis upon which a federal court may afford it the injunctive relief it seeks.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1380-12\">.

The union\u2019s conduct, they assert, is tantamount to a demand made on behalf of Central Vermont\u2019s employees for an agreement that Central Vermont will not assist any other carrier subject to a strike. The record does not bear out this characterization of the case. BMWE has not asked for a \u201cstruck work\u201d clause or other modification of Central Vermont's collective bargaining agreement with its employees. Insofar as BMWE seeks to force Central Vermont to cease doing business with the sturck carriers, it does not do so directly on behalf of Central Vermont\u2019s employees. We thus find it unnecessary in this case to explore the precise accommodation of the Norris-LaGuardia Act and the RLA that would be appropriate in the scenario the railroads hypothesize.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1381-18\">. As the district court noted, however, the RLA does contain certain mechanisms to deal with harmful strikes. In situations \"threaten[ing] substantially to interrupt interstate commerce to a degree such as to deprive any section of the country of essential transportation service,\u201d the President may convene an emergency board to investigate the controversy. <em>See </em>45 U.S.C. \u00a7 160 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
