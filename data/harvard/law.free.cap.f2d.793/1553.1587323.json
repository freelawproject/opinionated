The trial court concluded that the fear-inducing conduct of the appellants constituted, <em>inter alia, </em>a violation of the Hobbs Act. We agree with that conclusion, and with the others reached below, and for that reason we affirm the judgment of the trial court on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1633-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1633-24\">The appellants in this case, Robert Blan-ton, Clyde Daigle, and Jerome Banks, were involved in the organization of a new labor union, the International Brotherhood of Security Services [hereinafter \u201cIBOSS\u201d], which sought to organize private security employees in places like factories and airports. Blanton was the first president of Local 1 of IBOSS in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Banks was director of the Internal Secret Service [hereinafter \u201cISS\u201d] of IBOSS Local 1, which functioned as Blan-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1556\">*1556</page-number>ton's armed body guard. Daigle was the ISS secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1634-4\">In 1984, IBOSS began an organizational drive among the security officers at the Atlanta-Hartsdal\u00e9 International Airport. All three appellants were seen at Hartsdale during a work stoppage and picketing episode in August of 1984. During this time IBOSS submitted petitions to the National Labor Relations Board [hereinafter \u201cNLRB\u201d] seeking to represent the workers at Hartsdale. Though the NLRB held hearings, during the time here relevant they issued no representation decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1634-5\">In November 1984 the other IBOSS officers effectively ousted Blanton from his position. The motivations appear to have been internal disagreements and difficulty in borrowing money due to Blanton\u2019s criminal record. Blanton had been convicted of murder ten years earlier; that conviction was reversed, after Blanton had served nine years, in a federal <em>habeas corpus </em>action. He had also been arrested for possession of an illegal silencer and <em>for </em>rape and had been convicted of shooting into an occupied home. Blanton \u201cresigned\u201d and was retained on a contract that provided, <em>inter alia, </em>that he would be paid $235,000/year for life as a consultant. Further quarrel-ling over the extent of Blanton\u2019s control, and an apparent desire to purge \u201cblack militants,\u201d led to the termination of the contract on December 7 of that year and the ousting of all three appellants from the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b1634-6\">On December 14, 1984, Banks called the office of Frank Argenbright, president of Argenbright, Inc. Argenbright is one of the companies supplying security services to Hartsdale. Banks left a message that he wanted to help Argenbright \u201cclose down\u201d IBOSS and left Blanton\u2019s telephone number. Mr. Argenbright knew of Blan-ton\u2019s criminal record due to investigations made during the earlier organizing efforts and became alarmed that this might be the beginning of an extortion attempt. Mr. Argenbright and his vice-president, Mr. Bivins, began a series of tape-recorded telephone calls with the appellants during which the latter made clear that they were out to close down IBOSS \u2014 both to help Argenbright, and to get revenge for their ouster.</p>\n<p id=\"b1634-8\">Eventually FBI agents were brought into the matter and they took over the dealings with the appellants through Agent Sollars. The appellants negotiated with Sollars for a period of several months, during which the price for destroying IBOSS rose from $6000 to $18,000 plus expenses. Originally the appellants wished to be retained as \u201cconsultants\u201d on the Argenbright payroll; later they demanded cash so that there would be no trail that would prevent Blan-ton from becoming head of a sweetheart company union at Argenbright after IBOSS was out of the picture.</p>\n<p id=\"b1634-9\">In exchange for this money, Blanton and his two associates maintained that they would come to Atlanta and disclose secret documents to the NLRB, create a notable media event, and use their tremendous influence with the rank and file to \u201cblow IBOSS out of the water.\u201d Blanton also made clear that he could help Argenbright set up a company union so that when IBOSS was gone no other union would come in and take over. Blanton stated that if Argenbright did not hire him IBOSS would destroy the Argenbright business. Blanton also suggested that IBOSS itself was trying to buy his documents and thus that Argenbright needed to act quickly. Finally Blanton threatened that, if Argen-bright was not forthcoming, he would get rid of IBOSS anyway, set up his own union, and make things difficult for Argenbright. There were several veiled threats of possible violence, either from IBOSS or from Blanton, if things were not quickly resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1634-10\">Because Blanton was on probation, there was some difficulty in arranging for him to come to Atlanta to consummate the deal, but eventually the details were worked out. On February 25 the three appellants arrived with a brief case of secret papers handcuffed to Daigle\u2019s wrist. Appellants met with officials of Argenbright, Inc. for 80 minutes, which meeting was recorded on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1557\">*1557</page-number>sound and video tape at Argenbright headquarters. One half of the money, $9000, changed hands. The rest was to be paid upon the destruction of IBOSS. At this point, FBI agents entered the room and arrested Blanton, Banks and Daigle.</p>\n<p id=\"b1635-5\">The appellants were tried before a jury on four counts: conspiracy to extort in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1951 (1985); extortion by threats of violence, also a violation of Section 1951; solicitation of money in exchange for sworn testimony, 18 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 201(i); and solicitation of money in violation of 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 186(a)(2), (b)(1), and (d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1635-6\">Blanton put on no defense. Banks and Daigle argued that they had not extorted, but merely offered to engage in a valid business deal \u2014 to help protect Argenbright from the illegal organizing actions of IBOSS. They claimed that any taped statements they made that sounded extortionate or threatening were either lies or kidding. All three were convicted on the first three counts and acquitted on the Title 29 solicitation of money count. Blanton received concurrent ten year prison terms on counts one and two, plus a five year probation term on count three. Banks and Daigle each received concurrent two year terms on counts one, two and three.</p>\n<p id=\"b1635-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1635-8\">This case presents three issues: A) whether the evidence is sufficient to sustain the convictions; B) whether the trial judge erred in giving some government instructions and in declining to give appellants\u2019 requested jury instructions; and C) whether the trial court erred in admitting evidence of Blanton\u2019s prior criminal record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1635-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1635-10\">All appellants advance the same position with respect to the sufficiency of the evidence on the extortion counts, one and two, and on the solicitation count, three.</p>\n<p id=\"b1635-11\">1) Extortion:</p>\n<p id=\"b1635-12\">Appellants argue that the government has failed to make out a violation of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1951 <em>et seq. </em>(1985) , because they \u201cnever threatened to cause physical harm or economic loss to Argenbright, but were only asking for money to aid Argenbright to avoid the economic loss\u201d that IBOSS would wreak. In essence, they argue that the threats here were neither express nor intentionally implicit \u2014 that in fact the threat came from IBOSS and that the appellants were being good Samaritans trying to help Argen-bright avoid the loss IBOSS would cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1635-15\">On appeal we will reverse a jury verdict for insufficient evidence only if that evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the government, does not substantially support the verdict. The verdict must be sustained so long as a reasonable trier of fact could find that the evidence establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 469, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>758 F.2d 1517,1521 (11th Cir.1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 789, 88 L.Ed.2d 767 (1986) . All credibility choices must be made in favor of those reached by the finder of fact. <em>Anderson v. Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, -, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1512, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985); <em>United States v. Gianni, </em>678 F.2d 956, 959 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1071, 103 S.Ct. 491, 74 L.Ed.2d 633 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1635-19\">Justice Jackson once observed that \u201c[w]hat a man is up to may be clear from considering his bare acts by themselves ____\u201d <em>Cramer v. United States, </em>325 U.S. 1, 33, 65 S.Ct. 918, 934, 89 L.Ed. 1441 (1945). In this case, considering only the conduct and statements preserved on the record, the evidence was, to risk understatement, overwhelming. The appellants\u2019 <em>post hoc </em>explanation of their intentions to the contrary is notwithstanding. The appellants clearly exploited the fears of Mr. Argenbright of violence and economic loss not only from IBOSS, but from the appellants themselves. Repeated references were made to the fact that Blanton had a past criminal record, that he used the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1558\">*1558</page-number>two appellants as armed body guards, that the body guards had been surreptitiously observing high ranking Argenbright employees, and that if Mr. Argenbright did not utilize their services they might bust IBOSS and then set up their own union among Argenbright employees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The appellants made it clear that Mr. Argenbright and Argenbright, Inc. could not afford to forego their services, due to the threat both from IBOSS and from appellants themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b1636-4\">Beyond this, an actionable claim under the Hobbs Act can be made out even if the threats used to extort are merely subtle and indirect, so long as the government can show \u201ccircumstances surrounding the alleged extortionate conduct that rendered the victim\u2019s fear of threatened loss reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Sander, </em>615 F.2d 215, 218 (5th Cir.) <em>(per curiam ), cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 835, 101 S.Ct. 108, 66 L.Ed.2d 41 (1980). Likewise, in <em>United States v. Kopituk, </em>690 F.2d 1289, 1328 (11th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>463 U.S. 1209, 103 S.Ct. 3542, 77 L.Ed.2d 1391 (1983), we noted that in order to win a conviction under the Hobbs Act, \u201cthe government need show only that the defendant received the property of another without any lawful claim to such property and that the person who made the payment did so out of fear.\u201d That is simply and squarely on all fours with the factual posture of this case. The appellants received $9000 from Argenbright, Inc., they had no lawful claim to that money because they provided no legitimate service, and Argen-bright was induced to make that payment out of fear of violence caused by or contributed to by the appellants. A reasonable jury could have concluded that a Hobbs Act violation occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1636-8\">2) Solicitation:</p>\n<p id=\"b1636-9\">Appellants also challenge the sufficiency of the evidence that they solicited money in exchange for testimony before the NLRB. The gist of their argument is that it was Argenbright\u2019s employees and the FBI agent who kept bringing up that topic, rather than appellants. They claim that while they agreed to testify if necessary they did not think that it would be necessary and that instead they intended to do a number of other things for the money they sought. Appellants also argue that the references to testimony and to being witnesses really referred to appearing in the media and not before a court or board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1636-10\">The standard of review here is the same as for the extortion claim. Where testimony is ambiguous, we must defer to the inferences that the jury drew. <em>Glasser, </em>315 U.S. at 80, 62 S.Ct. at 469; <em>Gianni, </em>678 F.2d at 959.</p>\n<p id=\"b1636-11\">This claim too is meritless, for the record is interlarded with episodes featuring each appellant promising testimony to the NLRB in exchange for payment. Blanton offered to give sworn depositions and to speak privately to \u201cthe judge\u201d (presumably the NLRB examiner or the Administrative Law Judge) in his chambers, providing the necessary evidence to shut down IBOSS.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1559\">*1559</page-number>Banks promised to testify personally before the NLRB,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as did Daigle.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Whether or not Argenbright\u2019s people or the FBI brought the subject up,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> each appellant unambiguously stated that in exchange for the fee to be tendered he would appear before a judge or the Board to offer testimony against IBOSS. This is a clear violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 201(i), which prohibits demanding, soliciting, accepting or agreeing to accept \u201canything of value ... because of the testimony under oath or affirmation given or to be given by [the defendant] as a witness upon any such trial, hearing, or other proceeding____\u201d The jury verdict on this point was clearly reasonable and hence must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1637-21\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1637-22\">Appellants raise eight allegations of improper jury charges or failure to give re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1560\">*1560</page-number>quested charges. The allegations will be discussed <em>seriatim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1638-4\">In reviewing allegations of error in charging the jury this Court will examine the entire charge to determine whether, on the whole, the issues and law presented to the jury were adequate. <em>United States v. Abravaya, </em>616 F.2d 250, 251 (5th Cir.1980). \u201cA district court\u2019s refusal to give a requested instruction constitutes reversible error if and only if the instruction (1) is correct; (2) is not substantially covered by other instructions which were delivered; and (3) deals with some point in the trial so important that the failure to give this instruction seriously impairs the defendant\u2019s ability to defend himself.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>728 F.2d 1402, 1404 (11th Cir. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1638-5\">1) Requested Charge 34:</p>\n<p id=\"b1638-6\">Appellants offered Charge 34 as part of their defense that the physical or economic fear which Argenbright experienced was neither exploited by the appellants nor under their control.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There is no error here, however, for the requested Charge 34 is an incorrect statement of the law. The second sentence of the proposed instruction directs the jury to focus on an irrelevant fact. Under <em>United States v. Haimowitz, </em>725 F.2d 1561, 1572 (11th Cir. 1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 563, 83 L.Ed.2d 504 (1984), the defendant need not actually \u201ccause, or threaten to cause the force, violence, or fear to occur\u201d in order to be convicted of extortion. He need only be aware of the victim\u2019s fear and intentionally exploit that fear to his own possible advantage. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1638-9\">2) Requested Charge 35:</p>\n<p id=\"b1638-10\">Requested Charge 35<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> presents in capsule form the holding of our opinion in <em>United States v. Livingston, </em>665 F.2d 1003, 1005 (11th Cir.1982). In that case the defendants were themselves not involved with an extortion scheme, they merely offered to sell information about an on-going embezzlement perpetrated by others. There is no error here for two reasons. First, the factual posture of this case and <em>Livingston </em>are markedly different. In <em>Livingston:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1638-15\">[t]he scheme contemplated ... was to offer to inform [the victim of the embezzlement] of the source of past and current economic loss stemming from the embezzlement, in exchange for a monetary payment. The scheme did not contemplate threatening to cause the embezzlement to continue unless payment was made. There was no factual showing that Livingston was involved in the embezzlement or that he knew that any of his associates were involved in it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1638-16\">665 F.2d at 1005. In the instant matter the appellants did not merely offer to help Ar-genbright avoid economic loss caused by IBOSS, they also made threats to inflict economic loss themselves and to assist IBOSS in perpetrating the loss it supposedly contemplated if Argenbright was not forthcoming with the money demanded. For example Daigle told Bivins that unless Argenbright acted quickly, and paid a premium fee, Daigle and his cohorts planned to sell the incriminating documents to the union. Thus, unlike the defendants in <em>Livingston, </em>the appellants here crafted a \u201cscheme ... threatening to cause the [economic los\u00a7] to continue unless payment was made.\u201d 665 F.2d at 1005. <em>Livingston </em>is simply inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b1638-17\">There was no error for a second reason. Appellants submit that even if this case is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1561\">*1561</page-number>not on all fours with <em>Livingston, </em>this instruction embodied one theory of their defense and thus they had the right to have the jury consider it. We held in <em>United States v. Silverman, </em>745 F.2d 1386, 1399-1400 (11th Cir.1984), that a defendant is not automatically entitled to a theory of the defense instruction if that argument is adequately covered in another instruction, if it would be confusing, if it is not a legally cognizable defense, or if- it merely emphasizes a certain phase of the evidence. <em>See also United States v. Grassi, </em>783 F.2d 1572, 1577 (11th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1639-5\">All that the appellants sought to convey was that the jury could determine that they were simply seeking to sell information about IBOSS activities without demonstrating the requisite intent to instill fear or intent to exploit that fear. That was adequately spelled out in the instructions that the court actually gave.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> At best the proposed instruction merely emphasizes an aspect of the evidence that appellants believe is favorable to their defense. <em>Silverman, </em>745 F.2d at 1400. They were not entitled to a <em>Livingston </em>instruction under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1639-6\">3) Requested Charge 20:</p>\n<p id=\"b1639-7\">Appellants challenge as an erroneous instruction the government\u2019s requested Charge 20 dealing with the appellants\u2019 offer to set up a sweetheart union.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> They object that this improperly incorporated the provisions of the Taft-Hartley Act into the Hobbs Act thus permitting the jury to convict, based upon finding the commission of an unfair labor practice, contrary to the holding in <em>United States v. Enmons, </em>410 U.S. 396, 93 S.Ct. 1007, 35 L.Ed.2d 379 (1973), and to the former Fifth Circuit\u2019s opinion in <em>United States v. Quinn, </em>514 F.2d 1250 (5th Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>424 U.S. 955, 96 S.Ct. 1430, 47 L.Ed.2d 361 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1639-15\">There is no error here because appellants are guilty of selective reading of <em>Quinn </em>and its interpretation of <em>Enmons. </em>In the latter case the Supreme Court held that an alleged extortionist could not be convicted under the Hobbs Act for violence related to labor union activity aimed at obtaining property to which he had a lawful claim because such conduct was not \u201cwrongful\u201d within, the terms of the Hobbs Act, 410 U.S. at 399-400, 93 S.Ct. at 1009-10. In <em>Quinn </em>the former Fifth Circuit construed <em>Enmons </em>\u201cto remove from the reach of federal criminal law the use of coercive tactics to obtain increased wages, but with the caveat that the prosecutor\u2019s hand would be stayed <em>only </em>when the payment is gained in furtherance of legitimate labor objectives.\u201d 514 F.2d at 1257 (emphasis in original). Securing higher wages in exchange for honest labor provided, the defendant\u2019s objective in <em>Enmons, </em>is a legitimate labor objective; the creation of a sweetheart union, one objective of the appellants here, is not a legitimate labor ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1562\">*1562</page-number>jective \u2014 it is illegal. 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(a). <em>Quinn </em>and <em>Enmons </em>do not bar this action; the jury instruction was a correct statement of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1640-4\">4) The \u201cFear\u201d Instruction:</p>\n<p id=\"b1640-5\">The appellants contest what they characterize as the court\u2019s \u201cfear instruction.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> They claim it improperly failed to insert the word \u201cwrongful\u201d before \u201cfear.\u201d They do not say before which of the many appearances of \u201cfear\u201d they wanted \u201cwrongful\u201d inserted. They in any event concede that \u201cthe court did correctly define extortion prior to and subsequent to this quoted portion\u201d but argue that \u201cthe failure to again use the word wrongful in this portion created a confusing and incorrect charge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1640-6\">There is no reversible error if the instructions, considered as a whole, accurately present to the jury the issues and the law. <em>Abravaya, </em>616 F.2d at 251. Just prior to this complained-of section the court defined \u201cfear\u201d and \u201cwrongful,\u201d and in that section following it the court explained in which situations the use of fear would be wrongful, so as to direct the jury\u2019s attention to the object and purpose of the defendants\u2019 conduct. Viewed as a whole, there is no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1640-14\">5) Count 3 Instruction:</p>\n<p id=\"b1640-15\">Appellants object that the trial court gave an erroneous and confusing instruction on Count 3 to the effect that the government could meet its burden of proof on the solicitation charge simply by showing that the NLRB had not yet issued a ruling at the time the offer to testify took place.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1640-16\">This is frivolous. The instruction at issue was simply defining what constituted \u201ca pending judicial hearing.\u201d One necessary predicate to showing an attempt to sell testimony is the possibility that such testimony-for-hire could be presented to a hearing. Again the appellants concede that the court\u2019s statements before and after this particular explanation made clear that the actual elements of Count 3 required a request for money in exchange for testimony. We must look to the instruction as a whole, <em>Abravaya, </em>616 F.2d at 251, and here there was simply no possibility of confusion. The appellants\u2019 argument is make-weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b1640-17\">6) State of Mind \u2014 Past Criminal Acts:</p>\n<p id=\"b1640-18\">Appellants Blanton and Daigle object to the reference in the court\u2019s state of mind instruction to Argenbright\u2019s testimony about what he had heard of the past criminal conduct of appellants.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1563\">*1563</page-number>premise their objection on the fact that there was no evidence introduced as to Daigle\u2019s reputation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1641-4\">Blanton\u2019s argument on this point is frivolous. The record clearly establishes that he has a criminal record and that Argen-bright knew about it and was affected by it. Blanton has no basis for objecting to this properly limiting state of mind instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1641-5\">Daigle\u2019s position is technically correct; there was no evidence of a criminal record on his part. From that he argues that the jurors could conclude that he committed some crime and that they just missed hearing it. There was no error, however. The trial court\u2019s instruction on Argenbright\u2019s state of mind was initially confusing, but there is nothing in that ambiguity to suggest affirmatively that Daigle had some past record. In any event, four paragraphs later the trial court explicitly said that any state of mind evidence derived from past criminal acts related only to Blanton, so Daigle has suffered no prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1641-6\">7) State of Mind \u2014 Violence in the Organizing Drive:</p>\n<p id=\"b1641-7\">Appellants object to another portion of the state of mind charge, also on the grounds that it suggests the existence of acts not contained in the record.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Specifically, they claim the record does not reflect that threatening or intimidating conduct was actually used during the campaign to organize Hartsdale Airport.</p>\n<p id=\"b1641-13\">There is no error. Whether or not the organizers actually engaged in the alleged conduct is not to the point; the testimony did not come in for the truth of the matter asserted, as the court explained in that instruction. Rather the question is whether the rumors and allegations of such conduct had an effect on the witness\u2019s state of mind. Mr. Argenbright recounted that he had been made aware of a number of instances of threatening conduct by appellants and by other union partisans during the IBOSS organizational drive at Harts-dale. Mr. Argenbright testified that the techniques resorted to were unusual and threatening and that this prompted him to order a background check on Blanton. This in turn provided the evidence of Blan-ton\u2019s past convictions, which caused Mr. Argenbright to fear dealing with him. This was all relevant to Mr. Argenbright\u2019s state of mind. It was properly admitted, <em>Grassi, </em>783 F.2d at 1578; Fed.R.Evid. 803(3), and the instruction correctly advised the jury to consider it only for the limited purpose for which the court admitted it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1641-14\">8) Entrapment:</p>\n<p id=\"b1641-15\">Finally, the appellants claim that the trial court erred in failing to give their \u201crequested\u201d instruction on entrapment. During the course of deliberations the jury sent out a request for an instruction on entrapment. The trial court refused the request, reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1564\">*1564</page-number>ing that entrapment is an affirmative defense and appellants never argued it. The court sent the jury back to resume deliberations telling them that appellants had waived an entrapment defense by not arguing it and \u201cas a consequence you don\u2019t even consider that in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1642-4\">Appellants concede that they did not request such an instruction before the jury went out though they claim that from start to finish, if they may be permitted an oxymoron, they argued entrapment <em>sotto voce. </em>They submit, in essence, that we should overlook any error because entrapment was obviously a viable defense and the interests of justice compelled letting the jury accept that defense if they found it persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1642-5\">The government argues strongly, and persuasively, that this would be a poor rule to adopt. The appellants not only did not argue \u201cfrom start to finish\u201d an entrapment claim, they failed to raise it at all. This is just <em>post hoc </em>grasping at straws.</p>\n<p id=\"b1642-6\">As we noted, <em>supra </em>at n. 6, entrapment is an affirmative defense, <em>Dickens, </em>524 F.2d at 444, ordinarily requiring admission that one engaged in the alleged acts. <em>United States v. Greenfield, </em>554 F.2d 179, 181 (5th Cir.1977), <em>appealed following remand, </em>574 F.2d 305 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 860, 99 S.Ct. 178, 58 L.Ed.2d 168 (1978). The trial court properly refused to instruct the jury on entrapment after deliberations had begun; holding otherwise would have unfairly prevented the government from responding to that defense. Appellants made a decision to forego this argument. They may not have it both ways once it appears that they made the wrong tactical choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1642-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1642-8\">Blanton objected at trial to the introduction into evidence of the fact that he had previously been convicted of murder and served time on that charge before having the conviction set aside in a <em>habeas corpus </em>action. He claims this was error because it put his character at issue when he had not opened the door to that matter. The trial court admitted it as going to the victim\u2019s state of mind \u2014 that is, to show that Mr. Argenbright would fear Blanton in part because of the prior conviction. Ordinarily such evidence is probative and hence admissible in a Hobbs Act case. <em>Grassi, </em>783 F.2d at 1578. Although Blanton does concede that the conviction would have some probative value in showing fear he claims that it was error under Fed.R.Evid. 403 to admit this evidence for that purpose because the prejudicial effect substantially outweighed any probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b1642-10\">The decision to admit evidence of extrinsic acts for purposes other than showing the defendant\u2019s bad character is subject to a clear abuse of discretion standard. <em>United States v. Eirin, </em>778 F.2d 722, 731 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1642-11\">It was not an abuse of discretion under Rule 403 to admit that evidence in this case. We have invariably held that determining prejudice to outweigh probativeness under Rule 403 is an exceptional remedy invoked sparingly because that Rule has the effect of excluding relevant evidence from the jury\u2019s consideration. <em>Grassi, </em>783 F.2d at 1579; <em>United States v. Meester, </em>762 F.2d 867, 875 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Sawyer v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 579, 88 L.Ed.2d 562 (1985). As the Former Fifth Circuit explained in <em>United States v. McRae, </em>593 F.2d 700, 707 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 862, 100 S.Ct. 128, 62 L.Ed.2d 83 (1979), when discussing incriminating evidence offered by the prosecution, \u201c[rjelevant evidence is inherently prejudicial; but it is only <em>unfair </em>prejudice, <em>substantially </em>outweighing probative value, which permits exclusion of relevant matter under Rule 403____ [Rule 403\u2019s] major function is limited to excluding matter of scant or cumulative probative force, dragged in by the heels for the sake of its prejudicial effect.\u201d (Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1642-16\">Such was not the case below. The evidence of the murder conviction was relevant to the victim\u2019s state of mind; one element of a Hobbs Act violation is fear on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1565\">*1565</page-number>the part of the victim that can be deemed reasonable. <em>Kopituk, </em>690 F.2d at 1328. The risk of unfair prejudice due to the fact that the conviction was later overturned was minimized by the fact that the jury was informed of this fact and by the district court\u2019s repeated, clear limiting instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1643-5\">Blanton also challenges the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant him a mistrial after his parole officer mentioned that a government investigator called her in 1984 to inform her that Blanton had been charged with, but not convicted of, rape in 1982. Again, Blanton objects that this put his character at issue and was not otherwise relevant. He argues that Fed.R.Evid. 404(b) prohibited introducing the other crime evidence because a rape charge had no relevance to the crime here at issue. The decision to deny a motion for a mistrial is entrusted to the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>United States v. Brooks, </em>670 F.2d 148, 152 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>457 U.S. 1124, 102 S.Ct. 2943, 73 L.Ed.2d 1339 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1643-6\">The judge was not in error in refusing a mistrial. Blanton\u2019s lawyer at first withdrew his motion, apparently reasoning that the testimony properly came in as relevant to FBI Agent Sollars\u2019 motive. It was only when the trial court stated that this testimony could not be argued in closing that the motion was renewed. On the other hand, the trial court stated forcefully to the lawyers that it was completely irrelevant; the court firmly instructed the jurors to disregard it. The trial court even asked the jurors if each would be able to ignore the statement; none indicated to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1643-7\">There was no Rule 404 violation here because the testimony was not admitted into evidence. Nor was it an abuse of discretion to refuse the motion for a mistrial because there is no evidence of prejudice. The comment slipped out, was promptly objected to, and the judge instructed the jury that it was irrelevant and could not be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"ALW\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1643-9\">For the reasons foregoing, we determine that the appellants have failed to state any basis for relief by this Court. The evidence of guilt of each appellant on the extortion and solicitation charges is more than amply supported by the evidence educed at trial. Neither was there error in the instructions given nor in the trial court\u2019s decision to refuse certain instructions. As to Blan-ton\u2019s prior criminal record, the evidence of his conviction for murder was properly admitted. The rape evidence was not admitted and did not justify a mistrial. Finding no error on the record, the decision of the trial court is due, in all respects, to be AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1633-25\">. R.

Appellants appear to be advancing an entrapment defense of sorts. If so, it is too late asserted. Entrapment is an affirmative defense. <em>United States v.

In this Circuit offering that defense requires the defendant to admit that he committed the acts alleged, <em>United States v. Brooks, </em>611 F.2d 614, 618 (5th Cir. 1980), something that none of the defendants below did. Further, failure to assert entrapment at the district court level precludes advancing it for the first time on appeal. <em>United States v. Nicolt, </em>664 F.2d 1308, 1314 (5th Cir.
