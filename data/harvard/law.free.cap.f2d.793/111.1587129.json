Harney, </em>786 F.2d 688 (5th Cir.1986). Again, we confront an irate former husband bringing attempted civil rights actions arising from his divorce: one against his former wife, one against a state judge, and various ones against assorted counsel connected with his divorce and child custody case. Absent from the cast, however, is counsel for the husband; he has proceeded pro se.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-20\">Mr. Brinkmann\u2019s pro se complaint is to be construed liberally, with all well-pleaded allegations taken as true. <em>Krempp v. Dobbs, </em>775 F.2d 1319, 1320 (5th Cir.1985). For several reasons, Brinkmann\u2019s civil rights suit against the state judge is frivolous. At all material times, Judge Line was acting within the scope of his judicial duties; the complaint contains no serious or substantial allegations to the contrary. This being so, Judge Line is absolutely immune from suit. <em>Stump v. Sparkman, </em>435 U.S. 349, 362-64, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 1107-09, 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978). It is settled law that a judge enjoys absolute immunity from liability for any damages resulting from judicial acts performed within his jurisdiction. <em>See Hale, </em>786 F.2d at 690 (citing <em>Randall v. Brigham, </em>74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 523, 19 L.Ed. 285 (1869)) and <em>Turner v. Raynes, </em>611 F.2d 92 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>499 U.S. 900, 101 S.Ct. 269, 66 L.Ed.2d 129 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-21\">Brinkmann\u2019s claims against his ex-wife and her attorney and his son\u2019s attorney are likewise frivolous. Although private acts may support an action for liability under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 if the individual is \u201ca willing participant in a joint action with the state or its agents,\u201d Mr. Brinkmann\u2019s complaint in the present case does not state any factual basis to support his conspiracy charges. <em>Dennis v. Sparks, </em>449 U.S. 24, 101 S.Ct. 183, 66 L.Ed.2d 185 (1980); <em>Hale, </em>786 F.2d at 690 (citing <em>Earnest v. Lowentritt, </em>690 F.2d 1198 (5th Cir. 1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>In \u00a7 1983 cases, our Court requires that the \u201cclaimant ... state specific facts, not merely conclusory allegations.\u201d <em>Hale, </em>786 F.2d at 690 (citing <em>Morrison v. City of Baton Rouge, </em>761 F.2d 242, 244 (5th Cir. 1985)) (quoting <em>Elliot v. Perez, </em>751 F.2d 1472, 1479 (5th Cir.1985)). In <em>Arsenaux v. Roberts, </em>726 F.2d 1022, 1024 (5th Cir.1982), we held that \u201cmere conclusory allegations of conspiracy cannot, absent reference to material facts,\u201d state a substantial claim of federal conspiracy under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Moreover, \u201ca lengthy line of decisions in our court, ... holds that litigants may not obtain review of state court actions by filing complaints about those actions in lower federal courts cast in the form of civil rights suits.\u201d <em>Hale, </em>786 F.2d 690-91 (citing <em>Sawyer v. Overton, </em>595 F.2d 252 (1979) and <em>Kimball v. The Florida Bar, </em>632 F.2d 1283 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">The above principles are not limited to actions \u201cwhich candidly seek review of the state court decree; [they extend] to others in which the constitutional claims presented [in federal court] are inextricably intertwined with the state court\u2019s grant or denial of relief.\u201d <em>Hale, </em>786 F.2d at 691 (quoting <em>District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 482 n. 16, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 1315 n. 16, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1982)). Errors committed by state judges in state courts are for correction in the state court system.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Mr. Brinkmann is proceeding pro se on appeal and was proceeding so in the district court. For that reason, we forbear the imposition of sanctions for the bringing of this frivolous action and appeal. <em>Hale v. Harney, supra, </em>gives fair warning to those represented by counsel. Those who venture into federal court without the assistance of counsel cannot, however, be permitted to enjoy much or protracted advantage by reason of that circumstance. We publish this as a caution to future pro se litigants that an attempt to appeal domestic proceedings to federal court in the guise of civil rights actions invites sanctions. <em>Cf. Lonsdale v. Commissioner, </em>661 F.2d 71 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
