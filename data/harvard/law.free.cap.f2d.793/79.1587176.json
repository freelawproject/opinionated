Wexler, J., based on Eastern\u2019s alleged willful noncompliance with a permanent injunction that Judge Wexler issued in favor of the plaintiff, the Town of Islip. The permanent injunction required Eastern to discontinue two of its six daily flights out of Islip\u2019s MacArthur Airport. Judge Wexler issued his oral ruling on November 5, 1985, and written findings of fact and conclusions of law on December 3. Eastern still had failed to cut back its schedule, however, by December 10, when the contempt order issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">Eastern argues that the judgment of contempt was improper because the district court\u2019s injunction order failed, both in its oral form and its subsequent written form, to provide Eastern with a clear understanding of what it was legally required to do. In the alternative, Eastern argues that the contempt order was improper because it was based on a permanent injunction whose effect had been stayed by order of this court. Eastern also argues that the district court abused its discretion by \u201chastily\u201d and \u201cerroneously\u201d issuing the contempt order. Because we agree that the district court\u2019s injunction orders contained material ambiguities, and believe that Eastern took reasonable steps to secure clarification, which was not forthcoming, we vacate the judgment of contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">On January 8, 1985, Northeastern Airways filed a Chapter Eleven petition in the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida. That same day, as a part of Northeastern\u2019s nationwide reduction of flight operations, the airline discontinued its four flights at MacArthur Airport. Eastern, which already had two flights a day out of MacArthur, wanted to obtain the Northeastern slots. Discussions to that effect were held on January 8 between Arnold Aikens, Eastern\u2019s attorney, and Alfred Werner, who is Commissioner of Aviation and Transportation for the Town of Islip and also manager of MacArthur. That same day, the parties agreed that Eastern would be allowed to increase its service by taking over the four Northeastern flights; Eastern implemented the new schedule on January 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">Islip permitted Eastern to increase its flights on the condition that it would relinquish the four flights on a one-for-one basis if Northeastern were to resume its schedule. Islip requested this one-for-one reduction condition as a means of limiting the total number of flights going in and out of MacArthur Airport. This numerical limit was expected, in turn, to help control the MacArthur noise pollution problem that has affected 3600 Islip residents, and that the Town has been attempting to cope with since April, 1984. The oral agreement was initially referred to in a January 17, 1985 letter from Islip to Eastern.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-12\">Shortly thereafter, Northeastern informed Islip that it intended to resume flights out of MacArthur, effective February 8. On February 1, Islip wrote to Eastern requesting that Eastern reduce its flights accordingly, but in a February 14 letter Eastern responded that, according to its view of the \u201cone-for-one\u201d agreement, such cessation was not required. Eastern\u2019s letter argued that the oral negotiations had provided that Eastern\u2019s promise to reduce its flights would be triggered only if Northeastern\u2019s resumption of operations at MacArthur was by order of the Bankruptcy Court, and at that time the court had entered no order. Islip wrote back that it disagreed with Eastern\u2019s construction of the agreement. Nevertheless, Eastern and Northeastern began simultaneous operations out of MacArthur. The dispute took <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>another turn on March 4, 1985, when Northeastern again suspended flights at MacArthur.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Eastern continued its flights. On June 6, 1985, Northeastern again informed Werner that it intended to resume operations at MacArthur, beginning on June 21. Islip objected to this plan, and hearings regarding the plan ensued in the Bankruptcy Court. At the same time, however, Islip requested Eastern to reduce its flights should the plan take effect, which Eastern refused to do. On June 20, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order enjoining Islip from interfering with Northeastern\u2019s resumption of one flight per day at MacArthur beginning on June 21, and a second flight per day thirty days thereafter.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Islip believed that the revival of Northeastern\u2019s flight status by order of the bankruptcy court satisfied even Eastern\u2019s view of the conditions precedent to the agreement, and asked Eastern to reduce its operations accordingly. Eastern again declined to do so, stating that by then it had a protected claim to the disputed slots.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">On July 1, 1985, Islip brought an action against Eastern in the New York State Supreme Court, seeking an injunction requiring Eastern \u201cto reduce its daily departures on a one-for-one basis as Northeastern increases its departures.\u201d Eastern removed the case to the Eastern District on July 24, on the basis of diversity of citizenship. The district court reviewed the documents referring to the agreement, and held a hearing on Islip\u2019s application for a preliminary injunction on August 9. Eastern\u2019s theory was that the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s June 20 order was not the kind of order that the parties had agreed would activate Eastern\u2019s promise to reduce its operations. Eastern argued that the January 8 negotiation had occurred prior to the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s resolution of claims to immediate repossession lodged against Northeastern\u2019s aircraft by its creditors. In this context, Eastern thought the parties understood that if this attempt to repossess failed, then Northeastern would be in a position to reclaim its slots. If, on the other hand, the claims succeeded, the contract\u2019s condition would be satisfied and Eastern\u2019s right to the extra slots would vest. According to Eastern, this vesting occurred on March 4, 1985, when the Bankruptcy Court ordered repossession.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">Islip agreed that Eastern\u2019s promise to reduce operations would arise only by order of the Bankruptcy Court, but argued that the June 20 order had been sufficient. In Islip\u2019s view, the contractual condition was an open-ended attempt to preserve the Town\u2019s cap on flights, and accordingly <em>any </em>order of the Bankruptcy Court restoring Northeastern\u2019s flight status \u2014 whenever decided \u2014 would activate Eastern\u2019s obligation to cut back on flights. Having heard argument, the district court issued a preliminary injunction on August 9 directing Eastern \u201cto specifically perform its agreement to reduce flights ... on a one for one basis as Northeastern flights are added pursuant to order of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court.\u201d The district court delayed the effective date of the order to September 30, 1985. Eastern appealed the grant of the preliminary injunction and, on October 4, this panel remanded the case for trial of the contract issues within 45 days; we also continued the delay of the injunction\u2019s effectiveness \u201cuntil disposition of this appeal or further order of this court.\u201d Our order further directed the parties to file with our Clerk, on December 3, a written report advising us of the case\u2019s status in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">After expedited discovery, the district court conducted a bench trial on November 4 and 5, 1985. Primarily through the testimony of Aikens, Eastern\u2019s attorney, the airline presented its theory that the oral agreement had provided that Eastern would have to relinquish flight slots only if Northeastern regained its slots at Islip by virtue of a Bankruptcy Court Order stemming from the then-pending repossession claims. Werner, the manager of MacArthur, presented Islip\u2019s contrary view that the agreement had called for one-for-one reduction of Eastern\u2019s flights if Northeast<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>ern should resume flying as a result of <em>any </em>Bankruptcy Court order. After the close of proceedings on November 5, Judge Wex-ler stated \u201cpermanent injunction granted,\u201d and directed that an order be submitted. He then stated: \u201cFor the record, so we are clear, I will come out with findings of fact and conclusions and I will ask the Town to submit findings.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">On the next day, November 6, Northeastern again ceased operations at MacArthur. Eastern, believing that the injunction was no longer effective even under the Town\u2019s prevailing interpretation of the agreement at trial, continued its flights at the airport; Eastern also awaited the Town\u2019s proposed findings, as well as the written order that Judge Wexler had stated would follow his ruling. By November 15, Eastern had received Islip\u2019s proposed findings \u2014 which did not address Northeastern\u2019s discontinued status at Islip \u2014 and accordingly submitted a response by affidavit to Judge Wexler. The affidavit stated objections to the proposals, and also noted Eastern\u2019s view that the permanent injunction should not have any effect because Northeastern\u2019s complete cessation of flights at MacArthur had rendered the action moot at the time it was decided.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Eastern argued that, because there was no longer any \u201cone-for-one\u201d substitution for Eastern to comply with, it need not reduce its flights, and the district court should revise its order accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">On November 18, 1985, Islip responded to Eastern\u2019s papers in a letter to Judge Wexler which for the first time clearly stated Islip\u2019s position that Northeastern\u2019s flight status was irrelevant to Eastern\u2019s obligation to reduce its flights. The letter argued that Eastern should have stopped flying when Northeastern resumed in June, 1985, and therefore that Eastern had, at that point, been divested of its right to the slots. The Town stated that Northeastern\u2019s slots, again vacant, did not belong to Eastern but instead would be filled according to a so-called \u201cInterim Environmental Management Plan.\u201d In a letter to Judge Wexler dated November 19, 1985, Eastern described as \u201cnovel, creative and not supported by [Islip\u2019s] testimony on trial,\u201d the Town\u2019s view that Eastern no longer had any contractual right to the flight slots at MacArthur that Northeastern had vacated. Pending Judge Wexler\u2019s written order, Eastern continued to occupy the flight slots.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">On December 3, 1985, Eastern filed with this court the case status report that we had requested when we delayed the effect of the preliminary injunction. Also on December 3, Judge Wexler entered his written order, supplementing his oral grant of the permanent injunction. Eastern received the order on December 5, and that same day received from Judge Wexler an Order to Show Cause, returnable in the district court on December 10, why the airline should not be held in contempt for failing to cease flights following the oral grant of the permanent injunction. On December 6, Eastern supplemented its December 3 report to this court with the additional filings that had been made in the district court since the preparation of the first report; in its covering letter, Eastern apprised us that it was going to oppose the motion for contempt before the trial court on December 10, and at the same time would move for a stay and clarification of the written order, which it still believed to be ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">Eastern\u2019s motion for a stay and/or modification pointed out that the operative para<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>graph in the written order, which directed the airline to \u201ccease operating two flights daily at Long Island MacArthur Airport in accordance with its agreement with Islip,\u201d did not direct reductions of flights when Northeastern was not operating. Eastern argued \u2014 in support of modification, and in opposition to contempt \u2014 that both sides had assumed all along that, at a minimum, Northeastern would have to be <em>operating </em>at MacArthur before Eastern\u2019s obligation to reduce flights would arise. Eastern pointed out that its view of the \u201cagreement with Islip\u201d was perfectly reasonable in that this \u201cone-for-one\u201d arrangement directly addressed Islip\u2019s goal of maintaining a cap on flights out of MacArthur. Islip countered that Eastern had argued at trial that, assuming the two airlines\u2019 coexistence left the Town within its desired noise limit, then Eastern should not have to reduce flights even if Northeastern added them. Islip argued that, in rejecting this construction of the agreement, Judge Wexler had also \u201cimplicitly rejected\u201d Eastern\u2019s \u201cone-for-one\u201d theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">Judge Wexler denied Eastern\u2019s motions for a stay and for modification and, finding the airline in contempt of the court\u2019s oral and written orders, fined Eastern $1,000 for every flight in violation of the orders from November 5,1985, until December 10. He stated that he would fine Eastern an additional $5,000 for each additional flight, until it obeyed the order by ceasing the impermissible flights altogether. Eastern discontinued the two flights on December 11, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">We vacate this judgment of contempt because we believe that the district court\u2019s oral and written orders both failed to give the airline a clear understanding of what it was legally required to do, and because Eastern made reasonable efforts to seek clarification of the ambiguous orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(d) provides that \u201c[ejvery order granting an injunction ... shall be specific in terms [and] shall describe in reasonable detail ... the act or acts sought to be restrained.\u201d The Supreme Court has noted that Rule 65(d) reflects Congress\u2019 recognition that compliance may require significant \u2014 and occasionally irreparable\u2014 changes in position, and that social harms can result when a party unwittingly transcends the bounds of a vague order. <em>See International Longshoremen\u2019s Ass\u2019n, Local 1291 v. Philadelphia Marine Trade Ass\u2019n, </em>389 U.S. 64, 75-76, 88 S.Ct. 201, 207-08, 19 L.Ed.2d 236 (1967); <em>Sanders v. Air Line Pilots Ass\u2019n International, </em>473 F.2d 244, 247 (2d Cir.1972). Accordingly, before a court may use the contempt power for violation of its injunction, it must be shown that \u201cthe party enjoined [could] ascertain from the four corners of the order precisely what acts are forbidden.\u201d <em>Sanders, supra, </em>473 F.2d at 247; <em>see Longshoremen\u2019s Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>389 U.S. at 76, 88 S.Ct. at 208 (\u201cpotent weapon\u201d of contempt may not be \u201cfounded upon a decree too vague to be understood\u201d); <em>Ford v. Kammerer, </em>450 F.2d 279, 280 (3d Cir.1971) (the \u201clong-standing, salutary rule in contempt cases is that ambiguities and omissions in orders redound to the benefit of the person charged with contempt\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">The district court\u2019s oral ruling of November 5, 1985, stated only \u201cpermanent injunction granted.\u201d Eastern points out that this language was susceptible of several interpretations, when seen in the context of the trial evidence and the subsequent developments at MacArthur Airport. <em>Cf. United States v. Christie Industries, Inc., </em>465 F.2d 1002, 1007 (3d Cir.1972) (language of an injunction must be read in light of surrounding circumstances). The crucial issue at trial was whether <em>any </em>order of the Bankruptcy Court could activate Eastern\u2019s agreement to vacate slots at MacArthur, or whether \u2014 as Eastern argued in vain \u2014 the order had to have been related to the February, 1985, repossession claims. Both parties\u2019 witnesses assumed, however, that before the \u201cone-for-one\u201d reduction agreement took effect it required, at a minimum, that Northeastern actually resume its operations at the airport. According to one very plausible interpretation of the district court\u2019s November 5 order, Eastern was enjoined from any further breaches of its agreement not to occupy, simultaneously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>with Northeastern, the subject flight slots at MacArthur.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">Therefore, when Northeastern suspended all flight operations at MacArthur on the afternoon of November 5, Eastern reasonably believed that it would not violate the injunction to continue operating the two flights. Eastern was provided with no further advice as to the scope of the injunction until the district court filed its written order, on December 3, 1985, which similarly failed to clarify the central ambiguity. The court\u2019s findings of fact specifically noted that the agreement required Eastern to \u201crelinquish its flights on a one-for-one basis\u201d should Northeastern resume its \u201cservice at the Airport.\u201d The decretal paragraphs of the order enjoined Eastern from operating two of its daily flights \u201cin accordance with its agreement with Islip.\u201d In light of the district court\u2019s explicit construction of the agreement, which comported with both parties\u2019 theories at trial, it was not unreasonable for Eastern to believe that the injunction had no effect while Northeastern\u2019s operations were suspended. <em>Cf. H.K. Porter Co., Inc. v. Nat\u2019l Friction Products Corp., </em>568 F.2d 24, 28 (7th Cir. 1977) (Wyzanski, J., sitting by designation) (\u201c[I]t is not enough for enforcement by contempt ... if the decree merely referred to a contract, even though the contract clearly created the legal obligation which warranted the decree.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Eastern\u2019s noncompliance with the oral ruling, therefore, did not stem from its view that the district court had erred or abused its discretion in granting the injunction \u2014 it is well settled that an enjoined party\u2019s objections on the merits, regardless of their validity, would not justify a refusal to follow the injunctive mandate. <em>See United States v. United Mine Workers, </em>330 U.S. 258, 293-94, 67 S.Ct. 677, 696, 91 L.Ed. 884 (1947); <em>Howat v. Kansas, </em>258 U.S. 181, 189-90, 42 S.Ct. 277, 280-81, 66 L.Ed. 550 (1922). Rather, we attribute Eastern\u2019s continued operation of the two flights to the district court\u2019s failure to provide any clear statement of the injunction\u2019s coverage until after the December 10 hearing. <em>See Kammerer, supra, </em>450 F.2d at 280 (ambiguities resolved in favor of one charged with contempt). At that hearing, Islip presented its argument that Northeastern\u2019s flight status was irrelevant to the agreement because Eastern\u2019s rights had been divested by the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s June order. Apparently agreeing, the district court again enjoined the two flights, and held Eastern in contempt for having flown them in purported violation of the November 5 oral ruling. Upon receiving this unambiguous statement of its legal obligation to reduce its schedule regardless of Northeastern\u2019s operative status, Eastern immediately discontinued the two flights at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">Islip argues that, even if Eastern had been ignorant of the scope of the injunction, this ignorance is no defense to a judgment of contempt because Eastern failed to take reasonable steps to obtain clarification of the order. We disagree. It is true that, as we stated in <em>Perfect Fit Industries v. Acme Quilting Co., </em>646 F.2d 800 (2d Cir. 1981), \u201ca party to an action is not permitted to maintain a studied ignorance of the terms of a decree in order to postpone compliance and preclude a finding of contempt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 808. Whereas the enjoined party in <em>Perfect Fit </em>took virtually no steps to obtain a copy of what it knew to be an unfavorable order, however, Eastern here actively sought clarification of the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">When the district court issued its oral ruling on November 5, it stated that, \u201cso we are clear,\u201d a written order would be prepared laying out the findings and conclusions. The court also directed Islip to prepare proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. That same day, however, Northeastern suspended operations, which \u2014 in light of the parties\u2019 trial theories \u2014 caused Eastern justifiable confusion over whether the injunction was effective. Eastern reasonably assumed that Islip, then preparing its proposed findings, would immediately respond to what the airline perceived to be a crucial new development, perhaps by calling to the court\u2019s attention the essentially moot status of the dispute at that time. The airline, therefore, awaiting some imminent action by Islip, made no contacts with, or motions in, the court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>When Eastern received Islip\u2019s proposed order, it discovered that Islip had ignored Northeastern\u2019s suspension at MacArthur, evidently believing it to be irrelevant. Promptly thereafter, on November 15, Eastern\u2019s counsel sent the court an affidavit in opposition to the proposed order arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that Northeastern\u2019s status was at the heart of the agreement and that the dispute had thus been moot at the time of the court\u2019s initial order. Islip responded in a letter to the court, explicitly stating for the first time its view that Northeastern\u2019s discontinued status was irrelevant to Eastern\u2019s obligation to vacate slots at MacArthur.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Eastern, having explained its position to the court, made no further efforts to seek clarification until December 5, when it received the court\u2019s December 3 written order, as well as the order to show cause why the airline should not be held in contempt for having continued the two flights. On December 6, Eastern notified this court by letter that it intended immediately to file a motion for a stay and/or clarification of the court\u2019s order, to be argued on December 10, the same day as the contempt hearing. At that hearing, Eastern finally was unambiguously apprised that it must cease its two flights immediately, despite Northeastern\u2019s continued suspension. It did so the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">In these circumstances, we cannot agree that Eastern attempted to maintain a \u201cstudied ignorance\u201d of the scope of the injunction. On the contrary, as soon as it was aware that Islip was altering its trial theory as a reaction to Northeastern\u2019s discontinuation at MacArthur, Eastern sent the court a lengthy affidavit explaining its position that the injunction had no effect because, among other reasons, it was based on a dispute that no longer existed. Upon receipt of the court\u2019s unfavorable response to its view of the injunction, Eastern immediately moved for stay and/or clarification; when these motions were denied, Eastern complied with the injunction. We believe that Eastern was \u201creasonably diligent and energetic\u201d in attempting to comply with what amounted to a fundamentally ambiguous order. <em>See EEOC v. Local 638, Sheet Metal Worker\u2019s International Ass\u2019n, </em>753 F.2d 1172, 1178 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. granted, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 58, 88 L.Ed.2d 47 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">The judgment of contempt is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"A6\">Islip has made requests for attorneys\u2019 fees on three bases. First, Islip seeks fees to redress Eastern\u2019s purported misconduct in the district court before and through issuance of the permanent injunction, the appeal of which carried our docket no. 85-7995. Second, Islip requests that it be reimbursed for its fees relating to Eastern\u2019s appeal of the grant of the permanent injunction. Third, Islip requests the fees associated with the Town\u2019s prosecution of the contempt order that we have herein vacated, including the cost of defending this appeal, which carries the docket No. 85-9071.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-12\">Islip\u2019s first request for fees is not properly before us. We deny the second request because, although we affirmed the grant of the permanent injunction, we disagree with Islip\u2019s argument that Eastern brought the appeal \u201cvexatiously\u201d or in bad faith. As we have vacated the contempt judgment, we accordingly deny Islip\u2019s third request for the costs of prosecuting the contempt order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b161-7\">. This order of the bankruptcy court was reversed on appeal by the Town in January, 1986.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b162-6\">. On January 7, 1986, we affirmed the permanent injunction and stayed the contempt judgment pending resolution of this expedited appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b162-7\">. Eastern also argued that the permanent injunction could not have any current effect because this court had stayed the injunction \"until disposition of this appeal or further order of this court.\u201d This view was incorrect, however, because our order stayed only the effect of the <em>preliminary </em>injunction; the order could not reasonably have been construed as providing that a subsequent grant of a permanent injunction, after trial upon remand, would be ineffectual until we passed upon it. Because Eastern made no timely request that we clarify our order, its misreading of the order would be no defense to a contempt citation. Nevertheless, we vacate the judgment of contempt for other reasons.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
