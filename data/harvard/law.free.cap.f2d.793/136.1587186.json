KENNEDY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">Plaintiff-appellant, Miriam B. Houck, appeals the order denying her supplemental motion for payment of attorney\u2019s fees in this age discrimination action. Plaintiff-appellant brought the underlying action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (\u201cADEA\u201d), as amended, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 621-634, and included a pendent claim under Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 4101.17, the Ohio Age Discrimination Act. The parties agreed to settle the case on the morning of the scheduled trial. On August 23, 1984, the District Court entered a Consent Decree and Order (\u201cConsent Decree\u201d) which contained the terms of the parties\u2019 settlement agreement. As part of the settlement agreement, Lee Wilson Engineering Company, Inc. (\u201cthe Company\u201d) agreed to pay plaintiff\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. The Consent Decree provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-10\">6. Defendant, Lee Wilson Engineering Company, Inc. shall pay to the plaintiff, Miriam B. Houck, in addition to the payment specified in subparagraph 1 above, a further sum which shall be for the fee of her attorney, Leonard F. Lybarger, which shall be in an amount mutually agreed to by Mr. Lybarger and Mr. Joseph S. Ruggie, Jr., of Thompson, Hi\u00f1e and Flory, counsel for the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-15\">7. In the event counsel for the parties are unable to agree on the amount of the sum to be paid for plaintiff\u2019s attorney fee, counsel for plaintiff, Leonard F. Lybarger, shall submit an application to the Court on or before September 4, 1984 requesting same and setting forth an itemization of his services. In such event counsel for the defendant shall have until October 4, 1984 with which to respond to said application. The Court will thereafter determine the amount of the fee to be paid in accordance with applicable law. The decision of the Court shall be final and the parties waive all rights of appeal and further review of or relief from the Court\u2019s Order regarding same.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-16\">When the parties could not agree on the amount of attorney\u2019s fees, plaintiff\u2019s counsel, Leonard F. Lybarger, filed an application for payment of attorney\u2019s fees in the District Court seeking $57,721.69 in attorney\u2019s fees. The Company filed a response to the application. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel sought and the District Court granted leave to file a reply brief to the Company\u2019s response to the application. Along with the reply brief to the Company\u2019s response, plaintiff\u2019s counsel filed a supplemental motion for payment of attorney\u2019s fees seeking an additional $4,421.25 for legal services rendered in defense of the original application for attorney\u2019s fees. On December 11, 1984, the District Court filed a memorandum and order awarding plaintiff\u2019s counsel $23,390.19 for attorney\u2019s fees as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>(1) 224.5 hours at $100 per hour, for a total of $22,450, minus a twenty percent <em>Hensley </em>adjustment of $4,490, for a total of $17,960 in fees for this substantive work;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-4\">(2) 45.9 hours at $75.00, for a total of $3,442.50, for preparing his fee petition;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-5\">(3) $1,795.19 for out-of-pocket expenses; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-6\">(4) $192.50 for services of his legal assistants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">The District Court\u2019s opinion did not refer to the supplemental application for payment of attorney\u2019s fees for the legal services rendered in defending the original fee application. After plaintiff\u2019s counsel sent the District Court a letter requesting a ruling on the supplemental motion, the District Court denied the motion on January 9,1985 by writing on the first page of the supplemental motion: \u201cMotion for additional fees denied. SO ORDERED.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">This appeal raises two issues: (1) Whether plaintiff waived, in the Consent Decree, her right to appeal the District Court\u2019s order denying the supplemental application for attorney\u2019s fees; and (2) Whether the District Court committed reversible error in summarily denying the supplemental application and not stating reasons for its decision. For the reasons set forth below, we hold that the Consent Decree waived plaintiff\u2019s right to appeal any District Court decision regarding attorney\u2019s fees. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal. Consequently, we need not and do not address the second issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">The Company argues that plaintiff expressly waived, in the Consent Decree, her right to appeal any District Court decision regarding attorney\u2019s fees. The Consent Decree specified that if the parties could not agree on the amount of the attorney\u2019s fees, plaintiff\u2019s counsel would submit an application requesting attorney\u2019s fees and itemizing his services in the District Court. The parties further agreed that the District Court would determine the appropriate amount of the attorney\u2019s fees after the Company had an opportunity to respond to the application. The Consent Decree specifically provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-11\">The decision of the [District] Court shall be final and the parties waive all rights of appeal and further review of or relief from the Court\u2019s Order regarding same.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-12\">Despite this provision that the District Court\u2019s decision regarding the amount of attorney\u2019s fees would be final and nonap-pealable, plaintiff argues that the Consent Decree only prohibits the parties from appealing the District Court\u2019s decision regarding the amount of attorney\u2019s fees incurred in connection with the merits and in the preparation of the original application for payment of attorney\u2019s fees. Plaintiff contends that she did not waive her right to appeal from a District Court decision denying a request for attorney\u2019s fees incurred <em>in defense </em>of the original application for payment of attorney\u2019s fees in the Consent Decree. We refuse to construe the Consent Decree so narrowly.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-13\">In this case, the parties entered into a settlement agreement which expressed a clear intent to end all litigation concerning this age discrimination action. The first page of the Consent Decree states: \u201cWhereas, <em>the parties, being desirous of settling these matters without further litigation, </em>have agreed to the following terms and conditions____\u201d (Emphasis added). Accordingly, when the parties could not agree as to the amount of attorney\u2019s fees, they submitted the matter to the District Court for a final and nonappealable determination. Consequently, we hold that plaintiff waived her right to appeal any District Court decision regarding the amount of attorney\u2019s fees regardless of whether plaintiff\u2019s counsel rendered the legal services in the underlying age discrimination action, in the preparation of the original application for attorney\u2019s fees, or in defense of that application.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-15\">Plaintiff also argues that even if the settlement agreement constitutes a valid waiver of her right to appeal, the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>premised the Consent Decree on the assumption that the District Court would rule in accordance with applicable law and would not act arbitrarily. Plaintiff claims the District Court acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying the supplemental motion for payment of attorney\u2019s fees without stating any reasons for its decision. Even assuming that the District Court acted arbitrarily and capriciously, we hold that plaintiff assumed the risk of an unreviewable decision in agreeing to submit the matter to the District Court for a final and nonappealable decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">In <em>Brown v. Gillette Co., </em>723 F.2d 192 (1st Cir.1983) (per curiam), the First Circuit dismissed Gillette\u2019s appeal from an order awarding damages to the plaintiff under a settlement agreement. The settlement agreement provided that the district court would resolve certain promotion claims and stipulated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-6\">The parties agree that the determination of the [District] Court on such claims shall be final and binding and hereby waive any and all rights of appeal with respect to such determinations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-7\"><em>Id. </em>Notwithstanding the settlement agreement, Gillette argued that it could appeal the damage award because the district court incorrectly interpreted the matter before the court and that the waiver in the settlement agreement did not preclude an appeal from arbitrary decision-making. The First Circuit disagreed and held that the waiver applied. <em>See also Goodsell v. Shea, </em>651 F.2d 765, 767 (C.C.P.A.1981) (citations omitted) (\u201cThe great weight of authority favors enforceability of agreements not to appeal from a decision of a specified tribunal____ Such agreements have been honored by barring appellate review proceedings taken in violation of the agreement.\u201d). Consequently, we hold that plaintiff waived her right to appeal the District Court\u2019s determination regarding the amount of attorney\u2019s fees in the Consent Decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
