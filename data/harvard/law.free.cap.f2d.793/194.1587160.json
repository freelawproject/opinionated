That petition challenges two actions of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA,or agency) taken under authority of Part C of the Safe Drinking Water Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 300h to 300h-4. The statutory source of this court\u2019s jurisdiction to consider WNRC\u2019s petition is found at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300j-7(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-13\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b275-14\">The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA or Act) identifies underground injection wells as a potential source of pollution to our nation\u2019s underground sources of drinking water <em>(ie. </em>aquifers). To protect these sources of drinking water, Congress directed EPA to promulgate regulations governing the adoption of state-enforced underground injection control (UIC) programs. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 300h(a), 300h-l. As a part of these regulations, EPA was directed to establish minimum requirements that must be adopted and implemented by all EPA approved UIC programs. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 300h(b)j 300h-l(b)(l)(A)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-15\">EPA promulgated regulations governing state UIC programs and establishing minimum requirements for these programs in 1980. <em>See </em>45 Fed.Reg. 33,418-513 and 45,-500-12 (1980) (presently codified as amended at 40 C.F.R. Parts 124, 144, 145, and 146). These regulations generally prohibit all new underground injection wells unless authorized by permit. <em>See </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7 144.31. Further, a permit may not be granted where underground injection may cause a violation of any national primary drinking regulation or may otherwise adversely affect human health. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 144.12; <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300h(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-16\">To further assure the protection of our nation\u2019s drinking water, the agency\u2019s UIC regulations included a broad definition of an underground source of drinking water. 45 Fed.Reg. at 33,424. That definition, as last amended in 1982, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-17\"><em>Underground source of drinking water (USDW) </em>means an aquifer or its portion:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-18\">(a)(1) Which supplies any public water system; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-19\">(2) Which contains a sufficient quantity of ground water to supply a public water system; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>(i) Currently supplies drinking water for human consumption; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-4\">(ii) Contains fewer than 10,000 mg/1 total dissolved solids; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-5\">(b) Which is not an exempted aquifer. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 144.3.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Because that definition was sufficiently broad to encompass some aquifers that will never be used as sources of drinking water, EPA, as a corollary, also adopted criteria for identifying exempted aquifers. 45 Fed. Reg. at 45,502. These criteria, last amended in 1982, provide that an aquifer (or a portion of an aquifer) may be exempted if</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-7\">(a) It does not currently serve as a source of drinking water; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-8\">(b) It cannot now and will not in the future serve as a source of drinking water because:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-9\">(1) It is mineral, hydrocarbon or geothermal energy producing, or can be demonstrated by a permit applicant as part of a permit application for a Class II or III operation to contain minerals or hydrocarbons that considering their quantity and location are expected to be commercially producible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-10\">(2) It is situated at a depth or location which makes recovery of water for drinking water purposes economically or technologically impractical;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-11\">(3) It is so contaminated that it would be economically or technologically impractical to render that water fit for human consumption; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-12\">(4) It is located over a Class III well mining area subject to subsidence or catastrophic collapse; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-13\">(c) The total dissolved solids content of the ground water is more than 3,000 and less than 10,000 mg/1 and it is not reasonably expected to supply a public water system.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-14\">40 C.F.R. \u00a7 146.4. The identification of an exempt aquifer may, in certain circumstances, allow the underground injection of contaminants to be permitted where it would otherwise be prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-15\">Before underground injection will be permitted, however, the state, after notice and an opportunity for a public hearing, must itself identify and approve the aquifer exemption. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 144.7(b)(3). That exemption (with one exception inapplicable here) must then be authorized by EPA as a revision to the state\u2019s approved UIC program. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 144.7(b)(3), 145.32. Further, even after an aquifer exemption is approved by EPA, the construction and operation of any underground injection well will be subject to strict controls, <em>see, e.g., id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 144.21\u2014 144.70, 146.1 \u2014 146.52, which will include a continuing prohibition on the movement of any contaminated fluids into nonexempt underground sources of drinking water, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 144.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-17\">Once EPA had promulgated regulations governing state UIC programs, states began to submit applications to EPA seeking approval of their UIC programs. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300h-l(b). To gain EPA approval, a state\u2019s application must demonstrate (1) that the state has adopted and will implement a UIC program consistent with the minimum requirements established by the agency\u2019s regulations; and (2) that the state will keep such records and make such reports as may be required by the agency. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 300h-l(b)(l)(A)(i)-(ii). After a state\u2019s UIC program application is approved by rule, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 300h-l(b)(2), the state retains primary enforcement responsibility (primacy) until EPA by rule determines otherwise. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 300h-l(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-18\">In March of 1982, the State of Nebraska submitted a UIC program application to EPA. The Nebraska UIC program submitted (and as eventually approved) contained a definition of an underground source of drinking water and criteria for identifying an exempt aquifer consistent with the regulations promulgated by the agency. If anything, the state\u2019s definition of an underground source of drinking water was broader than that required by the agency, and its criteria for identifying an exempt aquifer were slightly more restrictive than the criteria adopted by the agency. <em>See </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7 145.11(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-19\">Approximately two years later, on June 12, 1984, the agency, by publication, gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>notice of its approval of the Nebraska UIC program application. 49 Fed.Reg. 24,133 (1984). As required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300h-1(b)(2), the agency\u2019s approval of that program was made by rule and is presently codified at 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.1401. For purposes of judicial review, the regulation approving Nebraska\u2019s UIC program (and the UIC program itself) became effective on June 26, 1984. <em>See </em>49 Fed.Reg. at 24,133; 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.1401.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">Prior to final approval of the Nebraska UIC program, the state, on March 28,1984, submitted a proposed aquifer exemption to EPA for its approval. That proposed revision had not been submitted as part of Nebraska\u2019s original UIC program proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">At the time Nebraska sought approval of the exemption, EPA approval of the overall Nebraska UIC program was already imminent. Rather than further delay final approval of the overall Nebraska UIC program while considering the state\u2019s proposed aquifer exemption, the agency gave final approval to the Nebraska UIC program, allowing Nebraska to achieve primacy. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300h-l(b)(3). The agency then proceeded to review the state\u2019s aquifer exemption request as a proposed revision to Nebraska\u2019s UIC program. <em>See </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 144.7(b)(3), 145.32. Under the circumstances of this case, the agency\u2019s decision to approve the Nebraska UIC program and then consider the proposed exemption in a separate administrative action, even if reviewable, was clearly reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The aquifer exemption requested by Nebraska was for a 3,000 acre portion of an aquifer located near Crawford, Nebraska (Chadron aquifer). That exemption was intended to make possible the granting of an underground injection well permit to Wyoming Fuel Company. In turn, that permit would authorize Wyoming Fuel Company to develop underground injection wells for the subsurface mining of uranium.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">After receiving Nebraska\u2019s request, EPA gave public notice of the request, accepted public comments, and on June 21, 1984, conducted a public hearing at Crawford, Nebraska. After considering all available data and taking into account all public comments, the agency approved a very small portion of the requested aquifer exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">Specifically, rather than approve the 3,000 acre exemption requested, the agency approved only a 6.7 acre exemption. That narrow exemption was further limited to the lower portion of the Chadron aquifer formation. The overlying formations within the 6.7 acre area were not exempted. In granting a limited aquifer exemption, essentially intended to allow the establishment of a research and development area by Wyoming Fuel Company, EPA sought to verify conclusively the validity of its determinations before approving any more extensive aquifer exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">EPA\u2019s approval of the limited 6.7 acre exemption was published on February 7, 1985. 50 Fed.Reg. 5253 (1985). For purposes of judicial review, the agency\u2019s decision was promulgated on February 21, 1985. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">WNRC filed its petition on April 4, 1985. WNRC challenges EPA\u2019s approval of the entire Nebraska UIC program as well as the agency\u2019s separate approval of the 6.7 acre aquifer exemption. Although related, these administrative determinations constituted separate and independent administrative actions and for purposes of judicial review must be treated as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">II. EPA Approval of the Nebraska UIC Program</p>\n<p id=\"b277-13\">WNRC raises numerous challenges to EPA\u2019s approval of the Nebraska UIC program. In response, the agency asserts that WNRC\u2019s contentions are time barred and cannot be considered by this court. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-14\">Under the Safe Drinking Water Act, jurisdiction to review an EPA approved state UIC program is vested exclusively with the various circuit courts of appeal. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 300j-7(a)(2), 300j-8(e). Further, a petition challenging a state UIC program must be filed \u201cwithin the 45-day period beginning\u201d on the day the regulation approving the state UIC program was prom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>ulgated. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 300j-7(a). After that period has expired, contentions that could and should have been timely raised cannot be advanced in any later civil proceeding. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Quite simply, the 45-day time limit of section 300j-7(a), like those found in similar environmental statutes, defines the duration of this court\u2019s jurisdiction, and petitions filed outside the 45-day period cannot be reviewed by this court. <em>See Cerro Copper Products Co. v. Ruckelshaus, </em>766 F.2d 1060, 1069 (7th Cir.1985) (Clean Water Act); <em>Eagle-Picker Industries, Inc. v.

United States Environmental Protection Agency, </em>632 F.2d 863, 865 (10th Cir.1980) (Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 1030, 101 S.Ct. 1740, 68 L.Ed.2d 225 (1981); <em>Homestake Mining Co. v.

Train, </em>532 F.2d 280, 290-91 (2d Cir.1976) (Federal Water Pollution Control Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">This narrow limitation is intended and in fact brings finality to the administrative process and reflects \u201ca deliberate congressional choice to impose statutory finality on agency [action], a choice we may not second-guess.\u201d <em>Eagle-Picker Industries, </em>759 F.2d at 911 (quoting <em>City of Rochester v. Bond, </em>603 F.2d 927, 935 (D.C.Cir.1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">The only statutory exception to this express 45-day limitation is for petitions based \u201csolely on grounds arising after the expiration of such period.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300j-7(a). WNRC places no reliance on that exception. Further, assuming any other exceptions to the strict 45-day limitation of section 300j-7(a) might be recognized in exceptional circumstances, no such circumstance is implicated in this case. <em>See Eagle-Picker Industries, </em>759 F.2d at 911-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">Here, in its June 12, 1984 approval of the Nebraska UIC program, EPA explicitly provided that for purposes of judicial review, the Nebraska UIC program would be promulgated on June 26, 1984. <em>See </em>49 Fed.Reg. 24,133 (1984). On June 26 (as had been equally true on June 12), every procedural and substantive issue now advanced by WNRC was fully ripe and capable of judicial review. In addition, the record before the court clearly demonstrates (1) that WNRC played an active and continuing role both before and after the state\u2019s submission of its proposed UIC program; and (2) that WNRC received actual notice of the agency\u2019s approval of Nebraska\u2019s UIC program no later than July 18, 1984 \u2014 over three weeks prior to the expiration of the 45-day filing period.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">Despite well-defined, purely legal issues, an active role in the overall administrative process, and actual notice of the agency\u2019s approval of the Nebraska UIC program, WNRC failed to seek review of that approval until over nine months after approval was given and long after the 45-day period for review had expired. Because WNRC\u2019s petition was not timely filed, this court has no jurisdiction to review even constitutional challenges to the Nebraska UIC program. <em>See Lloyd A. Fry Roofing Co., </em>554 F.2d at 892. Without question, the 45-day limitation of section 300j-7(a) provided WNRC with a meaningful opportunity to seek review of the agency\u2019s action \u2014 due process requires no more. <em>Id. </em>at 892-93; <em>see also Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>673 F.2d at 406-07.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">III. EPA Approval of a Limited 6.7 Acre Aquifer Exemption</p>\n<p id=\"b278-11\">Before reviewing the merits of EPA\u2019s 6.7 acre aquifer exemption, we address briefly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>two preliminary contentions raised by WNRC. First, WNRC argues the Safe Drinking Water Act does not authorize EPA to grant aquifer exemptions under any circumstances. In advancing that argument, WNRC attacks directly the agency\u2019s authority to promulgate regulations dealing with (1) the identification of exempt aquifers, 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 144.7(b), (2) the substantial and nonsubstantial revision of state UIC programs, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 145.32(b), and (3) the criteria to be applied in determining what may be considered an exempt aquifer, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 146.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">WNRC\u2019s substantive challenge to the agency\u2019s regulations is untimely. At the latest, the regulations challenged by WNRC were last subject to any significant revision in 1982 or 1983. <em>See </em>48 Fed.Reg. 14,207-08 (1983) (minor change to UIC program revision regulation); <em>id. </em>at 14,193 (minor revision to identification of exempt aquifer regulation); 47 Fed.Reg. 4998-99 (1982) (minor revision to criteria for determining exempt aquifer). As with WNRC\u2019s challenge to EPA\u2019s approval of the Nebraska UIC program, WNRC\u2019s challenge to these regulations is barred by the 45-day limitation of section 300j-7(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">However, even if timely, WNRC\u2019s challenge has been raised in the wrong forum. Attacks on the agency\u2019s UIC program regulations, adopted under section 300h of the Safe Drinking Water Act, may not be brought in this court. Rather, they may be brought only in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300j \u2014 7(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">As a second preliminary matter, WNRC challenges the authority of an acting regional administrator to approve the 6.7 acre aquifer exemption. Specifically, WNRC argues the exemption at issue constituted a \u201csubstantial\u201d program revision that could only be approved by regulation prescribed by the EPA administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">As a general rule, under the Safe Drinking Water Act and the agency\u2019s UIC regulations, substantial UIC program revisions will be accompanied by rulemaking and must be approved by the EPA administrator. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 300h-l(b)(4), (d), 300j-9(a)(2); 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 145.32(b)(2), (4). However, under the agency\u2019s regulations, nonsubstantial program revisions need not be accomplished through formal rulemak-ing. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 145.32(b)(4). Further, under certain circumstances, nonsubstantial program revisions not accomplished by rule-making may be approved by an acting regional administrator. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300j~9(a)(2); EPA Delegation Manual 9-[19].</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">In this case, in light of the state\u2019s request for a 3,000 acre aquifer exemption, the agency initially determined the requested program revision to be substantial in nature. Thus, as required by its regulations, notice of the proposed revision was given, a reasonable opportunity for public comment was provided, and a public hearing was held. <em>See </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7 145.32(b)(2). Not only was WNRC active in these proceedings, but the agency\u2019s actions also resulted in a complete and well-developed administrative record.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">After considering all relevant information available to it and after taking into account the various comments received, EPA approved a very small portion of the requested aquifer exemption (6.7 acres). That limited approval, involving a single specific permitting request, was determined to constitute a nonsubstantial rather than a substantial program revision. Thus, formal rulemaking was determined to be unnecessary, and the acting regional administrator could approve the exemption. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300j-9(a)(2); EPA Delegation Manual 9 \u2014 [26].</p>\n<p id=\"b279-11\">The decision of whether a proposed UIC program revision is substantial or non-substantial lies with the agency. Even if reviewable, that decision, made internally and without a hearing, could be reversed only upon a showing that the decision was \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). No such showing has been made by WNRC.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>We turn finally to the substance of EPA\u2019s approval of the 6.7 acre aquifer exemption. WNRC\u2019s challenge to the agency\u2019s approval of that exemption was filed within the 45-day time limit of section 300j-7(a) and thus may be considered by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">As stated, the 6.7 acre aquifer exemption approved by the agency was a nonsubstan-tial program revision that could be approved without formal rulemaking. The parties agree that our review of that action is limited to determining whether the agency\u2019s action was \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A); <em>see Citizens to Preserve Over-ton Park v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 416, 91 S.Ct. 814, 823-24, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971); <em>see also Montgomery County v. United States Environmental Protection Agency, </em>662 F.2d 1040, 1042 (4th Cir.1981) (applying the arbitrary and capricious test under section 300j-7 in a nonrulemaking context).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Review under the arbitrary and capricious standard is quite limited, and this court may not substitute its views for those of the agency.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">Nevertheless, the agency must examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a \u201crational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u201d In reviewing that explanation, we must \u201cconsider whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-7\"><em>Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., </em>463 U.S. 29, 43, 103 S.Ct. 2856, 2866-67, 77 L.Ed.2d 443 (1983) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">We note that WNRC has made no contention that the substantial evidence test should apply in this case. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(E). Arguably, in cases in which the program revision is made by rule after a hearing required by statute, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300h-l(b)(4), that standard may be applicable, <em>see </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(E), and could in some cases lead to a different result. However, even if WNRC had asserted the applicability of the substantial evidence test, our thorough review of the well-developed agency record convinces us that under either standard of review no basis exists for overturning the agency\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">In reaching its decision, EPA properly considered a number of relevant factors. These factors included (1) whether the 6.7 acre area meets the agency\u2019s criteria for exempted aquifers, (2) the various comments received from interested groups and individuals, (3) the impact of the proposed mining project on the environment in general and on surrounding sources of drinking water in particular, (4) the impact of the proposed mining project on human health, (5) restoration of the mining site and removal of contaminants from the exempt aquifer area, and (6) reasonable alternatives to the exemption as well as alternatives to the type of mining proposed by Wyoming Fuel Company. <em>See generally </em>50 Fed.Reg. 5253-59 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">In its decision, the agency initially presented its determination that the 6.7 acre area exempted met the agency\u2019s criteria for classification as an exempt aquifer. <em>See </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7 146.4 (quoted <em>ante </em>at p. 196). First, after examining the data available to it, EPA found no one currently uses the 6.7 acre portion of the aquifer as a source of drinking water. In fact, the agency found that no water wells were currently located within the entire 3,000 acre area proposed by the state in its exemption request. <em>See </em>50 Fed.Reg. at 5253-54; <em>see also </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7 146.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-12\">Second, the agency found the 6.7 acre area to contain uranium and found further that this uranium is expected to be producible commercially. <em>See </em>50 Fed.Reg. at 5254; <em>see also </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7 146.4(b)(1). Coupled with its initial finding, this second determination was sufficient to place the 6.7 acre area within the agency\u2019s definition of an exempt aquifer. EPA, in the alternative, however, also found the 6.7 acre area to be so contaminated by uranium that it would be economically or technologically impractical to render the water in that area fit for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>human consumption. <em>See </em>50 Fed.Reg. at 5254; <em>see also </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7 146.4(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">On the basis of these findings, the agency concluded that the 6.7 acre area met the agency\u2019s criteria for identifying an exempt aquifer. Our review of the record convinces us that the agency\u2019s factual findings are supported by substantial evidence. Further, these findings place the 6.7 acre area within the agency\u2019s criteria for identifying an exempt aquifer, and as a result the agency\u2019s determination that the area meets these criteria is clearly reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">The agency\u2019s determination that the 6.7 acre area of the Chadron aquifer met its exemption requirement did not end the agency\u2019s inquiry. Rather, as was appropriate under the circumstances, a number of other factors were considered and a number of other findings were made by EPA. First, the agency found that no significant adverse impact on human health or on the environment as a whole (including surrounding sources of water) would result from the limited 6.7 acre exemption. 50 Fed.Reg. at 5255-57. The agency also concluded that the type of mining to be made possible by the limited exemption would enhance the long-term productivity of the uranium field while not adversely affecting the long-term productivity of the area as a whole. <em>Id. </em>at 5257-58. Our review of the record again convinces us these findings, which flow from a reasoned exercise of the agency\u2019s particular expertise in the area of environmental safety, are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Based on these further findings, which involved those factors relevant to the agency\u2019s decision under the circumstances of this case, the agency granted a limited exemption primarily intended to allow the establishment of a research and development project. Further, as a part of its approval, the agency emphasized the exacting protective and restorative measures required to be implemented under the terms of the Wyoming Fuel Company permit. Finally, the agency emphasized that once the project was fully developed and more complete data available, a decision on any further exemption could then be made. In taking this action, the agency acted with reasoned caution and well within the scope of its permissible discretion. Thus, finding no basis on which to overturn the agency\u2019s determination, we reject WNRC\u2019s challenge to the 6.7 acre aquifer exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">IV. Conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">WNRC\u2019s challenge to EPA\u2019s approval of the Nebraska UIC program is dismissed as untimely. Further, WNRC\u2019s challenge to certain regulations promulgated by the agency is dismissed as untimely and as brought in the wrong forum. Finally, because the agency\u2019s action was supported by substantial evidence and was neither arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, nor otherwise contrary to law, WNRC\u2019s procedural and substantive challenges to the agency\u2019s approval of the 6.7 acre aquifer exemption are rejected.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
