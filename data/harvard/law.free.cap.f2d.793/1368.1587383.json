The Act, among other things, was designed to assure democracy in union affairs. It prescribes certain substantive and procedural rules with which union elections must comply. The Act vests the Secretary of Labor with exclusive authority to bring suit to set aside invalid union elections. Here, after a contested union election, members of the Brotherhood of Railway, Airline, &amp; Steamship Clerks, Freight Handlers, Express &amp; Station Employees (BRAC) filed a complaint with the Secretary. The Secretary declined to bring suit to set aside the election. <em>See </em>Secretary of Labor, Statement of Reasons for Denying the Complaints of Charles E. Shelley, Robert J. Devlin and J.J. Witmeyer Regarding the Election Conducted by [BRAC] (\u201cFirst Statement\u201d); Secretary of Labor, Statement of -Reasons for Dismissing the Complaints of Charles E. Shelley, Robert J. Devlin and J.J. Wit-meyer Concerning the Election Conducted by [BRAC] (\u201cSecond Statement\u201d). BRAC members then sought a writ of mandamus in the district court to compel the Secretary to sue. The district court found the Secretary\u2019s decision not to sue was neither arbitrary nor capricious and refused to issue the writ. <em>See Shelley v. Donovan, </em>No. 84-2454, mem. op. (D.D.C. May 13, 1985) (appellee Brock has been substituted for former Secretary Donovan). Because we find that the Secretary did not adequately explain his decision not to bring suit, we reverse the district court with instructions to remand the matter to the Secretary for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-13\">The LMRDA was designed to put an end to \u201cshocking abuses\u201d in the process by which labor unions govern themselves, S.Rep.

Local 6, </em>747 F.2d at 714.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-16\">BRAC held an election in 1983. Just before the election took place, a split developed in the union\u2019s leadership and an insurgent slate emerged. Nevertheless, the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1372\">*1372</page-number>cumbent president and his slate won. Plaintiffs, members of BRAC, believe that improprieties occurred during the election. Plaintiffs have three principal complaints about the conduct of BRAC\u2019s election. <em>See </em>Complaint, <em>Shelley v. Donovan, </em>No. 84-2454, mem. op. (D.D.C. May 13, 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-4\">First, plaintiffs believe that the treatment of retired union members during the election was improper. BRAC\u2019s elections are run in a way similar to political conventions. Locals and other union units select delegates to attend the union\u2019s convention. These delegates, in turn, participate in the election of union officers at the convention. Retired members, although they retain their local affiliation, were not allowed to participate in the selection of their local\u2019s convention delegate. Despite this, the union calculated the voting weight to be assigned each local at the convention based on the local\u2019s roster of both active members and retirees. Plaintiffs claim that these two practices were improper and violated the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-5\">Second, to enable union locals with only a small number of members to vote at the convention, BRAC \u201cassigned\u201d members to those locals. These shifts gave smaller locals the 150 members that BRAC rules require for convention representation. <em>See </em>First Statement at 2-3. Plaintiffs believe that this practice was improper. Third, plaintiffs alleged that the incumbent slate improperly used union funds and facilities in aid of its election campaign.</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-6\">Based on these allegations, plaintiffs unsuccessfully protested the result of the election to the Union\u2019s Executive Council. Subsequently, pursuant to section 402 of the LMRDA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 482, plaintiffs filed a complaint with the Secretary of Labor. The Secretary of Labor investigated the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations, but declined to bring a civil action to set aside the election. <em>See </em>First Statement; Second Statement. After the Secretary\u2019s decision not to sue the union, plaintiffs sought a writ of mandamus in the district court to compel the Secretary to sue. The district court determined, however, that the Secretary\u2019s decision not to sue was proper and granted summary judgment to Secretary Brock. <em>See Shelley v. Donovan, supra. </em>This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-9\">The standard by which the courts are to review the Secretary of Labor\u2019s decisions under the LMRDA is quite deferential. In <em>Dunlop v. Bachowski, 421 </em>U.S. 560, 95 S.Ct. 1851, 44 L.Ed.2d 377 (1975), the Court explained that in enacting section 482,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1450-10\">Congress \u201cdecided to utilize the special knowledge and discretion of the Secretary of Labor in order best to serve the public interest ... [and] decided not to permit individuals to block or delay union elections by filing federal-court suits____\u201d ... \u201cCongress made suit by the Secretary the exclusive post-election remedy for two principal reasons: (1) to protect unions from frivolous litigation and unnecessary judicial interference with their elections, and (2) to centralize in a single proceeding such litigation as might be warranted____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1450-14\"><em>Id </em>at 568-69, 95 S.Ct. at 1858-59 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-15\">The Court noted that \u201cthe statute relies upon the special knowledge and discretion of the Secretary for the determination of both the probable violation and the probable effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 571, 95 S.Ct. at 1860. The Court held that \u201cto enable the reviewing court intelligently to review the Secretary\u2019s determination, the Secretary must provide the court and the complaining witness with copies of a statement of reasons supporting his determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 571, 95 S.Ct. at 1860. Only when the statement of reasons offered by the Secretary, <em>\u201cwithout more, </em>evinces that [his] decision is so irrational as to constitute the decision arbitrary and capricious\u201d is it appropriate to consider overriding the Secretary\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>at 573, 95 S.Ct. at 1860 (emphasis added). Thus, \u201c[e]xcept in what must be the rare case,\u201d the reviewing court may consider only the statement of reasons itself. <em>Id. </em>at 572, 95 S.Ct. at 1860. \u201c \u2018If ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1373\">*1373</page-number>the Court concludes ... there is a rational and defensible basis [stated in the reasons statement] for [the Secretary\u2019s] determination, then that should be an end of this matter, for it is not the function of the Court to determine whether or not the case should be brought or what its outcome would be.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 573, 95 S.Ct. at 1860 <em>(iquoting DeVito v. Shultz, </em>72 L.R.R.M. (BNA) 2682, 2683 (D.D.C.1969)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-4\">The Court also made clear that although \u00a7 482 by its terms only leaves the Secretary discretion to determine if a violation has taken place, the Secretary is also impliedly given discretion to decline to bring suit if he does not believe the violation \u201c \u2018probably infected the challenged election.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 570, 95 S.Ct. at 1859 <em>(quoting Wirtz v. Local 153, Glass Bottle Blowers Ass\u2019n, </em>389 U.S. 463, 472, 88 S.Ct. 643, 648, 19 L.Ed.2d 705 (1968)). However, despite the narrowness of review under \u00a7 482, the Court made clear that <em>some </em>review is appropriate and that \u201cthere is no merit in the Secretary\u2019s contention that his decision is an unreviewable exercise of prosecutorial discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 567 n. 7, 95 S.Ct. at 1858 n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-5\">Although the district court here cited <em>Dunlop, </em>it also stated that \u201cthe Secretary has broad prosecutorial discretion, subject to only limited judicial review, in deciding whether to act on a union members\u2019 complaint.\u201d This was error. The Secretary\u2019s discretion is broad, but it cannot be equated with the prosecutorial discretion of a United States Attorney; the Secretary must justify the exercise of his discretion by specific reference to the terms of the authority vested in him by the Act. While we disagree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that the Secretary\u2019s action was adequately justified, the tenor of its review was in fact correct. We wish only to clarify that the appropriate standard, and, as far as we can tell, the standard applied here, is less deferential than that of prose-cutorial discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-6\">It should also be noted that no tension exists here with the Supreme Court\u2019s recognition that certain enforcement decisions are not subject to judicial review. In <em>Heckler v. Chaney, </em>470 U.S. 821, 105 S.Ct. 1649, 84 L.Ed.2d 714 (1985), the Court said the following about <em>Dunlop:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1451-8\"><em>Dunlop </em>is thus consistent with a general presumption of unreviewability of decisions not to enforce. The statute being administered [in <em>Dunlop </em>] quite clearly withdrew discretion from the agency and provided guidelines for exercise of its enforcement power.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1451-9\"><em>Id. </em>105 S.Ct. at 1657. Thus, <em>Dunlop </em>and <em>Heckler </em>establish that review of the Secretary\u2019s decision under the LMRDA is not barred by the Administrative Procedure Act. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a)(2). Finally, we note that \u201cwhen a legal challenge focuses on an announcement of a substantive statutory interpretation, courts are emphatically qualified to decide whether an agency has acted outside of the bounds of reason.\u201d <em>International Union, United Automobile Workers v. Brock, </em>783 F.2d 237, 245 (D.C. Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-10\">We turn now to an examination of the Secretary\u2019s decision not to sue and the district court\u2019s ratification of that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-13\">With respect to the transfer of union members, the Secretary said the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aebf\">Because of the possibilities for abuse inherent in such a procedure, this matter constitutes the most serious of the investigative findings of the Secretary of Labor concerning the subject election, and the Secretary of Labor does not condone this practice of transferring members for this purpose. However, upon careful consideration of the equities and all of the circumstances ..., it is determined that the Secretary of Labor on this occasion should exercise his discretion to decline to bring an action under section 402 of the Act to set aside the subject election.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1451-14\">The following are factors taken into consideration ...[:] The transfer of members in this instance appears to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1374\">*1374</page-number>been in accordance with past practice of long standing in BRAC. The investigation disclosed insufficient evidence to support the conclusion that the transfers of members were carried out for the purpose of manipulating the election to the disadvantage of the opposition candi-dates____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1452-4\">Also weighed in the balance to determine whether it would be appropriate to bring an enforcement action in this instance is the fact that the union has acknowledged the possibility that the practice ... is subject to abuse. The union has indicated a willingness to take steps to avoid any further use of these procedures.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1452-5\">First Statement at 3-4. The Secretary went on to note that prosecuting this action would be difficult and involve a \u201cvery significant expenditure of the finite resources of the Department____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-6\">We find the Secretary\u2019s statement inadequate. Although the Secretary says that he \u201cdoes not condone\u201d the member-shifting that plaintiffs complain of, he does not say whether the LMRDA was violated. The Secretary is not charged with announcing his feelings about union elections. Rather, the Secretary is obligated to examine union elections and determine if they fall foul of the Act\u2019s dictates. On remand the Secretary must do that with respect to this election.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-7\">If the Secretary should conclude that this election did not comply with the LMRDA, he would then have discretion to decline to bring suit if, in his expert opinion, the violations involved did not \u201cprobably infect[] the challenged election.\u201d <em>See Wirtz v. Local 153, Glass Bottle Blowers Ass\u2019n, </em>389 U.S. 463, 472, 88 S.Ct. 643, 649, 19 L.Ed.2d 705 (1968); <em>Dunlop v. Bachowski, supra. </em>The Secretary\u2019s current statement is inadequate in this regard as well. We cannot say with confidence that the Secretary in fact applied the statutory standard to his determination. The Secretary\u2019s statements deal more with the complications of setting aside an election than with Congress\u2019 command to insure trade-union democracy. Should the Secretary find that the challenged practices were improper, his conclusion as to whether they infected the election must be clearly stated. The hodge-podge of considerations listed by the Secretary simply do not allow us to conduct even the deferential review that the Act requires. In administering the LMRDA, \u201c \u2018it is necessary ... to delineate and make explicit the basis upon which disciplinary action is taken, particularly in a case ... where the decision taken consists of a failure to act after the finding of union election irregularities.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dunlop v. Bachow-ski, </em>421 U.S. at 571-72, 95 S.Ct. at 1860 <em>(quoting DeVito v. Shultz, </em>300 F.Supp. 381, 383 (D.D.C.1969)). Should the Secretary find a violation but decide not to bring suit, he must provide an explanation for his decision that is both clear and founded on grounds permitted by the statute or the case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-10\">Because plaintiffs make an erroneous argument about the scope of the Secretary\u2019s discretion not to sue, we pause to clarify the nature and extent of that discretion. If the Secretary does elect to sue under the LMRDA, the Act specifies that if a violation \u201cmay have affected the outcome of an election,\u201d the court will set aside the election. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 482(c)(2). The plaintiffs assert that this section of the statute has a precise and mathematical meaning. They claim that if the total number of infected votes, if they were shifted to the election\u2019s loser, would be enough to change the election\u2019s outcome, then the election must be set aside by a court. That is, when the Secretary does sue to set aside an election, plaintiffs believe the election must be set aside if there is a statistical possibility a new election would yield a different result. Plaintiffs analogize that the Secretary must apply a similar mathematical standard in exercising the discretion granted him by <em>Wirtz v. Bottle Blowers </em>and <em>Dunlop v. Bachowski </em>to sue only when he believes the violation affected the election\u2019s outcome. That is, plaintiffs ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1375\">*1375</page-number>gue that the Secretary must sue if the number of tainted votes would have been enough to swing the election. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-4\">Plaintiffs cite <em>Wirtz v. Hotel, Motel &amp; Club Employees Union, Local 6, </em>391 U.S. 492, 88 S.Ct. 1743, 20 L.Ed.2d 763 (1968), for support. In that case the Court held that \u201ca proved violation of \u00a7 401 [of the LMRDA has] the effect of establishing a prima facie case that the violation \u2018may have affected\u2019 the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 506-07, 88 S.Ct. at 1752. Plaintiffs assert that when the number of votes affected would have been enough to swing the election, the prima facie case becomes irrebutable. We need not decide whether the plaintiffs\u2019 argument is correct in the context of an actual suit under the LMRDA. We hold, however, that plaintiffs are incorrect to extend their reasoning to the Secretary\u2019s decision whether to bring suit. The discretion given the Secretary by <em>Wirtz v. Bottle Blowers </em>and <em>Dunlop v. Bachowski </em>to bring suit only when he believes the alleged violation \u201cprobably infected the challenged election\u201d would amount to little if he were allowed only to ascertain the number of potentially affected votes and determine whether, if all recast for the loser, the election\u2019s outcome might have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-5\">The senseless consequences of plaintiffs\u2019 contentions are easily illustrated. Suppose a union violates the LMRDA by conducting an election five years and a day after the next previous election, but that in all other respects the election was proper and in compliance with the Act. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 481(a). Or suppose that a union constitution required all election ballots to be printed on yellow paper, but through an inadvertent error, all the ballots were printed on pink paper. This would be a violation of the Act. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 481(f). In both of these hypothetical cases, all the votes cast would be tainted and challenged; if they were recast the election\u2019s outcome might be changed. It would be ludicrous, however, to require the Secretary to sue to set aside the election in these cases. Nothing in precedent or policy suggests that the Secretary\u2019s discretion not to sue does not extend to circumstances where a technical violation has occurred, but he has no reason to believe that the election\u2019s outcome was affected. <em>See Wirtz v. Bottle Blowers, </em>463 U.S. at 473-74, 88 S.Ct. at 649-50; <em>cf. Donovan v. Local 6, Washington Teachers\u2019 Union, </em>747 F.2d at 719 (\u201cperfunctory and cryptic suggestion that such interference could not have affected the election\u2019s outcome\u201d inadequate to justify Secretary\u2019s decision not to sue).</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-8\">As the Secretary reconsiders this matter, we think it important to make clear that some of the \u201cfactors\u201d relied on by him in his decision not to sue here are clearly improper. The Secretary\u2019s consideration of the limited resources available to him, for instance, is entirely inappropriate. We are aware of the difficulty the executive branch may have in allocating its scarce resources to the many tasks it is called on to perform. However, Congress has directed the Secretary that he may not decline to bring suit unless he finds either that there was no violation of the statute or that the violation in question did not infect the challenged election. Notwithstanding budgetary exigencies, the Secretary does not have the same discretion to decline to seek the statutory remedies under the LMRDA that a prosecuting attorney has under the criminal laws. Similarly, a promise by the union that it will not repeat any violations does not suffice under the Act to excuse the Secretary from his duty to sue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-9\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-10\">Despite the inadequacy of the Secretary\u2019s statement, we have little difficulty in affirming the district court\u2019s conclusion that a writ of mandamus is inappropriate. <em>Dunlop v. Bachowski </em>makes clear that \u201c[w]here the [Secretary\u2019s] statement inadequately discloses his reasons, the Secretary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1376\">*1376</page-number>may be afforded opportunity to supplement his statement.\u201d 421 U.S. at 574, 95 S.Ct. at. <em>Dunlop </em>is explicit that only in the exceptional case <em>might </em>it be appropriate for a court to order the Secretary to sue. However, whether a court in fact has this power was left undecided by <em>Dunlop. See id. </em>at 574-76, 95 S.Ct. at 1861-62. In any event, there is no cause to resolve this question here. With respect to BRAC\u2019s member-shifting, the Secretary should be given another opportunity to apply the statutory standards rather than his personal balancing test and decide whether to sue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-5\">As noted above, the plaintiffs also argue that the Secretary was wrong to conclude that it was permissible under the Act to exclude retirees from representation in the union elections. <em>See </em>Second Statement at 1. The plaintiffs further argue that even if the exclusion of retirees from the selection of delegates was proper, it was wrong to nonetheless count their membership in the union\u2019s locals for the purpose of weighting the delegates\u2019 votes. <em>See </em>First Statement at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-6\">The Secretary based his conclusion that retirees were not improperly excluded from the union election on 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 452.93, a Labor Department regulation interpreting the LMRDA. <em>See </em>Second Statement at 1; First Statement at 2. Section 452.93 states that it is permissible for unions to restrict the right of retirees to vote. In other words, the section provides that excluding retirees from union elections does not violate the Act\u2019s command that \u201c[e]very member of a labor organization shall have equal rights ... to vote in elections ... subject to reasonable rules and regulations____\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-9\">In light of the special deference accorded the Secretary in this area by <em>Dunlop v. Bachowski, </em>and the general principles of deference to agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes announced by the Supreme Court in <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837,104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984), we do not believe that \u00a7 452.93 is an impermissible interpretation of the Act. The standard laid out in \u00a7 411 is flexible and calls for the exercise of judgment and expertise. While we do not think that any interpretive regulation the Secretary might promulgate that dealt with \u00a7 411 would necessarily be proper, the regulation here is reasonable. The Supreme Court has recognized that retirees are not \u201cemployees\u201d for all labor law purposes. <em>See Allied Chemical &amp; Alkali Workers of America, Local 1 v. Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co., </em>404 U.S. 157, 164-71, 92 S.Ct. 383, 389-93, 30 L.Ed.2d 341 (1971). The primary purpose of a union is the representation of employees. Allowing unions to exclude non-employee members from elections can be perfectly sensible and proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-11\">The supposedly analogous cases cited by the plaintiffs do not support the conclusions that retirees, a class that has interests quite different from those of working union members, may not be accorded lesser status in union elections. The examples cited by the plaintiffs are instances where union members whose substantive positions within the union were identical were improperly disenfranchised by essentially procedural requirements. For instance, in <em>Local SIt-89, United Steelworkers of Amer-ica v. Usery, </em>429 U.S. 305, 97 S.Ct. 611, 50 L.Ed.2d 502 (1977), the Court reviewed the Secretary\u2019s challenge to a union meeting-attendance rule that disqualified 96.5% of a local\u2019s members from holding union office. The Court held that the rule violated the LMRDA. Similarly, in <em>Wirtz v. Hotel, Motel &amp; Club Employees Union, supra, </em>the Court held that a union rule limiting eligibility for certain elective offices to union members who had previously held elective office violated the LMRDA. Even a cursory examination of these cases demonstrates how far removed they are from the practice challenged here. Moreover, in both cases the Court <em>agreed </em>with the Secretary that a union rule restricting eligibility for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1377\">*1377</page-number>elective office was improper under the LMRDA. Given the Secretary\u2019s status as primary arbiter of the Act\u2019s meaning, such a decision is quite different from invalidating the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of the Act under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-4\">The Secretary further concluded that it was proper to count retired members of each local \u201cas part of the local membership for purposes of determining the local\u2019s delegate representation at the Convention.\u201d First Statement at 2. We agree that this conclusion was also reasonable and adequately explained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-5\">In announcing his conclusion, the Secretary said that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1455-6\">\"Under the specific circumstances of this case, the inclusion of retirees as part of each local\u2019s membership for th[e] purpose [of vote weighting] does not appear to constitute a violation of the Act. The BRAC retirees pay dues and otherwise are considered members in good standing. The Department of Labor has consistently taken the position that unions may restrict the right of retired members to vote in union elections. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 452.93. However, the Act does not limit the representation of the interests of such members by the delegates from their locals where retired members do not have the right to vote, and therefore the union may choose to count retired members for purposes of determining delegation representation. Furthermore, the Supreme Court has pointed out that in prescribing the provisions of Title IV for the Act, Congress\u2019 model of democratic elections was political elections in this country. <em>Wirtz v. Hotel, Motel and Club Employees Union, Local 6, </em>391 U.S. 492, 502, 88 S.Ct. 1743, 1749, 20 L.Ed.2d 763 (1968). In this regard, it may be noted that for purposes of determining apportionment of members of the United States House of Representatives, persons in addition to registered voters are counted____ <em>See also, Sharron v. Brown, </em>447 F.2d 94 (2d Cir. 1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>405 U.S. 96[8], 92 S.Ct. 1511, 31 L.Ed.2d 243.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1455-11\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-12\">While the arrangement used by BRAC for including retirees in its elections may not be perfect, the Secretary\u2019s statement adequately explains why it is a permissible accommodation of the retirees\u2019 diminished but not non-existent interest in union affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-13\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-14\">Finally, we address plaintiffs\u2019 complaint about the expenditure of union funds and resources for electioneering by the incumbent slate. <em>See </em>First Statement at 1-2. The Secretary found \u201csimilar violations of [the Act] by the opposition slate____ As a result of widespread violations of ... the Act ... by both slates, the Department is unable to conclude that the violations had any actual effect on the outcome of the election.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Secretary\u2019s determination was a reasonable exercise of the expert discretion entrusted to him. We note, however, that the Secretary\u2019s statement bordered on the incorrect when it stated that \u201cthe Department is unable to conclude that the violations had any actual effect on the outcome of the election.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2. Given the nature of the discretion entrusted to the Secretary by <em>Dunlop v. Bachowski </em>it would be far better to conclude explicitly that a violation probably <em>did not </em>have an effect on the election than to assert that no conclusion is possible. The statement here, however, read as a whole, indicates that the Secretary did not believe that the violations affected the election\u2019s outcome, however inelegant his prose.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-16\">* \u25a0 * $ ?j&lt; # 9k</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-17\">Congress struggled hard to find an appropriate balance between the protection of union members\u2019 electoral rights and the avoidance of court supervision of the electoral process. It fashioned a statute that gives the Secretary broad, but not unbridled, discretion to review trade union elections to determine their conformity to statutory and democratic principles. While the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1378\">*1378</page-number>Secretary is the primary umpire, however, Congress did not put his decisions beyond review and necessity of explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-4\">Despite the substantial deference that is due the Secretary\u2019s determinations under the LMRDA, his decisions here with respect to the challenged practice of member-shifting and the impact on the election of such a practice simply do not state a conclusion to which we can defer. Accordingly, the decision of the district court is reversed and the cause remanded for the district court to remand it to the Secretary with instructions to reconsider the matter and clearly explain the basis for his determination not to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-6\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
