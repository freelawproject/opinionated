Upon consideration of the foregoing, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">ORDERED, by the Court <em>en banc, </em>that appellee\u2019s suggestion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">Separate statements of Circuit Judge GINSBURG, and Senior Circuit Judge Mac-KINNON are attached.</p>\n<author id=\"b461-10\">GINSBURG, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">The court\u2019s opinion in <em>Browning v. Clerk, U.S. House of Representatives, </em>789 F.2d 923 (D.C.Cir.1986), preserves this circuit\u2019s prior decision in <em>Walker v. Jones, </em>733 F.2d 923 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 512, 83 L.Ed.2d 402 (1984), but is inconsistent with the views expressed by the original Fifth Circuit panel in <em>Davis v. Passman, </em>544 F.2d 865, 880 (5th Cir.1977), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>571 F.2d 793 (5th Cir.1978) (en banc), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>442 U.S. 228, 99 S.Ct. 2264, 60 L.Ed.2d 846 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-14\"><em>Walker </em>held Speech or Debate Clause immunity inapplicable to personnel decisions about jobs \u2014 for example, managing food services \u2014 \u201centailpng] no function relating to the process of making laws.\u201d <em>Walker, </em>733 F.2d at 930-31; <em>see Browning, </em>at 927-28, 930. <em>Walker </em>left open two broader issues. (1) Does Speech or Debate Clause immunity apply at all to decisions to dismiss persons employed by the legislative branch? (2) If the immunity does apply in at least some cases, is it limited to jobs with a \u201cmeaningful input\u201d into legislative decision-making? These questions, which <em>Walker </em>reserved \u201cfor another day and case,\u201d 733 F.2d at 930, are decided in <em>Browning. </em>The answers <em>Browning </em>supplies are: (1) Speech or Debate Clause immunity does apply to legislative branch personnel decisions; (2) the immunity is <em>not </em>limited to cases in which the employee\u2019s work \u201cinforms or influences the shaping of our nation\u2019s laws.\u201d <em>See Walker, </em>733 F.2d at 931. Rather, Speech or Debate Clause immunity, <em>Browning </em>holds, covers personnel decisions regarding any employee whose duties are \u201cdirectly related to the due functioning of the legislative process,\u201d for example, recording and transcribing committee hearings. <em>Browning, </em>at 929 (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-16\">Eminent colleagues in the Fifth Circuit, Judges Goldberg and Brown, entertained a different view of the questions left open in <em>Walker </em>and closed in <em>Browning. </em>It was their position, stated by Judge Goldberg, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-17\">[w]hen members of Congress dismiss employees they are neither legislating nor formulating legislation. The fear of judicial inquiry into dismissal decisions cannot possibly affect a legislator\u2019s decisions on matters pending before Congress. The democratic process remains unfettered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-18\"><em>Davis v. Passman, </em>544 F.2d at 880.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-19\">While I do not call for en banc rehearing of <em>Browning </em>in this circuit, I believe the different views held by federal judges on congressional immunity from suit for alleged employment discrimination indicate the need for further enlightenment from Higher Authority.</p>\n<author id=\"b461-20\">MacKINNON, Senior Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b461-21\">A congressional reporter transcribing a hearing involving organized crime, where the testimony will be closely scrutinized by the Congress and possibly by courts for perjury, is working in an area that \u201cinfluences the shaping of our nation\u2019s laws[,]\u201d <em>Walker v. Jones, </em>733 F.2d 923, 931 (D.C. Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 512, 83 L.Ed.2d 402 (1984). Assuring accurate testimony in such an important field is <em>\u201cdirectly related to the due functioning of the legislative </em>process____\u201d <em>Browning </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number><em>v. Clerk, U.S. House of Representatives, </em>789 F.2d 923, 929 (D.C.Cir.1986), (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">The fact that the court in <em>Davis v. Pass-man, </em>544 F.2d 865, 880 (5th Cir.1977), added some broad language that went beyond the facts of the case they were deciding does not create any dicta that is troublesome for this court. It merely did not reach some of the major matters that are critically important to congressional action, i.e., a correct transcript of important Committee investigative hearings upon which Congress might act to legislate or recommend prosecution for perjury.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
