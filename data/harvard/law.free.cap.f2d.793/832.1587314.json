We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-11\">On February 22, 1981, the plaintiff, Dr. Adib Zaky, was employed as a cardiologist at the Veteran\u2019s Administration Medical Center at Fort Wayne, Indiana, pursuant to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4104 and 4106. Dr. Zaky was appointed for a two year probationary period, as provided in \u00a7 4106. Dr. Zaky\u2019s work was to be reviewed by a Professional Standards Board (\u201cPSB\u201d) during the probationary period and Dr. Zaky was subject to separation if the Board found that he was \u201cnot fully qualified and satisfactory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b911-12\">On November 30, 1981, during Dr. Zaky\u2019s first year of probationary employment, a patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (\u201cICU\u201d) as an emergency with severe bradycardia (slow heart beat). Although Dr. Zaky successfully \u201cpaced\u201d the patient\u2019s heart by inserting a temporary pacing electrode, the patient remained unresponsive. Dr. Zaky concluded that the bradycardia was symptomatic of another serious medical problem and instructed the nurses to ask the internist to whom the patient was assigned to see the patient without delay and left the ICU. According to Zaky, \u201cthe Chief of Service [Dr. Venka-tachala] accused me of abandoning this patient during a meeting at the Medical Service on December 1, 1981.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b911-14\">On December 3, 1981, some two days later, Dr. Zaky wrote a memorandum to Dr. Haan, the Chief of Medical Service and Dr. Venkatachala\u2019s supervisor, pointing out deficiencies in the resuscitation procedures in the ICU and suggesting that the Medical Center: (1) \u201cstart a regular, ongoing in-service drills involving simulated, cardiac emergencies, in particular, potentially fatal arrythmias;\u201d and (2) \u201cdiscuss and review each real live resuscitation procedure in CPR committee meetings.\u201d Zaky alleged in the memorandum that he had made these suggestions on numerous occasions, but neither suggestion had been implemented.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-15\">The record reveals that following the incident with the bradycardia patient and Dr. Zaky\u2019s letter to Dr. Haan, Dr. Zaky experienced difficulty in his relations with the Medical Center staff. Dr. Zaky failed to attend ICU rounds from January 11, 1982, to March 17, 1982 because, in his opinion, the rounds had \u201cdegenerate[d] into personal criticisms that serve no beneficial medical purpose.\u201d Dr. Zaky specifically complained that \u201con January 8, 1982, ... I was personally insulted, and my medical education was questioned.\u201d When he resumed attending rounds in March, he stood at a distance from the other physicians and seemed to be unable to hear their discussion. If asked a question, he would ask that the question be repeated and would then request that the treating physicians repeat their earlier discussions concerning the patient\u2019s condition and problems before replying. The other physicians responded to this treatment by walking out of the room when Dr. Zaky presented his patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-16\">Furthermore, Dr. Zaky experienced difficulty in cooperating with other physicians and surgeons in his operation of the cardiac <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>lab. In early 1981, Dr. Zaky learned that the hospital was considering the appointment of an internist with expertise in the field of cardiology to the facility and accused Dr. Haan of \u201cmaking plans to replace him.\u201d He objected to the hospital\u2019s granting cardiac privileges to another physician, a Dr. Krishnamoorthy, without consulting Dr. Zaky. When informed that Dr. Krishnamoorthy would receive privileges despite his protest, Dr. Zaky wrote a memorandum suggesting as a \u201csolution\u201d that Dr. Krishnamoorthy \u201cunderstand ... he cannot exercise these privileges in defiance to the legitimate cardiologist or with disregard to his expressed opinion.\u201d On another occasion, Dr. Zaky allegedly exclaimed to a patient, \u201cwho is the damn doctor asking for a stress test on you? He must be a nut.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">Official charges concerning Dr. Zaky\u2019s work at the Center, such as the incident involving the patient with bradycardia and his failure to attend rounds, were filed on December 1, 1981; March 15, 1982; April 9, 1982; and July 13, 1982. Dr. Zaky responded on each occasion with either a memorandum or an attempt to initiate a grievance proceeding. Dr. Zaky rejected the Veteran\u2019s Administration\u2019s attempt to have Zaky\u2019s supervisor counsel him by either walking out of the counseling meetings or insisting that all communications with him be in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">Dr. Zaky's first performance evaluation was conducted by Dr. Venkatachala on December 18, 1981, and his work was rated satisfactory. Dr. Venkatachala commented, however, that \u201cin the area of interpersonal relationships with staff members and nursing personnel, he leaves much to be desired. If Dr. Zaky could be more flexible, considerate, and develop good lines of communication, everyone can derive more benefit from his expertise.\u201d Before Dr. Zaky received the report, it was reviewed by the Chief of Staff, Dr. Haan who, pursuant to his authority, lowered both Dr. Zaky's \u201cPersonal Qualities\u201d rating to unsatisfactory and his \u201cOverall Evaluation\u201d rating to low satisfactory. Dr. Haan explained that he lowered the ratings because, in his opinion, \u201cDr. Zaky does not demonstrate good emotional stability.\u201d In addition to noting Dr. Zaky\u2019s objections to the Center\u2019s hiring an internist with cardiology training as \u201cmaking plans to replace him,\u201d Dr. Haan stressed Dr. Zaky\u2019s poor staff relations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-7\">\u201cIn regard to dependability, Dr. Zaky has been critical of our Intensive Care Unit and the nurses on ICU. He has also been critical of the CPR Program here. When invited by the Chief, Nursing Service, and by the Head Nurse, and the Intensive Care Unit to provide such training, Dr.' Zaky\u2019s usual reply was that T am too busy\u2019 or \u2018Go ahead and schedule it, and I\u2019ll be there.\u2019 When the sessions were scheduled, Dr. Zaky seldom appeared.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-8\">His relations with the staff have deteriorated to the point that recently, I was requested by five members of the medical staff to listen to their pleas in regard to their relationship with Dr. Zaky. The gist of that conversation was that they are so unhappy that they are considering departing from the hospital unless some adjustment can be made in regard to their relationship with Dr. Zaky.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-9\">As a consequence of this, he is able to elicit little cooperation with other members of the medical staff and is unable to secure what I would consider effective cooperation from the nursing staff, since they are also somewhat uncomfortable with him by reason of his remarks to them at inappropriate times.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b912-10\">On March 15, 1982, a Professional Standards Board composed of Drs. Haan and Venkatachala, Dr. Sun Guo, Chief of Surgical Service, and Patrick McKinney of the Personnel Service, convened to conduct Dr. Zaky\u2019s first year review and concluded that \u201cthere was sufficient evidence [Dr. Zaky\u2019s] performance has been less than satisfactory.\u201d Following the review, the Professional Standards Board listed five specific deficiencies in Dr. Zaky\u2019s performance and suitability and recommended that a Summary Review Board be convened to determine whether Dr. Zaky should continue as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>a member of the V.A. medical staff. Dr. Guo, as Chairman of the Professional Standards Board, informed Dr. Zaky of the five deficiencies in his performance and suitability by letter dated April 9, 1982:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-5\">\u201c1. You have consistently failed to attend ICU rounds as requested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-6\">2. You failed to communicate the condition of your patient to Dr. Gerding on February 25, 1982 (patient Navigato).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-7\">3. You failed to communicate with the primary physician concerning a severe bradycardia. (Incident occurred approximately November 30, 1981).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-8\">4. You have created difficulties with fellow physicians by your failure to accept valid criticism. You have made accusations that the Chief Medical Service is attempting to manipulate physicians. You have made rude and sarcastic remarks to Nursing Service Personnel resulting in their request to not be assigned to the Cardiac Laboratory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-9\">5. You made derogatory comments about Dr. Smithivas to patient Marlin to the effect ... \u2018Who is the damn doctor asking for a stress test on you? He must be a nut.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b913-10\">On June 15, 1982, Dr. Guo informed Dr. Zaky that a Summary Review PSB previously scheduled to meet on April 15, 1982, would meet on July 14, 1982. The letter listed four new charges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-11\">\u201c5. On April 30, 1982, you were instructed to initiate, coordinate, present, and evaluate at least one educational program of mutual benefit to you and the Nursing ICU staff within 30 days. You failed to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-12\">6. You were insubordinate to your Service Chief on April 30, 1982. Your Service Chief attempted to discuss with you your performance, you demanded it be given to you in writing saying \u2018I\u2019m not a child, I don\u2019t need lecturing.\u2019 You then left the office refusing to allow your Service Chief to complete the counseling meeting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-13\">7. You were insubordinate to your Service Chief on June 8, 1982. Your Service Chief attempted to have a counseling meeting with you on June 8, 1982. You interrupted saying, \u2018Anything you want to say, please give it in writing.\u2019 You were told it would be confirmed in writing, but your Service Chief wanted to discuss certain aspects with you. You again stated you wanted everything in writing and didn\u2019t want any discussion and left the office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-15\">8. You were insubordinate to your Service Chief on June 10, 1982. You were at a meeting called by your Service Chief to discuss an incident involving you, Dr. Moorthy, Dr. Salomon, and Mr. Zimmerman. You stated you felt there was no problem, but you wanted it recorded. Your Service Chief agreed to have his secretary record it. You stated you wanted it tape recorded. You were told it was not possible and to stay for the meeting. You refused and left the office.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b913-16\">Dr. Zaky was also informed that he would have the opportunity to \u201cappear in person before the Board to present your side of the case and/or submit a written statement in your behalf.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b913-17\">On July 14, 1982, the Summary Review PSB composed of Dr. Guo, Dr. Palileo, Chief of Laboratory, and Dr. Dorothy Weiner, Chief of Radiology Services, interviewed 11 witnesses and examined written statements submitted by Dr. Zaky. Dr. Zaky declined the opportunity to make an oral statement to the Board because there was no \u201cverbatim recording of the procedure.\u201d The Summary Review PSB determined that all eight deficiencies were sustained by the evidence and recommended that Dr. Zaky be discharged. Dr. Zaky\u2019s file was transferred to the Veteran\u2019s Administration\u2019s Central Office along with letters from Dr. Haan and Mr. Woytassek, the Medical Center Director, counseling approval of the Summary Review PSB\u2019s recommendation of Dr. Zaky\u2019s separation. On August 25, 1982, while Dr. Zaky\u2019s case was pending in the Central Office, the Medical Center Director of the Fort Wayne facility suspended Dr. Zaky for insubordination. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>According to the \u201cNotification of Personnel Action\u201d included in the record, Dr. Zaky</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ8\">\u201cintentionally disobey[ed] a direct, proper order three times. On August 19, 1982, you were given a direct order by your Service Chief to complete a supervisory appraisal on an employee you supervise. You refused to do the appraisal. The order was repeated two more times, and you were informed by the Service Chief that this was a direct order, and your refusal would result in disciplinary action. After that warning, you again re-. fused to complete the supervisory appraisal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">The Chief Medical Director informed the Fort Wayne Medical Center of his approval of Dr. Zaky\u2019s separation on September 16, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">Zaky filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Veteran\u2019s Administration discharged him in retaliation for his exercise of his First Amendment rights; violated his Fifth Amendment liberty interests; and effected the discharge in violation of his procedural rights guaranteed by 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4106(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">The parties filed motions for summary judgment and the district court ruled that the First Amendment claim must fail because the plaintiff\u2019s statements \u201cappear to have been made in the context of an employee protecting his job, a matter of personal interest. These are precisely the kinds of statements which the [Supreme Court in <em>Connick v. Myers, </em>461 U.S. 138, 103 S.Ct. 1684, 75 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983)] held are not matters of public concern, and thus not entitled to protection in a federal court.\u201d As to the liberty interest claim, the district court \u201cagree[d] with Dr. Zaky that a liberty interest is involved in a situation where the accusations against a probationary physician are potentially available to future employers.\u201d However, the court rejected the liberty interest claim, ruling that Dr. Zaky received all the process that was due with the \u201copportunity to make his side of the story part of his permanent record.\u201d Finally, the court divided the \u00a7 4106 claim into two parts: allegations of procedural irregularities and an argument that the proceedings were not \u201cfair and impartial\u201d as required by the regulations. The court rejected the various arguments of procedural irregularities because: (1) alleged \u201cirregularities,\u201d in fact, were authorized by the regulations; (2) Dr. Zaky claimed procedural rights that were not granted to him by the regulations; and (3) Dr. Zaky\u2019s charges were not supported by the evidence. Dr. Zaky\u2019s principal argument that the proceedings were not \u201cfair and impartial\u201d was that the presence of Drs. Venkatachala and Haan on the March 15, 1982, Periodic Review PSB undermined the fairness of the entire review process because of the alleged bias and prejudice both doctors felt toward the plaintiff. Noting that there are \u201cthree tiers of review for probationary employees\u201d and that \u201ceach tier is procedurally independent of the other,\u201d the court rejected the plaintiff\u2019s argument because \u201ca lack of impartiality on the part of a periodic review board would not affect the Summary Review PSB because the latter must independently find the deficiencies to exist.\u201d Moreover, the court pointed out that the presence of Drs. Haan and Venkatachala could not have biased the entire review process because the findings of the Summary Review PSB are reviewed by the Veteran\u2019s Administration\u2019s Central Office in Washington, D.C., before the Chief Medical Director approves or disapproves of the Summary Review PSB\u2019s recommendation. Dr. Zaky\u2019s second principal argument attacking the impartiality of the Board merely contended that the postponement of the Summary Review from April 15 to July 14, 1982 raised an issue as to the validity of the charges and the motives of those who made them. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>found that the delay did not undermine the fairness of the review proceedings because it gave Dr. Zaky additional time to \u201ciron out his differences with his superiors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">A. <em>First Amendment</em></p>\n<p id=\"ATh\">As an initial matter, we address Dr. Zaky\u2019s argument that \u201cthe trial court erred by avoiding consideration of plaintiff\u2019s claim that his request for a grievance hearing played a substantial and motivating role in the decision to discharge him.\u201d An examination of the record reveals that the plaintiff moved for partial summary judgment on his Fifth Amendment and \u00a7 4106 claims and that the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment focused on Zaky\u2019s statements concerning patient care rather than the request for a grievance hearing.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"and-dedup-0\">\u201cAs we have recently emphasized, \u2018the district court need not investigate the evidence for arguments that might possibly support the plaintiff\u2019s claim; it was the <em>plaintiffs </em>responsibility to raise the <em>arguments </em>that it seeks to use now on. appeal.\u2019 \u2018In our view, the trial judge may properly depend upon counsel to appraise him of the issues for decision. He is not obligated to conduct a search for other issues which may lurk in the pleadings.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b915-7\"><em>Erff v. MarkHon Industries, Inc., </em>781 F.2d 613, 618 (7th Cir.1986) <em>quoting Libertyville Datson Sales, Inc. v. Nissan Motor Corp., </em>776 F.2d 735 (7th Cir.1985) and <em>Desert Place, Inc. v. Salisbury, </em>401 F.2d 320, 324 (7th Cir.1968). Since Zaky failed to present to the district court arguments and evidence supporting his theory that the defendants retaliated against him for requesting a grievance hearing, we hold that the district court did not err in failing to address this issue. Our review is confined to the plaintiff\u2019s argument that in finding that his statements were made as \u201cpart of an internal process of policy determination within the Medical Center,\u201d the court \u201cexcluded privately-expressed statements on medical issues from First Amendment protection.\u201d Additionally, we address Dr. Zaky\u2019s contentions that the court erred in finding that his statements did not address a matter of public concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">\u201c[A] state cannot condition public employment on a basis that infringes the employee\u2019s constitutionally-protected interest in freedom of expression.\u201d <em>Connick v. Myers, </em>461 U.S. 138, 142, 103 S.Ct. 1684, 1687, 75 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983). When public employees press claims alleging that their First Amendment rights were denied by a public employer, the court must strike \u201ca balance between the interests of the [employee], as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.\u201d <em>Pickering v. Board of Education, </em>391 U.S. 563, 568, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 1734-35, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968). The courts\u2019 concern with protecting the First Amendment rights of public employees rests on the First Amendment goal of \u201cassuring] unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes desired by the people. Speech concerning public affairs is more than self-expression; it is the essence of self-government.\u201d <em>Connick, </em>461 U.S. at 145, 103 S.Ct. at 1689 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-10\">Judicial oversight, however, is limited to protecting employee speech on matters of public concern.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-11\">\u201c[W]hen a public employee speaks not as a citizen upon matters of public concern, but instead as an employee upon matters only of personal interest, absent the most unusual circumstances, a federal court is not the appropriate forum in which to review the wisdom of a personnel decision taken by a public agency allegedly in reaction to the employee\u2019s behavior. Our responsibility is to ensure that citizens are not deprived of fundamental rights by virtue of working for the government; this does not require a grant of immunity for employee grievances not afforded by the First Amendment to those who do not work for the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>While as a matter of good judgment, public officials should be receptive to constructive criticism offered by their employees, the First Amendment does not require a public office to be run as a roundtable for employee complaints over internal office affairs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b916-4\"><em>Connick, </em>461 U.S. at 147, 149, 103 S.Ct. at 1690, 1691. Indeed, courts addressing First Amendment claims by public employees must heed \u201cthe common-sense realization that government offices could not function if every employment decision became a constitutional matter.\u201d <em>Id,., </em>at 143, 103 S.Ct. at 1688. In <em>Egger v. Phillips, </em>710 F.2d 292 (7th Cir.1983), our court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-5\">\u201c[WJhile the employer has a general interest in maintaining a work environment conducive to effectuating the agency mission, under the <em>Pickering </em>calculus, certain aspects of the particular employment milieu are especially germain____:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-6\">(1) The need to maintain discipline or harmony among co-workers; (2) the need for confidentiality; (3) the need to curtail conduct which impedes the [employee\u2019s] proper and competent performance of his daily duties; and (4) the need to encourage a close and personal relationship between the employee and his superiors, where that relationship calls for loyalty and confidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b916-7\"><em>Egger, </em>710 F.2d at 319. <em>See also, Linhart v. Glatfelter, </em>771 F.2d 1004, 1009 (7th Cir. 1985) (\u201cThe state or municipality may not punish an employee for speaking out on a matter of public concern provided that the government\u2019s interest in efficient operation does not outweigh the importance of the right to speak in the individual case.\u201d); <em>O\u2019Brien v. Town of Caledonia, </em>748 F.2d 403, 407 (7th Cir.1984) (\u201cIn <em>Connick </em>the court emphasized the government\u2019s legitimate interest in controlling employee\u2019s communications which are disruptive of internal operations. Furthermore, the public\u2019s interest in the subject matter of the communication was deemed to be of limited weight when the topic was primarily a private concern of the employee\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-8\">Thus, the focus of the court\u2019s inquiry is \u201cwhether the personnel action was based on legitimate personnel concerns or rather was based on a naked desire to punish an individual for expressing a certain point of view.\u201d <em>Egger, </em>710 F.2d at 320.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-9\">\u201c[T]he <em>Connick </em>test does not consist in looking at what might incidently be conveyed by the fact that an employee spoke in a certain way. The test requires us to look at the <em>point </em>of the speech in question: Was it the employee\u2019s point to bring wrongdoing to light? Or to raise other issues of public concern, because they are of public concern? Or was the point to further some purely private interest?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b916-10\"><em>Linhart, </em>771 F.2d at 1010 (emphasis in original). To determine whether an employee\u2019s speech addressed a matter of public concern, the court must consider \u201cthe content, form, and context of the given statement, as revealed by the whole record.\u201d <em>Connick, </em>461 U.S. at 147-48, 103 S.Ct. at 1690. \u201cThe reasons behind an employment decision will not be scrutinized unless a speech or other conduct can be \u2018fairly characterised as constituting speech on a matter of public concern.\u2019 \u201d <em>Patkus v. Sangamon-Cass Consortium, </em>769 F.2d 1251, 1257 (7th Cir.1985), quoting <em>Connick, </em>461 U.S. at 146, 103 S.Ct. at 1689.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-11\">Initially, we addressed the plaintiff\u2019s argument that the district court \u201cexcluded privately-expressed statements on medical issues from First Amendment protection.\u201d An examination of the district court\u2019s analysis of the First Amendment claim reveals that the court in fact rejected an argument that quality of patient care is, <em>per se, </em>a matter inherently of public concern and held that the context of the statement must be considered in addition to the content, i.e., quality of patient care. The court determined that \u201cDr. Zalcy\u2019s statements were made in the course of internal hospital business involving the determination of which procedures would be used at the Medical Center.\u201d The court concluded that because Dr. Zaky\u2019s comments were made as part of an internal process of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>policy determination, they were not \u201ca matter of public concern for precisely that reason, even though similar statements in a different context may have appealed to the public\u2019s general interest.\u201d Our review of this portion of the opinion reveals that the district court judge performed the analysis mandated by <em>Connick: </em>determining whether the point of the speech in question was to bring wrongdoing to light or merely to address internal office affairs. We discern no intent on the part of the district court judge to \u201cexclude privately-expressed statements on medical issues from First Amendment protection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">Zaky attacks the district court\u2019s holding, that his speech was made during the course of an internal process of policy determination and that the majority of the statements were made in defense of the numerous complaints lodged against him, by arguing that the content of the speech, quality of patient care, outweighed the employer\u2019s interest in the efficient delivery of public services. Additionally, Dr. Zaky contends that he did not disrupt the functioning of the Medical Center when he presented his views. Initially, we note that Dr. Zaky, in effect, seems to be arguing that the importance of patient care is so great that his First Amendment interest in statements concerning quality of the patient care can <em>never </em>be outweighed by the employer\u2019s interest in efficiently delivering medical services. Dr. Zaky has not cited, and our research has failed to reveal, any legal authority for his proposition that speech concerning the quality of patient care <em>always </em>outweighs the employer\u2019s interests in a court\u2019s analysis of whether the speech is a matter of public concern. Moreover, an examination of the record reveals ample support for the district court\u2019s conclusion that the statements concerning quality of care were made in defense of numerous complaints against Zaky and were \u201cstatements ... made in the context of an employee protecting his job, a matter of personal interest.\u201d The memorandum to the Chief of Staff, Dr. Haan (who was Dr. Venkatachala\u2019s superior) was written two days after Dr. Venkatachala charged Zaky with abandoning the patient with severe bradycardia. Indeed, the record is replete with complaints about Zaky\u2019s inability to communicate or cooperate with other members of the Medical Center staff. Further, Dr. Zaky\u2019s contention that he did not disrupt the functioning of the Center is negated by Dr. Haan\u2019s comment on his Proficiency Evaluation that \u201cfive members of the medical staff ... are so unhappy that they are considering departing from the hospital unless some adjustment can be made in regard to their relationship with Dr. Zaky.\u201d Based upon the numerous complaints about Dr. Zaky, evidence that his comments and behavior disrupted the functioning of the Medical Center and the fact that the resuscitation memorandum was written two days after Dr. Venkatachala charged Dr. Zaky with abandoning a seriously-ill patient, we hold that the district court correctly determined that Dr. Zaky\u2019s statements about the quality of patient care did not address a matter of public concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">B. <em>Fifth Amendment Liberty Interest</em></p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">Zaky argues that his \u201cliberty was injured by separation and by allegations which harmed his good name, reputation, honor, and integrity.\u201d According to Zaky, the defendants\u2019 description of him as \u201cemotionally unstable, undependable, unethical, insubordinate, unable to get along with all categories of personnel, nurses and doctors alike, to the extent that he caused disruption of the medical service in the cardiac lab,\u201d damaged his standing and associations in the medical community, branded him with a \u201cbadge of infamy\u201d and \u201cforeclosed his chances for federal and non-federal employment.\u201d The Supreme Court has held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-9\">\u201cThe requirements of procedural due process apply only to the deprivation of interests encompassed by the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s protection of liberty and property. When protected interests are implicated, the right to some kind of prior hearing is paramount, but the range <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>of interests protected by procedural due process is not infinite.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b918-4\"><em>Board of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 569-70, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 2705, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972). We reviewed liberty interest claims in the context of federal employment in <em>Perry v. Federal Bureau of Investigation, </em>781 F.2d 1294 (7th Cir.1986).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-5\">\u201cIn the ... situation of a firing or failure to rehire a government employee, a liberty interest is implicated if \u2018either (1) the individual\u2019s good name, reputation, honor or integrity are at stake by such charges as immorality, dishonesty, alcoholism, disloyalty, communism or subversive acts or (2) the state imposes a stigma or other disability on the individual which forecloses other opportunities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b918-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1300 <em>quoting Munson v. Friske, </em>754 F.2d 683, 693 (7th Cir.1985); <em>see also Had-ley v. County of DuPage, </em>715 F.2d 1238, 1244 (7th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">Initially, we note that the district court failed to analyze the statements about Dr. Zaky to determine whether they impugned his moral character or diminished his future employment opportunities so significantly that his liberty interest in future employment was implicated. The court, instead of engaging in careful analysis, merely \u201cagree[d] with Dr. Zaky that a liberty interest is involved in a situation where the accusations against a probationary physician are potentially available to future employers.\u201d According to the district court, Dr. Zaky\u2019s Fifth Amendment due process rights were satisfied by his opportunity to respond to stigmatizing statements in his personnel file. \u201cThe inclusion of Dr. Zaky\u2019s written statement to the Summary Review Professional Standards Board in the record guarantees Dr. Zaky that any future employer will have both sides of the story so that ... his' opportunities for future employment will not be unconstitutionally limited.\u201d We cannot approve of the district court\u2019s assumption that a liberty interest is involved in a situation where \u201cthe accusations against a probationary physician are potentially available to future employers;\u201d alleged violations of asserted infringements of a liberty interest of a discharged employee <em>must </em>be analyzed to determine whether statements concerning the employee, made during the discharge, either impugned the employee\u2019s moral character or diminished his future employment opportunities so significantly that his liberty interest in future employment was implicated. <em>Hadley v. County of DuPage, </em>715 F.2d 1238 (7th Cir.1983). Indeed, the district court ignored numerous cases holding that \u201ca liberty interest is not implicated merely by a reduction in an individual\u2019s attractiveness to potential employers.\u201d <em>Perry, </em>781 F.2d 1302; <em>Roth, </em>408 U.S. at 575 (\u201cIt stretches the concept of liberty too far to suggest that a person is deprived of \u2018liberty\u2019 when he simply is not rehired in one job but remains as free as before to seek another\u201d); <em>Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners, </em>353 U.S. 232, 238, 77 S.Ct. 752, 756, 1 L.Ed.2d 796 (1957) (\u201cnot every negative effect upon one\u2019s attractiveness to future employers violates due process if it results without a hearing.\u201d) However, we need not reverse the district court because of its failure to analyze the magnitude of the effect of the remarks on the employee\u2019s chances of obtaining future employment in view of the fact that the district court correctly held that Zaky received all the process that was due. \u201c \u2018[Wjhat procedures due process may require under any given set of circumstances\u2019 varies with a \u2018determination of the precise nature of the government function involved as well as the private interest that has been affected by governmental action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Greene v. Finley, </em>749 F.2d 467, 470 (7th Cir.1984) (quoting <em>Larry v. Lawler, </em>605 F.2d 954, 959 (7th Cir.1978)). \u201cThe function of a due process hearing is \u2018to provide the person an opportunity to clear his name.\u2019 \u201d <em>Perry, </em>781 F.2d at 1303 <em>quoting Roth, </em>408 U.S. at 573 n. 12, 92 S.Ct. at 2707 n. 12. The inclusion of the employee\u2019s denials and explanations in the memorandum containing the employer\u2019s allegedly objectionable statements may satisfy the employee\u2019s due process rights in that it \u201cprovides the person an opportunity to clear his name.\u201d <em>See Perry, </em>781 F.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>1303. We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that the inclusion of Dr. Zaky\u2019s statement in the record protected his interests in preserving his reputation. Accordingly, even if we were to assume that the statements made during Dr. Zaky\u2019s discharge implicated his liberty interests in obtaining future employment, we hold that he received all the due process protection he was entitled to under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">C. <em>Section 4106</em></p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">Dr. Zaky raises numerous arguments in support of his position that he did not receive the fair and impartial proceeding mandated by 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4106. A review of the district court\u2019s thorough and well-reasoned analysis of the \u00a7 4106 claim reveals that several of the plaintiff\u2019s arguments were not raised in the district court. Accordingly, we limit our discussion to those arguments that were presented to the trial court and renewed in this court: (1) whether the charges in the June 18, 1982 notice letter were vague, frivolous, and arbitrary; (2) whether the presence of Drs. Venkatachala and Haan on the March 15, 1982 periodic review PSB \u201cundermined the fairness of the entire review process\u201d because of their alleged bias and prejudice toward the plaintiff; (3) whether the delay of the Summary Review PSB from April 15, 1982 to July 14, 1982 undermined the fairness of the review process; and (4) whether the July 14, 1982 Summary Review PSB was impartial.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">The district court reviewed the June 18, 1982 letter giving notice of the charges and found that the \u201cletter specified both the date of the alleged deficient action by Dr. Zaky and a description of the specific acts which Dr. Zaky did. Thus, the allegations were not vague.\u201d The district court judge concluded that the charges were neither frivolous nor arbitrary because the Summary Review PSB had found all of the allegations sustained by the evidence. As to the argument that the presence of Drs. Haan and Venkatachala on the March 15, 1982 periodic review PSB \u201cundermined\u201d the fairness of the review process, the district court noted that their presence could not undermine the entire review process because the regulations provided for three independent tiers of review and that the Summary Review PSB\u2019s recommendation must be approved by the Chief Medical Director in the Veteran\u2019s Administration\u2019s Central Office. Furthermore, the court rejected Zaky\u2019s argument that the postponement of the Summary Review PSB undermined the fairness of the review process, concluding that \u201cit is clear that the postponement was effectuated for Dr. Zaky\u2019s benefit. It gave him additional time to iron out his differences with his superiors, and promised that the postponed review would consider his record up to the date of the review, so that if he exhibited improvement in his attitude and actions, the PSB would be able to review those facts.\u201d Finally, the court dismissed Zaky\u2019s allegation that the July 14, 1982 Summary Review PSB was not impartial, finding that \u201cthe members of the July 14, 1982 Summary Review PSB which actually began the separation process were not people who Dr. Zaky alleged harbored any potential prejudice against him. Thus, the court finds that no lack of fairness or impartiality influenced the decision to separate Dr. Zaky.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b919-9\">On appeal, Zaky failed to advance arguments demonstrating either factual or legal error in the court\u2019s analysis of these issues. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s conclusion that: (1) the charges in the June 18, 1982 notice letter were neither vague, frivolous, nor arbitrary; (2) the presence of Drs. Venkatachala and Haan on the March 15, 1982 periodic review PSB did not \u201cundermine the fairness of the entire review process;\u201d (3) the delay of the Summary Review PSB from April 15, 1982 to July 14, 1982 did not undermine the fairness of the review process; and (4) the July 14, 1982 Summary Review PSB was impartial.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-10\">The decision of the district court is Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b914-7\">.
