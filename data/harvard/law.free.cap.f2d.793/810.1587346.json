We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-12\">The International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (the \u201cUnion\u201d) and the National Lock Division of Keystone Consolidated Industries, Inc. (\u201cKeystone\u201d) have been parties to a series of pension agreements since 1955. Beginning in 1968 and continuing to the present, these pension agreements provided that Keystone shall make annual contributions to the pension\u2019s trust fund. The pension agreement between Keystone and the Union provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-16\">\u201cThe Company agrees to make contributions to the [pension] trust fund on an annual basis during the term of this Agreement in the amount of ... [sums] determined by the independent actuary employed by the company in the valuation of the pension plan: ____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b889-17\">In June 1981, Keystone issued a summary annual report to the pension plan\u2019s participants, the members of the Union, as required by ERISA. In this report, Keystone revealed that in December 1980, on the advice of its accountants, it had applied to the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) for a waiver of its 1979-1980 pension plan contribution. To obtain a temporary waiver of the ERISA annual minimum funding obligation from the IRS, the employer must demonstrate</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-18\">\u201c(1) The employer is operating at an economic loss,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-19\">(2) There is substantial unemployment or under-employment in the trade or business and in the industry concerned,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-20\">(3) The sales and profits of the industry concerned are depressed or declining and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-21\">(4) It is reasonable to expect that the plan will be continued only if the waiver is granted.\u201d \u25a0</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b889-22\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1083(b). If the IRS grants the temporary waiver, the company in subsequent years must contribute, \u201cthe amount necessary to amortize each waived funding deficiency (within the meaning of section 1083(c) of this title) for each prior plan year in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over a period of 15 plan years.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1082(b)(2)(C). The summary annual report to the pension plan participants issued by Keystone revealed that the Inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>nal Revenue Service had granted Keystone\u2019s request for a waiver of its annual contribution under ERISA based on evidence presented by Keystone alleging that it had suffered a net loss of almost $3.5 million for the fiscal year beginning on July 1, 1979, and a net loss of over $2.5 million in the following year, due to serious downturns in the industries to which it sold its products. Additionally, the IRS found that Keystone was experiencing great difficulty in maintaining sufficient working capital to prevent a technical default of its prime loan obligations to the Continental Illinois National Bank. However, the IRS concluded that Keystone would in all probability be able to recover from its present financial difficulties as a result of its modernization efforts and its program to reduce costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">In September 1981, the Union filed grievances with an arbitrator pursuant to the Union\u2019s collective bargaining agreement with Keystone, alleging that Keystone had violated the annual funding provision of the pension agreement by failing to make its contribution to the plan for the 1979-1980 plan year. After the arbitrator held an evidentiary hearing and reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs, he issued an award in favor of the Union and ordered Keystone to pay $2,147,932 to the pension fund with interest at 8% per year from July 1, 1980, until paid. The parties became involved in a dispute as to when the award was due to be paid, after the issuance of the arbitrator\u2019s decision. The Union claimed that the award required the immediate payment of the full amount, while Keystone claimed that the award required full payment in conformity with the fifteen-year equal installment payment schedule, as set forth for in ERISA. As a result of this dispute over the interpretation of the arbitrator\u2019s award, the Union filed suit under section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185 (1982), to have the district court enforce the arbitrator\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">On June 16, 1983, the district court denied both the Union\u2019s and Keystone\u2019s motions for summary judgment without prejudice and remanded the case to the arbitrator for clarification of the language in the award. The arbitrator clarified his decision on July 5, 1983, explaining that Keystone was to pay the 1979-1980 plan year contribution immediately because Article VI, section 2 of the pension agreement specifically provided that: \u201cThe Company agrees to make contributions to the trust fund on an annual basis ____\u201d Both parties renewed their motions for summary judgment to the district court, and Keystone argued that the court should not enforce the arbitrator\u2019s award because the award directly conflicted with and nullified the waiver provision of ERISA. On February 27, 1984, the district court granted the Union\u2019s motion for summary judgment and enforced the arbitrator\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-9\">On appeal, Keystone argues that the district court erred as a matter of law in enforcing the arbitrator\u2019s award because the award conflicts with the public policies embodied in ERISA. Keystone claims that the safeguards embodied in the waiver provision of ERISA cannot be overridden by a pension agreement because these safeguards were enacted for the benefit of the participants of the pension plan. Additionally, Keystone contends that compelling an employer to honor a contractual obligation to make pension plan contributions when the IRS has granted a waiver of the ERISA minimum funding requirements because of the dire financial status of the business would violate public policy because enforcement of the contract provision risks an unnecessary termination of the pension plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-11\">At the outset, we note that there were two sources of Keystone\u2019s annual funding obligation. Section 302 of ERISA (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1082) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-12\">\u201c(1) Every employee pension benefit plan subject to this part shall satisfy the minimum funding standard (or the alternative minimum funding standard under section 1085 of this title) for any plan year to which this part applies. A plan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>to which this part applies shall have satisfied the minimum funding standard for such plan for a plan year if as of the end of such plan year the plan does not have a cumulative funding deficiency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b891-4\">The purpose of the ERISA minimum funding requirements is to insure that pension plans will accumulate sufficient assets within a reasonable time to pay promised benefits to covered employees when they retire. <em>See </em>H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 93-1280, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 283, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1974, p. 4639, 1974-3 Cum. Bull. 415, 444. ERISA\u2019s funding standards are enforced under provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4971(a). If, at the end of a plan year, the employer has failed to make the minimum contributions necessary to meet the funding requirements of Section 302 of ERISA, \u00a7 4971 imposes a nondeductible, 5% excise tax on the amount of the accumulated funding deficiency. <em>Id. </em>If the funding deficiency is not corrected, an additional tax equal to 100% of the deficiency is imposed. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 4971(b). Neither the initial 5% excise tax nor the additional 100% tax is deductible for federal income tax purposes. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 275(a)(6).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although the minimum funding standards were imposed by Congress to minimize the loss of benefits to participants in inadequately funded plans, Congress recognized that enforcement of the ERISA minimum funding requirement could cause financially troubled employers to terminate their plans rather than subject themselves to the funding taxes imposed on funding deficiencies. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 93-779, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 80, 1974-3 Cum.Bull. 244, 323. To avoid plan terminations, Congress authorized the IRS to temporarily waive the minimum funding requirement in cases of economic hardship. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1083(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">In addition to the ERISA minimum funding obligation, an employer\u2019s annual contribution obligation may be contained in a collective bargaining agreement. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 186(c)(5-8). Article VI \u00a7 2 of the Pension Agreement between Keystone and the Union recites in pertinent part: \u201cThe Company agrees to make contributions to the trust fund on an annual basis during the terms of the Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">Keystone argues that \u00a7 303 of ERISA, the ERISA minimum funding waiver provision, limits Keystone\u2019s and the Union\u2019s rights to contract during the collective bargaining process for continued annual funding of the pension plan when the IRS has granted a waiver of the ERISA minimum funding requirement. According to Keystone, the parties\u2019 liberty to contract is limited by ERISA because a contractual promise to continue annual funding of the pension plan even though the IRS has temporarily waived the ERISA minimum funding requirement would force the employer into financial ruin and jeopardize the pension plan. In addressing the issue of whether ERISA limits the parties\u2019 rights to contract in collective bargaining agreements, we note that ERISA \u201cdoes not regulate the substantive content of welfare-benefit plans.\u201d <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Mass., </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 2380, 2385, 85 L.Ed.2d 728 (1985). <em>Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>463 U.S. 85, 103 S.Ct. 2890, 77 L.Ed.2d 490 (1983). In <em>Murphy v. Heppen-stall Co., </em>635 F.2d 233 (3d Cir.1980), the Third Circuit addressed the question of whether 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362 and 1322, limiting the employer\u2019s liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation \u201cplace a cap on, respectively, the employer\u2019s liability for pension benefits, and the employees\u2019 right to receive employer-funded benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 237. \u201cThe employer maintained] the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>federally-insured pension benefits set out in Title IV of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1301-81 afford[s] employees all the pension rights to which they are entitled,\u201d and that section 1362 and 1322, placing a cap on liability to the PBGC, evinced Congress intent to limit the beneficiaries pension rights. The court noted that the sections 1362 and 1322 \u201cin no way address pension benefits directly recoverable from the employer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 237-38. Based upon not only the statutory language but also upon the Act\u2019s legislative history, as summarized in <em>Nachman Corp. v. PBGC, </em>446 U.S. 359, 374,100 S.Ct. 1723, 1732, 64 L.Ed.2d 354 (1980), the Third Circuit concluded that \u00a7\u00a7 1362 and 1322 did \u201cnot limit the employer\u2019s direct contractual liability to employees,\u201d 635 F.2d at 237-38, and that its holding was \u201cnot inconsistent with the statutory scheme to permit employees to recover directly from the employer any additional benefits to which the employer has contractually obligated itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 239. <em>See also In the Matter of M &amp; M Transportation Co., </em>3 B.R. 722 (S.D.N.Y.1980); <em>In Re Alan Wood Steel Co., </em>5 B.R. 620 (Bkrtcy E.D.Pa.1978). Similar to the analogous situation faced by the Third Circuit in <em>Murphy, </em>we have failed to discover any language in the legislative history of section 303 that would limit the contractual obligation of Keystone to fund its pension plan pursuant to the negotiated collective bargaining agreement. In <em>Murphy, </em>the court further held that \u00a7 1144 of ERISA, the preemption section, preempts state law but does not supercede the federal common law of labor-management contracts. <em>Id. </em>at 237. Indeed, ERISA expressly provides that an employer\u2019s failure to make a pension plan contribution agreed upon in a collective bargaining agreement violates ERISA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-4\">\u201cEvery employer who is obligated to make contributions to a multiemployer plan under the terms of the plan or under the terms of a collectively bargained agreement shall, to the extent not inconsistent with law, make such contributions in accordance with the terms and conditions of such plan or such agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1145.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Suits to enforce pension rights obtained under a collective bargaining agreement may be brought under ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132, or under \u00a7 301 of the Labor-Management Relations Act, (\u201cLMRA\u201d) 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185.' <em>Bug her v. Ge-ightner, </em>722 F.2d 1356, 1361 (7th Cir.1983) (Wood, J., concurring); <em>see e.g., Kaiser Steel Corp. v. Mullins, </em>455 U.S. 72, 102 S.Ct. 851, 70 L.Ed.2d 833 (1982). Our court has held that the ERISA enforcement section, \u00a7 1132, \u201cwas intended to supplement rather than supersede the rights existing under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185____\u201d <em>Ind. State Council of Roofers v. Adams Roofing, </em>753 F.2d 561, 563 (7th Cir.1985); <em>Bugher, </em>722 F.2d at 1359, <em>see also Kaiser Steel, </em>455 U.S. at 87, 102 S.Ct. at 861. Based upon not only the statutory language of ERISA sections 1132 and 1145 but also the cases addressing the relationship of ERISA to the LMRA, we hold that ERISA does not forbid parties to collectively bargain for obligations greater than, and separate from, the ERISA minimum funding obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-10\">We now turn to the question of whether the arbitrator\u2019s award violated public policy. Keystone bases its public policy argument on the observation that the well-defined and dominant public policy embodied in ERISA is to protect plan participants from the unnecessary termination of their pension plans. Keystone reasons that because the IRS found that it faced a \u201csubstantial business hardship,\u201d the arbitrator\u2019s refusal to permit it to rely on the payment schedule outlined in ERISA\u2019s waiver provision jeopardized the continued existence of Keystone\u2019s pension plan, to the serious detriment of the plan participants. Keystone concludes that because the arbitrator jeopardized the continued ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>istence of the pension plan in refusing to allow Keystone to rely on the payment schedule outlined in the ERISA waiver provision, he violated public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-4\">Initially, we note that an examination not only of the legislative history of ERISA but also the statutory language fails to reveal that Congress intended to authorize the IRS to relieve an employer of its contractual obligation to contribute to its employees\u2019 pension plan. The statute provides that the Secretary of the Treasury \u201cmay waive <em>the requirements of section 1082(a) of this title\u201d </em>(emphasis added); the statute fails to specify that the Secretary may waive contractual funding requirements contained in pension agreements between private parties. Moreover, the application for the waiver is made by the employer and the statute fails to provide for giving notice or an opportunity to be heard to the beneficiaries. <em>See </em>Rev.Proc. 83-41, 1983-1 Cum.Bull. 775. The Justice Department argues, and we agree, that there are two reasons for granting waivers on an <em>ex parte </em>basis without providing advance notice to plan participants. First, since the employer\u2019s waiver application contains tax return information, disclosure of the application would violate Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code prohibiting the disclosure of tax return information. Secondly, involvement of the plan participants or their bargaining representative in the waiver process would be administratively cumbersome. The statute requires the Secretary to consider whether:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-5\">\u201c(1) The employer is operating at an economic loss,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-6\">(2) There is substantial unemployment or underemployment in the trade or business and in the industry concerned,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-7\">(3) The sales and profits of the industry concerned are depressed or declining and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-8\">(4) It is reasonable to expect that the plan will be continued only if the waiver is granted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b893-9\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1083(b). However, the statute does not provide beneficiaries with an opportunity to present evidence on these issues, and furthermore, the Secretary is not required to provide a written record in support of his decision. Moreover, it is apparent that Keystone\u2019s reasoning rests on the assumption that the IRS determination was necessarily fair and accurate; on the other hand, if the IRS decision to waive the ERISA minimum funding requirement was in fact, inaccurate, the arbitrator did not violate public policy by requiring Keystone to make the annual contributions.set forth in the Pension Agreement. The Justice Department argues, and we agree, that enforcement of an employer\u2019s contractual funding obligations is not in violation of any policy provision of ERISA. On the basis of this statutory scheme, we reject Keystone\u2019s argument that the IRS\u2019 determination of the employer\u2019s obligations under ERISA should be determinative of the contractual rights of private parties since the statute is structured to temporarily waive only the statutorily created right to minimum pension funding.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-11\">The Union also raises two persuasive constitutional objections, based upon their right to due process and on separation of powers, to Keystone\u2019s contention that the IRS\u2019 decision to waive the ERISA minimum funding requirements nullifies their contractual right to an annual contribution under the pension agreement. Initially, we address the Union\u2019s due process argument that Keystone\u2019s interpretation of ERISA (that an IRS waiver of the ERISA minimum funding requirement also acts as a waiver of the contractual obligation to annual funding) violates their due process rights to notice and to be heard. Because the statute does not require the IRS to conduct a formal trial-type hearing in determining whether to grant a waiver of the ERISA minimum funding requirements, the decision whether to grant the waiver is more properly classified as an \u201cinformal\u201d agency action. Although the applicable statutes and regulations may permit an agency to act informally, the agency\u2019s informal temporary waiver determination procedure must still provide due process to those whose rights will be adversely affected by its decision in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>comply with the Fifth Amendment\u2019s mandate that a person must not be deprived of his \u201cliberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976). In addressing a due process challenge to an informal agency decision based on the deprivation of a property interest, the court must ascertain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-4\">\u201cFirst, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government\u2019s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute proce-durals requirement would entail.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ags-dedup-0\"><em>Mathews, </em>424 U.S. at 335, 96 S.Ct. at 903. Thus, to determine whether Keystone\u2019s interpretation of the Act (arguing that the IRS decision to allow a waiver of the ERISA annual minimum funding requirement also waives the contractual minimum funding requirement) violates due process, we examine the IRS waiver procedure to ascertain the danger of an erroneous deprivation of the contractual right to minimum funding; the probable value of additional or substitute safeguards; and, the Government\u2019s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute safeguards would entail. <em>Mathews, </em>424 U.S. at 335, 96 S.Ct. at 903. In essence, the statute requires the Secretary of the Treasury to make two separate and distinct evidentiary determinations before granting a waiver of the ERISA minimum funding requirement: (1) the employer is facing a substantial business hardship and (2) that granting a waiver of the ERISA minimum funding requirements would be in the interest of the plan participants. <em>See, </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1083(b). If the IRS grants the waiver, the company must, in subsequent years, contribute, \u201cthe amount necessary to amortize each waived funding deficiency (within the meaning of section 1083(c) of this title) for each prior plan year in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over a period of 15 plan years.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1082(b)(2)(C). In the instant case, the IRS\u2019 grant of the temporary waiver of the ERISA minimum funding requirement stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-6\">\u201cThe information submitted with the request and at an informal conference shows that the Company has suffered a substantial loss for the Company\u2019s fiscal year ended June 30,1980, for a variety of reasons, most of which relate to serious downturns in the industries to which it-sells its products, including the automotive industry, housing and agriculture. Further, the Company continues to experience a serious problem maintaining a sufficient amount of working capital to prevent technical default under its prime loan obligations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-7\">The Company has nevertheless managed to continue its modernization program so that it can be positioned to take best advantage of turnarounds in the industry it serves. The Company has also pared costs and has reduced future benefit accruals under one of the largest pension plans it maintains. For these reasons, we believe the Company can recover from its present hardship and have therefore granted these waivers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">An analysis of these reasons reveals that although some of the facts on which the IRS relied may not be subject to serious dispute <em>{i.e., </em>\u2014 \u201cthe downturns in the industries to which it sells its products\u201d), other factual findings could be the subject of vigorous debate <em>{i.e., </em>\u2014 whether the company \u201chas ... managed to continue its modernization program so that it can be positioned to take best advantage of turnarounds in the industry it serves\u201d and whether \u201cthe Company can recover from its present hardship\u201d). Moreover, under Keystone\u2019s approach the government\u2019s interest in making a fair and accurate determination of whether to grant a temporary waiver of the <em>ERISA </em>minimum funding requirement would be expanded to include an interest in making a fair and accurate determination of whether to grant a tempo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>rary waiver of the <em>contract\u2019s </em>minimum funding requirement. We hold that the beneficiaries\u2019 contract rights cannot be nullified by an IRS ERISA minimum funding temporary waiver determination because the IRS ERISA minimum funding waiver procedure fails to grant the beneficiaries (who have a contractual right to an annual contribution from the company) the right to notice and an opportunity to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-4\">As a second constitutional objection to Keystone\u2019s public policy argument, the Union directs our attention to the following passage in <em>Northern Pipeline Construction Co. v. Marathon Pipeline Co., </em>458 U.S. 50, 102 S.Ct. 2858, 73 L.Ed.2d 598 (1982):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-5\">\u201c[A] matter of public rights must at a minimum arise \u2018between the government and others.\u2019 ... In contrast, \u2018the liability of one individual to another under the law as defined\u2019 ... is a matter of private rights. Our precedents clearly establish that <em>only </em>controversies in the former category may be removed from Art. Ill courts and delegated to legislative courts or administrative agencies for their de-termination____ Private-rights disputes, on the other hand, lie at the core of the historically recognized judicial power.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"agr-dedup-1\">458 U.S. at 69-70, 102 S.Ct. at 2870-71 (emphasis in original) (citations omitted). The plurality in the <em>Marathon </em>decision held that the principle of separation of powers embodied in Article III of the Constitution permits legislative courts (non-Article III courts) in three situations: (1) territorial courts; (2) courts-marshals; (3) legislative courts and agencies established to enforce \u201cpublic rights.\u201d The plurality defined \u201cpublic rights\u201d as \u201cmatters arising \u2018between the Government and persons subject to its authority in connection with the performance of the constitutional functions of the executive or legislative departments.\u2019 \u201d <em>Marathon, </em>458 U.S. at 67-68, 102 S.Ct. at 2869-70. The Supreme Court stated that no case arising between two individuals could be characterized as one of public rights. <em>Id. </em>at 68-72, 102 S.Ct. at 2869-72. Although the <em>Marathon </em>decision addressed the constitutionality of bankruptcy courts, courts have applied its reasoning to administrative agencies, <em>see, e.g., Kalaris v. Donovan, </em>697 F.2d 376 (D.C.Cir.1983), and commentators agree that the decision may be applied to administrative agencies if an agency adjudication attempts to resolve private rights. See, e.g., Forward \u2014 The Supreme Court, 1981 Term, 96 Harv.L.Rev. 257-68 (1982); Redish, Legislative Courts, Administrative Agencies, and the <em>Northern Pipeline </em>Case Decision, 1983 Duke L.J. 197 (1983). An \u201c \u2018adjudication\u2019 means agency process for the formulation of an order.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(7). An \u201c \u2018order\u2019 means the whole or a part of a final disposition, whether affirmative, negative, injunctive, or declaratory in form, of an agency in a matter other than rule-making but including licensing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at (6). Because the IRS\u2019 grant of a temporary waiver of the ERISA minimum funding requirement is \u201ca final disposition of an agency matter other than rule making,\u201d it is an adjudication; the IRS acts in a judicial function when determining whether to grant a waiver of the ERISA minimum funding requirement. Under Keystone\u2019s argument, the IRS\u2019 decision to grant a temporary waiver of the ERISA minimum funding requirement nullifies the beneficiaries\u2019 contract right to an annual contribution because an attempt to enforce the contract right would be viola-tive of public policy; in effect, under Keystone\u2019s public policy argument, the IRS determines contract rights between private parties, <em>i.e., </em>whether an attempt to enforce the contract right to an annual contribution would violate public policy. Thus, we reject Keystone\u2019s public policy argument because it would improperly place the IRS into the role of impermissibly wielding Article III power in determining the contract rights between private parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">We hold that the relationship between the IRS\u2019 procedure for waiving the ERISA minimum funding requirement and the collective bargaining agreement is analogous to the relationship between the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and collective bargaining agreements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>\u201cAbsent a judicial determination, the commission [EEOC], not to mention the Company, cannot alter the collective bargaining agreement without the Union\u2019s consent. Permitting such a result would undermine the federal labor policy that parties to a collective bargaining agreement must have reasonable assurance that their contract will be honored.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b896-4\"><em>W.R. Grace &amp; Co. v. Local Union 759, </em>461 U.S. 757, 103 S.Ct. 2177, 2186, 76 L.Ed.2d 298 (1983); <em>see also, </em>126 Cong.Rec., at 20180 (remarks of Sen. Williams) (\u201cIt is essential to the financial health of multiem-ployer plans that they and their actuaries be able to rely on an employer\u2019s contribution promises. [P]lan participants for whom the employer promises to make pension contributions to the plan in exchange for their labor are entitled to rely on their employer\u2019s promises.\u201d). The Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in the well-reasoned <em>Grace </em>decision mandates that neither the company nor the IRS could alter the collective bargaining agreement without the beneficiaries\u2019 consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">The decision of the district court is Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b891-5\"><em>. </em>When collective bargaining agreements are involved, the Internal Revenue Code provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Amq\">\u201cthe liability under section 4971 [imposing the funding tax] of each employer who is a party to the collective bargaining agreement shall be determined in a reasonable manner not inconsistent with regulations prescribed by the Secretary\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-10\">(A) first on the basis of their respective delinquencies in meeting required employer contributions under the plan, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-11\">(B) then on the basis of their respective liability for contributions under the plan.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b891-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 413(b)(6).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b892-5\">.
