Horn &amp; Hardart contends that the District Court improperly granted summary judgment in the face of a need for further factual development both as to the meaning of the termination provisions and as to whether the facts, as ultimately adduced, would have warranted Amtrak\u2019s invocation of these clauses. While Horn &amp; Hardart\u2019s arguments are not without force, we are persuaded in the end that the District Court\u2019s disposition of this case is correct. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-29\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b436-30\">Horn &amp; Hardart is a familiar corporate face in New York. Its operations extend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>underground, as it were, to include within the confines of Penn Station three restaurant and cocktail lounge operations each of which is the subject of a separate lease. The three leases contain identical provisions in respect of termination, permitting that power to be invoked by Amtrak:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1k\">in the event that [Amtrak] shall require the demised premises for its Corporate purposes ..., or in case of the proposed re-construction or demolition of the terminal building in which the demised premises are located (resulting thereafter in the re-construction or demolition thereof)____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">In November 1984 Amtrak dispatched to Horn &amp; Hardart termination notices with respect to all three leases. Amtrak\u2019s stated reason for displacing its long-standing lessee was to permit construction of an ambitious project, duly approved by Amtrak\u2019s board of directors, to modernize Penn Station pursuant to a master plan. As represented to the court below, \u201cAmtrak\u2019s current intention is to reconstruct the portion of Pennsylvania Station in which the demised premises are located so that a new ticket facility can be installed on the premises ... occupied by [Horn &amp; Har-dart].\u201d Amtrak\u2019s Statement of Material Facts As To Which There Is No Genuine Dispute 117.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Horn &amp; Hardart challenged Amtrak\u2019s use of the termination clause, repairing to United States District Court here in Washington, Amtrak\u2019s corporate situs and the jurisdiction whose law governs the three leases in accordance with' applicable federal law. 45 U.S.G. \u00a7 546(d) (1982). Horn &amp; Hardart averred that since the Penn Station operations commenced in 1967 the Company had expanded substantial sums to improve the leased premises, as most recently evidenced by the conversion in 1980 of a \u201cHorn &amp; Hardart\u201d coffee shop to an \u201cArby\u2019s\u201d and the modernization of its two other premises, the \u201cIron Horse\u201d and the \u201cDolphin Bar,\u201d in which approximately $1 million had previously been invested. To protect its sizable investments, Horn &amp; Hardart argued, the Company had not only negotiated long-term leases but had succeeded in limiting substantially Amtrak\u2019s powers of termination. Specifically, the parties had agreed to the language, which we have quoted above, only after Horn &amp; Hardart had fended off in negotiations a considerably more sweeping termination clause advanced by Amtrak which would have empowered the latter to terminate the leases (upon ninety days\u2019 written notice)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aui\">in case [Amtrak] shall desire to use the demised premises, or any portion thereof, either for itself or through agreement with others for transportation or public service purposes, or for construction, reconstruction ... of that portion of the building of which the demised premises constitute a part____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">The upshot of this successful negotiation effort, Horn &amp; Hardart maintained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ati-dedup-2\">was to restrict Amtrak\u2019s right to terminate the leases to situations which would \u201crequire\u201d termination because of activities affecting Amtrak as a corporate entity, and to situations involving reconstruction or demolition of the entire \u201cterminal building\u201d in which the leased premises were located, as compared with reconstruction or demolition \u201cof that portion of the building\u201d of which the leased premises were a part.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">Verified Complaint 1111, at 5-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">Arguing that Amtrak\u2019s purported terminations were entirely inadmissable under the express terms agreed to by the parties, Horn &amp; Hardart sought a declaration that the terminations were unlawful, an injunction prohibiting Amtrak from seeking to evict or otherwise remove Horn &amp; Hardart from the premises, and compensatory damages of not less than $2.5 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-11\">Amtrak promptly moved to dismiss the complaint or, alternatively, for summary judgment. Inasmuch as Amtrak submitted evidence outside the pleadings, the District Court treated the motion as falling into the latter category, see Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). The court ruled in favor of Amtrak, concluding, in brief, that the operative words of the termination clause, namely \u201crequire[d] ... for Corporate purposes\u201d were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>unambiguous and thus amendable to authoritative judicial construction. As to the term \u201crequire,\u201d the court determined that \u201c[bjoth the plain meaning of the word [\u201crequire\u201d] as used in the leases and case law supports Amtrak\u2019s position.\u201d Memorandum Opinion at 6. In so concluding, the trial court rejected Horn &amp; Hardart\u2019s argument that, as evidenced by the Declaration of one of its officers who had conducted the lease negotiations on behalf of the Company, the term \u201crequire\u201d was substituted for the term \u201cdesire\u201d in order \u201cto reflect the fact that the leases could be terminated only if termination was mandatory or indispensible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8. <em>See </em>Horn &amp; Hardart\u2019s Opposition to Defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss at 12 (\u201c[T]he Leases use \u2018require,\u2019 which in this context clearly means \u2018to demand as necessary or essential\u2019 or \u2018to make indispensable.\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted). So too, the District Court eschewed the Company\u2019s interpretation of \u201cCorporate purposes,\u201d which Horn &amp; Har-dart construed to mean \u201cthat Amtrak may take Horn &amp; Hardart\u2019s space only when such space is indispensable for Amtrak\u2019s continued existence as an entity which provides \u2018intercity and commuter rail service.\u2019 \u201d Opposition at 19 (citation omitted). In the trial court\u2019s view, this proffered construction was \u201cunduly narrow.\u201d Memorandum Opinion at 8. Invoking \u201cplain meaning,\u201d the court determined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-4\">[I]t is obvious that Amtrak\u2019s use of Horn and Hardart\u2019s space for expanding ticket counter and waiting room facilities is for Amtrak\u2019s corporate purposes of providing modern, cost-efficient, intercity passenger rail transportation service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Looking to the uncontradicted evidence as to the use to which the leased premises would in fact be put, the court concluded that \u201cAmtrak has the right to terminate the leases in order to expand its ticket counter and waiting area because Amtrak \u2018requires\u2019 the demised premises for its \u2018Corporate purposes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9. In so doing, the court construed what it viewed as the critical term, \u201crequire,\u201d as \u201cnecessary or needed,\u201d not, as Horn &amp; Hardart vigorously argued, \u201cmandatory or indispensable.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">On appeal, Horn &amp; Hardart\u2019s principal argument is that the lease terms were infected by \u201cpatent ambiguity.\u201d Brief for Appellant at 10, thus rendering the contract dispute unsuitable for summary judgment. To compound this threshold legal error, the Company contends, the District Court\u2019s summary disposition resurrected Phoenix-like the sweeping, pro-Lessor termination clause that the parties, by virtue of Horn &amp; Hardart\u2019s effective negotiation efforts, had discarded. That is to say, \u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s interpretation is tantamount to construing the word \u2018require\u2019 to mean \u2018desire.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14. This fundamental legal error, the Company asserts, had the effect of cutting off, without warrant, the development of \u201crelevant facts\u201d through \u201cessential discovery,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 15, all in derogation of the orderly procedures contemplated by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, especially Rule 56(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-10\">The Company suggests that the court below, remaining as it did on high legal ground instead of delving into the facts, ignored the incongruence of its legal pronouncements with the facts themselves. Such facts include facial alterations to the Arby\u2019s lease and Horn &amp; Hardart\u2019s acceptance of Amtrak\u2019s sweeping termination clause in a contemporaneously executed lease for retail space (aside from the three leases at issue here). What is more, the Company argues, the pivotal term, \u201cCorporate purposes,\u201d is not only ambiguous but is clearly less expansive than Amtrak\u2019s proffered interpretation, which would encompass any corporate activity that does not stray beyond the outer perimeter of the <em>ultra vires </em>doctrine. This extraordinary sweep, the Company maintains, could not possibly have been intended by the parties inasmuch as the parties in their negotiations modified the termination provision so as to substitute \u201cCorporate purposes\u201d for \u201ctransportation or public service purposes.\u201d Taken together, the pro-Horn &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Hardart modifications to the lease provisions were meant, as the Company sees it, to restrict Amtrak\u2019s right to terminate. The District Court\u2019s pre-trial disposition, Horn &amp; Hardart argues, permits Amtrak unfairly to claim victory in the courthouse despite its defeat at the negotiating table.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">To exacerbate matters, the Company goes on, Amtrak is thereby permitted to effect a forfeiture of Horn &amp; Hardart\u2019s valuable leasehold interests, a result disfavored by the more merciful principles animating courts of justice in construing contracts. Finally, in Horn &amp; Hardart\u2019s view, the District Court\u2019s interpretation has rendered surplusage the \u201cre-construction\u201d provision in the termination clause, which limits Amtrak\u2019s right to abrogate the leases to when the <em>terminal building </em>\u2014 not just the <em>portion </em>of the building of which the leased premises are a part \u2014 is reconstructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Notwithstanding the able arguments of counsel for the Company, we find ourselves in full agreement with the District Court\u2019s pivotal determination that the contract language is properly amenable to dispositive interpretation as a matter of law. Consistent with applicable law, <em>see, e.g., Clayman v. Goodman Properties, Inc., </em>518 F.2d 1026,1034 (D.C.Cir.1974), the District Court turned to the language of the contract itself to determine whether the provision was ambiguous. As the District Court rightly said, the construction of <em>unambiguous </em>contractual language is a matter of law entrusted to the court. <em>Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority v. Mergentime Corporation, </em>626 F.2d 959, 961 (D.C.Cir.1980). The issue, then, is whether the language that has so sharply divided the parties is, in truth, <em>reasonably </em>susceptible of different construction or interpretations. <em>Papago Tribal Utility Authority v. FERC, </em>723 F.2d 950, 955 (D.C.Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>467 U.S. 1241, 104 S.Ct. 3511, 82 L.Ed.2d 820 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">We conclude that the District Court\u2019s interpretation of the language, based upon its plain meaning, is unimpeachable. Horn <em>&amp; </em>Hardart\u2019s construction of the contract, whether it is based on the term \u201ccorporate purpose\u201d alone or on the juxtaposition of the terms \u201crequire\u201d and \u201ccorporate purpose,\u201d is not yielded by a fair examination of the language itself. The sole interpretation advanced by the Company before the District Court and on appeal is, as we have seen, that Amtrak can lawfully trigger the clause \u201conly if termination was mandatory or indispensable\u201d for Amtrak\u2019s corporate purposes. Opposition at 8; <em>see also </em>Reply Brief for Appellant at 4-5. This is a reading to which the actual language does not reasonably admit. Corporate life and death does not have to be on the line to \u201crequire [space] ... for Corporate purposes.\u201d We concur fully with the able District Judge\u2019s view that the Company\u2019s strained interpretation \u201cwould render the termination provision virtually useless and would be inconsistent with Amtrak\u2019s mandate from Congress to provide modern, efficient, rail passenger service.\u201d Memorandum Opinion at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">Contrary to Horn &amp; Hardart\u2019s assertions, our rejection of its corporate life-and-death standard does not render the termination provision operable at the whim of the landlord. The undisputed evidence shows that Amtrak did not terminate the Company\u2019s lease in order to secure a more lucrative leasehold arrangement. Rather, Amtrak, pursuant to a broad plan of substantial improvements to Penn Station, sought to employ the precise space occupied by Horn &amp; Hardart for expanded ticket counter space and other, non-leasehold purposes. Those specific purposes, under the undisputed facts presented here, suffice to bring the lessor\u2019s reason for termination within the plain meaning of the lease\u2019s termination provision. That the use of the demised premises by Amtrak in this instance is \u201creasonably necessary\u201d to give life to one of its general corporate purposes is further supported by Horn &amp; Hardart\u2019s acknowledgment that Amtrak could have terminated the leases pursuant to the leases\u2019 condemnation clause, a provision which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>incorporates Amtrak\u2019s right to acquire or take property when \u201crequired for intercity rail passenger service.\u201d 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 545(d)(1) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">Horn &amp; Hardart\u2019s remaining concerns need not detain us. There is, fairly viewed, no \u201cforfeiture\u201d at work here since the leases either did (Arby\u2019s) or could have contained a cancellation premium clause. Indeed, pursuant to the Arby\u2019s cancellation premium clause, Horn &amp; Hardart in August 1985 received $180,000 from Amtrak; what is more, the original 1967 lease likewise contained a cancellation premium clause. The disincentive of a cancellation premium clause constituted the specific protective mechanism to which the parties agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">We are similarly unpersuaded that the District Court\u2019s reading of Part 1 of the termination clause (\u201crequire ... for Corporate purposes\u201d) renders surplusage the provisions of Part 2 of the clause (\u201cre-construction\u201d). The clauses do indeed overlap in this particular setting, but overlap in one situation cannot properly be equated with the unhappy condition of \u201csurplusage.\u201d For it appears to us that the latter Part\u2014 the \u201creconstruction\u201d portion of the clause \u2014 may have efficacy in other settings, such as where reconstruction might be forced on Amtrak by, say, Madison Square Garden which sits atop the subterranean provinces of Penn Station.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Finally, we observe merely in passing that the acceptance of Horn &amp; Hardart\u2019s plea that this case move beyond the summary-judgment station and onto the tracks of discovery and trial would likely lead to a highly extensive factual undertaking as to the \u201cindispensability\u201d of the substantial improvements project now underway and approved by the Amtrak board of directors. The unlikelihood that the parties contemplated such a result fortifies us in our conclusion, reached independently for the reasons heretofore stated, that the plain language of this provision reasonably admits only of the construction discerned by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b440-8\">J. SKELLY WRIGHT, Senior Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A3M\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">I am unable to agree with the majority that the contract in dispute in this case is so unambiguous as to admit of only one reasonable construction. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">As an initial matter I note that this case does not present us with the issue whether Amtrak may evict its tenant Horn &amp; Har-dart. Indeed, Horn &amp; Hardart has already been displaced. Rather, the issue is the extent to which Amtrak is liable to Horn &amp; Hardart for damages resulting from the already-completed eviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-11\">In the usual case when a landlord evicts his tenant in violation of a lease he assumes the burden of compensating his tenant for the breach. The parties, of course, may alter this arrangement either by allowing the landlord to evict the tenant <em>without </em>violating the lease or by providing that the landlord may evict the tenant without liability in only a narrow range of circumstances. In this case Horn &amp; Hardart argues that the parties agreed to the latter, allowing Amtrak to terminate the lease only in a very narrow range of circumstances. This does <em>not </em>mean that unless those circumstances are met Amtrak is burdened with the presence of Horn &amp; Hardart\u2019s restaurants. Amtrak may proceed either through its condemnation power or, as in this case, through an arguable violation of the lease to rid itself of its unwanted tenant. In either case Amtrak must pay damages to its tenant. But surely <em>that </em>is not such an unreasonable result; landlords and tenants often agree to be bound in leases without termination clauses.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-12\">Horn &amp; Hardart does not rest its case on a reading of the term \u201cCorporate purpose\u201d alone. Indeed, it specifically acknowledged both in the trial court and on appeal that the term \u201cCorporate purpose\u201d might, in the abstract, include the proposed renovation. <em>See </em>Transcript of Proceedings (April 29, 1985) at 34-35; Reply Brief for Appellant at 2-3. Rather it argues that <em>regardless </em>of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>the scope of the term \u201cCorporate purpose\u201d the court must examine the nexus between that purpose and the termination of Horn &amp; Hardart\u2019s leases. <em>See </em>Reply Brief for Appellant at 2-3 (\u201cWhether termination of Horn &amp; Hardart\u2019s leases is <em>\u2018required\u2019 </em>for Amtrak\u2019s \u2018Corporate purposes,\u2019 however, is a wholly separate issue, and one that greatly restricts Amtrak\u2019s right to terminate.\u201d) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">The District Court and the majority find that \u201crequired\u201d means \u201creasonably necessary.\u201d Although I wholly agree that the \u201creasonably necessary\u201d construction of the challenged contract clause <em>might </em>reflect the intent of the parties to this contract, I am unable to agree that this construction represents the only possible reasonable construction of the contract. As Horn &amp; Hardart argues, this clause might also mean that Amtrak may only terminate the lease when use of the space is <em>required </em>for a permissible corporate purpose. The majority\u2019s construction of this contract requires this court to assume that Horn &amp; Hardart entered into this long-term contract, made large investments protected only by limited cancellation premium clauses, and left itself open to eviction whenever Amtrak decided that the use of the space was \u201creasonably necessary\u201d for its general purposes. Although Horn &amp; Hardart might have agreed to such a contractual relationship, it is by no means clear to me that it did not intend, through the use of the word \u201crequire,\u201d to place more stringent limitations upon the right of termination. Certainly I would not reach such a conclusion without consideration of extrinsic evidence bearing on the intent of the parties. Moreover, I note that \u201crequire\u201d and \u201creasonably necessary\u201d are hardly synonyms. Had the parties intended the contract to allow termination whenever Amtrak found it \u201creasonably necessary\u201d to further one of its corporate purposes, they could easily have incorporated such language. Thus, because the contract is reasonably susceptible of different reasonable interpretations, I would hold that summary judgment was inappropriate and would remand this case for trial. <em>See Papago Tribal Utility Authority v. FERC, </em>723 F.2d 950, 955 (D.C. Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>467 U.S. 1241, 104 S.Ct. 3511, 82 L.Ed.2d 820 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">Because the majority reaches the opposite result, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
