He had also sold Blaylock the Ford car in which the keg of whisky was found. He refrained from telling the officers that the whisky belonged to Blaylock for the reason that Blaylock was sick and he feared that an attempt to arrest him would jeopardize his health. Blaylock\u2019s illness resulted in his death. Appellant disclaimed the ownership of the whisky.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>The officers' testified that the appellant admitted the ownership of the whisky and stated that he was ageing it for sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-3\">The issues of fact were submitted to the jury in a charge against which there is no complaint urged and in which no fault has been observed.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">Deeming the evidence sufficient, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"Azr\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
