This was urged in a motion to quash the indictment based upon the proposition that the ownership was not sufficiently alleged. In the indictment it is charged that the accused entered the house occupied by O. L. Curren, hereinafter called \u201cinjured party\u201d. The contention has been held unsound in the authorities cited by Mr. Branch in his Ann. Tex. P. C., sec. 2324, among which are the following: Tidwell v. State (Texas Crim. App.), 45 S. W., 1015; Moore v. State, 48 Texas Crim. Rep., 400, 88 S. W., 230.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-11\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AZB\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
