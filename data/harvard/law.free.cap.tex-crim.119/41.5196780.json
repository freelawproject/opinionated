The last paragraph of this charge was excepted to as infringing appellant\u2019s right of self-defense, and upon the further ground that there was no evidence authorizing a charge on provoking the difficulty.. We are of opinion that the exception was well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-13\">One provokes a difficulty, as that expression is used in our criminal practice, when, in order to have pretext or apparent excuse for killing or injuring another, he does some act or uses some words intended or calculated to bring on a difficulty, in which he may appear to have acted in self-defense; but when, as in the case before us, the only question is,\u2014 who began the difficulty, \u2014 or who made the first attack, it is error to charge on provoking the difficulty. Red v. State, 39 Texas Crim. Rep., 424, 46 S. W., 408; White v. State, 42 Texas Crim. Rep., 570, 62 S. W., 575; Pollard v. State, 45 Texas Crim. Rep., 121, 73 S. W., 953; Dugan v. State, 86 Texas Crim. Rep., 130, 216 S. W., 161; Alexander v. State, 95 Texas Crim. Rep., 497, 255 S. W., 408; Frazier v. State, 100 Texas Crim. Rep., 157, 272 S. W., 454. Appellant and his wife swore that they saw Humphrey tearing down a fence which appellant had erected, and that appellant put his pistol in his pocket and started to where Humphrey was, and that when he got within seventy-five or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>one hundred yards, Humphrey raised his shot gun as if to shoot, \u2014 and that appellant drew his pistol and shot, both weapons being fired at the same time. Appellant was on his own land at the time, and after firing again he returned to his house. Humphrey and his wife swore that Humphrey took his shot gun loaded with buck shot as they went down to where they had seen appellant removing posts from an old fence and throwing them over into Humphrey\u2019s enclosure, and when they got to the place appellant was gone. They said they found that appellant had built a fence on their land, and that Humphrey began to pull up the posts of this fence. While so engaged they saw and heard appellant coming from his house, and when some seventy-five or one hundred yards away they claim that appellant fired at them, and that Humphrey picked up his shot gun and fired at appellant. They said thereafter appellant fired his pistol again and it refused to work further and he went back home. Humphrey said he fired at appellant several times \u201cas he ran\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">We find nothing in this record in any way suggesting that appellant fired at Humphrey in order to provoke the latter to attack him so that he might use such attack as a pretext to kill or hurt Humphrey. There is no question but that the charge given was an undue restriction of appellant\u2019s right of self-defense, and we are of opinion that there was no evidence warranting the giving of such charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">For the error mentioned the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
