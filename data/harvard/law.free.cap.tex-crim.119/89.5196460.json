We quote that part of the indictment which is criticised: \u201c* * * did then and there unlawfully break and enter a house then and there occupied and controlled by Mrs. Annie Heath, who is hereinafter called \u2018Injured Party\u2019 with intent then and there to fraudulently take therefrom corporeal personal property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">If the precedents are understood, the averment complies with the requirements of the statute defining the offense, as shown by the decisions of this court, many of which are collated in Branch\u2019s Ann. Tex. P. C., page 1271, sec. 2324, among which are the following: Wilson v. State (Texas Crim. App.), 42 S. W., 290; Price v. State (Texas Crim. App.), 58 S. W., 83. See also form of indictment in Branch\u2019s Ann. Tex. P. C., p. 1271, sec. 2322; also Willson\u2019s Criminal Forms (4th Ed.), page 315, Form No. 624.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"ANp\">\n<em>A ffirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
