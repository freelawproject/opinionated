The penalty assessed against her was a fine of $200 and twenty days in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">The only question properly presented for review is the legal sufficiency of the complaint to charge an offense. This instrument recites that affiant had good reason to believe, etc., but omits the phrase \u201cand does believe\u201d. The inclusion of this last named allegation is statutory. Article 222, subdivision 2, C. C. P. (1925). Its omission from a complaint is fatally defective, as has been held in numbers of cases. Smith v. State, 45 Texas Crim. Rep., 411, 76 S. W., 436; Tompkins v. State (Texas Crim. App.), 77 S. W., 800; Green v. State, 62 Texas Crim. Rep., 50, 136 S. W., 467; Smith v. State, 103 Texas Crim. Rep., 228, 280 S.
