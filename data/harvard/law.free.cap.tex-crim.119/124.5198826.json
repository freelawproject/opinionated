Appellant did not testify. There is no further showing in the record as to who signed the alleged forged check, which was shown to be a forgery. Nor is there any testimony shedding light upon where appellant obtained the other checks found in his possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">The court did not charge on circumstantial evidence. Appellant presented to the trial court a requested charge submitting the law applicable to a case as one of circumstantial evidence, which charge was refused, and the refusal made the subject of a bill of exception. The failure of the trial court to include in his charge a paragraph submitting the law of circumstantial evidence was also excepted to and brought forward in a bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-12\">This court seems to have uniformly held since the case of Nichols v. State, 39 Texas Crim. Rep., 80, 44 S. W., 1091, that under facts like these a charge on circumstantial evidence should be given. See Gaut v. State, 49 Texas Crim. Rep., 493, 94 S. W., 1034; Lasister v. State, 49 Texas Crim. Rep., 532, 94 S. W., 233; Martin v. State, 81 Texas Crim. Rep., 307, 194 S. W., 1105; Cox v. State, 92 Texas Crim. Rep., 498, 244 S. W., 605. Since the case must be reversed for this error, the others mentioned will not be discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-13\">The judgment of the trial court will be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-14\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
