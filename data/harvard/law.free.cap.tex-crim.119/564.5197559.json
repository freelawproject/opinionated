The count charging the use of firearms having been abandoned,the court did not err in refusing a special venire. See Sweeney v. State, 103 Texas Crim. Rep., 393, 281 S. W., 571.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-3\">The verdict signed by the foreman reads as follows: \u201cWe, the jury, find the defendant guilty as charged in the indictment, and assess his punishment at fifty-five years\u2019 confinement in the penitentiary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Complaint that this verdict is so indefinite that it will not support the judgment of conviction cannot be sustained. In Branch\u2019s Ann. Tex. P. C., sec. 646, it is said: \u201cVerdicts should receive a liberal rather than a strict construction, and if the finding of the jury can be reasonably ascertained the verdict should be held good as to form. The object should be to ascertain the intention of the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">This announcement is supported by citation of many precedents. Finding no error in the record, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
