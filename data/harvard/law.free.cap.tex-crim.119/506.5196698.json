The verdict specifically found the appellant guilty of the offense of assault to rape. The offense of attempt to rape is defined in article 1190, P. C., 1925, and the definition is as follows: \u201cIf it appears on the trial of an indictment for rape that the offense though not committed was attempted by the use of force, threats or fraud, but not such as to bring it within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>the definition of an assault with intent to commit rape, the jury may find the defendant guilty of an attempt to rape and assess his punishment at confinement in the penitentiary for any term of years not less than two.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The offense of assault to rape is defined in article 1162, P.
