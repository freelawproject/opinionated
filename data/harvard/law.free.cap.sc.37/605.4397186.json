Each party owned his little account, and brought his own individual action for it. The cases were tried together merely as a matter of convenience. The cases were not thereby consolidated, but still preserved their identity. Judge Wallace had no right to consolidate the two cases, and render one judgment for the aggregate amount of both, and, if he had done so, the judgment might have been set aside as illegal and void.\u201d</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"ANx\">Judgment affirmed.</disposition>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AE3\">October 4, 1892.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"ADA\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"Au_4\">Me.
