After review, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1338\">*1338</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-4\">Hernandez, a native and citizen of Mexico, entered the United States as a lawful permanent resident in September 2004. In 2005, in the State Court of Gwinnett County, Georgia, Hernandez was convicted of one count of simple battery, in violation of Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 16-5-23(a)(2). Section 16-5-23(a)(2) provides that \u201c[a] person commits the offense of simple battery when he or she ... [intentionally causes physical harm to another.\u201d Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 16-5-23(a)(2). According to his Georgia indictment and conviction, Hernandez was convicted of having unlawfully and intentionally caused physical harm to Minerva Garcia Islas, in violation of Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 16-5-23(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-5\">The state court sentenced Hernandez to twelve months\u2019 imprisonment. The state court credited Hernandez with six days of time served and ordered Hernandez to serve the remainder of his twelve-month sentence on probation, subject to various conditions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In December 2005, due to a violation of his probation conditions, the state court revoked Hernandez\u2019s probation. In its probation revocation order, the state court ordered Hernandez to serve twenty-two days in the Gwinnett County jail and continued the remainder of Hernandez\u2019s probation with the further requirement that Hernandez enroll in anger management.</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-6\">In October 2006, the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) issued Hernandez a Notice to Appear (\u201cNTA\u201d). The NTA charged Hernandez with, <em>inter alia, </em>removability pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony \u2014 a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for which the term of imprisonment imposed was at least one year. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-9\">Before the IJ, Hernandez admitted that: (1) he was a native and citizen of Mexico; (2) he was admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident in September 2004; and (3) he was convicted of simple battery in Georgia in March 2005. Hernandez nevertheless denied removability on two grounds. First, Hernandez argued that his simple battery conviction under Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 16-5-23(a)(2) did not meet the relevant definition of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d because his conviction was not for \u201can offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a). Second, Hernandez argued that his term of imprisonment on his conviction was not at least one year because the state court, in revoking his probation, changed his sentence from twelve months to twenty-two days.</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-12\">The IJ rejected Hernandez\u2019s arguments and ordered Hernandez removed to Mexico. On appeal, the BIA rejected Hernandez\u2019s arguments, determining that: (1) his simple battery conviction under Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 16-5-23(a)(2) constituted a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a); and (2) he remained sentenced to twelve months\u2019 confinement for simple battery, \u201cregardless of any additional sentence due to the revocation of probation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-13\">Hernandez timely filed his petition for review in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-14\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-15\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1339\">*1339</page-number>IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Here, because the BIA issued its own decision and relied on the IJ\u2019s findings, we will review both decisions. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1365-4\">To the extent that the BIA\u2019s or the IJ\u2019s decisions were based on legal determinations, our review is <em>de novo. Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247-48 (11th Cir.2001). We review the BIA\u2019s and the IJ\u2019s factual determinations under the substantial evidence test. <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1026-27 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-5\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AWA8\">\n<em>A. Jurisdiction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-6\">As a preliminary matter, we must inquire into subject matter jurisdiction <em>sua sponte </em>whenever it may be lacking. <em>See Chacon-Botero v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>427 F.3d 954, 956 (11th Cir.2005). The text of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) provides that \u201c[njotwithstanding any other provision of law ... no court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in section 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-8\">However, the REAL ID Act of 2005 in turn provides that \u201c[njothing in [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C)] ... shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law.\u201d REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231 (2005) (codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D)). Moreover, in <em>Balogun v. United States Attorney General, </em>425 F.3d 1356, 1359-60 (11th Cir.2005), this Court determined that the question of whether a conviction qualified as an aggravated felony under a different immigration provision was a question of law within our jurisdiction. Accordingly, we conclude that we have subject matter jurisdiction to review Hernandez\u2019s claims in his petition that his state conviction was not an aggravated felony for purposes of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a) (2)(A) (iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-12\">\n<em>B. \u201cCrime of violence\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-13\">As discussed, an alien who has been convicted of an aggravated felony is removable. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). The term \u201caggravated felony\u201d includes a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d as defined by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16, for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). As relevant to this case, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16 defines a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as \u201can offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In order to determine whether Hernandez\u2019s simple battery conviction qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a), we must look to the \u201celements and the nature of the offense of conviction, rather than to the particular facts relating to petitioner\u2019s crime.\u201d <em>Leocal v. Ashcroft, </em>543 U.S. 1, 7, 125 S.Ct. 377, 381, 160 L.Ed.2d 271 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-14\">Georgia\u2019s simple battery statute in \u00a7 16-5-23(a) provides that \u201c[a] person commits the offense of simple battery when he or she either: (1) Intentionally makes physical contact of an insulting or provoking nature with the person of another; or (2) Intentionally causes physical harm to another.\u201d Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 16-5-23(a)(l)-(2). Georgia courts have interpreted this language to require actual physical contact for a simple battery conviction under either prong of the statute. <em>See Hammonds v. State, </em>263 Ga.App. 5, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1340\">*1340</page-number>587 S.E.2d 161, 163 (2003) (stating that \u00a7 16-5-23(a)(l) \u201ccontemplates a touching that does not result in injury, but is nonetheless insulting or provoking in character,\u201d while \u00a7 16-5-23(a)(2) \u201ccontemplates a touching that goes beyond insult to the infliction of pain or physical injury\u201d); <em>McKinney v. State, </em>218 Ga.App. 633, 463 S.E.2d 136, 139 (1995) (\u201cPhysical contact is required for a simple battery but not for aggravated assault.\u201d); <em>Lyman v. State, </em>188 Ga.App. 790, 374 S.E.2d 563, 565 (1988) (stating that \u00a7 16-5-23(a)(2) \u201cconcerns the intentional causation of physical harm, a touching which goes beyond insult to the infliction of pain\u201d); <em>Anderson v. State, </em>170 Ga.App. 634, 317 S.E.2d 877, 878 (1984) (stating that a simple battery conviction under \u00a7 16-5-23 \u201crequires physical contact\u201d); <em>Tuggle v. State, </em>145 Ga.App. 603, 244 S.E.2d 131, 133 (1978) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"Ajz\">While we have not addressed \u00a7 16 \u2014 5\u2014 <em>23(a)(2), </em>this Court has held that a conviction under \u00a7 16-5-23 <em>(a)(1) </em>constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). <em>See United States v. Griffith, </em>455 F.3d 1339 (11th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2028, 167 L.Ed.2d 771 (2007). Section 922(g)(9) makes it unlawful for any person who had been convicted of \u201ca misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\u201d to possess a firearm or ammunition. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(9); <em>Griffith, </em>455 F.3d at 1340-41. Although not an immigration case, <em>Griffith </em>is relevant here because a \u201ccrime of domestic violence\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 922(g)(9) is defined to include an offense, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201c(ii) has, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(33)(A). This is essentially the same definition of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a), the immigration statute at issue here. In <em>Griffith, </em>this Court discussed whether physical contact necessarily involves physical force and held that \u201c[a] person cannot make physical contact \u2014 particularly of an insulting or provoking nature \u2014 with another without exerting some level of physical force.\u201d <em>Griffith, </em>455 F.3d at 1342. In so holding, the <em>Griffith </em>Court expressly declined to insert the requirement of \u201cviolent\u201d force before the words \u201cphysical force\u201d in the statutory definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d and concluded that the simple physical contact made illegal by \u00a7 16-5-23(a)(1) satisfied the \u201cuse of physical force\u201d definition of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d in \u00a7 921(a)(33)(A). <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1366-12\">Here, Hernandez\u2019s simple battery conviction required more than simple physical contact with the victim; it required intentionally causing <em>physical harm </em>to the victim through physical contact. See <em>Hammonds, </em>587 S.E.2d at 163. Given that Georgia courts have interpreted \u00a7 16-5-23(a)(2) as requiring actual physical contact that inflicts pain or injury, and in light of <em>Griffith, </em>we conclude that Hernandez\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 16-5-23(a)(2) constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-13\">Our conclusion is bolstered by our decisions in <em>United States v. Llanos-Agostadero, </em>486 F.3d 1194 (11th Cir.2007), and <em>Hicks v. Moore, </em>422 F.3d 1246 (11th Cir.2005). In <em>Llanos-Agostadero, </em>this Court considered whether it was proper for a defendant to receive a 16-level enhancement under the federal sentencing guidelines for having committed a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d when the defendant\u2019s prior conviction was for the Florida crime of \u201caggravated battery on a pregnant woman.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1341\">*1341</page-number><em>Llanos-Agostadero, </em>486 F.3d at 1196. Notably, in <em>Llanos-Agostadero, </em>the sentencing enhancement defined the term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d just as it is defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a): an offense \u201cthat has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l) cmt. n. l(B)(iii)). Moreover, we stressed in <em>Llanos-Agostadero </em>that the Florida crime of \u201csimple battery\u201d is an essential element of the offense of \u201caggravated battery on a pregnant woman,\u201d and that a defendant commits \u201csimple battery\u201d under Florida law when he either \u201c[1] actually and intentionally touches or strikes another person against the will of another; or ... [2] intentionally causes bodily harm to another person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1197 (quoting Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.03(l)(a)). In other words, the second subpart of the Florida simple battery statute is essentially identical to the second subpart of the Georgia simple battery statute \u2014 the sub-part under which Hernandez was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-5\">The <em>Llanos-Agostadero </em>Court, citing our earlier decision in <em>United States v. Glover, </em>431 F.3d 744 (11th Cir.2005), concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1367-6\">the offense of aggravated battery on a pregnant woman under Florida law has as an element that the defendant commit simple battery, and there is no persuasive reason why simple battery on a law enforcement officer is a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d as this court held in <em>Glover, </em>431 F.3d at 749, while simple battery on a pregnant woman (which constitutes aggravated battery) is not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1367-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 1198 (internal citation omitted). The <em>Llanos-Agostadero </em>Court did not distinguish between the two ways in which one can commit simple battery in Florida, thereby indicating that \u201cintentionally causing] bodily harm to another\u201d \u2014 -language virtually identical to the Georgia statute at issue here \u2014 constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d in this circuit. <em>Id. </em>at 1197-98; <em>see also Glover, </em>431 F.3d at 749 (reciting both ways a defendant can commit simple battery in Florida, including \u201c[ijntentionally causing] bodily harm to another,\u201d and concluding that Florida battery on a law enforcement officer constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the federal sentencing guidelines).</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-9\">Our <em>Hicks </em>decision is also noteworthy. In <em>Hicks, </em>this Court considered, <em>inter alia, </em>whether a plaintiffs constitutional rights were violated when she was strip searched at a Georgia jail. The Court noted that the plaintiff was arrested and charged with the Georgia crime of family violence battery, \u201cthe elements of which are \u2018intentionally causfing] substantial physical harm or visible bodily harm\u2019 to a \u2018past or present spouse.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hicks, </em>422 F.3d at 1252 (quoting Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 16-5-23.1) (alteration in original). The Court then held that the strip search of the plaintiff \u201cviolated no constitutional right,\u201d because the crime with which she was charged \u201cis <em>obviously one of violence. </em>We accept that a person\u2019s being charged with a crime of violence is sufficient to evoke reasonable suspicion that the person may be concealing weapons or contraband.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1252-53 (emphasis added). While <em>Hicks </em>was not a \u00a7 16(a) immigration case, there is no meaningful distinction between the relevant elements of Georgia simple battery and Georgia family violence battery, and the <em>Hicks </em>Court unambiguously classified Georgia family violence battery \u2014 intentionally causing substantial physical harm or visible bodily harm \u2014 -as an \u201cobvious crime of violence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-10\">In light of <em>Griffith, Llanos-Agostadero, Glover, </em>and <em>Hicks, </em>we conclude that Hernandez\u2019s simple battery conviction under Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 16-5-23(a)(2), for \u201c[ijnten-tionally causing] physical harm to anoth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1342\">*1342</page-number>er,\u201d constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a). The clear weight of precedent compels this conclusion, and we reject Hernandez\u2019s arguments to the contrary.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1368-4\">\n<em>C. Twelve months\u2019 imprisonment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AbJ\">Hernandez also contends that he was not convicted of an aggravated felony because he was not sentenced to at least twelve months\u2019 imprisonment on his simple battery conviction. Although Hernandez acknowledges that he was initially sentenced to twelve months\u2019 confinement for the offense in question, he contends that when his probation was revoked, he was \u201cresentenced\u201d and given an \u201centirely new sentence\u201d of twenty-two days in prison. The order revoking Hernandez\u2019s probation states otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-5\">The order revoking Hernandez\u2019s probation indeed states that Hernandez\u2019s probation was revoked and that he was to serve twenty-two days in the Gwinnett County jail. However, the order <em>also </em>provides that Hernandez\u2019s probation was <em>\u201c[cjontin-ued, </em>under supervision, subject to the <em>further </em>provision[s]\u201d that Hernandez be: (1) given credit for time served; (2) \u201creleased instanter\u201d; (3) enrolled in anger management; and (4) given a status check in sixty days. Probation Revocation Order of Dec. 2, 2005 (emphasis added). Because the order revoking Hernandez\u2019s probation makes clear that Hernandez was not given a \u201cnew sentence\u201d of less than twelve months\u2019 imprisonment, but that his probation was continued, we cannot say that the BIA erred when it concluded that Hernandez was removable as an alien convicted of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for which the term of imprisonment imposed was at least one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-8\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we deny Hernandez\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-10\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1364-7\">. Among the conditions of Hernandez\u2019s probation was a requirement that he have \u201cno violent contact with\u201d Ms. Islas.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1365-9\">. The government concedes that Hernandez\u2019s simple battery conviction is not a \"crime of violence\" under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b), which provides an alternate definition for the term.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1366-6\">. In <em>Griffith, </em>this Court declined to follow <em>Flores v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 666 (7th Cir.2003), relied upon by Hernandez along with <em>Ortega-Mendez v. Gonzales, </em>450 F.3d 1010 (9th Cir.2006), for the proposition that a statute must require \"violent\u201d force in order to qualify as a \"crime of violence\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a). <em>See Griffith, </em>455 F.3d at 1345.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1368-6\">. We recognize that Hernandez argues, <em>inter alia, </em>that he could be convicted of simple battery under \u00a7 16-5-23(a)(2) if he put a banana peel in a victim\u2019s path, and the banana peel caused the victim to slip, fall, and sustain physical injury or harm. However, to date Georgia courts have interpreted Georgia\u2019s simple battery statute as requiring physical contact. <em>See Hammonds, </em>587 S.E.2d at 163; <em>McKinney, </em>463 S.E.2d at 139; <em>Lyman, </em>374 S.E.2d at 565; <em>Anderson, </em>317 S.E.2d at 878; <em>Tuggle, </em>244 S.E.2d at 133. We accept the Georgia courts\u2019 interpretation of their own battery statute and see no meaningful distinction between subpart (a)(1) and (a)(2) of Georgia\u2019s simple battery statute in deciding whether a conviction for simple battery under that Georgia statute is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a). If anything, causing physical harm to a victim under \u00a7 16-5-23(a)(2) is even more clearly a \"crime of violence\u201d than a simple physical touching of an insulting or provoking nature under \u00a7 16 \u2014 5\u201423(a)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
