Her answer denying indebtedness was traversed, and, on the trial of the case in a justice\u2019s court, the defendant in fi. fa. testified: \u201cMrs. Barksdale owes me $50.45. What she owes this to me for is for some building work that I had done for her. She got me to fix up some houses. T ceiled part of a house, for which she agreed to pay me $10, and I also did some other odd jobs about the house, for which she was to pay me $4.45. She has paid me $119, and this leaves her owing me $50.45.\u201d There was no further testimony. The jury rendered a verdict finding that the garnishee was indebted to the defendant $50.45. She sued out certiorari, the judge of the superior court overruled the certiorari, and she excepted to that judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b50-10\">Citations by counsel:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"An0\"><em>Herrington </em>v. <em>Shumate Razor Co., </em>6 <em>Ga.

Where a witness testified that he did work of the aggregate value of $14.45 for another person, who paid him $119, and that this left that person owing him $50.45, without more, the status of the mutual account between the parties as established by this evidence would not authorize a verdict for any amount against the person paying the $119. If there had been evidence of a contract for work, in payment upon which the apparent overplus was applicable, the verdict might be supported.</p>\n<p id=\"Aiq\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"AZl\">\n<em>Roam, J., absent.</em>\n</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
