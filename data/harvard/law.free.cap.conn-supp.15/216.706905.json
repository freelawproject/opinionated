On July 28, 1947, the defendant John Clark FitzGerald, a judge of the Court of Common Pleas, issued a temporary injunction restraining the present plaintiff from proceeding with the erection of the station. A motion to dissolve the temporary injunction was heard by Judge FitzGerald and was denied on August 18, 1947. The written motion, as filed with Judge FitzGerald, did not attack the jurisdiction of the Court of Common Pleas, but it was agreed by counsel at the hearing in the present matter that in argument before Judge FitzGerald the present plaintiff claimed that the action in the Court of Common Pleas exceeded its jurisdiction and that the temporary injunction should be dissolved for that reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">The writ of prohibition is sought because it is claimed by the plaintiff that, as the property upon which it is proposed to build the gasoline station exceeds $2500 in value and the gas station building when constructed would also be worth more than $2500, the Court of Common Pleas does not have jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">The Court of Common Pleas is a court of limited jurisdiction. It has, however, exclusive jurisdiction of all civil actions in which both equitable and legal relief are sought and in which the equitable and legal relief, severally and distinctly demanded, do not exceed $2500. General Statutes, Sup. 1941, \u00a7 808f. The writ demanded damages of $2500 and an injunction. The action was therefore prima facie within the jurisdiction of the court. In determining the question of jurisdiction, \u201cThe ordinary rule is \u2018that the matter in demand\u2019 is to be determined upon the- allegations of the complaint and the demand for relief.\u201d <em>Congregation B\u2019nai Israel </em>v. <em>Dymytruk, </em>129 Conn. 415, 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">Writs of prohibition are extraordinary remedies only occasionally used. \u201cA writ of prohibition against an inferior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>court ought not to issue unless it appears that there has been a clear excess of jurisdiction, to the injury of the applicant and that he has no other adequate remedy.\u201d <em>Toomey </em>v. <em>Comley, </em>72 Conn. 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">By appropriate pleading, the question of jurisdiction may be raised in the Court of Common Pleas upon the return of the writ. There is, therefore, an adequate remedy in that court and the issuance of the writ would be contrary to the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">\u201cThe Court of Common Pleas, the Superior Court, and the judges of both, derive their power and jurisdiction from the same sovereignty. They are component parts in one judicial scheme, the whole being designed for the welfare and happiness of the people of the State. Such courts ought at all times to act with mutual respect for and forbearance towards each other. Each should act on the presumption that the other is desirous to exercise only its own' proper jurisdiction. Between such courts jealousies would be unseemly; and any hasty or arbitrary exercise of authority would be inexcusable.\u201d <em>Sherwood </em>v. New <em>England Knitting Co., 68 </em>Conn. 550.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">The writ of prohibition ought not to issue and the application is dismissed with costs to respondents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
