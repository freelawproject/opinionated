She had been raped, beaten, and strangled. Police investigation disclosed that she had last been seen alive the night before in the company of the defendant and one Richard Palaza. Complaints were issued charging each with assault with intent to rape. Palaza was arrested. The police obtained a warrant for the defendant\u2019s arrest as well, but were unable to locate him, as he had left the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">On September 20, Captain John Bukunt and Sergeant Robert Morrill of the Brockton police department met with attorney Kenneth Elias, who had been retained by the defendant. They told Mr. Elias that they had heard that the defendant was telling an account of the victim\u2019s death to the effect that Palaza alone had raped and murdered the victim, while the defendant had merely helped to dispose of the body. They also told Mr. Elias that, if the defendant\u2019s story were true, he should return to Massachusetts to testify against Palaza. Mr. Elias told the officers that he wanted the defendant to receive a grant of immunity from prosecution in exchange for his testimony. Captain Bukunt agreed to discuss the subject of immunity with the assistant district attorney assigned to the investigation, Bernard Mulholland.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">On September 21, Mr. Elias met with Captain Bukunt, Sergeant Morrill, and Mr. Mulholland at the Plymouth court house. After some negotiation, Mr. Elias and Mr. Mulholland reached an agreement. Mr. Elias then brought in the defendant for questioning. Before any substantive questions were asked of the defendant, Mr. Elias memorialized the agreement on the audiotape of the meeting.* <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant was then questioned. The substance of his statement was that Palaza alone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>had raped and killed the victim, while the defendant merely had helped to dispose of the body. The defendant subsequently testified to this effect before a grand jury investigating the victim\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The police and the grand jury continued their investigation. On September 29, Palaza, at his own request, gave a statement to the police and testified before the grand jury, to the effect that the defendant alone had raped and killed the victim, and that he, Palaza, merely had helped to dispose of the body. Ultimately, the grand jury indicted both Palaza and the defendant on charges of aggravated rape and murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Sometime in December, 1983, an assistant district attorney brought to Mr. Elias\u2019s attention the possibility of a conflict of interest in Mr. Elias\u2019s representation of the defendant. Mr. Elias was then representing Captain Bukunt and other members of the Brockton police department on unrelated civil matters. Although the issue had not occurred to him at the time he was retained to represent the defendant, and he did not believe that his representation of Bukunt and the other officers conflicted with his representation of the defendant, Mr. Elias immediately discussed the matter with the defendant. The defendant told him that he did not perceive a conflict, and that he wanted Mr. Elias to continue to represent him. On March 12, 1984, when the case came before the Superior Court, a judge examined the defendant concerning the possibility of a conflict of interest between Mr. Elias\u2019s representation of Captain Bukunt and other Brockton police officers and his representation of the defendant.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judge concluded that the defendant fully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>understood the circumstances, and that he had voluntarily and intelligently decided to continue to be represented by Mr. Elias.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>Palaza was tried separately and was acquitted. In July, 1984, after Palaza\u2019s trial, and before his own, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the indictments on the ground that the Commonwealth had violated its agreement not to prosecute him.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>At the hearing on the motion, Captain Bukunt testified as to the events surrounding the making of the agreement and the defendant\u2019s testifying. Mr. Elias represented to the court that Captain Bukunt had committed perjury in his testimony, and that it would be necessary for Mr. Elias to testify in the defendant\u2019s behalf. Mr. Elias subsequently filed a motion to suppress the defendant\u2019s statement and grand jury testimony; however, it was marked, \u201cLate Don\u2019t Docket,\u201d and no hearing on the motion was held. Neither Captain Bukunt nor Mr. Elias testified at the defendant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">After the hearing, the judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictments, on several grounds.* * <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> First, he ruled that the Commonwealth had not violated the literal terms of the agreement, as the promise not to prosecute applied only to the crime of being an accessory after the fact, and not to that of being a principal to rape and murder. Second, the judge concluded that the agreement was expressly conditioned on the occurrence of two contingencies; namely, the Commonwealth\u2019s subjective, good faith belief that Jones was telling the truth, and the independent corroboration, through further investigation, of Jones\u2019s story that he had participated in the crimes only as an accessory after the fact, and that these conditions had failed. Finally, the judge concluded that Jones had not relied on the Commonwealth\u2019s promise.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">At trial, the defense presented no witnesses and the defendant did not take the stand. Prior to charging the jury, the judge conferred with counsel regarding the instructions he intended to give the jury. The prosecutor stated that he was proceeding, in part, on the theory that Palaza and the defendant were joint venturers in the rape and murder of the victim. Mr. Elias <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>questioned the propriety of such an instruction, in light of Palaza\u2019s previous acquittal. Later in the conference, the judge stated that he would instruct the jury on the theory of joint venture,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the defendant saved his rights as to this instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">The jury found the defendant guilty of aggravated rape and of murder in the first degree. He was sentenced to concurrent life terms at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Cedar Junction.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">The defendant, with new counsel, filed a postconviction motion for a new trial, alleging that he was denied a fair trial, in contravention of his Federal and State constitutional rights, because his trial counsel, Mr. Elias, labored under a conflict of interest which deprived the defendant of effective assistance of counsel. After hearing, the trial judge denied this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">On this appeal from convictions and from the denial of his motion for a new trial, the defendant renews his contention that his trial counsel, Mr. Elias, labored under a conflict of interest which deprived the defendant of his constitutional rights to effective assistance of counsel. He further contends that the trial judge, in deciding to instruct the jury on the theory of joint venture, improperly took into consideration extra-record evidence presented at Palaza\u2019s previous trial, at which the same judge presided, and so denied the defendant his constitutional right to procedural due process. We reject both these contentions, and now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>1. <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel; conflict of interest. </em>The defendant contends, first of all, that his constitutional rights to counsel were violated because Mr. Elias rendered ineffective assistance, as a result of his conflict of interest, at the time the defendant originally was interviewed by the police and the prosecutor. We need not address the question whether Mr. Elias was at this early stage burdened by a conflict of interest, as we conclude that the defendant had no constitutional right to counsel at the time of his interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">\u201c[I]t has been firmly established that a person\u2019s Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment right to counsel attaches only at or after the time that adversary judicial proceedings have been initiated against him.\u201d <em>Kirby </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>406 U.S. 682, 688 (1972), and cases cited. The same is true of the right to counsel under art. 12 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simmonds, </em>386 Mass. 234, 238 (1982). Although a complaint and an arrest warrant had been issued prior to Mr. Elias\u2019s alleged ineffectual assistance, this does not constitute the commencement of \u201cadversary proceedings\u201d in Massachusetts. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smallwood, </em>379 Mass. 878, 884 (1980). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahoney, </em>400 Mass. 524, 528-529 (1987) (dictum); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mandeville, </em>386 Mass. 393, 401 (1982) (dictum); <em>Simmonds, supra </em>at 237-238 (dictum). Having no constitutional right to counsel at this stage in the proceedings, the defendant can scarcely succeed on a claim that the counsel he did have rendered ineffective assistance. \u201cThe right to effective assistance of counsel can be no broader than the right to counsel on which it is based.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>People </em>v. <em>Claudio, </em>59 N.Y.2d 556, 561 n.3 (1983) . See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stirk, </em>392 Mass. 909, 913 (1984) . See also <em>Rachlin </em>v. <em>United States, </em>723 F.2d 1373, 1378 (8th Cir. 1983); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Zazzara, </em>626 F.2d 135, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>138 (9th Cir. 1980); <em>Brown </em>v. <em>United States, </em>551 F.2d 619, 620-621 (5th Cir. 1977). The principle of <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U. S. 436 (1966), has not been raised or argued, nor should it have been, in the circumstances of this case. \u201cApart from the defendant\u2019s right to counsel in exercise of his Miranda rights, he had no other constitutional right to counsel at the preliminary stage of this proceeding.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stirk, </em>392 Mass. 909, 913 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">The defendant further argues that there was a conflict of interest and ineffective assistance during his trial. At all stages of the proceedings following his indictment, of course, the defendant did enjoy a constitutional right to effective, conflict-free assistance of counsel. \u201cA defendant, however, may waive this right to an attorney \u2018unhindered by a conflict of interests. \u2019 \u201d Commonwealth v. <em>Goldman, </em>395 Mass. 495,505, cert. denied, 474 U.S. 906 (1985), and cases cited. In this case, the defendant knowingly, intelligently, and unequivocally indicated his understanding of the circumstances regarding the possibility of a conflict of interest and his desire to continue to be represented by Mr. Elias. See <em>supra </em>note 2. The judge\u2019s examination of the defendant in this regard was as thorough and probing as reasonably can be required.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">The defendant also argues that he should have been provided independent counsel at the March 12, 1984, hearing at which he waived his right to conflict-free counsel, and that the lack of independent counsel vitiates his purported waiver. Although we think that such a procedure is the better practice, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connor, </em>381 Mass. 500, 505 n.5 (1980), we do not think that the judge\u2019s failure to provide independent counsel compels the conclusion that the defendant\u2019s waiver is invalid. Independent counsel might well be required prior to accepting a defendant\u2019s waiver of important constitutional rights in circumstances where there is reason to believe that independent legal advice is reasonably necessary in order to permit the defendant knowingly and intelligently to decide whether to waive or to exercise his rights. But in the circumstances of this case, the judge\u2019s thorough examination of the defendant on this matter, and the defendant\u2019s unequivocal decision to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>continue representation by Mr. Elias, amply support the judge\u2019s ruling that the defendant\u2019s waiver of conflict-free counsel was knowingly and intelligently made.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Having disposed of the defendant\u2019s contention as to conflict of interest, we turn to his argument that Mr. Elias otherwise rendered ineffective assistance at trial. To succeed on such a claim, the defendant must show that his attorney\u2019s performance fell \u201cmeasurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer,\u201d and that this shortcoming \u201clikely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96-97 (1974), and cases cited. No such showing has been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">The defendant criticizes Mr. Elias\u2019s trial strategy and performance generally, but focuses specifically on three actions by Mr. Elias, namely, his failure to object to the admission of the defendant\u2019s statement to the police and grand jury testimony, his asking the judge not to submit to the jury the issue of the voluntariness of these statements, and his introduction of evidence that Palaza had made a statement inculpating the defendant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Viewed with the benefit of hindsight, these actions may appear inexpedient or counterproductive; they were, however, done advisedly and were not irrational decisions. The defendant, in his statement to the police and in his grand jury testimony, exculpated himself and laid the blame for the crimes of rape and murder on Palaza. It was arguably in the defendant\u2019s interest that the jury consider these statements. In seeking the admission of evidence that Palaza had made statements inculpating the defendant, Mr. Elias\u2019s hope was that the jury would find Palaza noncredible, and so tend to believe the defendant\u2019s story.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Moreover, the record reveals that the trial judge carefully examined the defendant as to his understanding of the nature of his attorney\u2019s strategy in introducing Palaza\u2019s statement and in declining a jury instruction on voluntariness, and of the risks involved, and that the defendant both understood and acquiesced in these decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">2. <em>Joint venture jury instruction. </em>The defendant contends that the trial judge, in deciding to instruct the jury on the theory of joint venture, improperly considered evidence presented at Palaza\u2019s trial, at which the same judge presided. The defendant argues that the judge\u2019s consideration of such extra-record evidence denied him his rights to due process and to a fair trial. We disagree. First, it appears that the judge did not ground his ruling on this basis. In his words, such evidence was \u201cprobably not needed on this ruling.\u201d See <em>supra </em>note 4. More importantly, the judge\u2019s ruling was, at worst, correct, but for a different reason. \u201cBecause the nature of the evidence may have suggested to the jury the possibility that there was more than one assailant,* ***** <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the judge was justified in giving a joint enterprise instruction. . . . The evidence was sufficient to show that the defendant was at least a participant, even if he was not the sole perpetrator, and that he possessed the state of mind required for guilt. Nothing further was required for conviction.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. Dyer, 389 Mass. 677, 683 (1983). That Palaza was acquitted does not insulate the defendant from being found guilty as a joint venturer. There is nothing inconsistent between one jury\u2019s finding that there was insufficient evidence to prove Palaza\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and another jury\u2019s finding, in a separate trial, that there was sufficient evidence to prove the defendant\u2019s guilt to that degree of certainty. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cerveny, </em>387 Mass. 280, 285-286 (1982) (separate prosecution for conspiracy not barred by acquittal of sole coconspirator).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">3. <em>G.L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>We have reviewed the entire record as required by G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E (1986 ed.), and decline to order a new trial or to direct the entry of a verdict of a lesser degree of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b296-7\"> Mr. Elias: \u201cLet me put on tape, too, what our agreement was or what I perceive it to be that Jeff Jones has voluntarily appeared here today for the purposes of telling you what he knows on an investigation of the death of [the victim].

Having been the trial judge on that case, although it is probably not needed on this ruling, but having been the trial judge on the Palaza case, I\u2019m satisfied that the evidence submitted to that jury was sufficient, if believed by a jury, to have warranted for a finding of guilty. It\u2019s obvious that the jurors did not find that evidence to be sufficient, and on that basis, Mr. Palaza was found not guilty. I\u2019m satisfied, if it has any basis in light of the recent thinking of the Supreme Judicial Court on other matters, that evidence submitted at that trial was sufficient, if believed, to return verdicts of guilty on the crimes charged, as well as on the theory of joint venture. \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b302-7\"> The above discussion focuses on the constitutional arguments, but the defendant also has failed to show that he is entitled to relief on nonconstitutional grounds. Cf., e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sylvester, </em>388 Mass. 749 (1983). He points to nothing in the record, including the proceedings relating to his motion for a new trial, that would support the subsidiary findings necessary for a judge to grant relief on nonconstitutional, \u201cfairness\u201d grounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b304-7\"> Mr. Elias obtained a ruling from the judge that the defendant could introduce, in their entirety, Palaza\u2019s statement to the police and his grand jury testimony. Mr. Elias subsequently did not introduce Palaza\u2019s statements, but only brought out through the testimony of witnesses for the Commonwealth that Palaza had made statements inculpating the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b304-8\"> To the judge\u2019s inquiry as to the defendant\u2019s theory in introducing Palaza\u2019s statements, Mr. Elias replied, \u201cIt is the defendant\u2019s opinion that the statements of Mr. Palaza are noncredible; that there have been three or four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>different ones made, each one significantly different than the one before where, when stacked up against his [the defendant\u2019s] consistently same statement given on three or four different occasions, it would be beneficial to him in having the jury decide which of the two is credible. He\u2019s of the opinion that they\u2019re going to believe one or the other, rather than disbelieve both.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b305-13\"> For example, Palaza, in his grand jury testimony admitted at trial at the defendant\u2019s request, stated that the defendant alone had raped and killed the victim, and that he, Palaza, had merely helped to dispose of the body. However, an expert on forensic dentistry testified that bite marks inflicted on the victim could not have been made by the defendant. The expert was unable to say whether the marks could have been made by Palaza, as Palaza\u2019s teeth had been physically altered \u201cby a non-dentist\u201d in a manner that precluded certainty in matching them with the bite marks. In addition, a pathologist testified that bruises on the victim\u2019s arms were \u201cconsistent with . . . something, hands, for example, of <em>one or more persons </em>just holding these areas, trying to restrain the decedent, and these are antemor-tem, before she died\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
