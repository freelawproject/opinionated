The plaintiffs challenge the Attorney General\u2019s certification of an initiative petition pursuant to art. 48 of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth. Art. 48, The Initiative, II, \u00a7 3.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The petition, entitled \u201cThe Stop Nuclear Waste Act\u201d by its proponents, would, after July 4,1989, prohibit \u201cgeneration of electric power by commercial nuclear power plants in the Commonwealth by means which result in the production of nuclear waste.\u201d The plaintiffs also seek to prevent the Secretary of the Commonwealth from having the initiative measure placed on the ballot in the upcoming State election. See art. 48, The Initiative, IV, \u00a7 5. The single justice reserved and reported the case for consideration by the full court on the parties\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">The plaintiffs maintain that the petition, if enacted, would constitute a \u201ctaking\u201d of the property of plaintiff Yankee Atomic Electric Company and one other electric utility within the Commonwealth, and that the Attorney General is therefore required under art. 48 to decline to certify the initiative petition for a place upon the ballot.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>This is the second decision and opinion of this court relating to this controversy. On July 7, 1988, this court\u2019s opinion in <em>Yankee Atomic Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>402 Mass. 750 (1988) (Yankee One), ordered the Attorney General to make an examination of the facts relating to the initiative petition. The court stated that the Attorney General\u2019s duty under the Massachusetts Constitution, art. 48, The Initiative, is to certify proposed initiative petitions, and this duty requires the Attorney General to determine, among other things, whether the petition contains matter excluded from the initiative process by art. 48, The Initiative, II, \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Among the matters thus excluded from the initiative are propositions inconsistent with the right to receive compensation for private property appropriated to public use. In response to the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the Attorney General is required to make a factual investigation and analysis in order to determine whether the proposed initiative should be excluded from the ballot, the court stated that the factual examination required of the Attorney General is limited to matters implicit in the language of the petition and to matters of which the Attorney General may properly take official notice. The court, in defining official notice, stated: \u201cFactual matters which are \u2018indisputably true\u2019 are subject to judicial notice; these include \u2018[mjatters of common knowledge or observation within the community.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">. . . Official notice includes matters subject to judicial notice, as well as additional items of which an agency official may take notice due to the agency\u2019s established familiarity with and expertise regarding a particular subject area.\u201d (Citations omitted). <em>Yankee One, supra </em>at 759 n.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>In <em>Yankee One, </em>in ordering that the Attorney General must make the limited factual examination as defined by the court, we further stated that if it is the Attorney General\u2019s decision to affirm his certification after factual examination, the certification shall be considered to be valid ab initio. <em>Id. </em>at 759-760. We also directed that the county court was to retain jurisdiction of this case, and that the single justice in his discretion was to enter orders to expedite the proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 760. Subsequently, pursuant to a time schedule ordered by the single justice by agreement of the parties, the Attorney General on July 19, 1988, filed in the county court a copy of his letter of that date to the Secretary of the Commonwealth in which the Attorney General affirmed his certification of the petition. Subsequently, the single justice reported the case back to the full court without decision.* *** <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The Attorney General in his letter of July 19, 1988, stated: \u201cIn reexamining the validity of the petition I have considered those facts implied by the petition\u2019s language and those officially noticeable. <em>Id. </em>at 759. I have also reviewed facts proffered and arguments submitted by the proponents and opponents of the petition.\u201d He then stated all the facts which he had considered in affirming his original decision that the petition does not establish, on its face, that it effects a regulatory taking.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>In assessing the Attorney General\u2019s conclusion that, on consideration of the pertinent facts, the petition does not, on its face, establish a regulatory taking, we undertake de novo review. <em>Massachusetts Teachers Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>384 Mass. 209, 230 n.18 (1981). See, e.g., <em>Bowe </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>320 Mass. 230, 248-253 (1946) (court engages in de novo review in considering whether petition contains excluded matter); <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>269 Mass. 503, 511-512 (1929) (same). Similarly, in considering what facts are implicit in the petition\u2019s language or are subject to judicial notice, see <em>Yankee One, supra </em>at 759 &amp; n.7, we are not bound by the Attorney General\u2019s determinations. However, in assessing the extent of the facts subject to his official notice, see <em>id., </em>we will defer to the Attorney General\u2019s reasonable determinations. See <em>Massachusetts Teachers Ass\u2019n, supra </em>at 230. Cf. <em>Beth Israel Hosp. Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Medicine, </em>401 Mass. 172, 176 (1987) (\u201call presumptions are in favor of the validity of agency action . . . [and] agencies have leeway in interpreting statutes they enforce\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Guided by our description in <em>Yankee One </em>of the limited factual examination required of the Attorney General, we first consider whether there are facts implicit in the petition\u2019s language or facts subject to judicial notice, i.e., indisputable facts or matters of common knowledge, which the Attorney General should have considered and did not. In our view there are no such facts. The Attorney General\u2019s summary of the facts he considered, <em>supra </em>note 6, contains all the facts which we would consider to be implicit in the petition\u2019s language and subject to judicial notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Next we determine whether there are further facts of which, in accordance with our directions to him in <em>Yankee One, supra </em>at 759 &amp; n.7, the Attorney General should have taken official notice \u201cdue to [his] established familiarity with and expertise regarding a particular subject area.\u201d Beyond question, the person best qualified to determine the extent of his expert knowledge is the Attorney General. In that regard we shall not lightly substitute our view of what are the officially noticeable facts for that of the Attorney General. See <em>Massachusetts Teachers Ass\u2019n, supra </em>at 230. Cf. <em>Beth Israel Hosp. Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>and cases cited. Our review of the summary of the facts he considered, <em>supra </em>note 6, leads us to conclude that the Attorney General did not arbitrarily omit facts apparently subject to his official notice. Accordingly, we accept as <em>reasonable </em>the Attorney General\u2019s determination of the facts he has considered in affirming his certification of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">We next consider whether the facts recognized by the Attorney General preclude him under art. 48, as a matter of law, from certifying the petition. Here we look particularly at the Attorney General\u2019s finding that \u201cI infer from [the petition\u2019s] prohibition that it would prevent Yankee and Boston Edison from generating any electricity by use of their nuclear reactors in their current forms after July 4, 1989.\u201d <em>Supra </em>note 6. Do the facts as properly found compel a conclusion that this petition proposes legislation which would bring about a taking of private property without compensation? We think not, and in so concluding we look to the legal principles which have controlled in cases similar to the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Our review of these principles reveals issues (1) which are relevant to the question whether a taking would ensue from the proposed legislation, and (2) which have not been, and should not be, determined through the Attorney General\u2019s limited examination of the facts at this time. The petition proposes not a permanent physical occupation or confiscation of property, see <em>Loretto </em>v. <em>Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., </em>458 U.S. 419, 426 (1982), but instead a regulation of use of property. As such the question is whether the \u201cregulation goes too far.\u201d <em>Pennsylvania Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Mahon, </em>260 U.S. 393, 415 (1922). Answering this question involves regulatory takings analysis which is peculiarly fact dependent, involving \u201cessentially ad hoc, factual inquiries.\u201d <em>Penn Cent. Transp. Co. </em>v. <em>New York City, </em>438 U.S. 104, 124(1978). <em>See Turnpike Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Dedham, </em>362 Mass. 221, 236 (1972), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1108 (1973). We conclude that at least some of the relevant inquiries which may arise in the ultimate determination whether a taking of property has occurred will involve the kind of lengthy factual determinations which art. 48 does not require or allow to the Attorney General at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">In his letter of July 19, 1988, to the Secretary of the Commonwealth, affirming his certification, the Attorney General describes a number of these factual inquiries, and asserts, that they are relevant to the regulatory takings analysis.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We think <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>that this assertion is well made in that the existence of the undetermined factual issues raised, <em>supra </em>note 7, leads to reasonable, not frivolous, contentions that the petition does not necessarily effect a regulatory taking. This is so because the presently undetermined factual issues pointed to by the Attorney General have been held to be relevant to regulatory takings analysis. Thus, the issue of residual use is relevant, see, e.g., <em>Penn Cent. Transp. Co., supra </em>at 131; <em>MacNeil </em>v. <em>Avon, </em>386 Mass. 339, 341 (1982); <em>Lovequist </em>v. <em>Conservation Comm\u2019n of Dennis, </em>379 Mass. 7, 10 (1979), as is the determination of the diminution in value of the regulated property. See <em>Goldblatt </em>v. <em>Hempstead, </em>369 U.S. 590, 594 (1962). See also <em>Hadacheck </em>v. <em>Sebastian, </em>239 U.S. 394 (1915) (no regulatory taking despite substantial diminution in value); <em>Turnpike Realty Co., supra </em>(same).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">The possibility of compensation through the <em>rate </em>setting process cited by the Attorney General affects the \u201ctakings\u201d analysis in this case in a manner similar to the possibility that an appropriate board might grant a special permit affects the takings analysis in a case where a zoning by-law is challenged. See <em>MacGibbon </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Duxbury, </em>356 Mass. 635, 641 (1970). In both instances the determination whether a taking is present depends, in part, on a factual inquiry regarding possible agency action. The possibility of compensation through the rate setting process also has an impact on the question of the degree of interference with investment-backed expectations caused by the petition. See <em>Penn Central, supra </em>at 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">In sum, the facts implicit in the petition\u2019s language taken with those susceptible to the Attorney General\u2019s official notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>do not establish that the petition effects a regulatory taking.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In this circumstance, it was reasonable and proper for the Attorney General to affirm the petition\u2019s certification. This result is consistent with the firmly established principle that art. 48 is to be construed to support the people\u2019s prerogative to initiate and adopt laws. See <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>371 Mass. 195, 199, 202-203 (1976); 2 Debates in the Massachusetts Constitutional Convention, 1917-1918, at 728 (191.8) (when certifying petitions as to proper form, Attorney General is not to be a censor; people should be allowed to speak and act freely through the initiative process). In reaching this result we are, of course, not reaching or impliedly commenting as to the wisdom of the proposed legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">We affirm the Attorney General\u2019s certification of the initiative petition. The certification was valid ab initio. The Secretary of the Commonwealth shall take the appropriate steps to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>the measure placed on the ballot in the upcoming State elections.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Rescript is to enter forthwith.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b220-12\"> All references are to art. 48 as amended by art. 74, by art. 81, and by art. 108 of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b221-5\"> Article 48, The Initiative, II, \u00a7 2, provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-6\"><em>\u201cExcluded Matters </em>...

Yankee\u2019s plant is located in Rowe, Massachusetts. Boston Edison\u2019s plant is located in Plymouth, Massachusetts. According to the company and local real estate records, Yankee\u2019s plant is situated on approximately 2,200 acres of land in Rowe.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">\u201cYankee and Boston Edison operate their plants under licenses granted to them by the United States government. Yankee\u2019s license to operate the plant in Rowe was issued by the Atomic Energy Commission in 1957. Boston Edison\u2019s license to operate the plant in Plymouth was issued in 1972 by the Atomic Energy Commission. The terms of the licenses include, inter alia, the period of time for which they are issued. Federal law establishes requirements for the operation of the plants. Yankee and Boston Edison invested money to build the plants, and the companies sell or have sold electricity generated by the plants. Contracts for the sale of this electricity are subject to review by appropriate regulatory agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">\u201cThe petition does not, either facially or implicitly, exercise the power of eminent domain or mandate a physical taking or invasion of private property. The apparent impact of the petition, however, would be to prohibit after July 4, 1989, the generation of electricity by these two reactors \u2018by means which result in the production of nuclear waste.\u2019 I infer from this prohibition that it would prevent Yankee and Boston Edison from generating any electricity by use of their nuclear reactors in their current forms after July 4, 1989.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b225-6\"> The Attorney General wrote as follows: \u201cNothing in the petition, how- . ever, restricts alternative uses of the property that might be affected by the petition. The proponents and opponents of the petition dispute the possible alternative uses of the affected property. For example, the proponents assert that the property could be converted to another power source, used for a low-level waste repository, or used for other commercial purposes. The opponents dispute the availability of these proposed alternative uses. In my view, these issues of \u2018residual use\u2019 present questions of fact beyond the scope of my review. Certain of the disputed residual uses implicate future regulatory proceedings, such as licensing proceedings, the outcomes of which are not determinable at this time. In such circumstances I cannot conclude that the petition is \u2018inconsistent\u2019 with the asserted \u2018right to receive compensation for private property appropriated to public use\u2019 simply because one use of the property of the companies is foreclosed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-7\">\u201cSimilarly , the actual values of the Yankee and Boston Edison properties before and after the effective date of the petition are not facts susceptible to official notice. Resolution of such questions would require me to decide, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>among other things, disputable facts such as the actual net values of the properties before and after the effective date of the petition, and the extent to which the plants\u2019 owners may be permitted to recover their investments in the idled plants through existing regulatory processes. There are subsidiary facts, relevant to the actual values of the plants, that are indisputable. For example, I have taken official notice of past real estate tax assessments of the Yankee property by the Town of Rowe. However, the values of the properties in question remain ultimate facts not subject to official notice. \u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b227-6\"> The plaintiffs\u2019 argument that, on the facts as established by the Attorney General, the petition effects a regulatory taking improperly divides the utilities\u2019 property into discrete segments and focuses on the petition\u2019s impact on one of these segments (the reactor) rather than considering the petition\u2019s interference with the utilities\u2019 property rights as to the affected sites as a whole. See <em>Keystone Bituminous Coal Ass\u2019n </em>v. DeBenedictis, 480 U.S. 470, 495-498 (1987). Further, even if such dissection of the utilities\u2019 property is appropriate, possible other uses of the reactor (e.g., nuclear waste storage site), and the possibility of compensation through the rate setting process of the cost of conversion from nuclear to fossil fuel generation of electricity, or for the loss of generating capacity, indicates that the plaintiffs\u2019 argument is not determinative.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b228-7\"> Should the measure be adopted by the people, the plaintiffs are free to pursue, in appropriate fashion, any and all challenges, aside from those decided in this proceeding, they may have to the petition\u2019s validity. See <em>Bowe </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, supra </em>at 243-248; <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., supra </em>at 513-515. In ruling that the Attorney General\u2019s certification of the petition was proper, we do not preclude a determination, on appropriate proof and following the necessary factual resolutions, that the petition effects a regulatory taking as applied to particular property. We merely hold that, on the limited findings of fact permitted to the Attorney General at this time, the petition does not necessarily involve such a taking.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b228-8\"> Two Justices of the court found it necessary to recuse themselves from participating, and thus this matter was left to five Justices for decision. Although only three of the Justices concur in the result <em>supra, </em>the full panel is in agreement that judgment shall enter as above. See G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 2 (1986 ed.) (\u201cfour justices . . . constitute a quorum to decide all matters required to be heard by [the court]\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Geraway, </em>364 Mass. 168, 186 (1973) (decision of three Justices disposes of case).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b228-5\">Lynch, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAL\">(dissenting, with whom Liacos, J., joins). It has long been recognized that a governmental taking of property may be accomplished without the formal apparatus of eminent domain; a taking may result from a government regulation in a particular area. <em>First English Evangelical Lutheran Church </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, </em>482 U.S. 304, 315-316 (1987). This type of taking has been referred to as a \u201cregulatory\u201d taking or \u201cinverse condemnation.\u201d As noted by Justice Stevens, \u201cHowever confusing some of our criminal procedure cases may be, I do not believe they have been as open-ended and standardless as our regulatory takings cases are.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 340 n.17 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Be that as it may, certain overarching precepts may be identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Any discussion of the law of regulatory takings must begin with the landmark case of <em>Pennsylvania Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Mahon, </em>260 U.S. 393 (1922). At issue in <em>Mahon </em>was the validity of a Pennsylvania statute \u201cforbid[ding] the mining of anthracite coal in such way as to cause the subsidence of, among other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>things, any structure used as a human habitation, with certain exceptions . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 412-413. It was admitted that the statute acted to destroy the coal company\u2019s previously existing right to mine the coal beneath the affected structures notwithstanding any subsidence, but, the plaintiffs contended, the statute was nonetheless valid as a legitimate exercise of the State\u2019s police power, for which no compensation need be provided. <em>Id. </em>at 413. The Court, speaking through Justice Holmes, disagreed, and in its opinion set out what have become the bedrock principles of regulatory takings law.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">First, the Court noted, not every government action is a taking merely because the action incidentally diminishes property values. \u201cGovernment hardly could go on if to some extent values incident to property could not be diminished without paying for every such change in the general law. As long recognized, some values are enjoyed under an implied limitation and must yield to the police power.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 413. However, the Court recognized, that implied limitation is itself subject to limits, \u201cor the contract and due process clauses are gone. One fact for consideration in determining such limits is the extent of the diminution. When it reaches a certain magnitude, in most if not all cases there must be an exercise of eminent domain and compensation to sustain the act. So the question depends upon the particular facts. The greatest weight is given to the judgment of the legislature, but it always is open to interested parties to contend that the legislature has gone beyond its constitutional power.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus the Court advocated a kind of ad hoc balancing of the public interest served as against the private interest harmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">In determining that \u201cthe legislature [had] gone beyond its constitutional power,\u201d the Court reasoned that any public interest to be served by the statute was slight. The Court recognized that the Act was not justified as a protection of public safety since that \u201ccould be provided for by notice\u201d to the surface landowner. <em>Id. </em>at 414. Rather, the Court considered the Act to be a species of economic regulation, designed to shift the cost of the. surface owners\u2019 misfortunes onto the shoulders of the coal company. See <em>id. </em>at 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>On the other hand, the Court calculated the private detriment to be great: \u201c \u2018For practical purposes, the right to coal consists in the right to mine it.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clearview Coal Co., </em>256 Pa. St. 328, 331. What makes the right to mine coal valuable is that it can be exercised with profit. To make it commercially impracticable to mine certain coal has very nearly the same effect for constitutional purposes as appropriating or destroying it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 415. In the words of a Massachusetts case, the Act deprived the coal company\u2019s property of \u201call practical value.\u201d <em>MacGibbon </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Duxbury, </em>356 Mass. 635, 641 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Later Supreme Court cases have expanded upon the <em>Mahon </em>formulation and, in so doing, have identified three factors which are of particular significance to the regulatory taking question: (1) the economic impact of the regulation; (2) its interference with reasonable investment-based expectations; and (3) the character of the governmental action. E.g., <em>Keystone Bituminous Coal Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>DeBenedictis, </em>480 U.S. 470, 493-495 (1987); <em>Ruckleshaus </em>v. <em>Monsanto Corp., </em>467 U.S. 986, 1005 (1984); <em>Kaiser Aetna </em>v. <em>United States, </em>444 U.S. 164, 175 (1979). <em>See Nassr v. Commonwealth, </em>394 Mass. 767, 770 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">The court relies on the recent case of <em>Keystone Bituminous Coal Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>DeBenedictis, </em>480 U.S. 470 (1987), to explicate the question of when a regulation goes too far. I believe that the <em>Keystone </em>decision has no application to the matter in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">In <em>Keystone, </em>the plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of a statute superficially similar to that challenged in <em>Mahon. </em>The Pennsylvania statute, known as the Bituminous Mine Subsidence and Land Conservation Act, required coal companies to keep in the ground at least 50% of the coal beneath defined structures to protect those structures from subsidence damage. The coal companies in a facial attack on the statute sought to enjoin its enforcement alleging that it violated the takings clause of the Fifth Amendment. The companies neither alleged nor proved any specific injury; rather, they contended that the mere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>enactment of the statute constituted a taking. The Supreme Court concluded that the companies had not proven a taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The <em>Keystone </em>Court did not repudiate the principles of <em>Mahon. </em>Indeed the Court affirmed that \u201c[t]he two factors that the <em>[Mahon] </em>Court considered relevant\u201d \u2014 that is, the nature and extent of the public interest versus the nature and extent of the private harm \u2014 \u201chave become integral parts of our takings analysis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 485.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">However, the Court considered the Subsidence Act analogous to a State\u2019s \u201cexercising its police power to abate activity akin to a public nuisance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 488. There is nothing remarkable or that in any way diminishes traditional taking concepts by recognizing the equally established concept that a property owner cannot use his property in such a way as to constitute a public nuisance. Furthermore, the court concluded the Subsidence Act did not render mining of coal \u201ccommercially impracticable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 493. Thus <em>Keystone </em>affirms the fundamental principles of <em>Pennsylvania Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Mahon </em>and its progeny, that any economic regulation that renders the existing use of the owners\u2019 property commercially impractical and contrary to reasonable investment-backed expectations constitutes a taking. Applying this test, I conclude that the petition would effect an unconstitutional taking of property without just compensation and, therefore, the petition may not be certified.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">It is undisputed that the effect of the petition is to shut down Yankee\u2019s operations: Section 2 of the petition prohibits generation of electricity by means which result in the production of nuclear waste at commercial electric nuclear power plants on or after July 4, 1989. We take judicial notice of the fact that, in the current state of the art, it is impossible to produce electricity by nuclear fission without producing nuclear waste. Finally, it is public record that Yankee\u2019s license does not expire until 1997.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>The economic impact of the regulation is catastrophic. Obviously it renders the production of nuclear power \u2014 Yankee\u2019s reason for being in business \u2014 \u201ccommercially impracticable.\u201d Furthermore, it converts an economically viable enterprise into an economic albatross. In testimony filed before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Attorney General stated that, after a plant is irradiated \u201c[b]oth the plant and plant site become nearly irreversibly committed to a nuclear facility. This is because much of the plant equipment will be made radioactive and because the site itself becomes (de-facto) a long-term radioactive waste storage facility since there is no approved storage facility available to receive the irradiated fuel.\u201d Thus the Attorney General himself has conceded that an irradiated but inoperative nuclear power plant is nothing more than nuclear <em>waste. </em>Cf. <em>Commissioner of Natural Resources </em>v. <em>S. Volpe &amp; Co., </em>349 Mass. 104, 110-111 (1965) (court unable to tell from record whether all uses of land had been eliminated by regulation). We also take notice of the fact that after the plant ceases production Yankee will be left with the burden of decommissioning it. Atomic Energy Commission Reg. Guide 1.86; 50 Fed. Reg. 28,5600 (1985) (to be codified at 10 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 30, 40, 50, 51, 70 &amp; 72) (burden of decommissioning); G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 70 (1986 ed.) (Federal law is judicially noticeable); 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 2507 (1982 ed.) (contents of Federal Register shall be judicially noticed). Thus, this is a classic case of a regulation leaving a landowner with only the burdens of ownership and none of the benefits. See <em>MacGibbon </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Duxbury, </em>356 Mass. 635, 641 (1970).* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>This is not a case of the government\u2019s \u201cfreezing\u201d a property into its existing use or prohibiting contemplated future uses not based upon reasonable investment-backed expectations. See <em>Penn Cent. Transp. Co. </em>v. <em>New York City, </em>438 U.S. 104, 138 (1978). On the contrary, the petition at issue here would eliminate altogether the existing primary use of Yankee\u2019s property. Compare <em>Penn Cent, </em>with <em>Pennsylvania Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Mahon, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">The government\u2019s police power, however, depends to great extent on the <em>nature </em>of the government action. Thus, what was considered a taking in <em>Mahon </em>was deemed a valid police power regulation in <em>Keystone </em>because of a crucial difference in the nature of the government action. That is, in <em>Mahon, </em>the government action \u201cserved only private interests,\u201d while in <em>Keystone </em>the government action was justified by health and safety concerns. <em>Keystone, supra </em>at 484. Similarly, in cases such as <em>Mugler </em>v. <em>Kansas, </em>123 U.S. 623 (1887) (prohibiting manufacture of liquor); <em>Hadacheck </em>v. <em>Sebastian, </em>239 U.S. 394 (1915) (prohibiting operation of brickyard in residential area); and <em>Goldblatt </em>v. <em>Hempstead, </em>369 U.S. 590 (1962) (prohibiting excavation for sand and gravel below water line), the government may prohibit \u201cnoxious use of property\u201d in the interest of public health and safety. <em>Penn Central, supra </em>at 145 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">Here, the basis for the governmental action is stated to be that it is \u201cuneconomical and unwise to continue to generate electric power in the Commonwealth by means which result in the production of nuclear waste when there is no method for disposal of nuclear waste. The purpose of this Act is to protect the people of Massachusetts from the consequences of this uneconomical and unwise course . . . .\u201d Thus, by its own terms, the petition seeks not to abate any public nuisance, but only to shelter the public from what its signers see as an economically unwise method of producing electricity.* * <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>Moreover, we must recognize that use of the property which is restricted by the statutes is one that is authorized by a Federal permit and thus calls into question the preemption doctrine. The Atomic Energy Act of 1954, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2011 et seq., gives the Federal government exclusive control over radiological safety issues involved in the construction and operation of nuclear power plants. <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>State Energy Resources Conservation &amp; Dev. Comm\u2019n, </em>461 U.S. 190 (1983). Force of logic compels the conclusion that nuclear power, which is both permitted and extensively regulated by the government, cannot constitute a public nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">The signers of the petition seek to impose upon two power companies and their ratepayers the cost of eliminating what the signers perceive to be an \u201cuneconomical\u201d means of producing power. Leaving aside the question of the extent to which it is the proper function of government to close down \u201cuneconomical\u201d businesses, this petition impermissibly seeks to impose upon two power companies and their ratepayers the transaction cost of shifting from an assertedly less economical means of producing power to some more economical means.* ** <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is a fundamental tenet that government may not single out a few citizens to bear burdens properly borne by the public as a whole. See <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>United States, </em>364 U.S. 40, 49 (1960); <em>Pennsylvania Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Mahon, supra </em>at 416.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">In sum, if enacted, the petition would render production of nuclear power at Yankee\u2019s plant commercially impossible, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>thus upsetting Yankee\u2019s reasonable expectation that, on the basis of its Federal license, it could continue to operate as a nuclear power plant until 1997. The petition, if enacted, would eliminate all commercial use of the property and convert an economic use to an economic burden on the owners. Hence, the Attorney General could not properly certify that the petition contained no excluded matter. <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b231-8\"> It has been held that a license to operate a business is a protected property interest under the due process clause if it cannot be taken away from its holder before a time certain and in the absence of misconduct. <em>Baer </em>v. <em>Wauwatosa, </em>716 F.2d 1117, 1122 (7th Cir. 1983). Thus, the petition at issue here might also be analyzed as effecting a taking of Yankee\u2019s license, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>since the effect of the petition is to terminate Yankee\u2019s business before that license expires. Compare <em>Boston Elevated Ry. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>310 Mass. 528 (1942) (legislative termination of franchise <em>in accordance with condition of grant for breach of the condition </em>cannot be regarded as a taking).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The mere fact that a portion of Yankee\u2019s property is affected may, despite the defendants\u2019 assertions, indicate a taking. For while the United States Supreme Court has intimated that various parts of property are not to be \u201csegmented\u201d to determine whether there has been a taking, <em>Keystone </em>at 500-501, that interpretation of the Fifth Amendment of the Federal Constitution is not necessarily applicable to article 10 of the Declaration of Rights, which states that \u201cno <em>part </em>of the property of any individual can, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>with justice, be taken from him, or applied to public uses, without his consent, or that of the representative body of the people\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b233-12\"> While we have upheld public regulations <em>preserving </em>existing uses, see <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>333 Mass. 773 (1955); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>333 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>Mass. 773 (1955); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>333 Mass. 783 (1955), we are aware of no case in which such a purpose was sufficient to <em>eliminate </em>the primary existing use of an individual\u2019s property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b234-8\"> The petition does not address the economic cost of \u201cacid rain\u201d and the \u201cgreenhouse effect,\u201d which is an environmental cost of producing electrical power by the conventional means of burning fossil fuel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b234-10\"> Thus, the instant case is to be distinguished from <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Schoene, </em>276 U.S. 272 (1928), where landowners were required to cut down their cedar trees in order to prevent a blight on the State\u2019s apple crop, an emergency measure necessary to preserve this important agricultural activity. No emergency is present here. Cf. <em>Davidson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 541, 549 (1979) (no taking where government took over operation of nursing home in emergency situation).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b235-5\"> The Attorney General strenuously argues that the factual record is insufficient to establish a taking, and, therefore, that he may certify that the petition contains no excluded matter. Even were we to accept the Attorney General\u2019s premise, his conclusion does not necessarily follow. The United States Supreme Court has expressed its hesitancy to address takings claims on less than a fully developed record. <em>Pennell </em>v. <em>San Jose, </em>485 U.S. 1, 8-9 (1988). However, the justification for that Court\u2019s hesitancy was an unwillingness to reach constitutional claims unnecessarily. Here, on the other hand, it is the express constitutional function of the Attorney General to examine the constitutional issues presented by an initiative petition to ensure that the rights of the individual under our State Constitution are adequately protected from majoritarian encroachment. Article 48 admonishes that the Attorney General \u201cshall certify\u201d that the petition contains no excluded matter. As we noted in <em>Yankee One, </em>the word \u201ccertify\u201d in art. 48 means \u201cto make certain, as a fact; to attest authoritatively; to verify. . . .\u201d <em>Yankee Atomic Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>402 Mass. 750, 757 (1988). That language would seem to indicate that if there is any reasonable possibility that the petition impinges on an excluded matter, it may not be certified. Thus the fact that a petition leaves open certain fact questions cannot justify the Attorney General in abdicating his constitutional function as gatekeeper against an initiative\u2019s potential infringement upon important individual rights. Where the petition, read in light of both its apparent factual impact and officially noticeable facts, discloses a reasonable possibility that the petition contains an excluded matter, it is the Attorney General\u2019s constitutional duty to deny certification.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
