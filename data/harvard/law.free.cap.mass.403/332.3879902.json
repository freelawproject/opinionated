The case began as an attempt by William A. Hahn and thirteen other residents of the town of Stoughton (collectively referred to as \u201cHahn\u201d) to set aside the approval of a subdivision plan by the planning board of Stoughton (planning board) submitted by Salvatore B. Simeone, Benjamin A. Simeone, Jr., and Maria J. Luongo (developers). The Superior Court judge (a) granted summary judgment for the planning board and the developers, (b) denied Hahn\u2019s motion to amend the complaint, stating that the proposed amendment was \u201cimmaterial if not frivolous,\u201d (c) denied Hahn\u2019s motion to reconsider both the granting, of summary judgment and the denial of the motion to amend, and (d) with respect to the developers\u2019 motion for attorney\u2019s fees incurred in defending against the motion to amend and motion to reconsider, ruled \u201cafter extensive hearing \u2014 no action taken at this time as I anticipate appeal by plaintiff . . . and am reluctant to cause a \u2018chilling effect\u2019 by allowing this motion on this date. Action deferred until appellate review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>Hahn appealed. The Supreme Judicial Court denied his application for direct appellate review. The Appeals Court affirmed the judgment for the defendants, and awarded double costs. <em>Hahn </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Stoughton, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 553 (1987).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Hahn applied for further appellate review, which the Supreme Judicial Court denied. 400 Mass. 1106 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Following the Appeals Court\u2019s decision, the developers filed a motion in the Supreme Judicial Court for attorney\u2019s fees, <em>costs, </em>and expenses incurred in opposing Hahn\u2019s applications for direct and further appellate review. The single justice, to whom this court referred the motion, denied it, stating that there was merit to the developers \u2019 contention that Hahn \u2019 s claims were frivolous, but he was not persuaded that Hahn had acted in bad faith. The developers now appeal from the single justice\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Following the Appeals Court\u2019s decision, Hahn commenced a proceeding in this court, pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3 (1986 ed.) (general superintendence powers), seeking to have this court set aside the Appeals Court\u2019s award of double costs. A single justice of this court denied relief, and Hahn now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Also following the Appeals Court\u2019s decision, the developers renewed their motion in the Superior Court for attorney\u2019s fees incurred in defending against Hahn\u2019s motion to amend and motion for reconsideration. The Superior Court judge awarded the developers $3,795 in attorney\u2019s fees. Hahn sought review in the Appeals Court pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6G (1986 ed.) (appellate review of attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 6F). A single justice of the Appeals Court affirmed, and Hahn appealed. The appeal is here on this court\u2019s granting of the developers\u2019 application for direct appellate review. We now affirm each of the decisions below.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">1. <em>Hahn\u2019s Appeal from an Order of the Single Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court Denying Relief from the Appeals Court\u2019s Award of Double Costs.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">The Appeals Court awarded double costs to the developers pursuant to Mass. R. A. P. 25, as amended, 378 Mass. 925 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>(1979), which states that \u201c[i]f the appellate court shall determine that an appeal is frivolous, it may award . . . double costs to the appellee.\u201d Hahn sought relief from a single justice of the Supreme Judicial Court pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. The single justice declined to set aside the double costs award.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">General Laws c. 211, \u00a7 3, states: \u201cThe supreme judicial court shall have general superintendence of all courts of inferior jurisdiction to correct and prevent errors and abuses therein if no other remedy is expressly provided.\u201d Orders entered by a single justice of the Supreme Judicial Court, however, are not to be disturbed absent an \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d or \u201cclear error of law.\u201d <em>Palaza </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>393 Mass. 1001, 1002 (1984). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Yelle, </em>390 Mass. 678, 686 (1984). We conclude that the single justice neither abused his discretion nor made an error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">The single justice acted properly in light of G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, which allows use of the court\u2019s general superintendence powers only if \u201cno other remedy is expressly provided.\u201d The extraordinary remedy provided by c. 211, \u00a7 3, should be invoked only when appellate review is otherwise unavailable. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lam Hue To, </em>391 Mass. 301, 306 n.4 (1984). In the instant case, the other remedy expressly provided to Hahn was an application for further appellate review of the Appeals Court\u2019s decision. Hahn had, prior to his hearing before the single justice of the Supreme Judicial Court, sought further appellate review, which the Supreme Judicial Court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-11\">Although unnecessary to our determination, we add that the Appeals Court\u2019s opinion, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 553 (1987), discloses ample support for the imposition of double costs.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-12\">2. <em>Hahn\u2019s Appeal from an Order of a Single Justice of the Appeals Court Affirming the Superior Court Judge\u2019s Award of Attorney\u2019s Fees.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-13\">The Superior Court judge awarded, and a single justice of the Appeals Court affirmed, attorney\u2019s fees to the developers for defending against Hahn\u2019s motion for leave to amend the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>complaint, and motion for reconsideration pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, which states that a court shall grant attorney\u2019s fees where the opponent\u2019s claims are frivolous and not advanced in good faith.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This court reviews the finding appealed from as if it were initially deciding the matter, a de novo review.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We conclude that the attorney\u2019s fees were properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The Superior Court judge sifted through numerous papers filed by Hahn including multiple affidavits, motions to amend, motions to reconsider, motions for summary judgment, letters addressed to the judge, motions in opposition, a motion to strike, and a motion to vacate orders. It is within this context of pleadings, petitions, and appearances by Hahn that the judge concluded that Hahn had acted frivolously and in an absence of good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Hahn\u2019s amended complaint raised three points: (1) a predecessor in title had agreed to loam and reforest the gravel site; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>(2) the subdivision approval would require soil removal which had been denied to a predecessor in title; and (3) the owners of the land had a fraudulent deed because it failed to recite consideration. Each of the three theories was irrelevant to the central issue in the case, the correctness of the planning board\u2019s approval of a subdivision plan which required only regulatory compliance. The frivolousness of Hahn\u2019s actions in his motions to amend and to reconsider are readily apparent in the lack of weight or importance in these claims, and their failure to controvert the material points of the opposing pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">An award of attorney\u2019s fees, however, also requires a showing that Hahn\u2019s claims were not advanced in good faith. Good faith implies an absence of malice, an absence of design to defraud or to seek an unconscionable advantage. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 623-624 (5th ed. 1979). Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (1987) imposes sanctions upon actions that are not in good faith, those \u201cinterposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation.\u201d Sufficient evidence existed in the record before both the Superior Court judge and the single justice of the Appeals Court from which to infer an absence of good faith. In our view, based on Hahn\u2019s multiple actions throughout the course of the litigation, we reach the same conclusion as the judges below and award attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">We recognize the implication of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, that a judge should consider the possible chilling effect of a decision to award attorney\u2019s fees. At this point, there is no danger of chilling any possible appeal based on <em>a </em>novel argument of law. An award of attorney\u2019s fees is being affirmed because of a party\u2019s irrelevant and immaterial claims, rather than novel theories of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">3. <em>The Developers\u2019 Appeal from an Order of the Single Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court Denying Their Motion for Attorney\u2019s Fees.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">The developers sought attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, which directs a court to award fees to a party if \u201call or substantially all of the [opponent\u2019s] claims . . . were wholly insubstantial, frivolous and not advanced in good faith.\" <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>This court, hearing an appeal, must review the finding appealed from \u201cas if it were initially deciding the matter\u201d and may modify the judgment as warranted by the facts. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6G. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The single justice applied the \u201cfrivolous and not advanced in good faith\u201d standard to the record before him, which consisted of petitions for direct and further appellate review after the Appeals Court\u2019s decision. He concluded that \u201cwhile there [was] merit in the contention that the [plaintiffs\u2019] claims were frivolous, [he was] not persuaded that the [plaintiffs] acted in bad faith.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Based on the record and other material the single justice had before him, we conclude, as the single justice could have, that Hahn\u2019s frivolous undertaking might be based upon poor judgment, rather than an absence of good faith, insincerity, or ill will.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We emphasize here the limited record before the single justice, which we now review de novo, as compared to the extended record which was before the Superior Court judge. We, like the single justice, would be reluctant to find ill will or insincerity in Hahn\u2019s action based on two applications for further and direct appellate review, and on the details available in the Appeals Court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">4. <em>The Developers\u2019 Motion for Attorney\u2019s Fees for Hahn\u2019s Current Appeal to this Court.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">We also have before us the developers\u2019 motion for attorney\u2019s fees for defending against Hahn\u2019s appeals to this court. For the same reasons which impelled the Appeals Court, the Superior Court judge, and the single justice of the Appeals Court, we, with the entire record before us, inescapably reach the conclusion that Hahn has made frivolous claims that were \u201cnot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>advanced in good faith,\u201d and therefore award attorney\u2019s fees. We remand the case to the single justice of this court for assessment of appropriate attorney\u2019s fees for Hahn\u2019s appeals to this court in which he sought to have the Appeals Court\u2019s award of double costs set aside and in which he sought reversal of the Superior Court judge\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b350-10\"> The facts for purposes of these appeals are adequately stated in the Appeals Court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b351-14\"> The opinion of the Appeals Court also summarizes part of the reasoning on which the Superior Court judge could rely in awarding attorney\u2019s fees, as discussed <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b352-7\"> General Laws c. 231, \u00a7 6F, states in pertinent part: \u201cUpon motion of any party in any civil action in which a . . . judgment has been made by a judge or ... by a jury, ... the court may determine, after a hearing, as a separate and distinct finding, that all or substantially all of the claims, . . . whether of a factual, legal or mixed nature, made by any party who was represented by counsel . . . were wholly insubstantial, frivolous and not advanced in good faith. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">\u201cIf such a finding is made with respect to a party\u2019s claims, the court shall award to each party against whom such claims were asserted an amount representing the reasonable counsel fees and other costs and expenses incurred in defending against such claims. . . . &lt;&lt;</p>\n<p id=\"b352-11\">\u201cNo finding shall be made that any claim, defense, setoff or counterclaim was wholly insubstantial, frivolous and not advanced in good faith solely because a novel or unusual argument or principle of law was advanced in support thereof.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b352-12\"> General Laws c. 231, \u00a7 6G, states in pertinent part: \u201cAny party aggrieved by a decision on a motion pursuant to section six F may appeal .... If the matter arises in the superior, land, housing or probate court, the appeal shall be to the single justice of the appeals court at the next sitting thereof. If the matter arises in the appeals court or before a single justice of the supreme judicial court, the appeal shall be to the full bench of the supreme judicial court. The court hearing the appeal shall review the finding and award, if any, appealed from as if it were initially deciding the matter, and may withdraw or amend any finding or reduce or rescind any award when in its judgment the facts so warrant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b354-9\"> The single justice\u2019s reference to \u201cbad faith\u201d rather than the \u201cnot advanced in good faith\u201d language in G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, is not crucial. We believe that the single justice was applying the same standards we now apply. Furthermore, we now conduct a de novo review and are not bound by the single justice\u2019s finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b354-10\"> Hahn has filed a motion to dismiss the developers\u2019 appeal for failure to comply with appellate rules, for failing to make a timely designation of the appendix contents and statement of issues. Because Hahn prevails on the developers\u2019 appeal, we need not address his motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
