The plaintiffs assert constitutional deficiencies and violations of statutory requirements in proceedings before local authorities<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> under G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 48 (1986 ed.), and in the review and approval of the project by the Secretary of the Executive Office of Communities and Development (EOCD) under \u00a7 48. Additionally, the EOCD raises an issue of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">General Laws c. 121B (1986 ed.) provides a comprehensive scheme for the approval of an urban renewal plan. Section 46 places on a local urban renewal agency<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the responsibility for determining what areas within its jurisdiction are decadent, substandard, or blighted open areas. The urban renewal agency is required to prepare an urban renewal plan in order to begin the process of redeveloping and improving these areas. After the urban renewal plan has been prepared, the local planning board must find that the plan is based on a local survey and con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>forms to a comprehensive plan for the area as a whole. Approval of the plan by the city council then is required after a public hearing. After local approval, the Department of Community Affairs (department) reviews the plan. The department must concur in the local planning board\u2019s findings, and determine that the urban renewal plan is sufficiently complete and the project area is an appropriate subject for renewal. When the department gives its approval, the local urban renewal agency may undertake the project. See G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7\u00a7 46-48.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The project consists of three major parcels: (1) a park of approximately forty-seven acres fronting the Merrimack River to be created by the Department of Environmental Management; (2) a parcel designated for educational and recreational use of some eighty-five acres running from the park parcel to Andover Street. Emerson College has an agreement with the redevelopment authority to purchase this parcel; (3) a new major transportation connector between the new riverfront park and college campus and downtown Lawrence, to be built by the city.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The proponents of the plan state that by improving a large tract of riverfront land \u201cthe Riverfront Urban Renewal Project is expected to address the problems of a blighted open area and provide a catalyst for development and economic revival in Greater Lawrence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>It is undisputed that Lawrence, as compared to other Massachusetts cities, has had serious economic difficulties. Unemployment has been and continues to be above the State and Federal averages and welfare caseloads continue to be on the rise despite the efforts of the State government.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The plaintiffs sought review in the Superior Court of the approval of the project by the local authorities and the EOCD. After a trial commenced, the judge in the Superior Court granted summary judgment on the civil rights claims for the defendants in the third action. Trial concluded on the remaining claims and the judge entered judgments for all defendants. The plaintiffs appealed. We granted their application for direct appellate review, and now affirm the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">1. <em>Jurisdiction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">We first address the EOCD\u2019s claim that the Superior Court lacks jurisdiction to review the approval of an urban renewal plan. We have consistently stated that courts may review the purpose for which land is taken. <em>Luke </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Turnpike Auth., </em>337 Mass. 304, 308 (1958). <em>McAuliffe &amp; Burke Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Auth., </em>334 Mass. 28, 30-31 (1956). <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Mayor of Beverly, </em>309 Mass. 388, 390 (1941). Here, the plaintiffs claim the taking was not for a public purpose, the redevelopment of a blighted open area, but instead was for the purpose of relocating Emerson College. Judicial review is available for such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">Although G. L. c. 121B does not expressly grant the Superior Court jurisdiction to review the actions of the EOCD-and local <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>authorities,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> this absence of an express grant does not immunize these actions from judicial scrutiny, as the EOCD contends. See <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Redevelopment Auth., </em>374 Mass. 37, 53 (1977); <em>West Broadway Task Force, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Community Affairs, </em>363 Mass. 745, 750 (1973). Similarly, the legislative nature of the findings by the local authorities and the EOCD, see, e.g., <em>Reid </em>v. <em>Acting Comm\u2019r of the Dep\u2019t of Community Affairs, </em>362 Mass. 136, 143 (1972), and the absence of a statutory requirement that the EOCD explain its findings, see G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 48, do not indicate a legislative intent to preclude review. These factors indicate a legislative scheme which provides for less rigorous judicial scrutiny, rather than no judicial scrutiny. See <em>Boston Edison Co., supra. </em>Cf. <em>Reid, supra; Moskow </em>v. <em>Boston Redevelopment Auth., </em>349 Mass. 553, 561 (1965), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 983 (1966); <em>Worcester Knitting Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Worcester Hous. Auth., </em>335 Mass. 19, 21-22 (1956); <em>Bowker </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>334 Mass. 422, 434 (1956); <em>Despatchers\u2019 Cafe, Inc. </em>v. <em>Somerville Hous. Auth., </em>332 Mass. 259, 261-262 (1955); <em>Stockus </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Auth., </em>304 Mass. 507, 509-511 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The EOCD\u2019s reliance on our decision in <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Executive Office of Envtl. Affairs, </em>402 Mass. 611 (1988), is misplaced. Although in <em>Cummings </em>we stated that the Superior Court lacked jurisdiction to review the Secretary\u2019s actions absent express statutory authority, we based our decision on a close reading of G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 <em>7A, </em>and G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 62H (1986 ed.). <em>Cummings, supra </em>at 613, 618. Such an analysis does not apply to a case, such as this one, where the plaintiffs challenge the validity of a taking. <em>McAuliffe &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number><em>Burke Co., supra. Luke, supra. Burnham, supra. </em>We therefore conclude that the Superior Court had jurisdiction over the plaintiffs\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">2. <em>Standard of Review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">The LRA, planning board, and city council are not \u201cagencies\u201d for the purposes of G. L. c. 30A (1986 ed.) (see \u00a7 1 [2]), and are not required by the provisions of G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7\u00a7 46-48, to furnish an adjudicatory, \u201ctrial-like\u201d procedure. See <em>Sherman </em>v. <em>Rent Control Bd. of Brookline, </em>367 Mass. 1, 7-8 (1975). Also, a proceeding before the EOCD is not an \u201cadjudicatory proceeding\u201d as defined in G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1 (1). <em>Reid, supra </em>at 142. Therefore, c. 30A, \u00a7 14, which provides the standard of review for an appeal from an agency\u2019s adjudicatory proceeding, does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">The \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard generally governs judicial review of the specific statutory findings required by \u00a7 48. <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Redevelopment Auth., </em>374 Mass. 37, 52-53, 59 n.15 (1977). We stated in <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>that review of decisions in c. 121B redevelopment projects under the \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard is appropriate' because such projects require active participation by public agencies and lack the tax benefits of c. 121A projects. <em>Boston Edison Co., supra </em>at 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">The plaintiffs argue that we should judge the public agencies\u2019 actions by the substantial evidence test. They argue generally that the \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard is too deferential to agencies involved in urban renewal decisions and argue specifically that the influence of consultants and the incentives the project offered to Emerson College nullified G. L. c. 121B\u2019s scheme of checks and balances and require application of the substantial evidence test. The agency decisions challenged in this case were not made after adjudicatory hearings, and thus there are no agency records to which the substantial evidence test could be applied in its traditional form. We are not at all certain in the circumstances of this case that there is a significant difference between agency action that is arbitrary and capricious because its decision was not supported by facts, and agency action not supported by substantial evidence. Here, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>judge applied the \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard (and ruled it was met) and further ruled that, in any event, the challenged findings of the planning board, the LRA, and the EOCD<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> satisfied what he described as the more rigorous substantial evidence standard, based on the material that was before each agency when it made its determination. Even if we were to accept the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments that there was error in the judge\u2019s rulings as to standard of review, clearly there was no prejudicial error in the judge\u2019s application of the standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">3. <em>The LRA\u2019s Finding of a Blighted Open Area.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Exercising the power of eminent domain is improper unless the taking is for a public purpose. <em>Sellors </em>v. <em>Concord, </em>329 Mass. 259, 261 (1952). See <em>Papadinis </em>v. <em>Somerville, </em>331 Mass. 627, 629 (1954); art. 10 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. Taking for redevelopment an area which is a \u201cblighted open area\u201d as defined by G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 l,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> is a public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>purpose. G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 45. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>334 Mass. 760, 763 (1956). See <em>Papadinis </em>v. <em>Somerville, supra </em>at 631-632. Chapter 121B, \u00a7 2, presents alternative definitions of a \u201cblighted open area.\u201d The area need satisfy only one of these definitions. The provision of G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 1, under which the judge examined the LRA\u2019s determination that the project area is \u201cblighted-open\u201d provides that a blighted open area is \u201ca predominantly open area which by reason of any condition or combination of conditions which are not being remedied by the ordinary operations of private enterprise is of such a character that in essence it is detrimental to the safety, health, morals, welfare or sound growth of the community in which it is situated.\u201d Thus, for the taking properly to have a public purpose, it must satisfy these statutory requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">The plaintiffs claim that the judge misconstrued the requirements of \u00a7 1 and therefore erroneously found that substantial evidence supported the determination that the project area is blighted-open. According to the plaintiffs, the judge determined that the predominantly vacant condition of the area, by itself, satisfied the statutory requirement of blighted-open. We agree that land is not blighted-open under G.L.c. 121B, \u00a7 1, merely because it is vacant. The plaintiffs, however, misinterpret the judge\u2019s reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">The judge addressed each component of G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 1, and found that the LRA based its determination that the project area is blighted-open on substantial evidence. The record supports his conclusion. The judge found that the LRA had available to it a report entitled \u201cCode 200 \u2014 Project Area Report\u201d (report) prepared for it by the Logue Development Company (Logue consultants). Although the judge noted that the report contained some inaccuracies,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> he found that the documents on which the report was based, and which were available to the LRA, contained accurate information. The report described <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>the area as blighted and open. Although the statute does not define \u201cpredominantly open,\u201d 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 12.01 (1986) states that, \u201c[a] \u2018blighted open\u2019 area eligible for Urban Renewal is one which is not more than thirty percent (30%) built up.\u201d Land which \u201ccontains buildings or other improvements\u201d is \u201cbuilt up.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The project area comprises approximately 152 acres. The combined area of the parcels which have buildings on them, the Digital parcel, the Ryder parcel, the Elks\u2019 parcel, the Bank of New England parcel, and the two New England Telephone parcels, is approximately thirty-three acres, which is less than thirty percent of the total project area. There was no error in the judge\u2019s finding that the LRA reasonably could have determined that the area was predominantly open.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The judge evaluated the \u00a7 1 requirement that the area contain a condition or conditions \u201cdetrimental to the . . . sound growth of the community.\u201d The report contains substantial evidence indicating that the condition of the project area is detrimental to the sound growth of the city. The report demonstrates that the project area lacks sufficient street capacity to support further development, to create a link to downtown Lawrence from interstate Route 93 as a plan entitled, \u201cProgram Community Action \u2014 Lawrence 1970\u201d (1970 plan) suggested, or to lessen traffic congestion in the neighborhood. The report also indicates that soil, subsoil, surface water, and water table conditions necessitate site development costs. Wetlands comprise twenty percent of the proposed campus site, and fifty-four percent of that site lies within the 100-year flood plain. Fifteen percent of the site contains either bedrock which may require blasting, refuse fill which requires disposal, unstable soils which require either pile foundations or soil improvement, or underground fuel storage tanks which require removal. In addition, the report demonstrates that the area had deteriorated because of low grade uses, random filling, and because relatively unrestricted dumping has occurred in certain areas. Finally, the report explains the planning goals of the 1970 plan, such as improving recreational facilities, educational facilities, and traffic patterns. The report illustrates how development of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>the project area carries out these goals by increasing the public park created by the Department of Environmental Management from fifteen to forty-seven acres, providing for a college campus, and implementing the construction of a new highway. The report explains how the project will help to revitalize the economy of the city of Lawrence. A letter from State Senator Patricia McGovern which was before the LRA similarly states that: \u201cThis project will go a long way toward assuring a better future for Lawrence.\u201d There was substantial evidence before the LRA that the project area is in a condition detrimental to the sound growth of Lawrence, and the judge properly considered this component in his review.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">There was substantial evidence before the LRA that the ordinary operations of private enterprise are not remedying the deteriorated condition of a majority of land within the project area. The report explains how the current development of the area, which is clustered along the more economic Andover Street frontage, hinders the development of the potentially useful riverfront property. Current development, the report indicates, renders approximately 135 acres of developable land unusable. A December, 1986, memorandum prepared by the Logue consultants outlined the history of ABP\u2019s and Brooks\u2019 stalled attempts to develop their parcels. The memorandum explained that, although the Andover and Lawrence planning boards had approved ABP\u2019s subdivision plan, ABP still needed to submit proposals for each building to be approved by the planning boards and the conservation commissions. The memorandum also contained information that the Department of Environmental Management had received authority to take all of Brooks\u2019 property by eminent domain, and that, if Brooks were to construct, he would need at least one year to obtain the necessary permits and approvals. Thus there was substantial evidence concerning the history of the project area and its development to support a conclusion that the ordinary operations of private enterprise were not remedying the deteriorated and unused condition of a preponderance of the project area.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">From the foregoing analysis, it is clear that the judge was warranted in concluding that there was substantial evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>that the area is blighted-open and thus the judge properly concluded that substantial evidence supported the LRA\u2019s determination.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">4. <em>The Planning Board\u2019s Findings.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Under G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 48, a planning board is required to find that an \u201curban renewal plan is based upon a local survey and conforms to a comprehensive plan for the locality as a whole.\u201d The plaintiffs claim that the urban renewal plan underlying the project meets neither requirement. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"AKa\">Chapter 121B does not define the phrase \u201ccomprehensive plan for the locality as a whole.\u201d The planning board determined that the project conformed to the 1970 plan. The plaintiffs claim that the planning board should have used, as the comprehensive plan, a 1960 master plan. No complete copy of this 1960 master plan is available, and the plaintiffs base their contention solely on a document entitled, \u201cSummary Master Plan \u2014 Lawrence 1960.\u201d The Superior Court judge found substantial evidence that the 1970 plan the planning board used was comprehensive. To complete this plan, which took over three years to formulate, the planning board, with the aid of a Federal grant, compiled information from city departments, the Lawrence Housing Authority, the LRA, neighborhood groups, and numerous social agencies in the Lawrence area. In 1970, the planning board voted that the 1970 plan conforms in general to the master plan of the city of Lawrence. The plaintiffs\u2019 argument therefore must fail. There was substantial evidence to warrant the planning board\u2019s finding that the project conforms to a comprehensive plan for the locality as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">Chapter 121B also does not define the term \u201clocal survey.\u201d The plaintiffs claim that the documents before the planning board did not constitute a local survey. We disagree. The judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>found that the planning board had before it the Cullinan Engineering Co., Inc., survey plans, the report, and maps attached to the riverfront urban renewal plan. The Cullinan survey, for example, shows the owners and deed references for each parcel within and abutting the project, the measurements for each parcel within the project, all encumbrances and easements, and all public ways. Expert witnesses for the Elks and Brooks testified that the Cullinan survey is a local survey. It was reasonable for the planning board to conclude that these materials constituted a local survey. Substantial evidence supports the judge\u2019s conclusion that the planning board complied with the requirements of G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">5. <em>The EOCD\u2019s Approval of the Project.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">The plaintiffs challenge the EOCD\u2019s approval of the project on numerous grounds. They claim that the EOCD (1) incorrectly approved the project\u2019s financial plan; (2) violated its regulations in concurring in the planning board\u2019s findings; (3) incorrectly allowed parcels which are not blighted-open to be included in the project area; and (4) failed to obtain information from the local authorities which would have reversed its finding that the project was in a blighted open area. We have examined each of these claims, and conclude that none has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">Before we examine these claims, however, we first address whether the plaintiffs have standing to challenge the EOCD\u2019s approval of the plan. The judge ruled that the plaintiffs\u2019 challenge was \u201cessentially a challenge of the proposed expenditure of state funds\u201d under G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 63 (1986 ed.). To restrain the expenditure of State funds under \u00a7 63, twenty-four State taxpayers must bring a petition before the Supreme Judicial Court or Superior Court. Because the plaintiffs did not meet these procedural requirements of \u00a7 63, the judge determined that they could not contest any of the EOCD\u2019s findings relating to the project. The judge, however, found that, even if the plaintiffs presented a proper petition under \u00a7 63, substantial evidence supported all findings by the EOCD except its finding that the financial plan was sound. The judge, therefore, found substantial evidence that the EOCD properly concurred in the planning board\u2019s findings; that private enterprise would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>make the project area available for urban renewal without either government subsidy or the exercise of governmental powers; that the proposed uses and requirements would afford the private sector opportunity to finance urban renewal consistent with the sound needs of the locality as a whole; that the project area is a blighted open area; that the plan is sufficiently complete; and that the relocation plan had been approved under G. L. c. 79A (1986 ed.). See G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The plaintiffs claim that they have standing under G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 48, as landowners to challenge the EOCD\u2019s actions. We agree that the judge erred in concluding that parties such as the plaintiffs may not challenge any of the EOCD\u2019s actions except as taxpayers under G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 63. The plaintiffs do have standing, for the reasons we discuss below, to challenge the EOCD\u2019s findings regarding their properties\u2019 eligibility for urban renewal as a blighted open area. The plaintiffs do not, however, have standing to challenge the EOCD\u2019s finding that the financial plan is sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-14\">\u201cA party has standing when it can allege any injury within the area of concern of the statute or regulatory scheme under which the injurious action has occurred.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Ass\u2019n of Independent Ins. Agents &amp; Brokers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>373 Mass. 290, 293 (1977). \u201cAn injury alone is not enough; a plaintiff must allege a breach of duty owed to it by the public defendant.\u201d <em>Northbridge </em>v. <em>Natick, </em>394 Mass. 70, 75 (1985). The plaintiffs, as landowners, are not within \u201cthe area of concern\u201d of the statutory requirement of a sound financial plan. See G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 48. The Legislature\u2019s purpose in requiring a sound financial plan is to protect the State purse. If the EOCD approves a municipality\u2019s application for financial assistance with its urban renewal plan, the State may become obligated for a substantial portion of the net cost of the plan. G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7\u00a7 54-57. The statute, therefore, requires that the EOCD ensure that the municipality\u2019s plan for meeting its share of the expenses is sound. The EOCD owes a duty to State taxpayers to ensure that the financial plan is sound, but it does not owe this duty to the plaintiffs as landowners. The United States Constitution, the Massachusetts Declaration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>Rights, and G. L. c. 79 (1986 ed.) fully protect the plaintiffs\u2019 rights as landowners to adequate compensation when their property is actually taken by eminent domain. The judge correctly determined that the plaintiffs lack standing to challenge the EOCD\u2019s finding that the financial plan is sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">We conclude, however, that the plaintiffs do have standing to challenge the EOCD\u2019s findings which relate to the eligibility of their property for urban renewal under G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 48. We have recognized that \u201c[t]he private rights most clearly affected by proceedings under \u00a7 48 are those of owners and tenants of land in the project area.\u201d <em>Reid </em>v. <em>Acting Comm\u2019r of the Dep\u2019t of Community Affairs, </em>362 Mass. 136, 142(1972). A decision, for example, that property is blighted-open has direct impact on rights in that property. The plaintiffs, as landowners, are \u201cwithin the area of concern\u201d of the statutory requirements which relate to the eligibility of the project area for urban renewal, and thus have standing to enforce these provisions. <em>Northbridge, supra </em>at 76. We therefore turn to the merits of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">First, the plaintiffs claim that the EOCD violated its regulations by concurring in the planning board\u2019s findings. The plaintiffs contend that EOCD regulations in effect until December 12,1986, which was after the planning board made its findings, but before the EOCD\u2019s concurrence, require that a local survey contain a detailed analysis of the structural conditions of buildings within a blighted open area. Even if we assume, as the plaintiffs argue, that these regulations control, we believe that the regulations apply where the purpose of the project is to redevelop a substandard or decadent area.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Such regulations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>are inapplicable where the purpose of a project is to redevelop a blighted open area. The regulations govern the content of a survey, and essentially require an explanation, supported by maps, of how a project area meets eligibility requirements for urban renewal. 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 15.03 (1) (1978). No building deficiencies need be present for an area to meet the eligibility requirements of a blighted open area. See 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 15.01 (2) (b) (1978). Consequently, the local survey for the project, the purpose of which is to eliminate a blighted open area, does not need to contain a structural analysis of each building in the project area showing that each building is deficient. The final project report, which describes the nature and location of existing buildings, and states that no residences are involved in the project, provides sufficient information about the buildings. There was substantial evidence that the urban renewal plan was based on a local survey.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">Moreover, because the EOCD had before it essentially the same information as the planning board, it was similarly justified in finding that the urban renewal plan conforms to a comprehensive plan for the locality as a whole. The judge did not err in upholding the EOCD\u2019s concurrence in the planning board\u2019s findings.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Second, the plaintiffs claim that the EOCD\u2019s approval of the project is invalid because the project affects a number of parcels which admittedly are not blighted-open. The project empowers the ERA to take by eminent domain certain non-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>blighted-open parcels, and empowers it to impose restrictions on the use of other nonblighted-open parcels which are not to be taken, but which are included within the project area.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The plaintiffs apparently object both to the taking of the nonblight-ed-open parcels, and to the imposition of restrictions on the nonblighted-open parcels which are not to be taken. Neither of these claims has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">EOCD regulations provide that, \u201c[i]f any sizeable portion of an area is not . . . blighted open its inclusion in the Urban Renewal Plan must be justified by one of the following: (1) Necessity of achieving urban renewal objectives for the total project area. (2) Necessity of bringing the project area to a sound boundary.\u201d 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 13.03.(5) (1986). The plaintiffs argue that the regulation requires an express finding of necessity by the EOCD, and that, even if no finding is required, the inclusion of nonblighted-open property in the project could not be necessary because the EOCD did not consider any alternatives.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Even if we assume that these parcels, which constitute less than thirty percent of the total project area, are a \u201csizeable portion\u201d of the area, we do not accept the plaintiffs\u2019 argument. First, the regulation does not expressly require that there must be a finding of necessity in an urban renewal plan. In light of the findings and supporting data which an urban renewal plan must include, 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 13.03 (1986), such an additional finding would add nothing of substance. See <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Auth., </em>374 Mass. 37, 63 (1977). Therefore, the plan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>did not need to include an express finding on the necessity of including in the project property which is not blighted-open. Second, we interpret the word \u201cnecessity\u201d in this context to mean necessary for sound planning purposes rather than, as the plaintiffs argue, necessary because no feasible alternatives exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">Under this interpretation of \u201cnecessity,\u201d there was substantial evidence before the EOCD justifying the inclusion of the nonblighted-open property. The report described the nature and location of buildings in the project area and the maps included with the report indicated the division of the area into parcels. The Elks\u2019 parcel is situated between the two large, blighted-open Brooks\u2019 and ABP parcels. There was substantial evidence from which to determine that sound development of the blighted-open area of the Brooks\u2019 and ABP parcels would not take place unless the northern portion of the intervening Elks\u2019 property was taken. Similarly, there was substantial evidence justifying the decision to take by eminent, domain the Ryder parcel, and the Cyr parcels leased to Bank of New England and New England Telephone, given the predominantly blighted-open nature of the riverfront area. Subjecting the remainder of the Elks\u2019 property, and the parcels leased to Digital and New England Telephone to restrictions on use was also reasonable. For the project as a whole to be viable, it was necessary to allow these parcels to be used only in ways compatible with use of the surrounding area as a college campus and park. On the basis of the evidence before it, it was reasonable for the EOCD to determine that inclusion of the nonblight-ed-open parcels was necessary to bring the project to a sound boundary, Andover Street, and necessary to achieve the objectives of the project, the sound, uniform development of the riverfront area. We therefore conclude that the parcels which are not blighted-open were properly included in the project area.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Finally, the plaintiffs claim that the EOCD, in violation of its regulations, failed to obtain information from the local authorities which would have reversed its finding that the project area is eligible for urban renewal as a blighted open area. The regulations the plaintiffs claim the EOCD disregarded required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>information on the condition of buildings within the project area, a description of the area around the project area, and a justification of the project\u2019s boundaries. Noncompliance with these regulations, the plaintiffs contend, establishes arbitrary and capricious action as a matter of law. This argument has no merit. We conclude that, even if the EOCD had considered this information in the required form, and followed all technical requirements, it would have reached the same result. Consequently, as shown below, there was no prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">We have stated consistently that-\u201c[o]nce an agency has seen fit to promulgate regulations, it must comply with those regulations.\u201d <em>Royce </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>390 Mass. 425, 427 (1983). See <em>Restaurant Consultants, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>401 Mass. 167, 170 n.8 (1987); <em>Northbridge </em>v. <em>Natick, </em>394 Mass. 70, 76 (1985). Promulgated regulations have the force of law, and bind the agency. <em>Restaurant Consultants, supra. Royce, supra. </em>We have also reasoned, however, that \u201c[tjhere must be some showing of prejudice before an agency\u2019s disregard of its own rules may constitute reversible error.\u201d <em>Martorano </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>401 Mass. 257, 262 (1987). <em>DaLomba\u2019s Case, </em>352 Mass. 598, 603 (1967). After reviewing the record and the judge \u2019 s findings, we conclude that the EOCD\u2019s disregard of its own regulations was not prejudicial to the plaintiffs. The Superior Court judge noted that all forms required by 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 12.00-20.00 (1986), which relate to a project\u2019s eligibility, had not been submitted to the EOCD. He found that substantial evidence nonetheless warranted the EOCD\u2019s finding that the project was eligible for urban renewal as a blighted open area. We agree. Although information concerning buildings in the project area was not in the form the regulations require, sufficient information on this issue was submitted to the EOCD. The final project report to the EOCD provided the location of existing buildings and sufficiently described the commercial nature of the buildings to be taken. This report also provided an adequate description of the surrounding area, and sufficient reasons for the project\u2019s boundaries. Furthermore, the EOCD\u2019s administrative record indicates that it fully considered the infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>mation that landowners, including the plaintiffs, submitted at the March, 1987, public hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">We have determined that the judge correctly interpreted the G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 1, definition of \u201cblighted open area,\u201d and that substantial evidence supports the findings by the local authorities that the project area is a blighted open area. The same fundamental information was before the EOCD. We conclude that, even if the EOCD had followed its regulations and received all information in the correct form, it would have reached the conclusion that the project area is eligible for urban renewal as a blighted open area. Substantial evidence supports this conclusion. Because the plaintiffs can show no prejudice, we need not consider further their claim of error. <em>Martorano, supra </em>at 263.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">6. <em>Bad Faith.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">The plaintiffs allege that the proposed taking is void because the local authorities acted in bad faith. The judge concluded that the predominant motive behind the project was to eliminate a blighted open area, and implicitly found there was no bad faith. The plaintiffs challenge this conclusion and, as grounds for their claim, first assert that the project on its face demonstrates bad faith because it benefits Emerson College by providing it with a favorable location on advantageous terms. This contention is without merit. We have suggested that \u201c[tjhere are certain motives or reasons that would be unlawful if they were the dominant reasons for [a] . . . taking.\u201d <em>Pheasant Ridge Assocs. Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Burlington, </em>399 Mass. 771, 777 (1987). The taking of land pursuant to a valid redevelopment plan is not void merely because the disposition of that land indirectly benefits private individuals. <em>Papadinis </em>v. <em>Somerville, </em>331 Mass. 627, 632 (1954). See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>334 Mass. 760, 764 (1956). Disposition to a private redeveloper of property acquired pursuant to a valid plan may be necessary to achieve the public purpose. <em>Papadinis, supra. </em>Any benefits this disposition may present to the redeveloper are incidental to the main purpose of the plan, which is the elimination of a substandard, decadent, or blighted open area. <em>Id. </em>See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>332 Mass. 769, 783 (1955). We have concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>in the instant case that there was substantial evidence to support the judge\u2019s finding that the project area was blighted-open. The project therefore has a public purpose and the benefit to Emerson College is incidental to this purpose. From these facts alone a conclusion that the local authorities acted in bad faith is not warranted, much less required.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Second, the plaintiffs argue that the judge was required to find a bad faith motivation for the project because Emerson College was invited to relocate to the riverfront area before the area was officially designated as blighted-open. We disagree. \u201cIn determining the state of mind of a person or group of persons, we consider not only what they have said but we also draw inferences concerning their intentions from what they have done and what they have not done.\u201d <em>Pheasant Ridge, supra </em>at 777. In examining a municipality\u2019s proposed exercise of the power of eminent domain for inferences of bad faith, we consider whether the municipality has evinced prior interest in the area or its neighborhood, and whether its method of acquiring the property accords with usual practices. <em>Id. </em>at 778. The judge found that the city and various elected officials expressed considerable interest in the project area before they learned of Emerson College\u2019s plans to relocate. City officials had exercised substantial efforts to aid Brooks, for example, in his attempts to develop the parcel; interest in constructing a riverfront park started as early as 1983; and the 1970 plan designated a portion of the project land as an improvement area. In light of this continuous prior interest in the riverfront area, the judge was not required to infer bad faith from the fact that political leaders discussed the site with Emerson College before the area was designated as blighted-open. See <em>Pheasant Ridge, supra </em>at 778; <em>Chelmsford </em>v. <em>DiBiase, </em>370 Mass. 90, 93 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Furthermore, the local authorities did not deviate from usual practices in considering the riverfront urban renewal plan. The ERA, planning board, and city council considered the project in depth, and based their approvals on substantial evidence. In <em>Pheasant Ridge, </em>where we concluded that a taking was unlawful on the ground of bad faith, selectmen and town counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>developed the purposes for the proposed taking within minutes before the commencement of the town meeting in which the taking was approved, and the town meeting voted to take the property without any consideration of the merits of the taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\"><em>Id. </em>There is nothing in the record before us to show that the local authorities had any motive other than the performance of their public duty. See <em>Despatchers\u2019 Cafe, Inc. </em>v. <em>Somerville Hous. Auth., 332 </em>Mass. 259, 263 (1955). The judge correctly concluded that the predominant motive behind the project was to eliminate a blighted open area and thus enhance the sound growth of the city of Lawrence. The actions of the local authorities required no adverse inferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">7. <em>The Anti-Aid Amendment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">The anti-aid amendment, art. 46, \u00a7 2, as amended by art. 103 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution, provides in part: \u201cNo grant, appropriation or use of public money or property or loan of credit shall be made or authorized by the Commonwealth or any political subdivision thereof for the purpose of founding, maintaining, or aiding any infirmary, hospital, institution, primary or secondary school, or charitable or religious undertaking which is not publicly owned and under the exclusive control, order and supervision of public officers or public agents authorized by the Commonwealth or federal authority or both . . . .\u201d The language of the amendment is \u201cclear and peremptory.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>357 Mass. 836, 842 (1970). The purpose of art. 46 is to prevent the transfer of appropriated funds to nonpublic institutions. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>374 Mass. 843, 856 (1978). The plaintiffs claim that selling parcel B of the project area to Emerson College as redeveloper violates the anti-aid amendment. Because the sale price is less than the city\u2019s cost to acquire the property, the plaintiffs argue that the sale involves a grant of public money to a nonpublic institution. We disagree. No public aid can be involved where a private institution pays fair market value for public property. <em>Opinion of the Justices, 374 </em>Mass, at 856-857. <em>See Brooks </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>334 Mass. 285, 286 (1956). The judge, after considering the numerous restrictions the disposition agreement and the urban renewal plan imposed on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>parcel B,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> found that the sale price to Emerson College is the fair market value. The judge was entitled to rely on the disposition appraisal commissioned by the LRA, and the testimony of that appraiser. The LRA\u2019s appraiser considered comparable sales of residentially zoned land and took into account the restrictions the LRA placed on the property. The other appraisals introduced in evidence did not account for the decrease in value caused by the restrictions. Restrictions on use, development, and resale of property under an urban renewal plan affect the fair market value of property in much the same way as do easements, zoning restrictions, and other development restraints. The judge properly considered these restrictions, and his finding as to fair market value was warranted by the evidence. There was no violation of the anti-aid amendment. Because public funds are not being used to aid Emerson College, we need not analyze the proposed transaction in terms of the three criteria enunciated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Springfield, </em>382 Mass. 665, 675 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">8. <em>The Applicability of G. L. c. 121A, \u00a7 18C.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">We next address the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the riverfront urban renewal plan violates G. L. c. 121A, \u00a7 18C, and we conclude that \u00a7 18C does not apply to the plan. General Laws c. 121 A, \u00a7 3, allows private individuals, through an entity approved by the EOCD, to commence a redevelopment project. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>Under G. L. c. 121A, a private entity bears the responsibility for planning and initiating the project, and owns the project throughout its existence. <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Redevelopment </em>Auth., 374 Mass. 37, 50 (1977). Private entities are granted tax concessions to encourage them to undertake c. 121A projects. G. L. c. 121A, \u00a7 10. See <em>Boston Edison Co., supra. </em>In contrast, public agencies plan, initiate, and supervise projects conducted under c. 121B. <em>Id. </em>at 52. See G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7\u00a7 46-49. Chapter 121B does not require tax concessions to private entities which may become involved in a c. 121B project. See G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 16. The inducements c. 121A provides through required tax concessions are inappropriate in a c. 121B project because continuing public involvement lessens the strain on private redevelopers \u2019 resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">Section 18C of c. 121A allows a private entity such as Emerson College either to \u201cundertake\u201d a c. 121A project or to \u201cacquire\u201d a project commenced under c. 121A or c. 121B.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>To undertake a c. 121A project or to acquire a c. 121A or a c. 121B project, the private entity must agree to pay certain excise taxes in exchange for exemptions from real and personal property taxes. G. L. c. 121A, \u00a7 18C <em>(f). </em>To the extent of these payments in lieu of taxes, a charitable corporation is deemed to have waived its exemption from local property taxes. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The plaintiffs argue that \u00a7 18C requires a charitable corporation that participates in any way in a c. 121B project to waive its tax exempt status and make excise payments in lieu of property taxes. Because the riverfront urban renewal plan does not specify that Emerson College is to make payments in lieu of taxes, the plaintiffs contend that the plan violates G. L. c. 121A, \u00a7 18C. The plaintiffs misconstrue the \u00a7 18C provision that a charitable corporation \u201cacquire a project ... or any severable portion of such project\u201d conducted under c. 121B. G. L. c. 121A, \u00a7 18C. The phrase \u201cacquire a project\u201d does not apply where a redeveloper merely acquires land within a c. 12IB urban renewal area which remains subject to ongoing regulation by a redevelopment authority.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Rather, the phrase applies to an entity\u2019s acquisition of a c. 121B project, or sev-erable portion of such project, disengaged from the control of a redevelopment authority under c. 12IB. The plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to read c. 121 A, \u00a7 18C, into c. 121B leads to anomalous results. Under the plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation, any entity meeting the requirements of \u00a7 18C, such as a joint venture or a partnership, which acquires property in a c. 121B project, would obtain not only the burdens of c. 121A, \u00a7 18C, the excise payments, but also the benefits of \u00a7 18C, the tax exemption. Requiring tax concessions for such entities would restrict unreasonably the options open to redevelopment authorities operating under c. 121B. We therefore conclude that G. L. c. 121A, \u00a7 18C, does not apply where a redeveloper obtains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>property within a c. 121B project subject to ongoing regulation by a redevelopment authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Emerson College is not acquiring the riverfront urban renewal project, but rather is acquiring property from the ERA as a redeveloper under c. 121B. The ERA will supervise the project for its duration and, under the land disposition agreement with Emerson College, may enforce restrictions contained in the plan. Emerson College receives no tax concessions as a result of its participation in the project because, as a charitable corporation, it is already tax exempt. See G. L. c. 180 (1986 ed.); G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5, Third (1986 ed.). Nothing in c. 121B prohibits otherwise tax-exempt redevelopers from maintaining this status after thus acquiring property in a c. 121B project. Emerson College need not make excise payments in lieu of taxes. The judge correctly ruled that c. 121A, \u00a7 18C, does not apply to the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">9. <em>Requirements of the Open Meeting Law.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">The plaintiffs claim that the ERA violated the provisions of the open meeting law, G. L. c. 39, \u00a7\u00a7 23A-23C. As a remedy, they seek to invalidate the LRA\u2019s December 10, 1986, vote determining that the project area is blighted-open. Despite the plaintiffs\u2019 claims of numerous violations, only one alleged violation, on December 8, 1986, occurred within the limitation period of \u00a7 23B and is therefore properly before us. The Superior Court judge found, and the ERA concedes on appeal, that the ERA violated \u00a7 23B at its December 8 meeting. The judge, however, found that the ERA complied with \u00a7 23B at its December 10 meeting, and refused to invalidate the determination of blighted-open made at that meeting. The plaintiffs argue that the judge should have invalidated the actions taken on December 10 because of the open meeting violation on December 8.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>Section 23B of the open meeting law, G. L. c. 39, \u00a7\u00a7 23A-23C, generally prohibits a quorum of a governmental body from meeting \u201cin private for the purpose of deciding on or deliberating toward a decision on any matter.\u201d We have noted that \u201c[i]t is essential to a democratic form of government that the public have broad access to the decisions made by its elected officials and to the way in which decisions are reached.\u201d <em>Foudy </em>v. <em>Amherst-Pelham Regional School Comm., </em>402 Mass. 179, 184 (1988). The open meeting law\u2019s purpose is to provide such access by \u201celiminat[ing] much of the secrecy surrounding the deliberations and decisions on which public policy is based.\u201d <em>Ghiglione </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Southbridge, </em>376 Mass. 70, 72 (1978). To accomplish this purpose, the Legislature granted various remedies for violations. In particular, a judge \u201cmay invalidate any action taken at any meeting at which any provision of [\u00a7 23B] has been violated.\u201d G. L. c. 39, \u00a7 23B. Nothing in \u00a7 23B empowers a court to invalidate actions taken --- at a meeting which complies with the requirements of the open meeting law. In order for a court to have authority to nullify an action taken by a public body, the action must be taken while the body was in violation of the statute. See <em>Puglisi </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Whitman, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 142, 145 (1981). The LRA fully complied with \u00a7 23B\u2019s provisions at its December 10 meeting. The judge therefore had no power to invalidate this vote. Moreover, the LRA\u2019s lengthy public hearings on December 9, and its public deliberations on December 10, helped to accomplish the purpose of the open meeting law. We conclude that the judge properly refused to invalidate the LRA\u2019s vote on December 10, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">10. <em>G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Finally, the plaintiffs claim that the judge erred as a matter of law in granting the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment on the plaintiffs\u2019 civil rights claims under G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 111.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Under \u00a7 111, which incorporates \u00a7 11H, a plaintiff must prove that by threat, intimidation, or coercion a defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>has interfered with or attempted to interfere with, rights the Constitution or the laws of the Commonwealth secure. G. L. c. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 11H, 11I. <em>Appleton </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>397 Mass. 812, 817 (1986). The judge found that the actions of the LRA, the city council, and President Koenig of Emerson College took regarding the proposed taking as a matter of law did not constitute coercion within the meaning of G. L. c. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 11H and 11I. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">The plaintiffs\u2019 factual allegations concern only the defendants\u2019 pursuit of legal rights. The defendants\u2019 actions thus lack any element of coercion, threat, or intimidation actionable under \u00a7 11I. <em>Pheasant Ridge Assocs. Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Burlington, </em>399 Mass. <em>771, </em>782 (1987). We reject the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that votes by the LRA and the city council approving the proposed taking constitute coercion. We have determined that a \u201ctaking [is] an attempted direct, preemptive act and [does] not seek to coerce any plaintiff to do or not to do anything. Legislation, even unlawful legislation, lacks any quality of coercion when that legislation seeks to eliminate the rights of a person and does not seek to force that person unwillingly to do or not to do something otherwise lawful.\u201d <em>Pheasant Ridge, supra </em>at 781. The votes of the LRA and the city council, therefore, did not interfere with the plaintiffs\u2019 rights by coercion. Moreover, the city did not coerce, threaten, or intimidate the plaintiffs within the meaning of \u00a7\u00a7 11H and 11I by disclosing, during negotiations to acquire the plaintiffs\u2019 property by agreement, its possible intent to take their property by eminent domain. The city had two lawful options open to it: to acquire the property by agreement or to take the property by eminent domain. Its selection of one option over the .other does not violate \u00a7 111. There was no error in the judge\u2019s grant of summary judgment for the LRA and the city council.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 claim that President Koenig and Emerson College interfered with their rights by threats, intimidation, and coercion is similarly without merit. The plaintiffs claim that Koenig\u2019s requests that the city take the plaintiffs\u2019 property by eminent domain, and his statement that Emerson College could not relocate unless a portion of the Elks\u2019 property was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>taken constitute coercion. We have recognized that, absent extraordinary circumstances, a party may petition \u201cfor the redress of grievances\u201d without subjecting himself or herself to liability under G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11I. <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Mazza, </em>394 Mass. 176, 183 (1985). Koenig was merely stating his concerns over the proposed plan. There is no indication that either Koenig or any representative of Emerson College attempted to use anything but legal means to relocate Emerson College in Lawrence. The actions of Koenig and Emerson College did not coerce the plaintiffs. The Superior Court judge properly granted summary judgment for Koenig and Emerson College on the plaintiffs\u2019 civil rights claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A3b\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"akn-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b550-6\"> The three separate actions were consolidated for trial. In the first of these actions, owners of land slated to be taken for the Riverfront Urban Renewal Project (project) alleged, inter alia, that the project violated G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 48 (1986 ed.), G. L. c. 121A, \u00a7 18C (1986 ed.), art. 46, \u00a7 2, as amended by art. 103 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution (anti-aid amendment), and applicable State regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">In the second action, ten taxable inhabitants of Lawrence and others filed a complaint against the city, the mayor of Lawrence, and the Lawrence Redevelopment Authority (LRA), alleging, inter alia, that the defendants violated the open meeting law, G. L. c. 39, \u00a7 23B (1986 ed. &amp; Supp. 1988), and the anti-aid amendment, and that the approved financing plan was contrary to applicable State regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">In the third action, the plaintiffs filed a complaint against Allen E. Koenig, the president of Emerson College, Emerson College; the LRA, and the city council of Lawrence pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1982) and the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 111 (1986 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">Prior to trial, the judge accepted with prejudice the notices of voluntary dismissal filed by ABP of its claims in each action. Prior to oral argument before this court, Ryder and Cyr filed notices of voluntary dismissal of their appeals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b550-10\"> The \u201clocal authorities\u201d who performed statutory functions were the planning board of Lawrence (planning board), the LRA, and the city council.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b550-11\">The LRA is an urban renewal agency.

The parties throughout these proceedings refer to the requisite State agency as the EOCD, and accordingly we do the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b551-7\"> A plan, appended hereto as Appendix A, shows the existing use and ownership of the land within the project area. The project area includes approximately 152 acres situated in the southern section of the city on the south bank of the Merrimack River. The plaintiffs own the following parcels within the project area: Ryder owns a 4.4 acre parcel in the southwest comer of the project immediately north of property occupied by Digital Equipment Corporation (Digital) which fronts on Andover Street; ABP owns a 26.5 acre parcel which is bordered on the west by the Andover-Lawrence line and extends north from the Ryder parcel to the Merrimack River; the Elks own a 13.9 acre parcel which is immediately east of the Ryder and ABP parcels and which extends from Andover Street on the south toward the Merrimack River on the north; Cyr owns three parcels totalling some ten acres which front on Andover Street \u2014 two of the parcels are leased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>to the New England Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company (New England Telephone), the third is leased to the Bank of New England; and Brooks owns a 51.2 acre parcel which is bordered on the south by Andover Street and the three Cyr parcels, on the west by the Elks\u2019 parcel, and on the north by the Merrimack River.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">Appendix B is a plan illustrating the land use under the proposed project. The land to be taken for the project includes all of the Ryder acreage, all of ABP\u2019s acreage, all of Brooks\u2019 acreage, 9.6 acres from the Elks, 7.4 acres from Cyr, and approximately nine acres from various owners who do not object to the project.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b553-6\">General Laws c. 121B, \u00a7 47, grants the Superior Court jurisdiction to review an urban renewal agency\u2019s determination that an area is decadent, or substandard, or a blighted open area. A petition under \u00a7 47 is an aggrieved party\u2019s exclusive remedy for. challenging this determination. <em>Id. </em>We have determined, however, that \u00a7 47 applies only where an urban renewal agency seeks to acquire land before the EOCD approves the urban renewal plan. <em>Reid </em>v. <em>Acting Comm\u2019r of the Dep\u2019t of Community Affairs, </em>362 Mass. 136, 140 n.2 (1972). This situation is not present here, and none of the parties claims that \u00a7 47 provides the plaintiffs\u2019 exclusive remedy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b555-6\"> The judge found that the evidence which supported the EOCD \u2019 s approval of the project\u2019s financial plan was not substantial. We conclude, however, for the reasons discussed below, that the plaintiffs do not have standing to challenge this particular agency finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b555-7\"> General Laws c. 121B, \u00a7 1 (1986 ed.), provides in part: \u201c\u2018Blighted open area,\u2019 a predominantly open area which is detrimental to the safety, health, morals, welfare or sound growth of a community because it is unduly costly to develop it soundly through the ordinary operations of private enterprise by reason of the existence of ledge, rock, unsuitable soil, or other physical conditions, or by reason of the necessity for unduly expensive excavation, fill or grading, or by reason of the need for unduly expensive foundations, retaining walls or unduly expensive measures for waterproofing structures or for draining the area or for the prevention of the flooding thereof or for the protection of adjacent properties and the water table therein or for unduly expensive measures incident to building around or over rights-of-way through the area, or for otherwise making the area appropriate for sound development, or by reason of obsolete, inappropriate or otherwise faulty platting or subdivision, deterioration of site improvements or facilities, division of the area by rights-of-way, diversity of ownership of plots, or inadequacy of transportation facilities or other utilities, or by reason of tax and special assessment delinquencies, or because there has been a substantial change in business or economic conditions or practices, or an abandonment or cessation of a previous use or of work on improvements begun but not feasible to complete without the aids provided by this chapter, or by reason of any combination of the foregoing or other condition; or a predominantly open area which by reason of any condition or combination of conditions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>which are not being remedied by the ordinary operations of private enterprise is of such a character that in essence it is detrimental to the safety, health, morals, welfare or sound growth of the community in which it is situated.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b556-7\"> He found that the errors involved no bad faith.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b559-11\"> Although the city council\u2019s approval of the project is essentially unchallenged, it follows from this conclusion that its approval was justified in this regard. We need not and do not rely on voluminous evidence which was presented before the judge and had not been presented before the LRA, and which supported various findings by the judge that the Elks, ABP, and Brooks had, by various actions and statements, in the past conceded that the preponderance of the property could not be developed without government assistance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b562-6\"> Title 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 12.01 (1986) defines a \u201cdecadent\u201d area as: \u201can area which is detrimental to the sound growth of a community as a result of the existence of buildings which are out of repair, physically deteriorated, unfit for human habitation, obsolete, or in need of major maintenance or repair, or because much of the real estate in recent years has been sold, or taken for nonpayment of taxes or upon foreclosure of mortgages, or because buildings have been tom down and not replaced and under existing conditions it is improbable that the buildings will be replaced, or because of a substantial change in business or economic conditions, or because of inadequate light, air, or open space, or because of excessive land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>coverage or because diversity of ownership, irregular lot sizes or obsolete street patterns make it improbable that the area will be redeveloped by the ordinary operations of private enterprise, or by reason of any combination of the foregoing conditions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">A \u201csubstandard\u201d area is described as: \u201cany area wherein dwellings predominate which by reason of dilapidation, overcrowding, faulty arrangement or design, lack of ventilation, light or sanitation facilities, or any combination of these factors are detrimental to safety, health or morals.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b563-7\"> The plaintiffs point out that EOCD regulations effective after December 12, 1986, require that a planning board certify a project area as blighted-open. Neither G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81B, nor G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 48, authorizes a planning board to make any finding that an area is blighted-open. We therefore reject the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that lack of certification by the planning board invalidated the approval of the project.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b564-5\"> The nonblighted-open parcels to be taken under the plan are the Ryder parcel and the two Cyr parcels leased to the Bank of New England and New England Telephone. The northern portion of the Elks\u2019 property, which for the purposes of argument we will assume is not blighted-open, is also to be taken. The nonblighted-open parcels which will be subjected to restrictions on use, but not taken under the project, are the remainder of the Elks\u2019 parcel, the parcel in the southwest comer of the project area owned by Andover Street Associates and leased to Digital, and the parcel on the southeast comer of the project area owned by Cyr and leased to New England Telephone. Compare Appendix A with Appendix B.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b564-6\"> The plaintiffs also argue that the ERA should have met these requirements. Because compliance with regulations by the EOCD will resolve the issue, we address only this aspect of the argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b570-6\"> The judge found that these restrictions included:</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">\u201c1. All design, financial, site, construction plans and the performance bond require LRA approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">\u201c2. The redeveloper agrees to convey upon request 17 feet of frontage along Andover Street to an agency designated by LRA for the widening of Andover Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">\u201c3. The redeveloper agrees to construct the roadways through the rede-veloper\u2019s land connecting Andover Street and South Broadway, the cost of which LRA will reimburse the developer.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">\u201c4. The conveyed property will be devoted only to and in accordance with the Project.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-11\">\u201c5. In the event the redeveloper transfer\u00eds] prior to completion any of the property the redeveloper will pay LRA the equivalent of all sums in excess of its costs for the land and improvements.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-12\">\u201c6. In the event the redeveloper transfers at any time any portion or interest in the land, the redeveloper shall reimburse LRA Lawrence\u2019s share of the net Project Cost as certified by EOCD.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b571-5\"> General Laws c. 121 A, \u00a7 18C (1986 ed.), provides in relevant part: \u201cIndividuals, and associations of persons organized in the commonwealth in the form of joint ventures, partnerships, limited partnerships or trusts, resident or organized in the commonwealth, or charitable corporations organized under chapter one hundred and eighty, may undertake projects under this chapter or acquire a project which has been authorized and approved and which has been developed or is being developed in accordance with the provisions of this chapter or chapter one hundred and twenty-one B or any severable portion of such project, including air rights or other interests in land therein, which project shall be exempt from taxation, betterments, excises and special assessments, provided that such persons or associations, with respect to any such project undertaken or acquired by them shall:</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">\u201c(f) agree by regulatory agreement with the department of community affairs, or in Boston with the Boston Redevelopment Authority, that in consideration of exemption from taxation of real and personal property and from betterments and special assessments and from the payment of any tax, excise or assessment to or for the commonwealth or any of its political subdivisions on account of a project, they will pay the excises with respect to a project which a corporation would be bound to pay under the formulae and provisions set forth in section ten and any charitable corporation organized under chapter one hundred and eighty which enters into such a regulatory agreement shall be deemed to have waived its exemption from local property taxes.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b572-6\"> If an \u201curban renewal agency\u201d sells property it has acquired for urban renewal, G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 49, requires the agency to subject the purchaser\u2019s use to certain ongoing restrictions. An agency, for example, is required to obligate a purchaser \u201cto devote the land to the use specified in the urban renewal plan.\u201d G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 49 <em>(a).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b573-8\"> The plaintiffs also claim the judge erred in not ordering the LRA to carry out the provisions of the open meeting law at future meetings. See G. L. c. 39, \u00a7 23B. There was no error in the judge\u2019s decision not to issue such an order, in light of the LRA\u2019s subsequent compliance with the statute\u2019s requirements. <em>Benevolent </em>&amp; <em>Protective Order of Elks, Lodge No. 65 </em>v. <em>City Council of Lawrence, post </em>563, 566 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b574-7\">The plaintiffs do not argue on appeal their claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1982), and we therefore do not address them.
