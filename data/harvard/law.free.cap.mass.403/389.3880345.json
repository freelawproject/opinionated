L. c. 152, \u00a7 12 (2), as appearing in St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 26, by an employee from a decision of. the reviewing board of the Department of Industrial Accidents denying him worker\u2019s compensation. The employee had filed a claim for benefits on February 8, 1983. The substance of his claim was that work-related stress had exacerbated his preexisting heart or coronary artery disease. Initially, a single member of the Industrial Accident Board denied the employee benefits following a conference pursuant to former G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 7, as appearing in St. 1980, c. 283. A different single member then heard evidence pursuant to former G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 8, as appearing in St. 1972, c. 742, \u00a7 2, and, on June 10, 1985, rendered a decision favorable to the employee. On May 19, 1987, the reviewing board heard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>the parties\u2019 oral arguments based on the record before the single member including the single member\u2019s report favoring the employee. The reviewing board reversed the single member\u2019s decision and vacated the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">The employee appealed to the Appeals Court pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12 (2). Consistent with the Appeals Court\u2019s interim rule respecting the processing of workers\u2019 compensation appeals, the employee\u2019s appeal was entered on the single justice docket of that court for determination by a single justice. The single justice, however, reported the case to a full panel of that court for reasons we set forth below. We then transferred the case to this court on our own initiative.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">The single member\u2019s decision favorable to the employee was largely based on the opinion of Alan Balsam, M.D., as set forth in a typewritten report to the employee\u2019s attorney. Dr. Balsam concluded that there was a causal connection between the employee\u2019s work-related stress and his coronary artery disease. The report was in evidence before the single member as part of the physician\u2019s deposition. Dr. Balsam had not treated the employee. The testimony of other physicians, including that of the employee\u2019s attending cardiologist, Maximilliaan G. Kaulbach, M.D., was also submitted to the single member in deposition form. The reviewing-board, relying heavily on Dr. Kaulbach\u2019s deposition, concluded, contrary to the decision of the single member, that \u201c[t]he overwhelming weight of the medical evidence in this case points to a natural progression of an underlying disease process which is unrelated to the work effort.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">In his report to the panel, the Appeals Court single justice noted that before the workers\u2019 compensation law was substantially revised by St. 1985, c. 572, the reviewing board had plenary fact-finding authority. The reviewing board\u2019s finding \u201centirely superseded that of the single member which thereafter became of no importance.\u201d <em>Ricci\u2019s Case, </em>294 Mass. 67, 68 (1936). The question on judicial review was whether the evidence warranted the finding of the reviewing board. <em>Di-Giovanni\u2019s Case, </em>255 Mass. 241, 242 (1926).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>The single justice observed that \u201c[tjhis case seems to be governed, however, by G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11C, as appearing in St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 25, which, by \u00a7 70 of the same act, took effect on November 1, 1986. (The single member\u2019s decision was filed earlier, on June 10, 1985, but the reviewing board\u2019s decision was not filed until September 24,1987.) Under \u00a7 11C,</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">\u2018 [t]he reviewing board shall reverse the decision of a [single] member only if it determines on the basis of such member\u2019s written opinion and on an examination of a written transcript of the hearing, that the member\u2019s decision is beyond the scope of his authority, arbitrary or capricious, contrary to law, or unwarranted by the facts. The reviewing board may weigh evidence, but may not review determinations by the member who conducted the hearing regarding the credibility of witnesses who have given testimony.\u2019 It may be relevant, under this standard of review, that the testimony of all four doctors was received in deposition form rather than in live testimony before the single member.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">The single justice\u2019s report concludes by identifying the issue this way: \u201cWhether the reviewing board, under this new standard of review, may reject the single member\u2019s adoption of one expert\u2019s opinion and adopt instead the contrary opinion of another expert is a question of fundamental importance in determining the role of the reviewing board under the new statute. It is pivotal to this case and may well be pivotal in any case where (as is often true in workmen\u2019s compensation cases) expert witnesses for the employee and for the employer have offered conflicting opinions as to disability or causation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">We recite some of the single member\u2019s findings for background purposes. The single member found as follows: The employee was employed by a patent law firm, from 1965 until March, 1982. At first he was an accountant-manager, and in the middle 1970\u2019s his job title changed to \u201clegal administrator.\u201d As such, he was in charge of bookkeeping, supplies, and other administrative matters, including personnel, pensions, and insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">The employee first experienced chest pains in June, 1970, while on vacation. In July, he was diagnosed as having suffered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>a myocardial infarction. He developed angina pectoris as a result of the myocardial infarction and was out of work for three months. In January, 1974, he was admitted to Salem Hospital after suffering an anginal attack on a train. That June, he was diagnosed as suffering from coronary artery disease and medical treatment was instituted. During the ensuing years, he had occasional bouts of angina approximately once a month. These bouts became more frequent and there was a progressive clinical deterioration of the cardiac condition. The employee had smoked about one and a one-half packs of cigarettes a day for twenty years until 1963, and the employee has a family history of cardiovascular disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">In 1980, the employee began to experience several incidents of stress at work. Among other things, heywas the only nonlegal employee not given a raise, and he was forbidden to chair partnership meetings as he had done in the past. He then filed an age discrimination suit, after which incidents of petty abuse and harassment increased. His angina began bothering him more in frequency and degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">On March 18, 1982, while coming to work on the train, the employee suffered a severe angina attack. He left work at 3 p.m., and has not returned since. His current activities are extremely limited, and he experiences angina on a regular basis when he exerts himself, in response to emotional excitement, and on certain other occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">In addition, as we stated earlier in this opinion, the single member, relying substantially on Dr. Balsam\u2019s opinion, found that the stress associated with the employee\u2019s work had contributed to the employee\u2019s disabling coronary artery disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">The reviewing board\u2019s decision contains a detailed discussion of the employee\u2019s medical history from 1972 to 1983 as disclosed by Dr. Kaulbach\u2019s records. None of the history contained in the reviewing board\u2019s decision was inconsistent with the single member\u2019s findings based on the credibility of witnesses before him. In support of its reversal of the single member\u2019s determination, the reviewing board stated as follows: \u201cThe overwhelming weight of the evidence leads inescapably to the conclusion that the employee has failed to introduce sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>expert testimony which, if adopted, would support a finding of nexus between work stress and disability. The single member adopted the opinion of Dr. Balsam. In formulating his opinion on causal relationship, Dr. Balsam gave weight to and relied upon his own opinion that the employee\u2019s 1970 myocardial infarction was work-related. It follows that Dr. Balsam\u2019s opinion must be rejected because it is based on facts not in evidence (nor even claimed).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">\u201cThe weight of the evidence in the case simply fails to support the proposition that the employee sustained an injury to his heart. In order to prove an injury to his heart, the employee must establish an aggravation or acceleration of his underlying arteriosclerotic heart disease. In plain terms he must prove that his heart condition worsened. A review of the testimony of the attending cardiologist evidences no worsening of the employee\u2019s condition in the several years prior to his stopping work on March 18, 1982. The overwhelming weight of the medical evidence in this case points to a natural progression of an underlying disease process which is unrelated to the work effort.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Close to the end of his decision, the single member reported as a \u201cgeneral finding\u201d that \u201cthe employee [had] sustained an industrial injury on March 18, 1982.\u201d The employee had sustained an angina attack on a train on his way to work that day. The insurer argues that the general finding was erroneous as a matter of law because \u201c[i]t is now elementary that the compensation act does not extend to cover employees going to and coming from their work.\u201d <em>Gwaltney\u2019s Case, </em>355 Mass. 333, 335 (1969), and cases cited. The reviewing board, argues the insurer, properly reversed the single member\u2019s decision on that ground alone. We are not persuaded by the insurer\u2019s argument. The board thought it possible, and we believe it to be clear, that the single member \u201csimply meant that the incident on the train while commuting to work was significant in that it was the last physical consequence flowing from a series of emotional and stressful situations at work.\u201d The reviewing board reversed the single member\u2019s decision solely on the ground that, despite the single member\u2019s contrary finding, the em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>ployee had not established to the board\u2019s satisfaction that his heart or coronary artery disease was caused or made worse by his employment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">We held in <em>Pospisil\u2019s Case, </em>402 Mass. 820, 822 (1988), that G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11C, is to be applied retroactively to cases \u201cwhere, as here, the reviewing board held its hearing and issued its decision after the effective date of \u00a7 11C, even though the injury and the proceedings before the single member occurred prior to that date.\u201d Therefore, we must resolve the question whether the reviewing board exceeded its authority under \u00a7 11C by finding differently from the single member on the causation question.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">With respect to clarity, \u00a7 11C does not represent one of the Legislature\u2019s best performances. Nevertheless, it does seem clear that the Legislature intended that the reviewing board is to function as a fact finder. No other construction would be consistent with \u00a7 llC\u2019s provision that the reviewing board, armed with a transcript of the hearing before the single member, \u201cmay weigh evidence.\u201d The reviewing board \u201cmay not review determinations by the member who conducted the hearing regarding the credibility of witnesses who have given testimony,\u201d but there is no other expressed limitation on the reviewing board\u2019s fact-finding authority, and the expression of a single limitation implies that there are no others.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">We construe \u00a7 11C as providing that a single member\u2019s findings, not erroneous as a matter of law, directly based on \u201clive\u201d testimony before him given by witnesses testifying to their personal observations, are final. The reviewing board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>must accept those findings, but, on the basis of the transcripts of the hearing before the single member (the board does not conduct an evidentiary hearing), the board may accept or reject a single member\u2019s findings based on inference. Also, the board may accept or reject a single member\u2019s findings based on deposition testimony, reports, documents, and the like, and may accept or reject a single member\u2019s findings based on the opinions of expert witnesses irrespective of whether the expert witnesses\u2019 testimony is \u201clive\u201d or by way of deposition. (Of course, the board would be bound by a single member\u2019s finding that an expert witness before him had misrepresented what his opinion was. In such a case, the board could not give weight to the testimony.) Furthermore, based on the transcripts, the reviewing board may make findings in addition to those made by the single member as long as the additional findings are not inconsistent with the single member\u2019s findings based on credibility as defined above.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">With the facts thus established, the reviewing board\u2019s function is to decide whether the single member\u2019s determination as to the employee\u2019s entitlement to benefits is \u201cbeyond the scope of his authority, arbitrary or capricious, contrary to law, or unwarranted by the facts.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11C. An aggrieved party may appeal the reviewing board\u2019s decision to the Appeals Court \u201cpursuant to section 14 of chapter 30A.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12 (2). Under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7), the Appeals Court may affirm, modify, or set aside the reviewing board\u2019s decision, or remand the matter to the board, if the board\u2019s decision, among other things, is \u201cbased upon an error of law\u201d or \u201cmade upon unlawful procedure,\u201d or \u201cunsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">In the present case, the employee does not argue that the reviewing board\u2019s decision was unwarranted by substantial evidence. Rather, the employee contends that the reviewing board \u201cacted beyond its appellate authority in overturning the decision of the Single Member.\u201d The reviewing board did not reject any finding of the single member based on \u201cthe credibility of witnesses who [gave] testimony.\u201d See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11C. The reviewing board properly exercised its fact-finding respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>sibilities. The board\u2019s decision is not based upon an error of law nor was it made upon unlawful procedure. We affirm the decision of the reviewing board.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b410-8\"> The reviewing board\u2019s statement, repeated above, that \u201c[i]n formulating his opinion on causal relationship, Doctor Balsam gave weight to and relied upon his own opinion that the employee\u2019s 1970 myocardial infarction was work related,\u201d appears to be erroneous. Cross-examined about that matter during his deposition, Dr. Balsam stated that \u201cirrespective of [the] issue of myocardial infarction, . . . there was a causal relationship between that stress and his coronary artery disease.\u201d It seems clear that the board\u2019s error in this regard is not the principal reason for the board\u2019s rejection of Dr. Balsam\u2019s opinion, however. Rather, the board viewed the evidence as inescapably leading to the conclusion that the employee\u2019s condition was not work-related. The board characterized the weight of the evidence in that regard as \u201coverwhelming.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
