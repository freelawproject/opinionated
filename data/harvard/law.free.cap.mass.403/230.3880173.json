L. c. 231, \u00a7 111 (1986 ed.), and Mass. R. Civ. P. 64, 365 Mass. 831 (1974), by a Superior Court judge of his interlocutory order allowing the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to compel production of documents which the defendants contend are protected from disclosure by a \u201cgovernmental privilege.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judge has stayed his order pending resolution of the report. We granted the plaintiffs\u2019 application for direct appellate review, and now hold that the judge\u2019s order <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was correct, and that there is no such privilege in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">The plaintiffs commenced the action below by filing a complaint requesting declaratory and injunctive relief and challenging the lawfulness of certain regulations promulgated by the Department of Social Services (DSS). The regulations, which are codified at 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 7.100 et seq. (1986), were attacked on the ground that they \u201cirrationally and arbitrarily categorize foster parent applicants by marital status and sexual preference in such a way as to exclude single persons, unmarried couples and gay [i.e., homosexual] men and lesbians from equal consideration as foster parents.\u201d The plaintiffs contended that these regulations violate their State and Federal constitutional rights to equal protection, due process, freedom of association, and privacy, as well as their statutory rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1982), G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11 (1986 ed.), and G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 IB (1986 ed.). They also contended that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>the regulations violate State and Federal law requiring that foster care placements serve the best interests of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The plaintiffs requested the defendants to produce certain documents relating to the process by which the policy embodied in these regulations was developed and promulgated, including internal memoranda and drafts of proposed regulations. The defendants complied with some of these requests, but refused to produce other requested documents, specifically those that, in their view, \u201cconstitute or contain information protected by the governmental privilege.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The plaintiffs then moved the court to compel the defendants to produce these documents. After hearing and in camera inspection of the disputed documents, the judge allowed this motion. In his memorandum of decision and order, the judge noted that there was merit to the defendants\u2019 position, but that he was constrained to follow existing law, and not to innovate or to create new law. He ruled that there existed under Massachusetts law no privilege that the defendant could invoke to excuse production of the requested documents. Recognizing, however, the importance of the issue, and that an appellate court might create such a privilege when squarely presented with the issue, he reported the matter of the correctness of his order, and stayed the order pending resolution of the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">In order to present the matter in a more concrete and meaningful posture, the judge went on to make certain findings and rulings concerning the defendants\u2019 assertion of the privilege. Taking cognate Federal law<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as his model, he found and held, assuming that the asserted privilege existed, that the defendants had properly invoked it, and that certain specified documents were within its scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>The judge correctly ruled that there presently exists no privilege of the type the defendants assert. We have previously declined to consider the question in the abstract. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>368 Mass. 866, 880 (1975). This case squarely presents the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">The defendants contend that this court should create a privilege under Massachusetts law, modeled on Federal law of executive privilege. They advance both constitutional grounds and nonconstitutional policy arguments in favor of such a privilege. We discuss first the constitutional arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">1. The defendants argue that executive privilege inheres in or is a necessary ramification of the doctrine of separation of powers, which is fundamental to our form of government, and which finds positive expression in art. 30 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution. We disagree. We think that the doctrine of separation of powers does not require recognition of the asserted privilege. What this doctrine interdicts is the interference by one branch of government with the power or functions of another. See <em>New Bedford Standard-Times Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>Clerk of the Third Dist. Court of Bristol, </em>377 Mass. 404, 410-411 (1979); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>375 Mass. 795, 813-814 (1978); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>372 Mass. 883, 892-894 (1977); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>365 Mass. 639, 640-642 (1974); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>208 Mass. 610, 613 (1911). Our declining to recognize the asserted privilege does not constitute the exercise of nonjudicial power or interfere with the Executive\u2019s power. We think that it is relevant that the defendants have failed to demonstrate that the Executive does not function effectively because of the lack of the asserted privilege. Moreover, the explicit constitutional grant to the Legislature of a \u201cprivilege\u201d as to its deliberations, see art. 21 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution, further supports our view that a corresponding privilege in the Executive is not constitutionally required. Had the framers of our government\u2019s structure intended to recognize in our Constitution an executive privilege, it is reasonable to expect that they would expressly have created one.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>We add that, even under Federal law, where the privilege is well established, and which the defendants urge us to adopt as our model, \u201cthere is abundant statutory precedent for the regulation and mandatory disclosure of documents in the possession of the Executive branch .... [and s]uch regulation of material generated in the Executive branch has never been considered invalid as an invasion of its autonomy.\u201d <em>Nixon </em>v. <em>Administrator of Gen. Servs., </em>433 U.S. 425, 445 (1977) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">2. Having considered and rejected the defendants\u2019 constitutional argument, we now turn to their contention that we should create a privilege as a matter of common law. We observe, first, that the defendants must overcome the customary reluctance of this court, exhibited on many occasions, to create common law privileges to exclude relevant evidence. We have consistently concluded that the creation of such privileges ordinarily is better left to the Legislature. See <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Although this court has the power to create privileges, <em>Three Juveniles </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>390 Mass. 357, 360 (1983), it is a power that we have exercised sparingly, and \u201conly to the very limited extent that permitting a refusal to testify or excluding relevant evidence has a public good transcending the normally predominant principle of utilizing all rational means for ascertaining truth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 359-360, quoting <em>Elkins </em>v. <em>United States, </em>364 U.S. 206, 234 (1960) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting). \u201c[Pjrivileges are exceptions to the general duty imposed on all people to testify,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Corsetti, </em>387 Mass. 1, 5 (1982); <em>Three Juveniles, supra </em>at 359; <em>Matter of Pappas, </em>358 Mass. 604, 607-609 (1971), aff\u2019d sub nom. <em>Branzburg </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>408 U.S. 665, 709 (1972), and to the fundamental principle that \u201cthe public \u2018has a right to every man\u2019s evidence\u2019 . . . [which] has been preferred, on the whole, to countervailing interests.\u201d <em>Matter of Pappas, supra </em>at 607, quoting 8 J. Wig-more, Evidence \u00a7 2192 (McNaughton rev. 1961). See <em>Three Juveniles, supra </em>at 359; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Collett, </em>387 Mass. 424, 442 (1982) (Lynch, J., dissenting). See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bryan, 339 U.S. 323, </em>331 (1950). Accordingly, existing privileges are strictly construed, <em>Three Juveniles, supra </em>at 359; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number><em>Corsetti, supra; Foster </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>12 Pick. 89, 97 (1831), and we have been reluctant to create new privileges, preferring to leave this area to legislative determination. See <em>Three Juveniles, supra </em>at 360; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mandeville, </em>386 Mass. 393, 409 (1982); <em>Matter of Pappas, supra </em>at 611-612. Cf. <em>Usen </em>v. <em>Usen, </em>359 Mass. 453, 456-457 (1971) (court \u201cnot free to water down the legislative policy embodied in the [psychotherapist-patient privilege] statute by loose construction\u201d). Accord <em>In re Terry W., </em>59 Cal.

See generally McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 75, at 180 (3d ed. 1984) (\u201cIt may be argued that legitimate claims to confidentiality are more equitably received by a branch of government not preeminently concerned with the factual results obtained in litigation, and that the legislatures provide an appropriate forum for the balancing of the competing social values necessary to sound decisions concerning privilege\u201d); Note, The Parent-Child Privilege, 1984 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 599, 608-614 &amp; n.63 (\u201cSince the early 1800\u2019s the vast majority of new privileges created have been of legislative origin,\u201d citing McCormick, <em>supra; </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>surveying State codifications of law of privileges).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Legislature has created or codified various types of privileges. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 135 (1986 ed. &amp; Supp. 1987) (certain communications to a licensed social worker); G.

(testimonial disqualification of spouse as to private conversations with spouse).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">Against this court\u2019s consistent reluctance to create common law privileges, as shown above, we appraise the defendants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>arguments that the executive privilege urged here will promote good public policy. They say that the privilege prevents possible public misinterpretation or confusion about the reasons behind executive policies. They also say that the privilege advances the public interest in well considered executive policymaking, by promoting candid and unconstrained communication and exchange of ideas between and among executive policymakers and their advisors. They contend that our failure to recognize the privilege would have a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on such intra-executive communication, to the detriment of the policymaking process and, ultimately, the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The plaintiffs controvert the defendant\u2019s arguments, and urge additional considerations that they say militate against the creation of the asserted privilege. They argue that the history of the Commonwealth demonstrates that the Executive has functioned effectively despite the lack of the privilege, and that this refutes the defendants\u2019 argument as to the chilling effect of disclosure on intra-executive communications. It is arguable that the threatened \u201cmisinterpretation or confusion\u201d could be forestalled by stating the actual reasons for the adoption or rejection of a particular policy, either at the time of promulgation, or later, in response to queries or erroneous attribution, and that public debate about the meaning and purposes of executive policy may result in better policymaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">There is force and logic to the defendants\u2019 policy arguments, but the arguments against the privilege are also persuasive. We have been especially reluctant to create new privileges on the basis of speculation or conjecture as to the harms which may result from our failure to do so. See <em>Matter of Roche, </em>381 Mass. 624, 635 (1980). We think that the defendants\u2019 assertions (which are unsupported by any empirical evidence) are speculative in light of the long history of the Commonwealth and the lack of any showing of real harm that has accrued from the absence of the privilege. This contrasts with the plaintiffs\u2019 specific and demonstrable need for the requested documents in order to prosecute their action for the vindication of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>their constitutional and statutory rights, allegedly violated by the defendants.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">We therefore decline to create a privilege of the type asserted by the defendants, and we affirm the correctness of the order below.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b247-8\"> Also referred to variously as \u201cexecutive privilege,\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Alaska Superior Court, </em>721 P.2d 617 (Alaska 1986); \u201cdeliberative process privilege,\u201d <em>Taxation with Representation Fund </em>v. <em>Internal Revenue Serv., </em>646 F.2d 666 (D.C.

A compelling reason is that while courts, as institutions, find it easy to perceive value in public policies such as those favoring the admission of all relevant and reliable evidence which directly assist the judicial function of ascertaining the truth, it is not their primary function to promote policies aimed at broader social goals more distantly related to the judiciary. This is primarily the responsibility of the legislature. To the extent that such policies conflict with truthseeking or other values central to the judicial task, the balance that courts draw might not reflect the choice the legislature would make.\u201d <em>Sanders, supra </em>at 271.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b252-4\"> The other States are divided on the issue of which branch of government is the appropriate source of new privileges. In at least twenty States, common law innovation in this area has been foreclosed by statute or rule of court. See Alaska R. Evid. 501 (1987); Ark. R. Evid. 501 (1988); Cal. Evid. Code \u00a7 911 (Deering 1986); Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 90.501 (West 1979); Hawaii R. Evid. 501, Hawaii Rev. Stat. \u00a7 626-1 (1981); Idaho R. Evid. 501 (1985); Me. R. Evid. 501 (1988); Md.

In at least ten other States, common law jurisdiction in this area has been expressly sanctioned by statute or rule of court. See Ariz. R. Evid. 501 (1988); Colo. R. Evid. 501 (1980); Del. Uniform R. Evid. 501 (1980); Mich. R. Evid. 501 (1988); N.C.R. Evid. 501 (1988); Ohio R. Evid. 501 (1985); Utah R. Evid. 501 (1988); Vt. R. Evid. 501 (1985); W. Va. R. Evid. 501 (1988); Wyo. R. Evid. 501 (1978). We are aware of four State Supreme Courts which have recognized a privilege of the type asserted by the defendants. See <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Alaska Superior Court, </em>721 P.2d 617-624 (Alaska 1986) (internal communications in Governor\u2019s files regarding appointment to State medical board); <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Verdow, </em>287 Md. 544 (1980) (report to Governor of investigation into release of convicted murderer) (on State constitutional grounds); <em>Nero </em>v. <em>Hyland, </em>76 N.J. 213 (1978) (report of character investigation of prospective State appointee, prepared by State police for Governor and Attorney General; <em>State ex rel. Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>First Judicial Dist. Court, </em>96 N.M. 254 (1981) (investigatory report on prison riot, prepared by State Attorney General) (on State constitutional grounds). In addition, other courts have recognized various types of executive privilege in contexts further removed from that of the instant case; generally, in the context of records of law enforcement agencies. See, <em>e.g., Assured Investors Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>National Union Assocs., </em>362 So. 2d 228 (Ala. 1978) (transcript of district attorney\u2019s interviews with officers and directors of a civil defendant, relating to ongoing criminal investigation collateral to the civil action); <em>Martinelli </em>v. <em>District Court, </em>199 Colo. 163 (1980) (civil defendant police department\u2019s personnel files and report of internal affairs division\u2019s investigation); <em>People </em>v. <em>Ellerhorst, </em>12 Mich. App. 661 (1968) (\u201cFormal\u201d claim of privilege sustained where petitioner made only a \u201cdubious showing of necessity\u201d for documents relating to Internal Revenue Service agent\u2019s knowledge of a government witness\u2019s credibility); <em>Cirale </em>v. <em>80 Pine Street Corp., </em>35 N.Y.2d 113 (1974) (report of investigation by municipal board of inquiry as to cause of explosion); <em>Henneman </em>v. <em>Toledo, </em>35 Ohio St. 3d 241 (1988) (defendant police department\u2019s internal affairs division\u2019s report of investigation into alleged battery by police officers).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b253-5\"> Because we ordinarily have deferred to the Legislature on issues of evidentiary privilege, it is pertinent to observe what the Legislature has done in this or in related contexts. Of course, the Legislature has not specifically acted to create a privilege of the type asserted by the defendants. While we impute little significance to such legislative inaction, we do find some evidence that may reflect the Legislature\u2019s prevailing attitude on this matter in the analogous context of public records law. The Public Records Act, G. L. c. 66 (1986 ed.), requires public access to various records and documents in the possession of public officials, with certain exceptions. See <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>388 Mass. 427, 430-431 (1983). Among the documents exempted from mandatory disclosure are \u201cinter-agency or intra-agency memoranda or letters relating to policy positions <em>being developed </em>by the agency ...\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth <em>(d) </em>(1986 ed.). By its terms, this exemption protects such documents from disclosure only while policy is \u201cbeing developed,\u201d that is, while the deliberative process is ongoing and incomplete. See Brant, Public Records, PIPA and CORI: How Massachusetts Balances Privacy and the Right to Know, 15 Suffolk U. L. Rev. 23, 31 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The Legislature has thus chosen to insulate the deliberative process from scrutiny only until it is completed, at which time the documents thereby generated become publicly available. See <em>Letter-Determination of the Supervisor of Public Records </em>87/208, January 20, 1988, at 2-3; <em>Letter-Determination of the Supervisor of Public Records </em>87/208, November 20, 1987, at 3-4; <em>Letter-Determination of the Supervisor of Public Records </em>87/196, December 23, 1987, at 4; <em>Letter-Determination of the Supervisor of Public Records </em>87/196, October 14, 1987, at 3-4.
