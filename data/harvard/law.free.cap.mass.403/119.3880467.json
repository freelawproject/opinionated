Count 1, brought by Anzalone under G. L. c. 93A (1986 ed.), alleged that the MBTA engaged in unfair or deceptive acts in the handling of his workmen\u2019s compensation claim. Anzalone\u2019s wife and children were plaintiffs in the remaining five counts, also brought under G. L. c. 93A. These five counts state claims for loss of consortium by An-zalone\u2019s wife and children \u201cas a result of the unfair and deceptive trade practices committed against\u201d Anzalone. The plaintiffs later amended their complaint, adding a count against John O\u2019Loughlin, Anzalone\u2019s supervisor, for intentionally harassing Anzalone and interfering with his employment,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The MBTA and O\u2019Loughlin filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted. Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974). The defendants\u2019 motion was allowed, and the plaintiffs appeal. We transferred this case on our own motion and affirm the dismissal of the complaint as to the MBTA and O\u2019Loughlin.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">We deal first with the plaintiffs\u2019 claims against the MBTA. The plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleges that, in 1968, Anzalone began his employment with the MBTA as a police officer. On November 9, 1979, while acting in the line of duty, Anzalone rescued a person from a dangerous place and, in so doing, inhaled a substantial amount of smoke. As a result, Anzalone was disabled and did not return to work until November 3, 1983, when the MBTA ordered Anzalone to return to work for light duty, or be terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">On the day Anzalone returned to work, he suffered an anxiety attack which caused him to be disabled from November 3, 1983, to April 20, 1984. Anzalone returned to work on April 20, 1984, and on June 6, 1984, was ordered to work in a room <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>with no ventilation and a temperature of 105 degrees. He again was disabled until June 8, 1984, at which time he returned to work. From June 19, 1984, until June 26, 1984, Anzalone was hospitalized for a cardiac catheterization. Thereafter, he returned to work until December 12, 1984, at which time he sustained a personal injury \u201cwhich caused him to become totally disabled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Anzalone filed for workmen\u2019s compensation payments pursuant to G. L. c. 152 (1986 ed.) (Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act), which the MBTA refused to pay. During the course of compensation proceedings before the Industrial Accident Board, the MBTA sent Anzalone to a number of physicians for examinations and evaluations. The MBTA has refused to supply Anzalone with copies of the medical reports.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">A. <em>Claim against employer. </em>Anzalone contends that he has alleged sufficient facts to state a claim under G. L. c. 93A and that the judge erroneously dismissed the complaint. In reviewing the dismissal oFa complaint pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (6), we take the facts alleged in the complaint to be true, and consider whether those allegations reveal that there is no set of facts which, if proven, would entitle the complainant to relief. <em>Santana </em>v. <em>Registrars of Voters of Worcester, </em>384 Mass. 487, 491 (1981). <em>Nader </em>v. <em>Citron, </em>372 Mass. 96, 98 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">In <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Zuckerman, </em>388 Mass. 8 (1983), we held that the Legislature did not intend to grant the protection of c. 93A to a former employee against his former employer in a dispute arising out of the employment relationship. <em>Id. </em>at 12. Anzalone asserts that <em>Manning </em>is inapposite because it was decided pursuant to G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, and Anzalone\u2019s action is brought under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9. In <em>Manning </em>we discussed the operative portion of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2 (a), which makes unlawful \u201c[ujnfair methods of competition and unfair or decep-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>live acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We stated that \u201cwe believe that the Legislature did not intend [c. 93A] to cover employment contract disputes between employers and the employees who work in the employer\u2019s organization, nor . . . disputes between members of that organization arising out of the employment relationship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nothing stated in the complaint makes this case anything other than a dispute arising out of an employment relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Anzalone argues, however, that this is not an employment dispute, but rather a dispute between him and an insurer. According to Anzalone, at the time the MBTA, a self-insurer under G. L. c. 152, committed the alleged unlawful trade practices, it was acting as an insurance company, not as An-zalone\u2019s employer, and thus violated G. L. c. 176D (1986 ed.).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Even if we assume the truth of Anzalone\u2019s allegations, G. L. c. 176D does not apply to the MBTA. General Laws c. 176D, \u00a7 1 (a), states that it applies to any self-insurer \u201cwhich is engaged in the business of insurance.\u201d A self-insuring employer under the workmen\u2019s compensation law does not become an insurance company. See <em>Bertrand </em>v. <em>Quincy Mkt. Cold Storage &amp; Warehouse Co., </em>728 F.2d 568, 571 (1st Cir. 1984). The judge correctly dismissed Anzalone\u2019s count against the MBTA and the loss of consortium claims, all of which are based on alleged violations of G. L. c. 93A.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">B. <em>Claim against co-employee. </em>In his count against O\u2019Loughlin, Anzalone alleged that, when he returned to work, O\u2019Loughlin ordered him to be in full uniform but not to carry a gun. The plaintiff alleged that O\u2019Loughlin criticized An-zalone\u2019s performance, ordered him to wash an automobile, in violation of the terms of light duty work, ordered Anzalone to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>perform dirty and menial jobs, and, when he had appointments with his physicians, required Anzalone to bring a note stating the time he arrived at his appointment, the time he left, and what was done. Anzalone further alleged that O\u2019Loughlin, in order to exacerbate Anzalone\u2019s physical condition, sent people smoking cigarettes into the office in which Anzalone was working, had people paint outside Anzalone\u2019s office, and placed Anzalone in a room with no ventilation and temperatures in excess of 100 degrees. At the end of his complaint, Anzalone concludes that O\u2019Loughlin \u201cintentionally and maliciously interfered with . . . Anzalone\u2019s employment with the M.B.T.A.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The defendants contend that the judge properly dismissed the complaint against O\u2019Loughlin because the complaint failed to set forth a claim of interference with contractual relations. The elements of the tort of interference with contractual relations were set out in <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Cronin, </em>107 Mass. 555, 562 (1871): \u201c(1) intentional and wilful acts (2) calculated to cause damage to the plaintiffs in their lawful business, (3) done with the unlawful purpose to cause such damage and loss, without right or justifiable cause on the part of the defendant, (which constitutes malice,) and (4) actual damage and loss resulting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">Anzalone\u2019s complaint does not allege that he was terminated, or that he separated from, or resigned from the MBTA. There is no allegation of any \u201closs of advantages, either of property or of personal benefit, which, but for [O\u2019Loughlin\u2019s] interference, the plaintiff would have been able to attain or enjoy.\u201d <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Cronin, supra </em>at 565. Because Anzalone\u2019s complaint failed to allege any actual damages or loss, the judge properly dismissed the claim against O\u2019Loughlin.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">Anzalone argues, however, that his complaint alleges an intentional tort by O\u2019Loughlin and that it was error for the judge to dismiss his claim against O\u2019Loughlin because intentional torts are not subject to the exclusivity bar in the workmen\u2019s compensation law. This is so, he says, because O\u2019Loughlin\u2019s conduct did not arise out of, and in the course of, O\u2019Loughlin\u2019s employment. Assuming, under this argument, that the essence of Anzalone\u2019s claim is the intentional infliction of emotional distress, we consider, on the facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>alleged, whether an employee can bring such a common law claim against his employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 15, provides in part: \u201cNothing in this section, or in section eighteen or twenty-four shall be construed to bar an action at law for damages for personal injuries ... by an employee against any person <em>other than </em>the insured person employing such employee . . . and said insured person\u2019s employees\u201d (emphasis added). In previous cases, we have concluded that the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act bars an employee injured in the course of his or her employment by the negligence of a fellow employee from recovering from that fellow employee if the fellow employee also was acting in the course of employment. <em>Mendes </em>v. <em>Tin Kee Ng, </em>400 Mass. 131 (1987). See <em>Saharceski </em>v. <em>Marcure, </em>373 Mass. 304, 306 (1977). We also have held that an employee is not barred from bringing an action against a fellow employee who commits an intentional tort which \u201cwas in no way within the scope of employment furthering the interests of the employer.\u201d <em>O\u2019Connell </em>v. <em>Chasdi, </em>400 Mass. 686, 690 (1987). However, a suit for an intentional tort in the course of the employment relationship is barred by the exclusivity provision of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, unless the employee has reserved a right of action pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 24.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Anzalone does not assert that he reserved his right under \u00a7 24. <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Polaroid Corp., </em>381 Mass. 545, 550 (1980) (claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress covered by c. 152; tort claim barred). The question, then, is whether O\u2019Loughlin\u2019s alleged actions occurred during the employment relationship; specifically, whether O\u2019Loughlin\u2019s conduct was \u201cwithin the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>scope of employment furthering the interests of the [MBTA].\u201d <em>O\u2019Connell </em>v. <em>Chasdi, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">O\u2019Loughlin\u2019s complained-of conduct related wholly to his position as Anzalone\u2019s supervisor and to the manner in which O\u2019Loughlin exercised his supervisory duties. The conduct complained of arose in the course of employment by the MBTA of Anzalone and O\u2019Loughlin. Thus, these claims are covered exclusively by c. 152. See <em>Albanese\u2019s Case, </em>378 Mass. 14 (1979) (claim for emotional distress covered by G. L. c. 152); <em>Fitzgibbons\u2019s Case, </em>374 Mass. 633 (1978) (same). The judge correctly dismissed Anzalone\u2019s count against O\u2019Loughlin.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>9</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b136-9\"> The complaint was amended a third time in a manner not pertinent to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b137-8\"> The status of the compensation claim before the Industrial Accident Board is hot before us. We note, however, that Anzalone\u2019s right to obtain copies of medical reports is adequately provided for by G. L. c. 152. See, e.g., G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 20, 20A, and 30A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b138-7\"> \u201cTrade\u201d and \u201ccommerce\u201d are defined in G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 1 <em>(b), </em>as: \u201c \u2018Trade\u2019 and \u2018commerce\u2019 shall include the advertising, the offering for sale, rent or lease, the sale, rent, lease or distribution of any services and any property, tangible or intangible, real, personal or mixed, and any other article, commodity, or thing of value wherever situate, and shall include any trade or commerce directly or indirectly affecting the people of this commonwealth.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b138-8\"> A violation of G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3 (9), is deemed, by virtue of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (1), to give rise to a c. 93A claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b140-18\"> Prior to the 1985 amendment, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 24, provided in part: \u201cAn employee shall be held to have waived his right of action at common law or under the law of any other jurisdiction in respect to an injury therein occurring, to recover damages for personal injuries if he shall not have given his employer, at the time of his contract of hire, written notice that he claimed such right, or, if the contract of hire was made before the employer became an insured person or self-insurer, if the employee shall not have given the said notice within thirty days of the time said employer became an insured person or a self-insurer.\u201d The subsequent amendments to this statute do not affect this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b141-7\"> We note that redress for Anzalone\u2019s claims against O\u2019Loughlin is provided for in the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. Section 28 of G. L. c. 152 provides for double damages in cases of \u201cserious and wilful misconduct\u201d by an employer, a fellow employee, or a supervisor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b141-8\"> The complaint against O\u2019Loughlin asserts no consortium claim as against him. Thus, we do not reach the issue of exclusivity in this regard. Additionally, although the plaintiff states that the motion to dismiss was \u201ctoo late,\u201d he makes no argument on this point. Thus, we consider the claim waived. Mass. R. A. P. 16, as amended through 386 Mass. 1247 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
