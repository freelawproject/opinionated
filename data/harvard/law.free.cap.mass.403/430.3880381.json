Blood, Jr., appeal from a final judgment dismissing their individual claims against the two defendants, Frederick G. Lea, M.D., and Emerson Hospital. The complaint alleged negligence in the care and treatment of Sharon Blood during pregnancy, labor, and subsequent delivery of Richard E. Blood, Jr., and that such negligence resulted in severe damage and harm to Richard E. Blood, Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B, a medical malpractice tribunal was convened. The tribunal held a hearing and concluded that the \u201cevidence\u201d presented to it, even if substantiated at trial, is insufficient to raise a legitimate question of liability appropriate for judicial inquiry. See G. L. c. 231,. \u00a7 60B, first par. Pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 54 (b), 365 Mass. 820 (1974), the plaintiffs moved for final judgment in their individual cases. After hearing, a judge entered an order for judgment pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 54 (b). Thereafter, a final judgment entered dismissing Sharon M. Blood\u2019s and Richard E. Blood\u2019s individual claims.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">On appeal, the plaintiffs allege error in the determination of the tribunal and in the composition of the tribunal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We granted direct appellate review on our own motion. We agree with the plaintiffs that the tribunal erred in its determination that the plaintiffs\u2019 offer of proof is insufficient to raise a legitimate question of liability appropriate for judicial inquiry. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>conclude that the plaintiffs waived any challenge to the composition of the tribunal. We reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">1. <em>The appeal. </em>The defendants assert that the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal is not properly before the court, and hence we should not consider their claims of error. Rather, they argue that we should dismiss the appeal. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Plaintiffs in a medical malpractice action may elect \u201cto have the alleged legal errors reviewed on appeal without first filing a bond and going to trial .... [They] thereby run[] the risk of being out of court entirely if [their] claim of error by the tribunal is decided adversely to [them] .... It is for [them] to decide whether [they are] willing to assume the potentially fatal risks of pretrial review after failing or refusing to file a bond.\u201d <em>Kapp </em>v. <em>Ballantine, </em>380 Mass. 186, 190-191 (1980). <em>McMahon </em>v. <em>Glixman, </em>379 Mass. 60, 63-64 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">We turn to the record to determine whether the plaintiffs properly appealed from the judgment. After the tribunal\u2019s determination, the plaintiffs moved to strike the findings of the tribunal because of an error in the composition of the tribunal. That motion was denied. The plaintiffs moved for a report of the issue of the composition of the tribunal. That motion was denied. Pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 54 (b), the plaintiffs then moved for entry of final judgment dismissing their individual claims, and leaving pending the claims of Richard E. Blood, Jr. See note 3, <em>supra. </em>A Superior Court judge expressly found that the allowance of the motion for final judgment would \u201cadvance the just, speedy and inexpensive determination of this action\u201d and that \u201c[t]here is therefore no just reason for delay in the entry of Final Judgment in favor of [the defendants] against Plaintiffs Sharon M. Blood and Richard E. Blood, individually with respect to their claims.\u201d A final judgment entered on February 26, 1987, and on March 5, 1987, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal. On these facts, it is clear that \u201c[t]he judgments as to the plaintiff[s\u2019] claims were final and appealable.\u201d <em>New England Canteen Serv., Inc. </em>v. <em>Ashley, </em>372 Mass. 671, 677 (1977). See Mass. R. Civ. P. 54 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>2. <em>The tribunal\u2019s determination. </em>The plaintiffs argue that the tribunal erred in its determination that the evidence presented was not sufficient to raise a legitimate question of liability appropriate for judicial inquiry. The plaintiffs correctly state that the tribunal must use the same standard that a judge would use \u201cin ruling on a defendant\u2019s motion for directed verdict.\u201d <em>Little </em>v. <em>Rosenthal, </em>376 Mass. 573, 578 (1978). \u201cThe applicable standard is comparable to that applied to a defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict, and appraisal of the <em>weight </em>and <em>credibility </em>of the evidence is <em>impermissible\u201d </em>(emphasis added). <em>Gugino </em>v. <em>Harvard Community Health Plan, </em>380 Mass. 464, 468 (1980).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cA plaintiff\u2019s offer of proof as to negligence will prevail before a malpractice tribunal . . . (1) if a doctor-patient relationship is shown, (2) if there is evidence that the doctor\u2019s performance did not conform to good medical practice, and (3) if damage resulted therefrom.\u201d <em>Kapp </em>v. <em>Bal-lantine, </em>380 Mass. 186, 193 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 offer of proof consisted of defendant Dr. Lea\u2019s office records; the discharge summary, labor and delivery summary and labor progress sheet from defendant Emerson Hospital; an opinion letter from Dr. Saul Lemer<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>; and a report from Dr. Martin Feldman.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">The doctor-patient relationship and hospital-patient relationship are clear from the records, and the defendants do not dispute the relationship each had with the plaintiffs. Thus, the remaining issues for the tribunal were whether Dr. Lea and the hospital fell below the standard of good medical practice and whether damage resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>The plaintiffs offered a letter from Dr. Saul Lemer, a physician practicing obstetrics and gynecology in Worcester and professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center. In the course of the letter, Dr. Lemer detailed the requirements of good medical practice in a case of pregnancy-induced hypertension and intrauterine growth retardation, including prompt diagnosis, fetal assessment, early intervention, and heightened alertness to the warning signs of fetal stress at delivery, and he specified how the defendants failed to meet those requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">In his letter, Dr. Lemer concluded that the \u201cbaby was in danger all of the last month of the pregnancy . . . [and that the] baby was further compromised by the failure of staff and physician to recognize the significance of the ominous fetal monitoring patterns being displayed immediately following admission to the hospital. This delay in rescuing the fetus from its dangerous predicament probably contributed to the damage to this baby\u2019s brain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">The defendants attack Dr. Lemer\u2019s letter on several grounds. They make much of the word \u201cprobably\u201d in the last sentence of Dr. Lemer\u2019s letter, asserting that it does not sufficiently support the allegation of a causal link between the malpractice and the injury. A medical expert\u2019s assessment of a \u201cprobable\u201d causal link between an alleged negligent act and an alleged injury is sufficient basis for consideration by a trier of fact. <em>Berardi </em>v. <em>Menicks, </em>340 Mass. 396, 402 (1960). The defendants assert that Dr. Lemer\u2019s opinion is based on surmise and conjecture. We do not agree. Doctor Lemer\u2019s opinion is based on the medical information in the records of Dr. Lea and Emerson Hospital. Doctor Lemer\u2019s opinion is not mere \u201cspeculation,\u201d but rather an opinion based on records before the tribunal. See <em>Girard </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 916 (1982). The defendants suggest that, in light of Dr. Lemer\u2019s expertise, he held the defendants to too high a standard. That argument goes to the weight of the evidence, not to its sufficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The documents offered by the plaintiffs, taken in the light most favorable to them, and with all permissible inferences, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>are sufficient to permit a reasonable fact finder to find that the defendants\u2019 acts or omissions caused the injury to the plaintiffs. The tribunal\u2019s decision in favor of the defendants therefore is in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">3. <em>The composition of the tribunal. </em>Iii view of our decision on the sufficiency of the plaintiffs\u2019 offer of proof, we need not pass on the composition of the tribunal. Nevertheless, because the issue has been fully argued, we express our opinion. <em>Wellesley College </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>313 Mass. 722, 731 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">General Laws c. 231, \u00a7 60B, requires that the medical member of the tribunal be chosen from a list which \u201cconsists] only of physicians who practice medicine outside the county where the defendant practices or resides or if the defendant is a medical institution . . . outside the county where said institution ... is located.\u201d The plaintiffs assert that the medical member of the tribunal convened in their case practices in Middlesex County as does Dr. Lea. Emerson Hospital is located in Middlesex County. The plaintiffs claim that the tribunal therefore lacked \u201cjurisdiction\u201d to hear this matter. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">The statute requires a physician member on the tribunal so that he or she may lend expertise in medical matters and assist in screening out nonmeritorious claims. <em>See Paro </em>v. <em>Longwood Hosp., </em>373 Mass. 645, 657 (1977). The physician member\u2019s place of practice or residence does not affect his or her expertise or the ability of the tribunal to fulfil its function of screening out nonmeritorious claims. \u201cJurisdiction concerns and defines the power of courts, encompassing the power to inquire into facts, apply the law, make decisions, and declare judgment.\u201d <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston </em>v. <em>Municipal Court of the Dorchester Dist.,31A </em>Mass. 640,662 (1978). In our view, the geographical area in which the physician member of the panel resides or practices is more akin to venue than to jurisdiction. Venue, of course, may be waived. <em>Paige </em>v. <em>Sinclair, </em>237 Mass. 482, 484 (1921).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">The plaintiffs, who knew of the physician member\u2019s identity before the hearing date, failed to object to the composition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>the tribunal prior to the hearing. Absent an objection, the place of residence or place of practice of the physician member is not \u201csufficient ground to deny the existence of a jurisdiction which was intended by the Legislature to be given.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>New York Cent. &amp; H.R.R.R., </em>206 Mass. 417, 428 (1910). Therefore, we deem the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to note their objection in a timely fashion a waiver of their objection. The judge correctly denied the motion to strike the tribunal\u2019s determination on the ground of \u201cjurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>The judgment dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 individual claims is vacated. The matter is remanded to the Superior Court, where the tribunal\u2019s decision is to be struck, and, in substitution therefor, a determination shall be entered that the offer of proof by the plaintiffs is sufficient to raise a legitimate question of liability appropriate for judicial inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b447-7\"> General Laws c. 231, \u00a7 60B, as amended by St. 1985, c. 759, \u00a7 3, provides in part: \u201cIf a finding is made for the defendant the plaintiff may pursue the claim through the usual judicial process only upon filing bond in the amount of two thousand dollars . . . , payable to the defendant for costs assessed ... if the plaintiff does not prevail in the final judgment. ... If said bond is not posted within thirty days of the tribunal\u2019s finding the action shall be dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">Because the plaintiffs filed two checks in the amount of $2,000 each, one check for each defendant, the judge did not dismiss the claims of Richard E. Blood, Jr., against the two defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b447-9\"> On the result we reach, we need not discuss the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that, in a malpractice case with derivative claims by family members, the family should be treated as a single plaintiff for purposes of determining the amount of the bond. We do not express our views because St. 1986, c. 351, substantially changed the wording of the bond section of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B, and the issue therefore is unlikely to recur in the same context.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b449-7\"> Contrary to the defendant\u2019s argument, the tribunal\u2019s function is not to \u201cevaluate\u201d the evidence in the full sense of that term. <em>Little </em>v. <em>Rosenthal, </em>376 Mass, at 578 &amp; n.4. Its function is limited to the determination of the sufficiency of the plaintiff\u2019s offer of proof, if that offer can be substantiated at trial, and does not include an assessment of the credibility of potential witnesses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b449-8\"> The letter was accompanied by a four and one-half page document detailing Dr. Lemer\u2019s qualifications and expertise in the field of obstetrics.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b449-9\"> The report from Dr. Feldman merely recited the condition of Richard E. Blood, Jr., at the time of the hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
