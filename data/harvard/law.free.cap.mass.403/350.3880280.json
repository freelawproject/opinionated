Cherubino, a licensed chiropractor, appeals to this court from a decision of the single justice affirming the decision of the Board of Registration of Chiropractors (board) that he had overutilized therapies in his practice of chiropractic medicine and had made improper charges, in violation of 233 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 4.06,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 4.07(1) and (5),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and in violation of G.

Regs. \u00a7 4.06, proscribing \u201coverutilization of practice,\u201d is unconstitutionally vague; (3) the board did not have authority to impose sanctions for violations of 233 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.06; (4) the board\u2019s decision was arbitrary and capricious; and (5) the board erred in refusing to admit in evidence a typewritten version of the chiropractor\u2019s handwritten patient progress notes and a chart summarizing the patient\u2019s treatment schedule. We conclude that there was no error, and we affirm the decision of the board.* ** <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">On April 12, 1985, the board issued an order to show cause, questioning whether Cherubino overutilized his practice in his treatment of one Michael Ellis and whether the fees charged for Ellis\u2019s treatment were excessive. After a hearing on October 2, 1985, the board concluded that Cherubino was guilty of excessive utilization of therapies and improper charges in violation of 233 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 4.06, 4.07(1) and (5). The board also concluded at that time that there was no evidence of a violation of G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">The plaintiff appealed to a single justice of this court who, on August 7,1986, remanded the matter to the board for further findings. On January 28, 1987, the board conducted a second hearing at which it allowed the plaintiff to recreate that portion of his testimony given at the first hearing which was not transcribed properly, received certain exhibits in evidence, including the plaintiff\u2019s written progress notes, and excluded a typewritten transcription of the progress report and a chart summarizing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>the patient\u2019s treatment schedule. The board entered an amended decision and order on April 13, 1987, ruling that Cherubino\u2019s treatment was excessive in violation of 233 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.06, that his charges were excessive in violation of 233 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.07(1) and (5), and that Cherubino had violated G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 61, in that he was guilty of \u201cdeceit and gross misconduct in the practice of his profession.\u201d The board reimposed its prior order by suspending Cherubino for three months, but stayed the suspension and imposed probation for a period of two years. The single justice affirmed the amended decision on September 15, 1987, holding that there was substantial evidence to support the finding of the board.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">We summarize the board\u2019s findings. Cherubino had been a licensed chiropractor in the Commonwealth for one and one-half years when Michael Ellis, a twenty-one year old man, first visited him for treatment on April 4, 1984. Ellis had been taken to Leonard Morse Hospital the previous day following a motorcycle accident, where he was examined, X-rayed, and discharged that same day with a diagnosis of cervical strain. Ellis complained to the plaintiff of pain in his neck and limited movement, and the plaintiff made a diagnosis of a so-called whiplash injury. He prescribed a program of treatment which included electrical stimulation to relieve muscle spasm, inter-segmental traction, and heat, all of which are considered by the chiropractic profession to be \u201csupportive procedures.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Acute muscle spasms on such cervical whiplash injuries rarely last more than four to six weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>Cherubino administered forty-four treatments to Ellis between April 4 and October 15, 1984, thirty-six of which were exactly the same despite the fact that on May 7, 1984, he entered into the patient\u2019s progress report that the conditions were improving and that pain and spasm had been reduced. Cherubino charged $3,690 for the treatments. The board concluded that Ellis had suffered a mild-to-moderate whiplash injury which was not sufficiently serious to warrant continuous supportive treatment for six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">1. <em>Substantial evidence. </em>The plaintiff contends that the board\u2019s decision is unsupported by substantial evidence. Substantial evidence is \u201csuch evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1 (6) (1986 ed.). <em>New Boston Garden Corp. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>383 Mass. 456, 466 (1981). Our review under the substantial evidence standard is circumscribed. <em>Langlitz </em>v. <em>Board of Registration of Chiropractors, </em>396 Mass. 374, 379 (1985). \u201cWhile we must consider the entire record, and must take into account whatever in the record detracts from the weight of the [board\u2019s] opinion, <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Board ofRegistration in Pharmacy, </em>350 Mass. 246, 253 (1966), as long as there is substantial evidence to support the findings of the [board], we will not substitute our views as to the facts.\u201d <em>Arthurs </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Medicine, </em>383 Mass. 299, 304 (1981). See <em>Bill </em>v. <em>Board of Registration of Chiropractors, </em>394 Mass. 779, 781 (1985). We conclude that the board\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">The board took testimony from two expert witnesses. Allan R. Steingisser* ***** <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> found that the supportive procedures were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>consistent with the diagnosis or the findings between April 4 and June 8,1984. Charles B. Johns <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> testified that the treatments given by Cherubino were excessive after the initial four to six weeks and were not reasonable or necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">Cherubino argues that the board could not rely properly on the opinions of these experts because they were formed without the benefit of Cherubino\u2019s patient progress notes. These experts based their conclusions on Ellis\u2019s medical records, including the hospital report relating to his injury and Chembino\u2019s letters to the insurance company describing the patient\u2019s progress.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Chembino\u2019s medical report of April 10, 1984, included the results of his orthopedic examination, neurological examination, and X-ray examination, as well as his clinical comments, diagnosis, and recommendation for treatment. His letters of May 7 and June 13, 1984, noted that the patient\u2019s pain and spasm had been reduced and that the range of motion had improved. The fact that Johns and Steingisser did not have the patient progress notes before them when they formed their judgment does not negate their testimony. The board admitted Chembino\u2019s handwritten progress notes in evidence, expressly finding that these notes were consistent with Johns\u2019s testimony that Ellis\u2019s condition did not warrant continuing the therapy. The board \u201cis free to evaluate evidence in light of its own technical expertise.\u201d <em>Langlitz </em>v. <em>Board of Registration of Chiropractors, supra </em>at 381. The board, after engaging in its own evaluation of the progress notes as well as the other evidence before it, could conclude that the forty-four treatments in six months were not justified by the patient\u2019s condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Cherubino testified that Ellis\u2019s continued complaints of pain due to racquetball necessitated further treatment. In its decision, the board \u201cdiscounted\u201d this testimony \u201cin large part, both in light of all the other evidence presented and by [its] opinion of the credibility of the witnesses before it.\u201d \u201cCredibility of witnesses is for the agencies . . . and the agency has the benefit of observing the witnesses in judging credibility.\u201d <em>Vaspoura-kan, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>401 Mass. 347, 352 (1987). The board, and not this court, has the responsibility of deciding preliminary questions of credibility and the weight of the evidence; the board was not required to believe all of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Maddocks </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeals Bd., </em>369 Mass. 488, 495 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">The references to racquetball in the written progress notes compiled by the plaintiff did not compel the board to find that the patient required the additional treatment. The board was not required to grant credence to every entry the plaintiff had made in his written progress notes. The board was free to accept as true only a portion of the plaintiff\u2019s handwritten progress notes. The board \u201cmay disbelieve the whole or a part of a party\u2019s [or witness\u2019s] tesitmony, even where it is uncontradicted.\u201d <em>Calderone </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>360 Mass. 174, 176 (1971), <em>quoting Lydon </em>v. <em>Boston Elev. Ry., </em>309 Mass. 205,206 (1941). See P.J. Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence 131 (5th ed. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">2. <em>Vagueness. </em>The plaintiff claims that 233 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.06 is unconstitutionally vague. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">\u201c \u2018A law is void for vagueness if persons \u201cof common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application.\u201d \u2019 <em>Caswell </em>v. <em>Licensing Comm\u2019n for Brockton, </em>387 Mass. 864, 873 (1983), quoting <em>Connally </em>v. <em>General Constr. Co., </em>269 U.S. 385, 391 (1926). \u2018. . . [Statutes that do not define or relate to criminal conduct need not be drawn as precisely as statutes that touch upon criminal acts. ... [If] neither First Amendment freedoms nor criminal conduct are concerned ... we limit out vagueness analysis to whether [the statute or regulation] is unconstitutionally vague as applied in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>[the particular] case . . . .\u2019 <em>Caswell, supra. Aristocratic Restaurant of Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n (No. 1), </em>374 Mass. 547, 552, appeal dismissed for want of a substantial Federal question, 439 U.S. 803 (1978).\u201d <em>Gurry </em>v. <em>Board of Pub. Accountancy, </em>394 Mass. 118, 127 (1985). Because suspension of a chiropractor\u2019s license is not penal or criminal in nature, <em>id., </em>we apply the less strict civil standard in our analysis of 233 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.06. <em>Lapointe </em>v. <em>License Bd. of Worcester, </em>389 Mass. 454, 462 (1983), citing <em>Caswell </em>v. <em>Licensing Comm\u2019n for Brockton, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Title 233 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.06 defines \u201c[o]verutilization of practice\u201d as \u201cpractice excessive in quality or amount to the needs of the patient.\u201d As applied to the facts of this case, as found by the board, this regulation could be understood without any guesswork. \u201cPersons of common intelligence\u201d could conclude easily that a patient with an injury that normally required from four to six weeks of treatment did not need forty-four separate treatments over a six-month period, absent proven exceptional circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Title 233 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.06, when read in context, also gives a practitioner guidance. Title 233 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.03 provides, in part, that \u201c[sjupportive procedures shall be supplemental or ancillary to the chiropractic adjustment and must not be used as an independent therapy. The use of supportive procedures MUST AT ALL TIMES be supported by a clinical rationale equivalent to present additional standards as well as ususal and customary practices\u201d (emphasis in original). Read together, \u00a7\u00a7 4.06 and 4.03 put the practicing chiropractor on notice that when supportive procedures are administered, they must be justified by the clinically diagnosed needs of the patient and may not constitute the primary form of therapy. The board found that Cherubino repeatedly treated his patient with the same three costly supportive procedures without furnishing sufficient justification. A person of common intelligence would have known that such behavior was within the scope of activity proscribed by 233 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.06. We note that the standard in this case \u2014 treatment not \u201cexcessive in quality or amount to the needs of the patient\u201d \u2014 is cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>tainly clearer than the regulation which disciplined accountants for acts \u201cdiscreditable to the profession,\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which the court in <em>Gurry, supra </em>at 126-127, refused to hold unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">3. <em>The board\u2019s authority to issue sanctions. </em>The plaintiff argues that the board lacks authority to impose sanctions for violations of 233 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 4.06 and 4.07. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">\u201cAn agency . . . has considerable leeway in interpreting a statute it is charged with enforcing.\u201d <em>Grocery Mfrs. of Am., Inc., </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>379 Mass. 70, 75 (1979). <em>See Manning </em>v. <em>Boston Redevelopment Auth., </em>400 Mass. 444, 453 (1987). The board properly could conclude, on remand by the single justice, that \u201c[ojverutilization of practice\u201d and \u201c[ijmproper charges\u201d are forms of deceit or gross misconduct subject to discipline under G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 61. See <em>Leigh </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Nursing, </em>395 Mass. 670,675 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">The board\u2019s regulations must bear only a rational relation to the enabling statute. <em>Citizens for Responsible Envtl. Management </em>v. <em>Attleboro Mall, Inc., </em>400 Mass. 658, 669 (1987). <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Board of Registration &amp; Discipline in Medicine, </em>378 Mass. 519, 524 (1979). \u201c[T]he Legislature through the board has provided for the imposition of sanctions \u2018to protect the life, health and welfare of the people at large and to set up a plan whereby those who practice [chiropractic] will have the qualifications which will prevent, as far as possible, the evils which could result from ignorance or incompetency or a lack of honesty and integrity.\u2019\u201d <em>Keigan </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Medicine, </em>399 Mass. 719, 722 (1987), quoting <em>Matanky </em>v. <em>Medical Examiners, </em>79 Cal. App. 3d 293, 305 (1978). Imposing sanctions for excessive treatment and charges bears a rational relation to the Legislature\u2019s goal of safeguarding the public welfare through regulation of the chiropractic profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">4. <em>Was the board\u2019s action arbitrary or </em>capricious? The plaintiff maintains that the board\u2019s amended decision was arbi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>trary and capricious because it reversed its earlier finding that there was no evidence of a violation of G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The board\u2019s amended finding of a violation of G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 61, when it originally failed to make this finding, does not constitute an arbitrary or capricious action. The board states in its amended decision that its failure to find violation of \u00a7 61 was \u201cinadvertent.\u201d There is nothing in the record to refute this statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">General Laws c. 112, \u00a7 61, authorizes the board to suspend or revoke the license of a practitioner who is found to be guilty of \u201cdeceit [or] . . . gross misconduct in the practice of his profession.\u201d A violation of 233 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 4.06 and 4.07 falls within the conduct proscribed by G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 61. The board was not required to show additional wrongdoing on the part of the chiropractor to justify its imposition of sanctions. Where there is substantial evidence in the record to support the board\u2019s decision, we conclude that it was not arbitrary or capricious as matter of law. See <em>Massachusetts Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>376 Mass. 294,312 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">5. <em>Exclusion of two documents. </em>The board did not err in excluding the typewritten transcription of Cherubino\u2019s handwritten patient progress notes and the chart summarizing the patient\u2019s visits to his office, both prepared by his counsel. The board did admit the handwritten notes in evidence, and they appear to us to be sufficiently legible. The board was within its discretion to exclude the verbatim transcription and the chart, both of which it had admitted as chalks. <em>Dyecraftsmen, Inc. </em>v. <em>Feinberg, </em>359 Mass. 485, 487 (1971). P.J. Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence 403-404 (5th ed. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">The matter is remanded to the single justice, and a judgment affirming the decision of the board is to be entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b367-10\"> Title 233 Code Mass.
