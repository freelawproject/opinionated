The Commonwealth sought an inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>locutory appeal. Mass. R. Crim. P. 15 (b) (2), 378 Mass. 884 (1979). We reverse the order allowing the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">We summarize the facts as found by the motion judge. At approximately 10 p.m., on June 11, 1986, Detective Eduardo Dominguez received a telephone call at Boston police headquarters from an informant. Dominguez, who was assigned to the drug control unit, had received information from this individual on approximately thirty prior occasions and the informant\u2019s tips had led to arrests and convictions of individuals trafficking in cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">The informant told Detective Dominguez that an unnamed Hispanic male with dark hair and a moustache, wearing a red T-shirt and black pants and carrying a brown bag would be arriving in Boston on the 11 p.m. Greyhound bus from New York City. The informant stated that the man would be carrying cocaine. Acting on this information, Detective Dominguez and three other officers proceeded to the Greyhound terminal where they set up a surveillance.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">The bus from New York arrived at 11:05 p.m. Dominguez saw the defendant, who fit the informant\u2019s description, disembark from the bus. The defendant entered the terminal and made a telephone call from a public telephone. The defendant was in the terminal approximately eight or nine minutes. The defendant then left the terminal and hailed a taxicab.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">As the defendant was about to enter the cab, Detective Dominguez arrested him. Dominguez opened the defendant\u2019s bag and found forty foil packages containing powdered cocaine, a plastic bag containing rock cocaine, and a substance frequently used to cut cocaine. The defendant filed a motion to suppress the evidence seized from his bag. The Superior Court judge allowed the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">After the judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, the Commonwealth sought an interlocutory appeal. See Mass. R. Crim. P. 15 (b) (2). In seeking its appeal, the Commonwealth failed to file a notice of appeal in the Superior Court, see Mass. R. A. P. 3 (a), as appearing in 378 Mass. 924 (1978), prior to filing its application before the single justice. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>As a result, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the application as untimely filed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bouvier, </em>399 Mass. 1002, 1003 (1987). Following oral argument, the single justice allowed the Commonwealth\u2019s application and transferred the case to the Appeals Court. The defendant filed a notice of appeal in the county court challenging the propriety of the order of the single justice, alleging again that the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal was untimely filed. Thereafter, the single justice allowed a motion by the Commonwealth, unopposed by the defendant, to transfer the case from the Appeals Court to this court to be heard together with the other cases raising the same issue that we decide today.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">We discuss first the defendant\u2019s argument that the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to file a notice of appeal in the Superior Court requires the present appeal to be dismissed. The Commonwealth ordinarily must file a timely notice of appeal under rule 3 (a) in order to perfect an interlocutory appeal in a criminal case. <em>Bouvier, supra. </em>The defendant clearly raised this point at the hearing on the Commonwealth\u2019s application, and the single justice expressly stated in his order that he allowed the Commonwealth\u2019s application, \u201c[ujpon consideration of counsels\u2019 argument.\u201d Thus, implicit in the order of the single justice is the exercise of his authority to \u201csuspend the requirements or provisions of any of these rules in a particular case on application of a party or on [his] own motion and . . . order proceedings in accordance with [his] direction.\u201d Mass. R. A. P. 2, 365 Mass. 845 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Although the better practice would have been for the single justice expressly to permit the Commonwealth to file a notice of appeal (subject to the time limit in Mass. R. A. P. 14 [b], as appearing in 378 Mass. 924 [1979]), <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and to condition his allowance of the application on the Commonwealth\u2019s filing a proper notice in the Superior Court, we decline to rule that the procedure he selected in this case requires dismissal of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The single justice expressly ordered \u201cthat the Clerk of the Superior Court Department of the Trial Court for the County of Suffolk assemble the record in [this case] and transmit the record to the Appeals Court of the Commonwealth for determination by that court.\u201d In the circumstances of this case, we conclude that the single justice\u2019s order, which was filed in the Superior Court the day after its issuance, served the purpose of a rule 3 (a) notice of appeal. We therefore proceed to the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">The issue on appeal is whether there was probable cause to support the defendant\u2019s arrest and the search of his bag. As we concluded in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, ante </em>163 (1988), an arrest and search comports with the due process requirements of art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights if the information known to the police at the time of the arrest satisfies the two-pronged test of <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108 (1964), and <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>393 U.S. 410 (1969). Independent police corroboration of the details of the informant\u2019s tip may compensate for a deficiency in either or both prongs of <em>the Aguilar-Spinelli </em>inquiry. <em>Robinson, supra </em>at 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Addressing first the reliability prong of the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>inquiry, we conclude, as did the judge below, that the informant\u2019s reliability was established by the accurate and reliable information he had provided Detective Dominguez on numerous prior occasions. As the judge below noted, this information had resulted in convictions. Thus, the informant\u2019s past record of supplying credible information to Detective Dominguez satisfies the reliability prong of the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>We turn to the basis of the knowledge requirement. The motion judge found that the informant had not provided the officer with information as to any underlying circumstances from which a basis for the informant\u2019s knowledge could be found. In analyzing whether independent police corroboration satisfies either or both prongs of the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>inquiry, we have used the detail provided by the informant in <em>Draper </em>v. <em>United States, </em>358 U.S. 307 (1959), as a suitable point of comparison. See <em>Robinson, supra </em>at 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">We conclude that the facts in this case compare favorably with the facts in <em>Draper, </em>and that there was sufficient independent police corroboration of the informant\u2019s tip to satisfy the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>inquiry. In this case, as in <em>Draper, </em>the informant described the defendant\u2019s physical appearance and clothing. The informant also correctly stated the defendant\u2019s time and place of arrival and the fact that he would be carrying a brown bag. Accordingly, we conclude that the motion judge should not have allowed the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. The order therefore is reversed and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b185-7\"> The Commonwealth filed its application for an interlocutory appeal within four days after the Superior Court judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b186-6\"> \u201cAppellate Rule 2, substantially tracking [Fed. R. A. P. 2], injects flexibility into the appellate structure. It permits relaxation of the rules in the interest of expedition, or for good cause . . . .\u201d Reporters\u2019 Notes to Mass. R. A. P. 2, Mass. Ann. Laws, Rules of Appellate Procedure at 268 (1982)</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">We are influenced in our thinking by the fact that allowing the Com-mnwealth\u2019s appeal permitted this case to be decided together with other cases raising similar substantive issues. The single justice was aware of the judicial economy to be achieved in allowing the application, as he allowed a similar application in one of the companion cases, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, post </em>172 (1988), on the same day.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
