Mathew\u2019s asserted damages include his medical expenses. Meg Manderson Norman, Mathew\u2019s mother, and Paul M. Norman, his father, seek damages for the loss of Mathew\u2019s consortium and they, too, seek damages for his medical expenses. The defendants moved to dismiss the parents\u2019 claims, and that motion was denied. Pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 64, 365 Mass. 831 (1974), the judge reported his ruling to the Appeals Court, and we granted direct appellate review. We now reverse the order denying the defendants\u2019 motion. We remand the case for the entry of an order dismissing the parents\u2019 claims and for further proceedings with respect to Mathew\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">In reviewing a ruling on a motion to dismiss, we accept as true the allegations of the complaint. <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Zuckerman, </em>388 Mass. 8, 9 (1983). We must determine whether the plaintiffs would be entitled to recover on any set of facts provable under the complaint. <em>Flattery </em>v. <em>Gregory, </em>397 Mass. 143, 146 (1986). <em>Bahceli </em>v. <em>Bahceli, </em>lO Mass. App. Ct. 446,451 (1980). In that connection, we observe that the complaint is silent with respect to whether Mathew was an adult or a minor, and was emancipated or unemancipated when the accident occurred. Neither fact is essential to our resolution of the consortium issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">In <em>Diaz </em>v. <em>Eli Lilly &amp; Co., </em>364 Mass. 153, 165 (1973), we recognized a right of recovery for loss of spousal consortium. We rejected the proposition that recognition of that right would logically require recognition of a similar right inhering in countless other relationships. <em>Id. </em>Our promise was to \u201cproceed from case to case with discerning caution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Subsequently, when we decided to allow dependent minor children to recover for the loss of a parent\u2019s consortium, we reiterated \u201cour determination to \u2018proceed from case to case with discerning caution\u2019 in this field.\u201d <em>Ferriter </em>v. <em>Daniel O\u2019Connell\u2019s Sons, </em>381 Mass. 507, 516 (1980). Our repeated commitment to use discerning caution was prompted by an awareness that, as a matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>of sound public policy, the law cannot and should not attempt to right all wrongs. \u201c [A]s a matter of policy, it must be recognized that tort liability cannot be extended without limit.\u201d <em>Feliciano </em>v. <em>Rosemar Silver Co., </em>401 Mass. 141, 142 (1987). See <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp., </em>389 Mass. 327, 341 (1983). The court must carefully limit the situations in which a defendant may be liable to persons indirectly affected by injuries negligently inflicted on third persons. Otherwise, society\u2019s exposure to the threat of financial ruin will be intolerable. \u201cThe problem for the law is to limit the legal consequences of wrongs to a controllable degree.\u201d <em>Payton </em>v. <em>Abbott Labs, </em>386 Mass. 540, 551 (1982), quoting <em>Tobin </em>v. <em>Grossman, </em>24 N.Y.2d 609, 619 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">In <em>Diaz </em>and <em>Ferriter </em>we recognized that the relationship between a negligently injured person and a person seeking recovery for loss of consortium may be such that recourse for the consortium loss must be available despite the strong public interest in not expanding tort liability beyond tolerable limits. Accepting that proposition, but also accepting the proposition that the possibility of recovery cannot wisely be extended to every relationship in which a loss of consortium has been sustained, we must draw a principled, defensible line between those relationships to which a right of recovery should attach and those relationships with respect to which no such right should be recognized. \u201cEvery effort must be made to avoid arbitrary lines which \u2018unnecessarily produce incongruous and indefensible results.\u2019\u201d <em>Dziokonski </em>v. <em>Babineau, </em>375 Mass. 555, 568 (1978), quoting <em>Mone </em>v. <em>Greyhound Lines, Inc., </em>368 Mass. 354, 365 (1975) (Braucher, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">By the very nature of marriage, spouses depend on one another\u2019s society, companionship, love and support (consortium) to a degree of intensity not normally present in other relationships. An injury to a spouse that impairs his or her ability to fulfil the other spouse\u2019s needs in that regard ordinarily is uniquely serious, identifiable and predictable. Our recognition of a right of recovery for the loss of spousal consortium in <em>Diaz </em>reflects that fact. Subsequently, in <em>Ferriter, supra </em>at 510, in concluding that a dependent minor child should be en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>titled to recovery for the loss of a parent\u2019s consortium, we characterized a minor child\u2019s interest in his parent\u2019s society as \u201cclosely analogous\u201d to the interest of a wife in her husband\u2019s society recognized in <em>Diaz. </em>We expressed our skepticism \u201cof any suggestion that the child\u2019s interest... is less intense than the wife\u2019s.\u201d In the ordinary course of things, the dependence of spouses on one another for love and support is found to the same degree in no other relationship except, perhaps, in the relationship of a minor child to his or her parents. The key to our holding in <em>Ferriter </em>was our recognition that ordinarily minor children are critically dependent on their parents for the spiritual and physical necessities of life. Thus, we concluded that the Ferriter children had \u201ca viable claim for loss of parental society if they [could] show that they are minors dependent on [their injured father].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 516. We added: \u201cThis dependence must be rooted not only in economic requirements, but also in filial needs for closeness, guidance, and nurture.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">The Appeals Court\u2019s decision in <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Lalumiere, 22 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 262, 270 (1986), is consistent with <em>Diaz </em>and <em>Ferriter. </em>In <em>Morgan, </em>the court allowed a mentally and physically disabled adult child to recover for the loss of the consortium of his mother upon whom he was \u201cphysically, emotionally, and financially\u201d dependent. The common thread in <em>Diaz, Ferriter, </em>and <em>Morgan </em>was the unique and intense dependency intrinsic to the relationship of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Although parents customarily <em>enjoy </em>the consortium of their children, in the ordinary course of events a parent does not <em>depend </em>on a child\u2019s companionship, love, support, guidance, and nurture in the same way and to the same degree that a husband depends on his wife, a wife depends on her husband, or a minor or disabled adult child depends on his or her parent. Of course, it is true that such dependency may exist in a particular situation, but it is not intrinsic to the parent-child relationship as is a minor child\u2019s dependency on his or her parents and as is each spouse\u2019s dependency on the other spouse. Thus, a principled distinction can be made between the situations governed by the <em>Diaz, Ferriter, </em>and <em>Morgan </em>cases and the instant case. On the other hand, if a plaintiff parent is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>permitted to recover in the circumstances of this case, there will be no defensible reason in the future to deny recovery to other relatives or even to friends who can establish that a defendant\u2019s conduct has adversely interfered with their relationship with the physically injured person.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Our opinions in <em>Stowe </em>v. <em>Heywood, </em>7 Allen 118 (1863), and <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>179 Mass. 576 (1901), both of which involved intentional torts, did not intimate that a parent should recover for the loss of a child\u2019s consortium resulting from injuries negligently inflicted on the child. In <em>Stowe, </em>we observed that a father may recover loss of consortium damages not only for the seduction of his daughter, but also \u201cin various other actions for injuries <em>wilfully </em>inflicted\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 122. We then said, \u201cWe therefore need not now inquire whether damages for such suffering can be recovered, when it is the effect of an injury caused by negligence and carelessness only, and not by design.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 122-123. As Justice Liacos recently stated for the court, relative to an action based on negligence, \u201cit does not appear that damages for the parent\u2019s mental suffering or for loss of the child\u2019s society [have been] available when the gravamen of the parent\u2019s claim was physical injury to the child.\u201d <em>Ferriter, supra </em>at 512.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Not only do our decisions involving intentional torts fail in their language to support the proposition that a parent should recover for the loss of a child\u2019s consortium as a result of negligently inflicted injuries, but also sound policy suggests the appropriateness of a distinction between loss of consortium due to intentional wrongdoing and a similar loss due to negligence. Whether recovery should be permitted requires a proper balancing of the desirability of compensating injured persons with the undesirability of imposing unfair burdens on defendants. Whether the tort is intentional or negligent is a factor relevant to the equation. Society is rightly less concerned about the burden placed on an intentional wrongdoer than about the burden placed on one who has been merely negligent. In <em>Payton </em>v. <em>Abbott Labs, </em>386 Mass. 540, 547 (1982), we recognized this truth in another context when we said: \u201cIt should be noted . . . that the retributive function of imposing tort liability is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>served by allowing recovery for emotional distress, without proof of physical harm, where a defendant\u2019s conduct was either intentional or reckless. Where a defendant was only negligent, his fault is not so great as to require him to compensate the plaintiff for a purely mental disturbance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">If, as a result of the defendants\u2019 negligence, Mathew Norman had died, his parents, as next of kin, would have been entitled to recover under the wrongful death statute, G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2, for the loss of his consortium. Does consistency require that the parents be entitled to recover for the loss of Mathew\u2019s consortium due, not to Mathew\u2019s death, but to his injuries? Does consistency require that recovery for loss of consortium be available to anyone who would have been the injured person\u2019s next of kin had the injured person died? We think not. In a wrongful death action, damages are not recoverable both for the injured person\u2019s losses and the derivative losses of others. In a wrongful death action, although the next of kin may recover for loss of consortium, no one recovers for the losses sustained by the injured deceased party. Here, the plaintiffs seek to recover for both. We conclude that the plaintiff parents cannot recover for the loss of their injured child\u2019s consortium.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">In addition to their loss of consortium claim, Meg Manderson Norman and Paul M. Norman seek to recover their contribution to the payment of Mathew\u2019s medical expenses. Although the complaint is silent with respect to Mathew\u2019s age, it is undisputed that, at the time of the accident, Mathew was nineteen years old, and was therefore an adult. G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Forty-eighth and Fiftieth (1986 ed.). Because Mathew seeks his medical expenses and, assuming the defendants\u2019 liability, is entitled to them, the parents\u2019 claim for the same expenses should be dismissed. This case is remanded to the Superior Court for the entry of an order dismissing the parents\u2019 claims, and for further proceedings with respect to Mathew\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b325-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>Liacos, J.</author>\n<p id=\"aeg-dedup-0\">(dissenting, with whom Wilkins and Abrams, JJ., join). I dissent. At the outset, based on the facts alleged in this case, I would rephrase the court\u2019s statement of the issue before us as follows: The principal question in this case is whether a parent has a cause of action for the loss of an adult child\u2019s society and companionship when that child has been severely and permanently injured due to the defendant\u2019s negligence. In my view it is legally significant that the complaint not only alleges that Mathew Norman was struck by a Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) vehicle, negligently operated by its employee, the defendant, Steven De-Dominici, but also that, as a result, Mathew suffered \u201cserious injury to his brain,\u201d which has rendered him \u201clargely incapacitated,\u201d \u201cpermanently disabled,\u201d and \u201ctotally dependent on his parents for financial, physical and emotional sustenance.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">The court holds today that the motion to dismiss the consortium claims of the parents should have been allowed. In reviewing a ruling on a motion to dismiss, the court must accept as true the allegations of the complaint. <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Zuckerman, </em>388 Mass. 8, 9 (1983). The court must determine whether the plaintiffs would be entitled to recover on any set of facts provable under the complaint. <em>Flattery </em>v. <em>Gregory, </em>397 Mass. 143, 146 (1986). <em>Bahceli </em>v. <em>Bahceli, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 446, 451 (1980). The court, apparently relying on \u201cpolicy\u201d grounds, holds that parents such as these plaintiffs should not be allowed even the opportunity to prove their severe loss in a court of law. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">I need not review here the extensive common law history defining the rights of parents, spouses, and children for loss of services and society, whether caused by intention or negligence. That history was reviewed extensively in <em>Diaz </em>v. <em>Eli Lilly &amp; Co., </em>364 Mass. 153, 154-161 (1973) (reviewing development of spousal rights for loss of consortium). In <em>Diaz </em>the court stated that \u201c[spousal] consortium . . . comprised the right to society and sexual relations, and had . . . been emptied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>of the element of services or earning capacity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 161. Thus, the court concluded that either spouse has a claim for a loss of consortium shown to arise from personal injury of the other spouse, caused by negligence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 167-168. Next, in <em>Ferriter </em>v. <em>Daniel O\u2019 Connell\u2019s Sons, </em>381 Mass. 507, 509-517 (1980), we reviewed the common law history pertaining to a minor child\u2019s right to a claim for loss of consortium of the parent. Again, as in <em>Diaz, </em>we referred to the loss of services aspect of the right as \u201ca technical requirement, an acknowledged fiction.\u201d <em>Ferriter, supra </em>at 511. The court recognized, in <em>Ferriter, </em>a dependent child\u2019s right to recover for loss of parental society and companionship \u201crooted not only in economic requirements, but also in filial needs for closeness, guidance, and nurture.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 516.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">In <em>Ferriter, </em>for purposes of analogy, the court also reviewed the case law pertaining to a parent\u2019s right to recover for loss of a child\u2019s services and society, and concluded that \u201c[t]he common law has traditionally recognized a parent\u2019s interest in freedom from tortious conduct harming his relationship with his child . . . [and] compensated parents for sentimental as well as economic injuries.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 512. Many years earlier, in <em>Stowe </em>v. <em>Heywood, </em>7 Allen 118,122 (1863), this court, without deciding the issue, recognized the possibility that even where the loss of a child\u2019s services and society is caused by negligence, damages may be recovered for the \u201cdistress and anxiety of mind which the parent has sustained in being deprived of the society and comfort of the child.\u201d See <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>179 Mass. 576, 579-580 (1901) (parent may recover for loss of child\u2019s services and for injury to feelings). Although the plaintiff-father in <em>Stowe </em>was deprived of his child\u2019s society and comfort due to the physical absence of the child (the child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>having been enticed away from her father\u2019s home by the defendant), rather than a physical injury, the court acknowledged that a parent suffers an emotional loss and may be compensated therefor when there is interference with the normal parent-child relationship. <em>Cook, supra, </em>involved an intentional tort, but similarly recognized that damages recoverable by a parent \u201cmay include compensation for the injury to his feelings<em>\" Id. </em>at 580.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Despite the court\u2019s efforts in this case to narrow the reading of our case law, a more objective reading of our prior cases reveals a process where the court gradually has broadened the common law recognition of a parent\u2019s right to recover for loss of filial consortium where the child sustains serious physical injuries as a result of the defendant\u2019s negligence. Statutory enactments also demonstrate an analogous legislative policy. Parents, as next of kin, may recover for loss of consortium after the death of a child in a wrongful death action. G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 1(4);<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Poyser </em>v. <em>United States, </em>602 F. Supp. 436, 440 (D. Mass. 1984). There should be a consistency between our statutory law and our case law. It would be anomalous to take the position that, if a child is severely injured, but does not die, the parents may not recover. See <em>Ferriter </em>v. <em>Daniel O\u2019Connell\u2019s Sons, supra </em>at 515-516. The reasons for allowing the former militate in favor of the latter.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>\u201cIt is easy to see that the loss of a child through his death takes from his parents the society and companionship that is the essence of the lost relationship. But consider the magnitude of the loss of society and companionship that occurs when a normal 16-year-old is suddenly reduced to a blind, nearly deaf, partially paralyzed child with a mental age of three. The parental expectations for the continuation of the family relationship are the same in either case. That the parents still have their son to love and care for is a factor to consider in determining the extent of their loss, but does not negate the loss. They have sustained a genuine loss in the nature of the society and companionship they can anticipate receiving from their son as a consequence of his injuries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-4\">\u201cPerhaps the loss of companionship and society experienced by the parents of a child permanently and severely injured ... is in some ways even greater than that suffered by parents of a deceased child. Not only has the normal family relationship been destroyed, as when a child dies, but the parent also is confronted with his loss each time he is with his child and experiences again the child\u2019s diminished capacity to give comfort, society, and companionship.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWC\">Note, The Parental Claim for Loss of Society and Companionship Resulting from the Negligent Injury of a Child: A Proposal for Arizona, 1980 Ariz. St. L.J. 909, 923.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">The notion of allowing loss of consortium for an injured child is neither new nor in disrepute. It has been accepted in Florida since 1926,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and a number of jurisdictions permit par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>ents to recover either by statute <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> or by common law.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> *11 See Annot., 54 A.L.R. 4th 112 (1987). These jurisdictions recognize that, in the case of a severely injured child, the quality of the parent-child relationship, as well as the parents\u2019 expectations of a normal family life, can be impaired seriously. Moreover, at least one of these jurisdictions has expressly extended the cause of action for filial consortium to cases in which the severely injured child is an adult, recognizing that parents continue to enjoy a legitimate expectation of their child\u2019s consortium beyond the age of majority \u201carising from the very bonds of the family.\u201d <em>Frank </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>150 Ariz. 228, 233 (1986). I doubt that, in these jurisdictions, \u201csociety\u2019s exposure to the threat of financial ruin [has been] intolerable,\u201d as the court now claims. <em>Ante </em>at 305. The line the court draws is neither \u201cprincipled\u201d nor \u201cdefensible\u201d but rather defeats the long established policy of this Commonwealth of protecting the integrity and sanctity of the family unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Damages for loss of consortium are allowed in this Commonwealth when familial relations are affected when a husband sues for the tortious injury to his wife, <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>New York, N.H. &amp; H.R.R., </em>168 Mass. 308, 311 (1897); when a wife sues for the tortious injury to her husband, <em>Diaz </em>v. <em>Eli Lilly &amp; Co., supra </em>at 167-168; and when a child sues for the tortious injury to his or her parent, <em>Ferriter </em>v. <em>Daniel O\u2019Connell\u2019s Sons, supra </em>at 516. There is no sound reason for drawing an arbitrary distinction when a parent sues for loss of consortium <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>for tortious injury to his or her child where the child has been severely injured and as a result has become seriously incapacitated and totally and permanently dependent on his or her parents as is alleged in the present case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">In both <em>Diaz, supra, </em>and <em>Ferriter, supra, </em>we scrutinized the practical objections to enlarging recognized consortium claims \u2014 (1) possibility of a multiplicity of suits; (2) inability to define the point at which the right would cease; (3) inability of a jury adequately to cope with the question of damages, both because the damages are too speculative and because overlapping recovery is probable \u2014 and ultimately found those reasons \u201cunsound.\u201d <em>Ferriter, supra </em>at 513-514, 516. <em>Diaz, supra </em>at 159-160. Further scrutiny is unnecessary here. None of the objections listed warrants a dismissal of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"an5-dedup-0\">An additional objection raised by the defendants in this case, and adopted by the court, is that the absence of economic dependency of a parent on his or her child should preclude recovery. This argument also ignores the careful case by case development of the law in this Commonwealth, as well as the evolution of loss of consortium from a loss of services action to a loss of companionship action.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">As we indicated in <em>Ferriter </em>v. <em>Daniel O\u2019Connell\u2019s Sons, supra </em>at 516, economic dependence is just one factor to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>considered in awarding damages for loss of consortium. Moreover, it has become an increasingly less significant factor in determining consortium rights. In recent years several courts have recognized that \u201cthe pecuniary-loss test is outmoded and does not, by itself, provide a proper vehicle for assessing the damages incurred by a parent when his child has been injured.\u201d Note, Torts \u2014 Parent\u2019s Recovery for Loss of Society and Companionship of Child, 80 W.Va. L. Rev. 340, 347 (1978), and cases cited. A child today is valued not because he is a source of income, but because he is a source of emotional sustenance and joy. Note, The Child\u2019s Right to Sue for Loss of a Parent\u2019s Love, Care and Companionship Caused by Tor-tious Injury To The Parent, 56 B.U.L. Rev. 722, 731 (1976). \u201cThe true significance of the parents\u2019 action under modem practice is that it compensates the parents\u2019 emotional losses when their child has been injured.\u201d 56 B.U.L. Rev. at731-732.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">I acknowledge that there are differences between the way in which parents depend on their children and the way in which spouses depend on each other and children depend on their parents. However, I am not persuaded that such differences should preclude the recovery of a parent for loss of consortium of his or her child who has been seriously injured by defendant\u2019s negligent acts, especially when the severity of the injuries has resulted in the child\u2019s continued dependence on his parents and the parents\u2019 continued subordination to the needs of the child. See <em>Frank v. Superior Court, </em>150 Ariz. 228, 231 (1986); <em>Sizemore </em>v. <em>Smock, </em>155 Mich. App. 745, 750 (1986).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>a position is more \u201cconsistent with the humane policies underlying the <em>Ferriter </em>decision,\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> than the position the court takes today.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">In my view, the court should hold that Mathew\u2019s parents have viable claims for loss of filial society if they can show that Mathew\u2019s injuries are of such severity and permanence as to render him physically, emotionally, and financially dependent on them and that, as a result, their lives have been significantly restructured and their expectations of enjoying those experiences normally shared by parents and children have been seriously impaired. If the plaintiffs can prove such a parent-child relationship and that Mathew\u2019s negligently inflicted injuries severely affected their relationship with him, recognition of a filial consortium right would be justified. I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b325-6\"> Although the complaint is silent as to Mathew\u2019s age, it is undisputed by the parties that he was nineteen years old at the time of the accident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b326-6\"> In <em>Diaz, </em>the court rejected the historical distinction between intentional and negligent injuries for purposes of recognizing spousal consortium rights, indicating that in reality the marital relationship suffers more disturbance and injury through third-party negligence than from intentional invasions. <em>Id. </em>at 159-160.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b326-7\"> In <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Lalumiere, </em>22 Mass.

The record here indicates that the parents in this action are, under c. 229, such \u201cnext of kin.\u201d The court\u2019s argument about other \u201cnext of kin,\u201d relatives or even friends being able to recover is a red herring which ignores the careful process of case by case development of common law rights. The opinion in this case relates only to a seriously incapacitated adult child who becomes significantly dependent on his or her parents and whose dependence significantly alters the parents\u2019 life-style. What we are in disagreement about is simply the importance of protecting the relationships of the nuclear family, i.e., the father, mother, and their children.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b328-7\">In a brief filed by amicus, a similar pending claim by parents of a daughter, now of legal age, seeks compensation for loss of consortium.
