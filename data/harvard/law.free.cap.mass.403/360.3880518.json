McLaughlin in an industrial accident. The plaintiffs, the decedent\u2019s widow and minor son, brought suit against the decedent\u2019s employer for (1) the widow\u2019s loss of consortium caused by the employer\u2019s negligence, (2) the widow\u2019s loss of consortium caused by the employer\u2019s wilful, wanton, and reckless conduct, (3) negligent infliction of emotional distress upon the widow, and (4) the minor son\u2019s loss of parental society caused by the employer\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-15\">A Superior Court judge granted the employer\u2019s motion to dismiss all the claims under Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (6), 365 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>Mass. 754 (1974), for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The judge entered judgment for the employer on all the claims, and the plaintiffs appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">In a memorandum and order under Appeals Court Rule 1:28, the Appeals Court affirmed the dismissal of all but the claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress. 26 Mass. App. Ct. 1101 (1988). This court allowed the employer\u2019s application for further appellate review. The plaintiffs did not apply for further appellate review. Thus the only issue before us is the correctness of the judge\u2019s dismissal of the widow\u2019s action for emotional distress. We conclude that the judge was correct in dismissing that claim, and we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The essential facts relevant to the decedent\u2019s accident are as follows. On August 19, 1985, in the course of his employment, McLaughlin inhaled toxic hydrocarbons and lost consciousness. He was taken to a hospital. His wife arrived at the hospital shortly after his death. After her husband\u2019s death, the widow applied for and began to receive weekly compensation benefits under the provisions of the workers\u2019 compensation act, G. L. c. 152.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">We disagree with the Appeals Court\u2019s conclusion that the judge was in error in dismissing the widow \u2019 s claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress. General Laws c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 1 (4) and 23, bar the claim. Section 23 states that an \u201cemployee\u201d who files a claim or accepts payment of compensation for personal injury under the workers\u2019 compensation act releases the insurer and insured of all common law claims arising from the injury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 1 (4) of the act provides that the term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>\u201cemployee,\u201d includes, after an employee\u2019s death, his or her legal representatives, dependents and other persons to whom compensation may be payable.* ** <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is clear that once McLaughlin\u2019s widow filed a claim and received compensation under the act, she was barred from recovering in any actions against the employer for common law claims arising from her husband\u2019s injury. Her allegations of emotional distress arose from his injury and ultimate death, and are therefore barred. There was no error in the order of the Superior Court judge dismissing the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b377-7\"> The fact that the widow has received compensation payments was established by an undisputed affidavit which the employer filed with the pleadings. Therefore, we treat the proceeding as for summary judgment under Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (e), 365 Mass. 730 (1974), rather than for dismissal under 12 (b) (6). The judge\u2019s ruling was correct. We add that both parties have discussed the significance of <em>Ferriter </em>v. <em>Daniel O\u2019Connell\u2019s Sons, </em>381 Mass. 507 (1980). <em>Ferriter </em>is not helpful here, because it was not shown in that case that the plaintiffs (employee\u2019s wife and children) had received workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b377-8\"> General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 23, stated at the time of the injury in August, 1985: \u201cIf an employee files any claim for, or accepts payment of, compen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>sation on account of personal injury under this chapter, or makes any agreement, or submits to a hearing before a member of the division under section eight, such action shall constitute a release to the insured or self-insurer of all claims or demands at law, if any, arising from the injury.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 23, as amended through St. 1953, c. 314, \u00a7 6.
