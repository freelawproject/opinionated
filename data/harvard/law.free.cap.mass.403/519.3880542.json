Von Henneberg (Henneberg) purchased a one-acre lot on Edmands Road in Framingham from Philip Weir in 1957. Weir owned the adjacent undeveloped back lot, access to which was gained by a forty-foot strip of land which ran along the side of the plaintiff\u2019s property. Henneberg\u2019s land sloped downward toward the back lot so that water from Henneberg\u2019s property drained onto the access strip and flowed to Weir\u2019s back lot. In 1972, Weir built an earthen driveway on the access strip, which blocked the flow of the water and caused it to remain on Henneberg\u2019s land. After Henneberg complained about this flooding problem, Weir dug a drainage trench along the border of the two lots so that the water flowed from Henneberg\u2019s property onto the driveway and into the drainage trench.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">In 1979, Weir sold the back lot to the defendant Generazio.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">Three days later Generazio conveyed the property to the PMG Realty Trust for $100. Generazio was the trustee and sole shareholder of the PMG Realty Trust. In 1980, Generazio began constructing a single-family dwelling on the back lot. He raised and paved the driveway, filled in the drainage trench, and built a berm which prevented water from flowing off Hen-neberg\u2019s land. Whenever there is a heavy rainfall, water floods one-third of Henneberg\u2019s property, endangering Henneberg\u2019s septic system. Photographs showing the flooded areas of the plaintiff\u2019s property were before the jury. There was evidence that, although Generazio was aware of these conditions, he made no effort to rectify them, as had Weir.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-12\">The evidence created a question of fact for the jury as to whether Generazio acted unreasonably in the circumstances. In <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Badoian, </em>376 Mass. 907 (1978), a majority of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>the Justices announced prospectively, in a concurring opinion written by Justice Kaplan, that the \u201creasonable use\u201d standard would govern water diversion cases. \u201c[E]ach possessor is legally privileged to make a reasonable use of his land, even though the flow of surface waters is altered thereby and causes some harm to others, but incurs liability when his harmful interference with the flow of surface waters is unreasonable.\u201d <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Badoian, supra </em>at 917 n.2. (Kaplan, J., concurring), quoting <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Francis Corp., </em>20 N.J. 320, 327 (1956). <em>Jacobs </em>v. <em>Pine Manor College, </em>399 Mass. 411, 416 n.9 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">The issue of reasonableness is \u201ca question of fact to be determined in each case upon a consideration of all the relevant circumstances, including such factors as the amount of harm caused, the foreseeability of the harm which results, the purpose or motive with which the possessor acted, and all other relevant matter.\u201d <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Badoian, supra </em>at 918 n.2. (Kaplan, J., concurring), quoting <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Francis Corp., supra </em>at 330. <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>115 R.I. 264, 272 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The defendant contends that as matter of law his actions do not fall under conduct governed by the reasonable use standard.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He argues that the reasonable use standard applies only to damage caused by water flowing from one landowner\u2019s property onto another landowner\u2019s property. Because he prevented water from flowing off Henneberg\u2019s property and did not discharge water onto Henneberg\u2019s property, Generazio reasons, he cannot be liable for the harm caused under the reasonable use doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>The defendant misunderstands the reasonable use doctrine. Under the reasonable use doctrine, a landowner can be held liable for the discharge of water onto another\u2019s land or for the blockage of water from another\u2019s land. The landowner \u201cincurs liability when his <em>harmful interference with the flow of surface waters </em>is unreasonable\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Badoian, supra </em>at 918 n.2 (Kaplan, J., concurring), quoting <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Francis Corp., supra </em>at 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">It is noteworthy that the concurring opinion in <em>Tucker </em>relied on two cases with facts very similar to those of the present case. In <em>Pendergrast </em>v. <em>Aiken, </em>293 N.C. 201 (1977), the defendants blocked a stream which ran downhill from the plaintiffs\u2019 property through the defendants\u2019 property, causing flooding on the plaintiffs\u2019 property. In <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Bruno, supra </em>the defendant, whose land was adjacent to and below that of the plaintiffs, built a retaining wall along the property line, which blocked the drainage and flooded the plaintiffs\u2019 land. In both cases, the court adopted the reasonable use doctrine, holding that the evidence presented a question to be determined by the trier of fact. Other jurisdictions have applied the reasonable use doctrine to similar fact patterns. See, e.g., <em>Rodrigues </em>v. <em>State, </em>52 Hawaii 156 (1970); <em>Mulder </em>v. <em>Tague, </em>85 S.D. 544 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">The defendant contends that construction of a single-family dwelling constitutes reasonable use per se, and thus cannot result in liability. Under the <em>Tucker </em>standard, the fact finder must view the landowner\u2019s activity on his land with an eye toward the effect of that activity on the flow of surface waters. If the fact finder, after taking into account all of the relevant factors, finds that the possessor acted unreasonably, the nature of the original activity alone, whether it be constructing a shopping mall or building a single-family dwelling, will not bar liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Here, there was ample evidence to support a finding that the defendant acted unreasonably. Accordingly, the judge properly denied the defendant\u2019s motions for a directed verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>2. <em>Damages. </em>The defendant argues that the trial judge improperly admitted Henneberg\u2019s testimony as to damages. \u201cAn owner of property familiar with it and its uses and characteristics may testify as to its value. <em>Rubin </em>v. <em>Arlington, </em>327 Mass. 382, 384 (1951). Evaluation of the witness\u2019 familiarity, knowledge, and experience is for the trial judge and his decision is \u2018conclusive unless upon the evidence it [is] erroneous as matter of law.\u2019 <em>Id.\u201d Larabee </em>v. <em>Potvin Lumber Co., </em>390 Mass. 636, 643 (1983). <em>Blais-Porter, Inc. </em>v. <em>Simboli, </em>402 Mass. 269, 272-273 (1988). See P.J. Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence 118-119 (5th ed. 1981 &amp; Supp. 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">The judge was well within his discretion to conclude that the plaintiff was sufficiently familiar with his land to testify as to its value. The judge did not presume familiarity from the fact of ownership alone. See <em>Blais-Porter, Inc. </em>v. <em>Simboli, supra </em>at 272. Henneberg, a professional architect, was not a mere holder of title or absentee landowner. He had cleared the land after purchasing it in 1957, had transformed a half-destroyed farmhouse into a family home, and had lived there for twenty-eight years. Henneberg demonstrated a detailed knowledge of his land in his trial testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">After the judge found that Henneberg was qualified to testify on the question of damages, the plaintiff was free to give his opinion of the value of the damaged property. Once a foundation for opinion testimony is properly laid, it is left to the fact finder to assess the weight and credibility of the testimony in reaching a final determination of damages. <em>Patch </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>146 Mass. 52, 57 (1888). The defendant\u2019s attempt, on cross-examination, to discredit Henneberg\u2019s method of reaching his dollar figure did not affect Henneberg\u2019s established competence to give his opinion. The fact that the plaintiff placed a value on the affected one-third of his land, rather than giving an opinion as to the lesser value of the whole land, is not fatal. The jury had other evidence of damages before them.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>value of a house lot such as the plaintiff\u2019s ($150,000) was before the jury. The jury could well have interpreted the plaintiff\u2019s testimony as evidence of a diminution of value of the entire lot as a result of the defendant\u2019s acts. See <em>Larabee </em>v. <em>Potvin Lumber Co., supra. </em>See also <em>Willey </em>v. <em>Cafrella, </em>336 Mass. 623, 624 (1958).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">3. <em>Individual liability. </em>Under G. L. c. 203, \u00a7 14A (1986 ed.), \u201c[a] trustee shall be personally liable ... for torts committed in the course of administration of the trust estate only if he was personally at fault.\u201d Generazio\u2019s unreasonable interference with surface waters constituted a private nuisance. <em>Triangle Center, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Works, </em>386 Mass. 858, 863 (1982). Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 833 (1979). A private nuisance is a \u201ctort\" under G. L. c. 203, \u00a7 14A. See <em>Triangle Center, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Works, supra; Tucker </em>v. <em>Badoian, </em>376 Mass. 907, 917 (1978) (Kaplan, J., concurring); <em>Pendergrast </em>v. <em>Aiken, supra </em>at 216; <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>115 R.I. 264, 272 (1975). See also W. Prosser &amp; R. Keeton, Torts \u00a7\u00a7 87-88 (5th ed. 1984). There is no question that Generazio personally conducted the construction activities which led to the flooding of the plaintiff\u2019s property. It follows that Generazio may be held personally liable as a trustee for the damage resulting from his unreasonable interference with his neighbor\u2019s surface water.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">4. <em>Prejudgment interest. </em>We reject Generazio\u2019s argument that Henneberg\u2019s damages should not have included prejudgment interest under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6B (1986 ed.). As we have indicated, the essence of this action is that it sounds in tort. General Laws c. 231, \u00a7 6B, clearly applies by its language: \u201cIn any action in which a verdict is rendered or a finding made or an order for judgment made for pecuniary damages ... for damage to property, there shall be added by the clerk of court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>to the amount of damages interest thereon at the rate of twelve per cent per annum from the date of commencement of the action even though such interest brings the amount of the verdict or finding beyond the maximum liability imposed by law.\u201d Additionally, the remittitur cured any potential error. While the original judgment was for $33,500 plus $22,143.50 in prejudgment interest, now the judgment is just under $28,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b536-9\"> The plaintiff sued Generazio individually and as trustee of PMG Realty Trust. The plaintiff\u2019s complaint also contained a count for negligence and a count alleging violation of G. L. c. 93A (1986 ed.). The negligence count was disposed of at trial by the allowance of the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict; the c. 93A count resulted in a summary judgment for the defendant. We consider only the count which went to the jury and which resulted in a verdict and a judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b536-10\"> The jury returned a verdict in the amount of $33,500, to which the clerk of the court added interest in the amount of $22,143.50. The judge allowed Generazio\u2019s motion for a new trial, unless Von Henneberg accepted a remittitur. Von Henneberg accepted the remittitur which reduced the final award to $16,750, plus $11,071.95 in interest. Final judgment was entered on May 11,1987, in favor of Von Henneberg and against Generazio individually and as trustee of the PMG Realty Trust.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Because the defendant failed to object to the judge\u2019s charge to the jury, the standard enunciated by the judge became the law of the case. See <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Nestor, </em>398 Mass. 184, 191 (1986) (Hennessey, C.J., dissenting). The validity of the judge\u2019s charge thus is not an issue before us. We recognize that this does not preclude the defendant from arguing that his motions for a directed verdict (made at the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s case and at the conclusion of the trial) should have been allowed. <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Badoian, supra </em>915-916. We note, however, that the judge in this case correctly charged the jury in accordance with the <em>Tucker </em>standard. We read Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s dissent to express no disagreement with the validity of the charge as given, but only to express disagreement with our view that the evidence was sufficient to warrant the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b540-6\"> There was other evidence as to damage, e.g., photographs showing the flooding of a portion of the plaintiff\u2019s land; testimony as to the danger caused by the flooding to the plaintiff\u2019s septic tank and leaching field; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>evidence as to the creation of a swampy area on part of the plaintiff\u2019s land; and evidence of the unsightliness of the affected area.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b541-9\"> The defendant offered no evidence of value. The plaintiff testified that the value of the affected area was $50,000. The jury verdict was in the amount of $33,500. We note also that the issue of mitigation was put to the jury by the judge\u2019s charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b542-6\">O\u2019Connor, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AUIt\">(dissenting). <em>In Tucker v. Badoian, </em>376 Mass. 907, 916-918 (1978), six Justices of this court announced that, in the future, water diversion cases would be governed by a \u201creasonable use\u201d standard, the \u201cdetails\u201d of which \u201c[would] evolve and be determined in the usual way through the decisional process.\u201d This is the first case in which the court has been called upon to give shape to the new rule and to demonstrate its application. This case, then, is not only important to the parties. It also provides the court an opportunity to move forward in an area of the law that has heretofore been troublesome and unsettled.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">I write this separate opinion because I read the court\u2019s opinion as unwisely permitting a jury to impose liability on a defendant on the basis of evidence that, as a matter of law, demonstrates no more than that the defendant diminished the value of the plaintiff\u2019s land by obstructing the flow of water from it. Such evidence, without more, should not be legally sufficient to warrant a finding of unreasonable use.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">I believe that the court should articulate standards by which reasonableness and unreasonableness must be measured, and I also believe that the reasonable use or unreasonable use issue should not be submitted to a jury unless, unlike here, the evidence is sufficient as a matter of law to warrant a finding of unreasonableness in the light of those standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">I suggest that the standards identified by the Supreme Court of North Carolina in <em>Pendergrast </em>v. <em>Aiken, </em>293 N.C. 201, 217 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>(1977), would be appropriate. In that case, the court reasoned that a determination of reasonableness requires \u201cweighing the gravity of the harm to the plaintiff against the utility of the conduct of the defendant. <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Francis Corp., </em>[20 N.J. 320, 330 (1956)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Deetz, </em>[66 Wis. 2d 1 (1974)]; Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 826 (Tent. Draft No. 18, 1972). Determination of the gravity of the harm involves consideration of the extent and character of the harm to the plaintiff, the social value which the law attaches to the type of use which is invaded, the suitability of the locality for that use, the burden on plaintiff to minimize the harm, and other relevant considerations arising upon the evidence. Determination of the utility of the conduct of the defendant involves consideration of the purpose of the defendant\u2019s conduct, the social value which the law attaches to that purpose, the suitability of the locality for the use defendant makes of the property, and other relevant considerations arising upon the evidence.\u201d It is my view that the jury in the present case, guided by a consideration of those factors, could not have concluded rationally that the defendant\u2019s blockage of water flow was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The evidence in its light most favorable to the plaintiff, supplemented by other relevant evidence, was as follows. In 1957, Henneberg purchased a farmhouse and one-acre lot at 618 Edmands Road in Framingham from Philip Weir. Weir retained ownership of an undeveloped back lot and also owned a forty-foot wide access strip connecting the back lot to Ed-mands Road. This right of way ran along the east side of Henneberg\u2019s property (the left side facing the property from Edmands Road). At first, there was good drainage from Hen-neberg\u2019s property across the right of way. The right of way was flat. In 1972, Weir piled earth on the right of way to construct a driveway to the back lot. As a result, there was a six-foot-high earthen bank \u201cpartially through\u201d the right of way. When water started to collect \u201cat the bottom of this bank,\u201d Henneberg wrote a letter to Weir complaining that the bank blocked the natural flow of water from his land. In response, Weir dug a drainage trench on Wier\u2019s land parallel to Hen-neberg\u2019s rear boundary line and perpendicular to and across <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>the base of the driveway. The ditch was one foot or less deep at its easterly (left) end and became deeper as it ran westerly. The trench collected water from Henneberg\u2019s property and the earthen bank and left Henneberg\u2019s ground free of water and his lawn undamaged. After this, Henneberg had no problem with water collecting on his property until 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">On November 13, 1979, the defendant Generazio, a builder, purchased the back lot and right-of-way strip from Weir. In April, 1980, Henneberg noticed that water had collected at the \u201cbottom\u201d of his property. Generazio had dumped gravel at the \u201clow part\u201d of the driveway near Henneberg\u2019s land to enable vehicles to be driven \u201cthrough the soft ground.\u201d This created a \u201cbarrier,\u201d so the water backed up onto Henneberg\u2019s land.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Water came from Edmands Road along the unpaved driveway and carried silt and sand onto Henneberg\u2019s property. (Nothing in the record shows that this was caused by anything Generazio had done.) Henneberg complained to Generazio about the water problem, and Generazio told him that he would eliminate the problem by running a drain on his own property.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">Subsequently, Generazio built a single-family dwelling on the back lot. He filled the drainage trench that had been dug by Weir but, according to Generazio\u2019s uncontradicted testimony, he replaced Weir\u2019s trench with another trench of the same length approximately two feet away, and filled it with a perforated pipe and a filter made of one-inch stones. <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">Generazio also paved the driveway with asphalt. Water still flowed from the driveway onto Henneberg\u2019s land and Hen-neberg complained to the town\u2019s building inspector. Generazio built a curb along the driveway and a catch basin at the bottom of the driveway. The catch basin did not solve the problem of water collecting at the low spot on Henneberg\u2019s property because, according to Henneberg\u2019s testimony, the catch basin \u201cwas constructed on the wrong side of the driveway\u201d; water could not go from Henneberg\u2019s land over the \u201clittle bank\u201d of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>the driveway built by Generazio, which constituted a \u201cbarrier,\u201d and thus could not drain into the catch basin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After Generazio installed the drain and the curb, he did nothing further to get rid of water on Henneberg\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">Generazio also constructed a berm across the top of his driveway where it meets Edmands Road, in order to prevent water from spilling off Edmands Road onto the driveway. As a result, water ponded on the road and leaked into Henneberg\u2019s property through a breach in the curb in front of Henneberg\u2019s property. Henneberg has never complained to the town about that breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Henneberg testified that he has not installed any trench or drain on his own property, has taken no action to drain water off his property, and has not contacted any contractor to see if such action on his part would be possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Generazio\u2019s conduct was incidental to the construction of a single-family home in a residential area. The jury would not have been warranted in finding otherwise. Thus, nothing about \u201cthe purpose of the defendant\u2019s conduct, the social value which the law attaches to that purpose, [or] the suitability of the locality for the use the defendant makes of the property,\u201d all relevant factors identified in <em>Pendergrast </em>v. <em>Aiken, supra, </em>weighs against Generazio or in favor of Henneberg. Furthermore, the evidence leaves entirely to speculation whether Generazio could have avoided the conduct of which Henneberg complains while still making his property usable for residential purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">Moreover, the jury would not have been warranted in concluding that the <em>Pendergrast </em>v. <em>Aiken </em>factors bearing on the \u201cgravity of the harm to the plaintiff\u2019 weigh in Henneberg\u2019s favor. A key factor is \u201cthe burden on plaintiff to minimize the harm.\u201d Nothing in the evidence shows that the back-up of water could not easily have been avoided by Henneberg. The evidence does not warrant a finding that most or all of the collected water does not come from Edmands Road through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>the breach in the berm at the front of Henneberg\u2019s property, a condition about which Henneberg did nothing. For all that appears in the evidence, the water collection problem could have been corrected by Henneberg\u2019s employment of simple and inexpensive methods of dealing with the source of the water or its evacuation. The evidence was insufficient to warrant the jury in concluding that the plaintiff had sustained his burden of showing that the gravity of the harm to Henneberg\u2019s property outweighed the utility of Generazio\u2019s conduct. Therefore, the evidence did not warrant a finding that the defendant\u2019s conduct was \u201cunreasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">There are jurisdictions which, at least in the past, have embraced the so-called \u201ccivil law\u201d or \u201cnatural flow\u201d rule, subjecting a landowner to liability whenever he interferes with the natural flow of surface water to the detriment of another\u2019s property. The concurring Justices in <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Badoian, supra </em>at 917, rightly characterized that rule, which has never been the law of this Commonwealth, as \u201cunsatisfactory.\u201d If the court is to develop a cogent body of law dealing with surface water disputes, it should not purport to reject the natural flow doctrine and then hold, as it implicitly does today, that evidence, which as a matter of law proves nothing more than the defendant\u2019s interference with the natural flow of water to the detriment of his neighbor\u2019s land, is sufficient for liability. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b544-9\"> The court\u2019s opinion notes merely that Generazio \u201cfilled in the drainage trench.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 521. Henneberg testified that Generazio has \u201crun a pipe along the trench.\u201d Clearly, there was no evidence that Generazio filled in the drainage trench without providing a substitute for it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b545-9\"> The evidence did not disclose whether Generazio owned land on Henneberg\u2019s side of the driveway on which an effective catch basin could have been placed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
