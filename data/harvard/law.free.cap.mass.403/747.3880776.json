The cable operators seek access in order to install cable television facilities for residents living in multiple-dwelling units located in buildings in Waltham, Worcester, and Westborough. The cable operators assert such rights, pursuant to G. L. c. 166A, \u00a7 22 (1986 ed.).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendants James J. O\u2019Brien, Katlin D. O\u2019Connor, Carabetta Enterprises, Inc., Joseph Carabetta, and Lincoln Street Realty Company (property owners) challenge the constitutionality of G. L. c. 166A, \u00a7 22.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Attorney General and the Community <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>Antenna Television Commission (cable commission) intervened in these actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">On cross motions for summary judgment, a judge in the Superior Court held that G. L. c. 166A, \u00a7 22, is unconstitutional in that it fails to provide for a jury determination of just compensation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plaintiffs, on appeal, maintain that the statute can be read to provide for a jury trial. We disagree and affirm the decision of the lower court.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">The parties are in agreement that art. 15 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> secures the right to a jury determination of just compensation in eminent domain cases. See <em>D\u2019Annolfo </em>v. <em>Stoneham Hous. Auth., </em>375 Mass. 650, 662 (1978); <em>Chadwick </em>v. <em>Proprietors of Haverhill Bridge, </em>2 Dane\u2019s Abr. 686 (1787); 1A Nichols, Eminent Domain \u00a7 4.105[3], at 145-146 n.19 (1985). The question for this court is whether G. L. c. 166A, \u00a7 22, provides for a jury trial in compliance with art. 15.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We conclude that \u00a7 22 cannot be read fairly to provide for a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">General Laws c. 166A (1986 ed.) provides a comprehensive framework for the regulation of cable television in Massachusetts with the principal task of regulation delegated to the cable commission. Section 22, which is set out in relevant part in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>the margin,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> grants cable operators a right of entry to install cable television facilities in multiple-dwelling units if one or more tenants request cable services. The statute provides a detailed procedure for determining compensation. It provides that \u201ccompensation [is] to be determined in accordance with the provisions of this section.\u201d The section requires that, if the owner of a multiple-dwelling unit wishes to receive more than one dollar as compensation for the taking, he must serve written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>notice upon the cable operator within twenty days after the landowner learns of the intended installation of the cable system.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The owner then has thirty days in which to inform the operator of the amount claimed as reasonable compensation. \u201cIf within sixty days after the receipt of the owner\u2019s claim the operator has not agreed to pay the amount claimed . . . the owner may bring an action before the commission .... Any such action shall be brought within six months of the notice informing the operator of the amount claimed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">In addition, G. L. c. 166A, \u00a7 19, was amended in 1985 to subject hearings before the cable commission under \u00a7 22 to the provisions of G. L. c. 30A (1986 ed.). St. 1985, c. 644, \u00a7 1. General Laws c. 30A, \u00a7 14, provides in part: \u201cExcept so far as any provision of law expressly precludes judicial review, any person or appointing authority aggrieved by a final decision of any agency in an adjudicatory proceeding, whether such decision is affirmative or negative in form, shall be entitled to a judicial review thereof .... Where no statutory form of judicial review or appeal is provided, judicial review shall be obtained by means of a civil action . . . .\u201d Last, \u00a7 14 (5) explicitly states that such \u201creview shall be conducted by the court without a jury and shall be confined to the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">We are mindful of \u201cour duty to construe a statute in a way to avoid constitutional problems.\u201d <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Colleton, </em>387 Mass. 790, 800 (1982). See <em>Beeler </em>v. <em>Downey, </em>387 Mass. 609, 613-614 (1982). In this case we cannot avoid the conclusion that \u00a7 22 fails to allow for a jury trial. Nowhere in c. 166A, \u00a7 22, is there any reference to a jury proceeding. The Legislature knows how to provide explicitly for a jury trial in eminent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>domain cases and has done so on numerous occasions.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Legislature chose not to do so here. We cannot rewrite the statute to add the requirement of a jury trial omitted by the Legislature. See <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Colleton, supra; Beeler </em>v. <em>Downey, supra </em>at 617.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">The cable operators argue that the statute provides for a jury trial. They read the granting of original jurisdiction to the Superior Court (see note 8, <em>supra </em>) as giving the owner a choice between bringing an action before the cable commission or before a jury. The suggestion that the Legislature intended to provide for an alternative procedure through a mere statement of jurisdiction is implausible.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Under the cable operators\u2019 reasoning the detailed procedures comprising the bulk of G. L. c. 166A, \u00a7 22, would be wholly optional at the election of the owner. We decline to accept the strained conclusion that the comprehensive administrative compensation scheme crafted by the Legislature may be ignored in its entirety by the landowner so as to pursue a jury trial right.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">The Attorney General argues that \u00a7 22 provides for the right to a jury trial but claims that the right attaches on appeal after the cable commission has determined the amount of compensation. This reading conflicts with the language of G. L. c. 166A, \u00a7 19, which provides that \u201c[t]he hearing provided for in section[]... twenty two, <em>shall </em>be subject to the provisions of chapter thirty A\u201d (emphasis added). The Legislature\u2019s choice of the word \u201cshall\u201d does not allow for any option on the part of the aggrieved party to choose a jury trial as part of an appeal from the agency decision. See <em>Hashimi </em>v. <em>Kalil, </em>388 Mass. 607, 609 (1983), and cases cited. The only form of appeal permitted by G. L. c. 166A explicitly provides for limited court review \u201cwithout a jury.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>In conclusion, \u00a7 22 provides for an administrative determination of compensation, subject to limited judicial review in the Superior Court under the State Administrative Procedure Act. Because \u00a7 22 does not provide for the right to a jury determination of compensation, we hold that it is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b764-10\"> In 1986, the cable operators received requests for cable services from tenants of buildings owned by the property owners. The operators notified the owners of their intent to install equipment and lines necessary to provide cable television service to the tenants, in accordance with the provisions of G. L. c. 166A, \u00a7 22. The property owners objected to the claimed right of entry and demanded compensation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b764-11\"> Defendants American Satellite Cable Corporation (AmSat), and Channel One Systems, Inc. (Channel One), are operators of \u201csatellite master antenna television\u201d who have entered into agreements with the property owners to provide television signals to the tenants of Lincoln Village and Windsor Ridge, respectively. AmSat and Channel One claim that they are entitled to just compensation for the losses they will suffer if the right of access is granted to the cable operators. We do not address this contention; nor do we make any determinations regarding the standing of these defendants to challenge the constitutionality of G. L. c. 166A, \u00a7 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-12\">The trustees of Northgate Gardens Condominium Trust also make claims for just compensation. We do not decide here whether G. L. c. 166A, \u00a7 22, applies to condominium units.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b765-8\"> The United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts found G. L. c. 166A, \u00a7 22, as amended by St. 1977, c. 225, to be unconstitutional in that the right of access comprised a taking for which the statute provided no just compensation. See <em>Greater Worcester Cablevision, Inc. </em>v. <em>Carabetta Enterprises, Inc., </em>682 F. Supp. 1244 (D. Mass. 1985). The parties agree that the entry and installation of equipment and lines for cable television, under \u00a7 22, as amended after the Federal case, would constitute a \u201ctaking\u201d under Federal and State law. See <em>Loretto </em>v. <em>Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., </em>458 U.S. 419, 441 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b765-9\"> Article 15 provides in relevant part: \u201cIn all controversies concerning property . . . the parties have a right to a trial by jury . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b765-10\"> We reject the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that, because the defendants did not request a jury trial in their pleadings they have waived any claim that \u00a7 22 unconstitutionally deprives them of a jury trial. In their answer, the defendants Carabetta Enterprises, Inc., Joseph Carabetta, and Lincoln Street Realty Company pleaded the defense that \u00a7 22 is unconstitutional. Their attack on the validity of that section is a facial attack properly raised by at least these defendants. This issue was the only issue addressed by the motion judge and is the basis of the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b766-4\"> \u201cNo person owning, leasing, controlling or managing a multiple dwelling unit or units shall prohibit or otherwise prevent an operator from entering such buildings for the purposes of constructing, installing or servicing CATV [cable television] system facilities if one or more tenants or occupants of a multiple dwelling unit or units have requested such CATV services....</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-5\">\u201cIf the owner of such multiple dwelling unit intends to require the payment of a sum in excess of one dollar in exchange for permitting the installation of CATV system facilities, such owner shall serve written notice thereof upon the operator within twenty days of the date when such owner is notified that the operator intends to construct or install CATV system facilities in his multiple dwelling unit. Unless timely notice, as herein provided, is given by the owner to the operator, it shall be presumed conclusively that the owner does not claim or intend to require the payment of a sum in excess of a one time payment of one dollar in exchange and as compensation for permitting the installation of CATV system facilities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-6\">\u201cAny owner who has given timely notice to the operator may assert a claim for reasonable compensation in excess of one dollar for permitting the installation of CATV system facilities. Within thirty days after notice has been given by said owner of his intent to demand additional compensation, the owner shall advise the operator in writing of the amount claimed as reasonable compensation. If within sixty days after the receipt of the owner\u2019s claim the operator has not agreed to pay the amount claimed or some other amount acceptable to the owner, the owner may bring an action before the commission pursuant to such rules and regulations as the commission may promulgate to enforce such claim for compensation. Any such action shall be brought within six months of the notice informing the operator of the amount claimed. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-7\">\u201cNeither the giving of a notice as described above, nor the assertion of a specific claim, nor the initiation of legal action to enforce such claim, shall delay or impair the right of an operator to construct, install or repair CATV system facilities and maintain said CATV services. The superior court shall have original jurisdiction to enforce the provisions of this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-8\">\u201cA cable television operator shall indemnify the landlord for any damage caused by the installation, operation or removal of cable television facilities. An owner of property may require that the installation of cable television facilities conform to such reasonable conditions as are necessary to protect the safety, functioning and appearance of the premises, and the convenience and well being of other tenants.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b767-6\"> The statute establishes a presumption that reasonable compensation shall be one dollar, which may be rebutted by evidence that the owner has a \u201cspecific alternative use\u201d for the space occupied by the cable facilities or that the cable installation will \u201cotherwise substantially interfere\u201d with the use and occupancy of the unit to the extent it causes a decrease in the value of the real estate. We do not address the contention that this aspect of \u00a7 22 imposes a binding rule of compensation in violation of art. 10 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. The judge made no decision regarding this issue. See <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Boston Edison </em>Co., 390 Mass. 604,615 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b768-6\"> In other eminent domain statutes, the Legislature has incorporated the provisions of G. L. c. 79 (1986 ed.), which provides for a jury trial. See, e.g., G. L. c. 33, \u00a7 126 (1986 ed.); G. L. c. 48, \u00a7 5 (1986 ed.); G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 16 (1986 ed.); G.
