Electronics (B.L.H.). Lucy\u2019s husband, Joseph, claimed damages for loss of consortium individually and on behalf of their three minor children. Ivan Mendoza, Joseph\u2019s natural son and Lucy\u2019s unadopted stepson, who was eighteen years old at the time of Lucy\u2019s injury, also sought loss of consortium damages. Prior to trial, the judge granted B.L.H.\u2019s motion in limine which sought to exclude any evidence on Ivan\u2019s behalf, ruling that Ivan could not maintain his action because he was only Lucy\u2019s stepson and not her natural or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>adopted son. At the close of the plaintiffs\u2019 case, the judge granted B.L.H.\u2019s motion for a directed verdict against Ivan on the same ground.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Ivan appealed the judge\u2019s rulings and we transferred the case here on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">The sole issue for our determination is whether an adult stepchild may recover for his loss of parental consortium from a third party who negligently injured his stepparent. We conclude that he may not and we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">In <em>Diaz </em>v. <em>Eli Lilly &amp; Co., </em>364 Mass. 153, 165 (1973), we recognized a right of recovery for loss of spousal consortium arising from negligently inflicted injuries by a third party. Subsequently, we ruled that minor dependent children could recover for loss of parental consortium. <em>Ferriter </em>v. <em>Daniel O\u2019Connell\u2019s Sons, </em>381 Mass. 507, 516 (1980). In <em>Ferriter, </em>however, we maintained \u201cour determination to \u2018proceed from case to case with discerning caution\u2019\u201d when extending the right to recover to new relationships. <em>Id.., </em>quoting <em>Diaz, supra </em>at 165. This cautious approach flows from our recognition that \u201ctort liability cannot be extended without limit.\u201d <em>Feliciano </em>v. <em>Rosemar Silver Co., </em>401 Mass. 141, 142 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Thus we recently concluded that parents could not recover for loss of a child\u2019s consortium. <em>Norman </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., ante </em>303 (1988). In <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Lalumiere, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 262, 270 (1986), the Appeals Court allowed a handicapped adult who was physically, emotionally and financially dependent on the injured parent to recover for loss of consortium. We have observed, however, that <em>Morgan </em>is consistent with <em>Ferriter </em>and <em>Diaz </em>because the physical, emotional and financial dependency of the child resulted in a unique and intense dependency intrinsic to the relationship of the parties. <em>Norman </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., supra </em>at 306. The plaintiff, Ivan Mendoza, now asks us to extend this unique relationship to include adult stepchildren. This we decline to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>In <em>Feliciano </em>v. <em>Rosemar Silver Co., supra </em>at 141-142, we denied the plaintiff the right to recover for loss of spousal consortium even though she and the injured party lived \u201cas a de facto married couple\u201d for approximately twenty years and \u201chad joint savings accounts, filed joint tax returns, jointly owned their home, depended on each other for companionship, comfort, love and guidance, and maintained a sexual relationship to the exclusion of all others.\u201d Focusing on the existence of a legal marital relationship to distinguish \u201cthe myriad relationships that may exist between mere cohabitants,\u201d we sought to avoid right to recovery standards that are \u201cvague and indefinite.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 142.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus this plaintiff lacks both the legal relationship to the injured party regarded as essential in <em>Feliciano, </em>and the unique and intense dependency recognized in <em>Norman </em>as giving rise to the right of recovery by a mentally and physically disabled adult child. By refusing to recognize the plaintiff\u2019s right of recovery in these circumstances, we continue to limit \u201cprotection to interests and values that are reasonably ascertainable,\u201d <em>Feliciano </em>v. <em>Rosemar Silver Co., supra </em>at 142, and to \u201cdraw a principled, defensible line between those relationships to which a right of recovery should attach and those relationships with respect to which no such right should be recognized.\u201d <em>Norman </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., supra </em>at 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b454-7\"> Judgments were entered in favor of Joseph and the minor children.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b455-7\"> In <em>Feliciano, supra </em>at 142, we rejected as vague and indefinite the standard that cohabitants must have a stable and significant relationship to qualify for loss of consortium recovery which was adopted in <em>Butcher </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>139 Cal. App. 3d 58, 70 (1983). We note that in <em>Elden </em>v. <em>Sheldon, </em>46 Cal. 3d 267 (1988), the Supreme Court of California noted that both lower California courts and other jurisdictions have \u201crejected the <em>Butcher </em>test as inviting \u2018mischief and inconsistent results.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 276. The court then rejected the <em>Butcher </em>standard and denied a loss of consortium recovery to unmarried cohabitants. <em>Id. </em>at 278-279.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b455-6\">Liacos, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-3\">(concurring). In light of my dissent in <em>Norman </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., ante </em>303 (1988), it may be helpful to the bar to state briefly why I join in the court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>In the instant case, there was no legally cognizable relationship between the stepparent and the stepchild. Unlike the husband-wife relationship in <em>Diaz </em>v. <em>Eli Lilly &amp; Co., </em>364 Mass. 153 (1973), and the parent-child relationship in <em>Ferriter </em>v. <em>Daniel O\u2019 Connell\u2019s Sons, </em>381 Mass. 507 (1980), and in <em>Norman, supra </em>(Liacos, J., dissenting), the stepparent-stepchild relationship does not trigger certain well-established rights and duties under Massachusetts law.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">For example, the wrongful death statute, G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 1 (1986 ed.), does not provide for a stepchild to recover for the death of a stepparent. See <em>Poyser </em>v. <em>United States, </em>602 F. Supp. 436, 440 (D. Mass. 1984). Under common law, stepparents are under no legal obligation to support their stepchildren. <em>Brookfield </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>128 Mass. 287, 288 (1880). <em>Worcester </em>v. <em>Marchant, </em>14 Pick. 510, 512 (1834). But see <em>Roush </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>377 Mass. 572, 575 (1979) (stepchild may be dependent under G. L. c. 151A [1986 ed.], the Employment Security Law). In addition, the Massachusetts Uniform Statutory Will Act, G. L. c. 191B, \u00a7 1 (1986 ed. &amp; Supp. 1987), explicitly excludes stepchildren from its definition of \u201cchild\u201d and \u201cissue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Just as cohabitants who do not formalize their relationship through a marriage may not recover for loss of consortium, <em>Feliciano </em>v. <em>Rosemar Silver Co., </em>401 Mass. 141, 142 (1987), so a stepchild whose relationship is not formalized in an adoption proceeding may not recover for such an alleged loss. Limiting loss of consortium claims to members of legally cognizable relationships provides a clear, principled, easily ascertainable standard which adequately distinguishes those entitled to recover from those involved in the \u201cmyriad relationships\u201d which exist in society. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
