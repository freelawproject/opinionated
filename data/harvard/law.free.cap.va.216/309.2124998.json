Code \u00a7 56-338.11. Appellants, Barnes Transfer &amp; Storage, Inc., and nine other certificated household goods carriers in the Richmond-Petersburg area, intervened below in opposition to award of the certificate to Lee. Contending that the evidence is insufficient to support the Commission\u2019s finding of public convenience and necessity, appellants here seek reversal of the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-18\">The evidence shows that the principal officer of Lee has had ten years\u2019 experience in the moving business. At the time of the hearing below, Lee operated as a local contract carrier under an exemption contained in Code \u00a7 56-338.2(c)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and as agent for an interstate car<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>rier. The evidence further shows, and the Commission found, that Lee is \u201ca fiscally sound company that would be financially able to transact business as a certificated household goods carrier.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Lee\u2019s moving business is based in the City of Hopewell. If granted the certificate of convenience and necessity it now seeks, Lee would be the only intrastate mover based in Hopewell or the surrounding area.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Hopewell, an industrial city whose 1970 population was 23,471 and which is experiencing rapid growth and an increasing population, serves a wide \u201cemployment market.\u201d The industries located in or near the city employ 6,831 persons and expend an annual payroll of $67,000,000. Both the local chamber of commerce and the manufacturers association endorsed Lee\u2019s application for a certificate as an intrastate mover.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">Nearby Fort Lee, with both a military complement and a civilian staff, has an annual payroll in excess of $80,000,000. Because of Fort Lee, Hopewell \u201cis really pretty much of a transit town.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">Lee\u2019s representative stated at the hearing below that his company each month receives \u201cquite a few\u201d calls, including two or three from local industries, for intrastate shipments which it must decline because of its presently limited authority. The representative further stated that local industries had \u201ccounted on\u201d Lee to move their personnel and were put to \u201cquite an inconvenience\u201d because of its inability to render intrastate service.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">Stressing the \u201cgrowth posture\u201d of Hopewell, the Commission noted in its written opinion the relevancy of the fact that, at the time of the hearing below, there were \u201ctwo less certificated carriers in the Richmond-Petersburg area\u201d than had previously existed. The Commission also found it \u201csignificant\u201d that appellants, while opposing Lee\u2019s application, had offered no evidence that the granting of the application would detrimentally affect existing carriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">Acknowledging that findings of the Commission are presumed to be <em>prima facie </em>just, reasonable, and correct, appellants concede that they \u201chave a substantial burden to carry\u201d in seeking to overturn the Commission\u2019s award. We are of opinion that appellants have failed to carry their burden, and, because the evidence supports the award, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-11\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b445-19\">Code \u00a7 56-338.2(c) permits the transportation of household goods without a certificate of convenience and necessity \u201cbetween any points wholly within the limits of any city or town in this State, or for any lesser distance than 30 road miles.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
