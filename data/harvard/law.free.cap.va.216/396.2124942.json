(Industrial) . The trial court held that the undertaking was not a guaranty, and we now review that holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">American brought this action against Industrial and the Bank to recover the purchase price, $15,350, of a hoist American had furnished Industrial for installation on a lightship which Industrial had constructed pursuant to a contract with the United States Coast Guard. Judgment by default was entered against Industrial. In a subsequent jury trial of American\u2019s claim against the Bank, the trial court struck American\u2019s evidence and entered summary judgment for the Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">The evidence shows that in early 1972 Industrial was awarded a contract to construct the lightship. Negotiations between American and Industrial culminated in an agreement on May 1, 1972, for American to furnish a general purpose hoist required for the lightship. The terms of the agreement required Industrial to secure a \u201cletter of credit\u201d from its bank guaranteeing that \u201c$15,350 is set aside in a special account payable to [American] upon delivery of quoted equipment.\u201d On May 1, 1972, the Bank, through its loan officer, David R. Holton, forwarded a letter to American, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-6\">\u201cThis letter will serve to confirm our agreement to lend Industrial Automation, Inc. ... an amount up to but not to exceed $15,350. The proceeds are to be used exclusively for the purchase of the hoist being sold by you to Industrial Automation, Inc. This commitment will expire on July 31, 1972.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">On May 16, American wrote the Bank, stating that the hoist could not be delivered before September 15, 1972, and that Industrial\u2019s order would be put \u201con hold\u201d unless the Bank\u2019s commitment was extended until November 1, 1972. The letter also stated that American\u2019s agreement with Industrial required a \u201cletter of credit,\u201d which would be the Bank\u2019s \u201cguarantee that [American] would be paid $15,350.\u201d On May 17, Holton, for the Bank, wrote American as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-8\">\u201cPlease refer to my letter of May 1. This letter will serve to extend our commitment confirmed in that letter through October 31, 1972.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">Following receipt of the May 17 letter, E. L. Fall, a representative of American, telephoned Holton. Fall told Holton that \u201cit would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>impossible for [American] to continue with this contract unless [it] received some guarantee of moneys that would be available to Industrial Automation through their bank.\u201d Holton, according to Fall, stated that the Bank was \u201cworking with\u201d Industrial and would \u201csend [American] a letter stating so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">On May 19, Holton wrote Fall, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-5\">\u201cTo confirm our agreement over the telephone- yesterday, any funds advanced to Industrial Automation, Inc. will be in the form of a Cashier\u2019s Check payable to your firm. I hope this will suffice for your credit requirements.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Thereafter, manufacture of the hoist was completed. It was shipped from Philadelphia on November 1, 1972, and received by Industrial in Richmond on November 3. On December 6, American billed Industrial for the hoist, and, after Industrial\u2019s failure to pay, on March 15, 1973, American made demand upon the Bank for payment. The demand was refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">The record shows that between May 1, 1972, the date the Bank wrote its commitment letter to American, and October 31, 1972, the expiration date of the commitment, the Bank made four advances, totaling $35,000, to Industrial. None of these advances, however, related to the loan involving the hoist or to Industrial\u2019s contract with the Coast Guard. Between October 31, 1972, and June 14, 1973, the date the present litigation was commenced, the Bank made six advances, totaling $62,900, to Industrial. The last two advances, totaling $15,400, in May and June, 1973, related to Industrial\u2019s contract with the Coast Guard. None of the six advances, however, related to the loan involving the hoist. It was uncontradicted that the Bank never loaned \u201cany money on account of the hoist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">In our opinion, the Bank\u2019s liability must arise, if at all, from the Bank\u2019s three letters of May 1, 17, and 19, 1972. Only if from those three letters, singly or collectively, a guaranty appears, would the Bank be liable to American.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">As related to this case, a guaranty is a separate, collateral, and secondary undertaking to answer for the debt of another in event of his default. <em>See Bourne </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors of Henrico County, </em>161 Va. 678, 683-84, 172 S. E. 245, 247 (1934). Because any action brought to impose liability for a guaranty agreement would seek to charge the purported guarantor upon a promise to answer for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>debt of another, the Statute of Frauds (Code \u00a7 11-2(4)) requires that the agreement be in writing and signed by the guarantor. <em>See Lawson v. States Construction Co., </em>193 Va. 513, 517, 69 S.E.2d 450, 453 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">While, as American points out, the Statute of Frauds does not require that the complete agreement between the parties show on the face of the signed writing, the nature and extent of the undertaking, including the essential promise to pay the debt of another, must so appear or the agreement is not enforceable. <em>See Saunders </em>v. <em>Bank of Mecklenburg, </em>112 Va. 443, 450, 71 S.E. 714, 716 (1911). If reliance is based upon an unsigned writing, it must be referred to in the signed writing in clear and distinct terms. <em>See Darling </em>v. <em>Cumming\u2019s Ex\u2019or., </em>92 Va. 521, 524, 23 S.E. 880, 881 (1896).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">American contends that the various documents constituting its agreement with Industrial and the contents of American\u2019s May 16 letter to the Bank, together with the Bank\u2019s May 1,17, and 19 letters should all be read together and that, when so read, the writings establish the Bank\u2019s undertaking to pay the debt of Industrial. The documents constituting American\u2019s agreement with Industrial, however, are not referred to in any manner in any of the letters signed by the Bank. Neither is American\u2019s May 16 letter to the Bank, in which American stated that its agreement with Industrial required that the Bank guarantee payment of $15,350, referred to in the Bank\u2019s subsequent letters of May 17 and 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">There is, of course, in the Bank\u2019s May 19 letter to American the reference to the \u201cagreement\u201d reached \u201cover the telephone\u201d between Holton, the Bank\u2019s loan officer, and Fall, American\u2019s representative. American argues that the May 19 letter is signed, documentary evidence of an agreement, reached over the telephone, that American was \u201cgetting a guarantee\u201d from the Bank. Fall\u2019s testimony, however, assuming its admissibility, fails to establish any such agreement. He stated that he told Holton \u201cit would be impossible for [American] to continue with this contract unless [it] received some guarantee of moneys that would be available to Industrial Automation through their bank.\u201d Fall did not testify, however, that Holton agreed that the Bank would guarantee payment of Industrial\u2019s obligation. Holton\u2019s reply, according to Fall, was merely that the Bank was \u201cworking with\u201d Industrial and would \u201csend [American] a letter stating so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">But even if Fall\u2019s testimony is considered sufficient to show an oral agreement between the Bank and American, the May 19 letter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>must mirror the oral agreement by showing the Bank\u2019s <em>promise to pay </em>Industrial\u2019s debt before the letter can be construed as a guaranty and deemed sufficient to satisfy the Statute of Frauds. We believe the essential promise to pay is lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">The May 19 letter states that \u201cany funds advanced to Industrial Automation, Inc. will be in the form of a Cashier\u2019s Check\u201d payable to American. In the trial court and here, American has construed the May 19 letter as requiring the Bank to pay to American any funds advanced on Industrial\u2019s account at any time for any purpose. We cannot agree with this construction. Rather, we agree with a statement of the trial judge, made when he ruled that there was \u201cno guarantee\u201d by the Bank of Industrial\u2019s obligation to American:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-5\">\u201cTo say, under [American\u2019s] construction, that this letter of May 19, such as it is, gave continuous open-ended draws on the [Bank] ad infinitum is beyond all reason.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">There is no reasonable construction of the May 19 letter which would convert it into the unconditional promise American claims it received from the Bank. When, however, the May 19 letter is read together with the Bank\u2019s prior letters of May 1 and 17, the one possible reasonable construction emerges and the true nature of the Bank\u2019s undertaking is disclosed. But this construction does not avail American.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">We believe the Bank\u2019s undertaking was no more than a promise to pay to American the proceeds of the loan the Bank had committed to make to Industrial for purchase of the hoist, if and when the loan commitment was exercised on or before October 31, 1972, an event which did not occur. The Bank\u2019s undertaking, therefore, was not a promise to pay the debt of Industrial and did not constitute a guaranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
