Daniel remained in the hospital until his death on February 6, 1974. Dr. R. C. Henry, Medical Examiner for the City of Richmond, performed a post-mortem examination. His report listed six \u201cpathological diagnoses\u201d and cited \u201c[g] unshot wound of head\u201d as the \u201cprobable cause of death.\u201d Dr. Henry died before Ward was brought to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-18\">Over defendant\u2019s objection, the autopsy report was admitted into evidence; it was the only proof of the cause of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-19\">While autopsy reports and duly attested copies thereof are admiss<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>ible in evidence as provided in Code \u00a7 19.1-45 (Repl.

Although signed by the decedent\u2019s attending physician, a statement in a death certificate concerning the cause of death \u201cwas but the expression of an opinion\u201d and \u201cwas not, therefore, competent to show the cause of the decedent\u2019s death.\u201d <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>210 Va. 450, 453, 171 S.E.2d 854, 856 (1970). We have only recently declined to extend the shopbook exception to the hearsay rule to \u201cinclude opinions and conclusions of physicians or others recorded in hospital records.\u201d <em>Neeley </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>215 Va. 565, 571, 211 S.E.2d 100, 106 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Dr. Henry\u2019s recorded statement was an expression of opinion and, standing alone, was incompetent to show the cause of Daniel\u2019s death. Since there was no other proof of the cause of death, we hold that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict. The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b314-7\"><em> \u201c\u00a7 </em>19.1-45.
