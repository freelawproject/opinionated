Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>finding that the claimant\u2019s injuries arose out of his employment, the Industrial Commission, with Commissioner Miller dissenting, denied compensation because the injuries did not arise in the course of employment. The claimant seeks reversal of the denial of compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The claimant, John Patrick Graybeal, is Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney for Montgomery County. In April, 1968, in the course of his duties, he prosecuted Frank H. Dewease, Jr., for murder. As a result, Dewease was convicted of murder of the second degree and sentenced to serve 20 years in the penitentiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Thereafter, Dewease vowed revenge upon \u201ceveryone having anything to do\u201d with his case and he expressed his desire \u201cto get- them all in the courthouse and blow it up.\u201d He especially \u201cseemed to want to kill\u201d the claimant. While in prison, Dewease bragged of his knowledge of bomb construction and of his ability to \u201cget dynamite and caps after he got out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">Shortly after his release from prison, Dewease, on the night of December 4, 1973, went to the claimant\u2019s home in Christiansburg. There, he placed on the top of the claimant\u2019s family automobile, which was parked in the driveway, a \u201cpotato chip can\u201d containing a homemade bomb.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">On that same evening, the claimant worked in his office at the courthouse preparing for the next day\u2019s trial of Commonwealth cases. Completing his work at approximately 11:30 p.m., he drove home in a borrowed automobile. Upon arrival at home, he observed the can on the top of the family car. Believing the can was a toy or an item of groceries, he picked it up. The device exploded, causing the severe and disabling injuries upon which the present claim for compensation is based.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">Code \u00a7 65.1-7, part of the Virginia Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, defines a compensable accidental injury as one \u201carising out of and in the course of the employment.\u201d We have said that the expressions \u201carising out of\u201d and \u201cin the course of\u201d are used conjunctively and are not synonymous. Both conditions must be satisfied before compensation can be awarded. <em>Southern Motor Lines </em>v. <em>Alvis, </em>200 Va. 168, 170, 104 S.E.2d 735, 737 (1958); <em>Dreyfus &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Meade, </em>142 Va. 567, 569, 129 S.E. 336 (1925).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">As has been noted, the Commission found that the claimant\u2019s injuries arose out of his employment. On appeal, that finding is conclusive. Whether the injuries arose in the course of employment is the sole, and novel, question for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"Ai-\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>In holding that the claimant\u2019s injury did not arise in the course of his employment, the Commission relied upon our decision in <em>Conner </em>v. <em>Bragg, </em>203 Va. 204, 123 S.E.2d 393 (1962). There, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-5\">\u201c[T]he words \u2018in the course of\u2019 refer to the time, place and circumstances under which the accident occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\">\u201c[A]n accident occurs in the \u2018course of employment\u2019 when it takes place within the period of employment, at a place where the employee may be reasonably expected to be, and while he is reasonably fulfilling the duties of his employment or is doing something which is reasonably incidental thereto.\u201d 203 Va. at 208, 123 S.E.2d at 396.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Tested by this seemingly rigid rule, the claimant\u2019s case might fail. <em>Conner </em>equates \u201carising\u201d with \u201coccurring.\u201d The express requirement that the injury must <em>occur </em>within the specified time, space, and circumstances of the employment would appear well-nigh insurmountable in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">But the <em>Conner </em>rule was enunciated in and designed for application to a case involving the usual employer-employee relationship and the typical industrial accident. The present case involves neither the usual employer-employee relationship nor a typical industrial accident. Instead, the case involves a public officer charged with the duty of exercising his authority in different places, including his home, and at various times, including evening hours. This officer\u2019s public duties, by their very nature, expose him to an increased risk of injury from an atypical accident\u2014an assault by a revenge-seeking criminal who, blaming his plight upon the officer\u2019s prosecutorial activities, is apt to seek out the object of his hatred in private places at unexpected times.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">It would be both unrealistic and in derogation of the beneficent purposes of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act to borrow from <em>Conner </em>and apply a rule which is designed for an employment situation with fixed hours of employment, identifiable places of performance, and definable areas of risk, but with no greater nexus between work and injury than exists in the present situation. The present case requires application of a modified rule, one sufficiently flexible to recognize the realities of the claimant\u2019s employment situation and yet rigid enough to prevent its extension to unwarranted situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">A modified rule is permitted, we believe, by the statutory language \u201carising ... in the course of the employment.\u201d An appropriate rule, limited in application, can be fashioned within the statutory language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>merely by shifting the emphasis from the word \u201coccurring,\u201d which is prominently employed in <em>Conner </em>but is not mentioned in the statute, to the statutory word \u201carising\u201d and giving it the ordinary meaning of \u201coriginating.\u201d Under this rule, the claimant\u2019s injury would be held to have arisen in the course of his employment if it originated in the course of the employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Upon first examination, this rule might appear to constitute a blending into one single test of the dual \u201carising out of\u201d and \u201cin the course of\u201d requirements. But the \u201carising out of\u201d requirement refers to causation, only incidentally related to considerations of time and space, and must be satisfied by a showing of causal connection between work and injury. The \u201ccourse of\u201d requirement, on the other hand, refers to continuity of time, space, and circumstances, only incidentally related to causation. This requirement must be satisfied by a showing of an unbroken course beginning with work and ending with injury under such circumstances that the beginning and the end are connected parts of a single work-related incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Considering, then, that in the context of the present case \u201carising\u201d means \u201coriginating,\u201d we believe the claimant\u2019s nighttime injury from the exploding bomb placed on the top of his family car no less arose in the course of his employment than if he had been shot by his revenge-seeking assailant in the courtroom immediately following the murder trial, or if he had been injured by a bomb triggered to explode in his office upon his return from the courtroom. The difference is in degree only and not in substance. In the realities of the present case, the course from prosecution to desire-for-revenge to injury was unbroken, constituting a single work-connected incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">For the reasons assigned, the Industrial Commission\u2019s denial of compensation will be reversed and the case remanded for the award to the claimant of appropriate compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
