(A &amp; P), and owned by defendants, Dudley Cooper, Trustee for Charles N. Cooper and Joel B. Cooper, United Virginia Bank/Seaboard National, Executor of the Estate of Arthur Cooper, Deceased, and L. P. Cooper, t/a Bayfront Property Account (collectively Bayfront). Defendants Charles N. Cooper and Joel B. Cooper (Coopers) owned property contiguous to the site of the accident. The plaintiff alleged that the defendants were guilty of negligently \u201cplacing and maintaining a metal chain at or near the area\u201d where the A &amp; P-Bayfront premises adjoined the Coopers\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">During the trial before a jury, the court below entered summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the grounds, first, that as a matter of law the evidence failed to establish the breach of any duty owed to the plaintiff by the defendants and, second, that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law. We awarded the plaintiff a writ of error to this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Our view of the case requires discussion only of the issue whether the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law. We hold that he was, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">The facts are without conflict.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On April 3, 1971, shortly before 10:00 p.m., the plaintiff, accompanied by his wife and infant child, drove his automobile to the premises of A &amp; P in Ocean View, a heavily populated beach area of Norfolk. The plaintiff stopped his car on the A &amp; P parking lot, which was adjacent to the store building, for the purpose of viewing and photographing a fireworks display at a nearby amusement park.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">At that time, there was no artificial lighting of the lot, or of the immediately surrounding area, except for that which \u201ccast in\u201d from the amusement park 500 yards away. The store had closed for business at 9:00 p.m. and the parking lot lights had been turned off by an automatic timer 15 minutes later.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">When the plaintiff arrived, there were 20 to 25 cars parked on the lot. He testified that he lived about two miles from the store and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>in the past the A &amp; P lot had been used by others at night after store hours for parking so that the occupants of the vehicles could \u201cget to the beach, ... go fishing, [and walk] on the beach at night.\u201d The plaintiff parked close to the northern boundary of the A &amp; P lot near an \u201copening\u201d to the contiguous field to the north owned by the Coopers.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">The plaintiff took photographs of the fireworks display from the rear of his parked vehicle. After the display had ended, the \u201ctraffic cleared out\u201d of the lot, and the plaintiff then proceeded north through the \u201copening,\u201d marked by two poles, into the field to get closer to the amusement park, in order to take pictures of the \u201crides.\u201d He had never walked through that field before.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">The surface of the field was elevated 28 inches above the A &amp; P paved lot and was covered with \u201cbrush and grass\u201d growing in the sand. A clearly defined path \u201cwhere people had walked and worn away the grass\u201d ran north from the \u201copening\u201d in the direction of the beach and amusement park. The \u201copening\u201d was clear, but brush, undergrowth, bushes and \u201cgreenery\u201d were located along the boundary of the A &amp; P lot and the Coopers\u2019 field.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">A metal chain, strung eight to nine inches above the level of the A &amp; P lot and overgrown by the brush, ran along this boundary. The chain had been installed at least 12 years before the accident by Bay-front at the request of A &amp; P, to be maintained by A &amp; P, in order \u201cto keep cars, bicycles, et cetera from going across the property.\u201d The \u201copening\u201d had been provided \u201cfor pedestrians to walk through.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">The plaintiff walked along the path to a point where he took additional photographs. He then started back on the same path until he observed a less clearly defined \u201cbranch path,\u201d which would have brought him more directly to his car. He testified that he followed the path and as it \u201cwent down the hill or terrace [to the A &amp; P lot] you could see a spot in the brush that was broken down where people had walked through there.\u201d As he started down the \u201chill,\u201d he \u201ctripped\u201d over the chain and fell. After the fall, from his position on the ground, he saw the chain for the first time \u201chidden in the brush itself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">We do not agree with the plaintiff\u2019s contention that the question of his contributory negligence was a jury issue. We will assume, but not decide, that the plaintiff is correct in his argument that he was a bare licensee on the premises of the defendants, that the defendants owed him the \u201cactive duty of protection from a known defect,\u201d and that, accordingly, the evidence established a case of primary negligence as to each defendant. Nevertheless, the plaintiff\u2019s own evidence discloses, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>as a matter of law, that he was negligent, and that such negligence proximately contributed to cause the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">The plaintiff advanced at night into an unlighted field, with which he was unfamiliar, from a paved parking lot, a place of relative safety. He proceeded without incident through the field along a well-defined path to a point where he accomplished the purpose of his uninvited visit to the premises. Instead of returning to the lot by the same route which he had just travelled in safety, he elected to take a shortcut into an unknown area of the field. While following this new route, he attempted to wade through the brush and fell over a chain obscured therein. This is not the conduct of an ordinarily prudent person exercising reasonable care for his own safety, and we hold that fair-minded men could not differ as to that conclusion. The plaintiff is, therefore, barred from recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">For these reasons, the judgment of the trial court is</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b430-10\"> The plaintiff was prevented from presenting all of his evidence during the trial because the trial judge sustained the motions to strike the evidence and entered summary judgment after only the plaintiff and a medical witness had testified. Although Rule 3:18 allows a party to make a motion for summary judgment \u201cat any time after the parties are at issue,\u201d the court in this case should have allowed the plaintiff to complete his case in chief. Any possible error is rendered harmless in this instance, however, because as the result of a stipulation at the Bar of this Court we are able to consider all of the additional evidence which the plaintiff would have offered had he been permitted to complete his case. Such additional evidence is contained in discovery depositions which are a part of the record before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
