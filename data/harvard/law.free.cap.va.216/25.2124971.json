He contends that the ordinance was vague and indefinite and therefore unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-22\">-The town ordinance incorporated by reference \u201call of the provisions of the laws of Virginia contained in Title 18.1, Article 6, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>the Code of Virginia, as amended, and in force on July 1, 1972.\u201d The title of the ordinance read: \u201cAdoption of portion of state law regarding driving under the influence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Code \u00a7 46.1-188, as amended in 1972, permits local authorities to incorporate appropriate provisions of \u201cArticle 6 [\u00a7 18.1-54, et seq.] of <em>chapter 2 </em>of Title 18.1\u201d into their ordinances by reference. (Italics supplied;)</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">When one statute adopts another by specific reference, only those particular parts of the statute referred to are incorporated. <em>Linthicum State ex rel. </em>v. <em>The Board of Com\u2019rs. Vanderburgh County, </em>175 Ind. 400, 94 N.E. 716 (1911); <em>Bancroft </em>v. <em>Frear, </em>144 Wis. 79, 128 N.W. 1068 (1910). <em>See also 2A Sutherland on Statutory Construction, </em>\u00a7 51.08 at 324-25 (4th rev. ed., C. Sands, 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">The instant ordinance failed to refer to the <em>chapter </em>of Article 6 of Title 18.1 of the Code. This omission left the ordinance vague and indefinite because at the time the ordinance was adopted two of the eight chapters under Title 18.1 contained an article 6. Without specific reference to Article 6, <em>Chapter 2, </em>of Title 18.1, a person could not receive fair notice of the relevant law by reading this penal ordinance. In addition, the title of the ordinance is not to be read as a part of it. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 1-13.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">Penal ordinances are to be strictly construed, and are not to be extended by implication or construction to embrace cases which are not within their letter and spirit. <em>Berry </em>v. <em>City of Chesapeake, </em>209 Va. 525, 526, 165 S.E.2d 291, 292 (1969); <em>Barber </em>v. <em>City of Danville, </em>149 Va. 418, 421-22, 141 S.E. 126, 127 (1928).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">Since this ordinance is vague and indefinite, it is unenforceable. The judgment of the court below is reversed, and the case is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
