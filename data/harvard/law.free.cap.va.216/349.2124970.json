Sentences were pronounced by the trial court on these verdicts. We granted a writ of error to review the defendant\u2019s claim that the evidence adduced at trial is insufficient to sustain his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-17\">Frederick Allen Sechrest, Jr. (Sechrest), who was employed at Little Joe\u2019s Mini Market (Little Joe\u2019s) in Amherst County, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>robbed and murdered at his place of employment on the afternoon of January 1, 1974. The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence against the defendant was wholly circumstantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Kenneth B. Waller (Waller), who subsequently discovered Sechrest\u2019s body, saw Sechrest standing near some \u201cdrink boxes\u201d outside Little Joe\u2019s between 4:18 and 4:20 p.m. as Waller drove by the store. He blew his horn and \u201cwaved at [Sechrest]\u201d who \u201cwaved back.\u201d There were no cars in Little Joe\u2019s lot at that time. Waller drove his car into the parking lot of a shopping center \u201calmost directly across\u201d the highway from Little Joe\u2019s. He entered a store in the shopping center where he remained for \u201cprobably five minutes.\u201d Reentering his car, Waller drove to the highway where he stopped and waited for \u201ca couple of cars to go by.\u201d He then drove across the highway and entered Little Joe\u2019s lot. A blue Chevrolet owned by Randolph Thomas (Thomas) entered the lot at approximately the same time Waller arrived there. Upon his arrival, Waller observed only one parked car, a \u201cbrownish-tan Dodge\u201d, in the lot. As Waller \u201cpulled up and stopped\u201d, a man that Waller could not identify, \u201ccame out of the store and went by [Waller\u2019s] car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Waller and Thomas entered the store together. Waller testified: \u201cWhen I got in the store I didn\u2019t see anybody, so I walked about halfway down the aisle in front of the door. I didn\u2019t see anybody at the back so I came back up the front. Then I saw the cash register opened and looked over [the counter] and saw [Sechrest] laying in the floor.\u201d Waller further testified: \u201cHe was laying face down and blood was coming out of his back.\u201d Waller \u201cglanced\u201d at the open cash register and saw \u201cnothing but change.\u201d He then used the store telephone to report to the sheriff\u2019s office what he had discovered. Waller and Thomas remained at the store until the arrival of a deputy sheriff a short time later.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">Deputy Sheriff B. W. Bailess testified that he arrived at Little Joe\u2019s at 4:3 3 p.m. in response to a radio call from the sheriff\u2019s dispatcher at 4:30 p.m. When he entered the store Deputy Bailess found Waller, Thomas and two other men waiting there. Bailess did not see Sechrest\u2019s body until he was told to look behind the counter. He looked at the body, which was lying face down behind the cashier\u2019s counter near the front of the store, and observed two gunshot wounds, one of which was \u201cabout the head\u201d and the other \u201cin the back\u2014upper part of the back, down below the neck.\u201d Bailess testified that he noticed that the drawer of the cash register was open. His testimony shows that the store had only one usable entrance.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>Henry Brockman, another deputy sheriff who participated in the investigation, testified that there was only one usable entrance to the store and that the other doors were \u201cfixed\u201d so that they could not be opened and that the store windows were \u201csecured\u201d by the use of screens and bars. Brockman participated in the defendant\u2019s arrest \u201cafter midnight\u201d on January 2 at the defendant\u2019s apartment in nearby Lynchburg. He testified that he did not \u201cfind a gun\u201d, although he was looking for one, either on the defendant\u2019s person or in his apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Don Wayne Doyle testified that he had worked at the store from 8:00 a.m. until he was relieved by the victim. Around 3:00 p.m. Doyle had ascertained that the cash register contained several checks, $720 in bills and an undetermined amount in coin. When Doyle left Little Joe\u2019s at 4:10 p.m., the victim and three lady customers were in the store. As Doyle drove away from the store, he observed that only one car remained in the parking area.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Allen Theodore King testified that on the afternoon of January 1 he was riding with the defendant in the latter\u2019s automobile in the vicinity of Little Joe\u2019s Mini Mart. They first \u201cwent past\u201d the store, then \u201cturned around and went back ... to buy some wine.\u201d Higginbotham parked the car, a \u201cbeige-yellow\u201d Dodge, with the front \u201cpointed opposite to\u201d the highway. There were no other cars in Little Joe\u2019s lot when King and the defendant arrived \u201cright around 4:00 o\u2019clock or 4:30.\u201d The defendant entered the store while King remained in the car and listened to the radio. Higginbotham came out of the store in \u201capproximately a minute or so\u201d carrying a bottle of wine. King testified that the defendant told him that \u201che was going to get right,. . . threw [the wine] in the car and told me to turn the car around.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">While King was turning the car, Higginbotham again entered Little Joe\u2019s where he remained for \u201cabout a minute or so.\u201d When the Waller and Thomas cars entered the lot, the defendant came out of the store, got into his car and said to King, \u201clet\u2019s go.\u201d King then drove the car from Little Joe\u2019s to the defendant\u2019s home in Lynch-burg. Asked if he heard \u201cany noise\u201d while the defendant was in the store, King responded: \u201cNo sir, I was listening to the radio while [Higginbotham] was in the store.\u201d When asked about the elapsed time between his arrival at Little Joe\u2019s and his departure from there, King answered: \u201cI couldn\u2019t say exactly. Maybe three, four or five minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>James E. Moss, the owner of Little Joe\u2019s, arrived at the store around 4:40 p.m. Moss testified that the only currency in the cash register was \u201ceight or nine\u201d twenty dollar bills which were concealed by \u201csome checks\u201d in a compartment of the cash drawer. Moss testified that the store had only one usable entrance and that the windows were barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">The foregoing constituted the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence. In his own behalf, the defendant testified that he went into Little Joe\u2019s on the afternoon of January 1. Upon entering the store through the door on the \u201cright side,\u201d he glanced toward the cashier\u2019s counter on the \u201cleft side\u201d and did not see anyone there. He then went to \u201ca refrigerator back on the right hand side\u201d where he got a bottle of wine. He then related: \u201cI didn\u2019t see anyone, so I came back out and I 'told King, \u2018I\u2019m going to get some Ripple.\u2019 So I went back to get a bottle of Ripple, but they didn\u2019t have any Ripple. So I came back out.\u201d The defendant denied seeing Sechrest, the victim, while he was in the store. He testified that one car, a red Ford, was in the lot at the time he arrived and that the car was still there when he left. Higginbotham stated that his first trip into Little Joe\u2019s took \u201cless than a minute\u201d and that he met Thomas and Waller entering the store as he was \u201ccoming out\u201d on the second occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">The defendant contends that this evidence is wholly circumstantial and is insufficient to support his convictions. He argues that: (1) There is no unbroken chain of circumstances which connected him with the crimes; (2) that these facts give rise to reasonable hypotheses other than that of the defendant\u2019s guilt; and (3) that the evidence shows no more than mere presence of the defendant at the scene of the crimes at about the time they were committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Where the sufficiency of the evidence is challenged after conviction, it is our duty to consider it in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth and give it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. We should affirm the judgment unless it appears from the evidence that the judgment is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. Code \u00a7 8-491; <em>Boykins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>210 Va. 309, 311, 170 S.E.2d 771, 773 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">The principles to be followed in weighing circumstantial evidence are succinctly stated in <em>LaPrade </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>191 Va. 410, 418, 61 S.E.2d 313, 316 (1950), where we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-9\">\u201c[I]f the proof relied upon by the Commonwealth is wholly circumstantial, as it here is, then to establish guilt beyond a reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>able doubt all necessary circumstances proved must be consistent with guilt and inconsistent with innocence. They must overcome the presumption of innocence and exclude all reasonable conclusions inconsistent with that of guilt. To accomplish that, the chain of necessary circumstances must be unbroken and the evidence as a whole must satisfy the guarded judgment that both the corpus delicti and the criminal agency of the accused have been proved to the exclusion of any other rational hypothesis and to a moral certainty. Yet what inferences are to be drawn from proved facts is within the province of the jury and not the court so long as the inferences are reasonable and justified.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The burden, of course, is upon the Commonwealth to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was the perpetrator of the crime. The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, however, need not affirmatively disprove all theories which might negate the conclusion that the defendant killed and robbed the deceased, but the conviction will be sustained if the evidence excludes every reasonable hypothesis of innocence. <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 265, 272, 217 S.E.2d 870, 875 (1975); <em>Orange </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>191 Va. 423, 434, 61 S.E.2d 267, 271 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Viewing the record with these principles in mind, we find the evidence sufficient to sustain the convictions. On the day in question, Sechrest was last seen alive between 4:18 and 4:20 p.m. At that time, he was outside the store, there were no vehicles on the parking lot, and Waller, who then observed Sechrest, \u201cdidn\u2019t see anybody in the store.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">Although obviously familiar with Little Joe\u2019s, the defendant first drove past the store, then \u201cturned around and went back\u201d and entered the parking lot. Despite the defendant\u2019s claim that a \u201cred Ford\u201d was already parked on the lot, the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence established that no other vehicles were present when the defendant arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">Sechrest was alive, as the trial judge observed at one stage of the trial, \u201cwithin minutes ... maybe even seconds\u201d before the defendant\u2019s arrival. Upon entering Little Joe\u2019s, the defendant did not see \u201canybody in the store at all.\u201d He then stole a bottle of wine, returned to his car, and told his companion, King, that he was \u201cgoing to get right.\u201d Although the vehicle was his and he had driven it to the store, the defendant directed King to turn it around and head it toward the highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>As King proceeded to turn the car around, the defendant reentered the store, remained a \u201cminute or so,\u201d returned to the car, and ordered King, \u201clet\u2019s go.\u201d In that \u201cminute or so,\u201d Waller and Thomas had arrived on the scene in separate cars. As they entered the store \u201ctogether,\u201d the defendant was \u201ccoming out.\u201d Once inside, Waller and Thomas discovered the rifled cash register and the still-bleeding body of Sechrest. The police were notified, and at 4:30 p.m. a radio call was broadcast concerning the crimes. Thus, at most, only 12 minutes had elapsed from the time Sechrest was last seen alive until the call was broadcast.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">From the evidence, there emerges an unbroken chain of circumstances from which the jury could properly find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant was the perpetrator of the crimes. The jury could reasonably infer and conclude that when Sechrest was last seen alive, outside the store, between 4:18 and 4:20 p.m. he was the only person then on the premises; that immediately thereafter the defendant, after first \u201ccasing\u201d the area, drove onto the deserted parking lot; that, meantime, Sechrest had gone inside the store; that the defendant entered the store, saw neither Sechrest nor anyone else, and stole a bottle of wine; that he returned to his car and, in haste, threw the bottle into the vehicle; that he directed King to turn the car around so a quick \u201cgetaway\u201d could be effected; and that he reentered the store intending to commit further acts of larceny, then encountered Sechrest, murdered him, and rifled the cash register.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">The judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
