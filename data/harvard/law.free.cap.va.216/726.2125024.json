The jury returned a verdict for Holloman against Waters for $35,000 and the trial court entered judgment on the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-17\">The single issue here is whether the evidence sustains the jury\u2019s finding that Waters\u2019 negligence was the proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries. Since the jury found for the plaintiff, the evidence and all proper inferences therefrom must be stated and viewed in the light most favorable to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-18\">The accident occurred on November 4, 1972, around 10:30 p.m. on U.S. Route 460 in Isle of Wight County, approximately one and three-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>tenths miles east of Windsor. U.S. Route 460 at the crash scene is a four-lane east-west highway. The two 12 foot eastbound lanes of the highway are separated from the two 12 foot westbound lanes by solid double lines only. The road is straight and level for at least three-tenths of a mile west of the scene of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">The investigating officer, Trooper W. G. Massengill, arrived at the site at approximately 10:40 p.m. while on routine patrol. He found the defendant \u201crunning in a rather hysterical way around 460, around the three injured persons that were laying on the highway around the automobiles. He was crying. He was bleeding profusely from the nose, and he was screaming that the accident was not his fault.\u201d The officer detected a strong odor of alcohol about the defendant\u2019s person. Trooper Massengill further testified: \u201cI placed [the defendant] against my car and asked him to stay there so I could attend to the other injured, and when I would leave him unattended, he would walk off from the car.\u201d The officer related that Waters was \u201cvery unsteady on his feet\u201d and that it was necessary to \u201crestrain him\u201d because of his condition. When Massengill placed the defendant in the back seat of the police car, Waters fell from the seat to the floor of the car and it was necessary for the officer to assist the defendant in regaining the car seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">Other officers were summoned and soon arrived at the crash site to assist Trooper Massengill. From his investigation of the accident site that night, Trooper Massengill testified that he ascertained that three cars had been involved in two separate crashes. The first crash occurred between the defendant\u2019s eastbound vehicle and the vehicle driven by the plaintiff. Shortly thereafter another eastbound vehicle operated by Martha S. Foster slid into the Waters vehicle which was stopped partly in each of the eastbound lanes of the highway. The officer testified that he found the Holloman car, which was not involved in the second crash, partly on the north shoulder and partly on the pavement of the right westbound lane of Route 460 facing west, towards Windsor.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">The trooper observed a large amount of broken glass and debris mostly in the left eastbound lane and left westbound lane. Some debris was also observed in the right eastbound lane. While the trooper observed some markings on the highway that night, he did not attempt to measure and record them until the following morning after daylight.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">When he returned to the scene of the accident the following morning the trooper found a \u201csingle darkened braking mark\u201d in the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>eastbound lane, which was approximately 60 feet in length. This mark, which was near, parallel to and south of the line dividing the two eastbound lanes, ran to a point where the trooper observed some scraped or dented marks in the road surface. From this point the trooper observed a \u201cdouble braking mark,\u201d with one mark beginning in each of the eastbound lanes, which deviated toward the right for approximately 69 feet and ended at the point where he found Waters\u2019 car the night before.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">Trooper Massengill also observed \u201cpressure marks ... real light tire marks\u201d which began in the vicinity of the scrape or dent marks in the road surface, crossed the westbound lanes and ended where the Holloman vehicle was sitting the preceding night.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">The trooper\u2019s testimony and the photographic exhibits introduced at trial show that the left rear door and left rear fender of Holloman\u2019s four door car were damaged in the initial collision. The entire front of the Waters car was demolished as a result of striking Holloman\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">Holloman testified that he and his two guests, Benjamin Holloman and Estelle Holloman, were proceeding east on Route 460 enroute to a restaurant in Suffolk when the wreck occurred. He told the jury that he was proceeding in the right eastbound lane at \u201cabout 50 or 55\u201d miles per hour. He said he did not stop or slow down before the crash nor did he see Waters\u2019 car. He related that Trooper Massengill interviewed him at the hospital the following day. When asked \u201chow the accident happened\u201d, the plaintiff \u201ctold him I thought I had a flat tire.\u201d When Massengill informed Holloman that there were no flat tires on Holloman\u2019s car and that the trooper believed Holloman was making a U-turn, plaintiff denied that he was making such a turn. Holloman testified that, after being pressed by the trooper, he told the trooper \u201c[m]aybe I was turning around.\u201d The final question asked plaintiff by his counsel was: \u201cDo you know anything about the accident except what somebody has told you?\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s response was \u201c[n]o sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">Trooper Massengill also testified about the interview at the hospital on November 5, 1972. As recorded by the trooper, plaintiff first stated, when asked to relate how the accident occurred, \u201cI was in the center lane going towards Suffolk. Something happened. I think a tire blew. I don\u2019t know anything else, it was done so quick.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">The trooper\u2019s notes then indicate that he asked the following questions and that Holloman responded with the following answers.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>\u201cQ. The car that hit you, did it come from behind you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-5\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t know, I just lost control of the car and got hit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-6\">\u201cQ. Had you been drinking?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-7\">\u201cA. Yes, one beer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-8\">\u201cQ. You weren\u2019t turning around in the road, were you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-9\">\u201cA. I just don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t think so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-10\">\u201cQ. You don\u2019t know what you were doing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-11\">\u201cA. Yes, I was turning around in the road. We decided to go back to Ivor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-12\">\u201cQ. Did you see any cars coming?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-13\">\u201cA. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-14\">\u201cQ. Did you turn around in the road or did you use a driveway?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-15\">\u201cA. I was turning around in the road.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b865-16\">Benjamin Holloman, a guest in plaintiff\u2019s car, testified that he had \u201cdozed off to sleep\u201d while enroute to the restaurant in Suffolk and that he remembered nothing else until he regained consciousness in a hospital the following morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-17\">Estelle Holloman, the other guest in plaintiff\u2019s car, testified that she was seated between the plaintiff and Benjamin Holloman on the front seat of plaintiff\u2019s automobile. She related that to the best of her recollection plaintiff was driving in the right eastbound lane in the direction of Suffolk before the crash. When asked if she recalled \u201cthe accident itself\u201d she responded, \u201c[n]o, I don\u2019t remember.\u201d She did testify that Holloman, whose speed was about 55 miles per hour, did not slow down, stop or apply his brakes before the crash. She also said that the plaintiff did not \u201cleave\u201d the right eastbound lane prior to the crash.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-18\">The only other witnesses who testified concerning the accident were the defendant and David Johnson, who was the only other occupant of defendant\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-19\">Johnson testified that the defendant was driving toward Suffolk in the left eastbound lane at approximately 45 miles per hour. After the defendant rounded a curve, Johnson observed plaintiff\u2019s unlighted car 30 or 35 yards ahead with its two right wheels on the right shoulder of the road. While he observed no signals from the plaintiff, the witness saw the plaintiff\u2019s car suddenly start to make a U-turn in front of defendant. Johnson related that Waters applied his brakes and \u201cstarted sliding\u201d before the front of his car collided with the left side of the Holloman vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-20\">Johnson testified that he had been with the defendant for approxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>mately one and one-half hours prior to the wreck. During that time he observed the defendant drink \u201cone beer\u201d. He testified that the defendant appeared \u201cnormal\u201d prior to the crash, but that he became nervous and upset afterwards.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">Waters testified that he was driving his car in the center or left eastbound lane of Route 460 toward Suffolk at a speed of about 45 miles per hour. He related that he drove into the center lane to pass the Foster car \u201con the outskirts of Windsor\u201d and continued to drive in the center lane until the crash. As he proceeded toward Suffolk Waters said his headlights were on \u201clow beam\u201d. He testified that he was suddenly confronted by the plaintiff\u2019s unlighted vehicle which was stopped \u201ccrossways\u201d in Waters\u2019 lane of travel. The defendant testified that he had consumed one bottle of ale earlier in the evening. In addition to the injury to his nose, the defendant said that his stomach and his legs struck the steering wheel in the crash. While conceding that he was having \u201ctrouble standing\u201d when Trooper Massengill arrived at the scene, Waters said this condition was caused by his injuries and was not due to drinking.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">What we said in <em>Weddle, Admx. </em>v. <em>Draper, </em>204 Va. 319, 322, 130 S. E. 2d 462, 465 (1963), seems particularly appropriate here:</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">\u201cNegligence cannot be presumed from the mere happening of an accident. The burden is on the plaintiff who alleges negligence to produce evidence of preponderating weight from which the jury can find that the defendant was guilty of negligence which was a proximate cause of the accident. The evidence produced must prove more than a probability of negligence and any inferences therefrom must be based on facts, not on presumptions. It is incumbent on the plaintiff who alleges negligence to show why and how the accident happened, and if that is left to conjecture, guess or random judgment, he cannot recover .. .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b866-8\">Here, while the jury would have been justified in finding from the evidence that the defendant was under the influence of alcohol, that fact does not, in the absence of some evidence of why and how the accident occurred, support an inference that Waters\u2019 intoxication was a proximate cause of the accident. Nor does the plaintiff\u2019s evidence that, prior to the crash, he was driving at a lawful speed, in his proper lane of travel, and that he neither stopped, slowed his speed, applied his brakes nor turned from his lane, establish why and how the crash occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-9\">Since the evidence adduced shows no more than a possibility of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>negligence which might have been a proximate cause of the crash, it follows that the jury\u2019s verdict was necessarily based upon conjecture, guess or random judgment. We therefore reverse and enter final judgment here for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">\n<em>Reversed and -final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
