She was sentenced to pay a fine of $150.00 and to serve a term of 30 days in jail, which term was suspended on condition of good behavior. The sole question on appeal is whether the drugs found in the defendant\u2019s possession were seized as the result of an illegal search of her wallet.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-17\">The record shows that on June 6, 1974, Detective F. S. Cruser, Jr., and several other officers of the Roanoke Police Department entered Miss Rene\u2019s Massage Parlor to execute a warrant for the arrest of the manager, L. R. Brown, Jr. The officers also intended to investigate a report that juveniles were employed in the establishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-18\">According to the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, after Brown was placed under arrest, Detective Cruser asked the defendant, who was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>in the front office, for \u201csome sort of identification to ascertain her age.\u201d The defendant began \u201clooking through her pocketbook\u201d and, becoming \u201crather perturbed,\u201d opened the purse and \u201cdumped . . . out\u201d its contents on a sofa. She then said to Cruser, \u201cI can\u2019t find [any identification], you look for it.\u201d Cruser looked \u201cthrough the contents,\u201d found a wallet, examined it, and discovered four tablets in one of its compartments. A temporary driver\u2019s license also found in the wallet showed that the defendant was 25 years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The defendant, testifying in her own behalf, stated that she was not 25 but 30 years old. She said that, after Brown was arrested, three police officers \u201ccornered\u201d her and told her she was \u201cunder arrest too,\u201d although it was later admitted that \u201cthey didn\u2019t arrest her.\u201d The defendant testified that Detective Cruser took her purse, \u201cjust dumped it out,\u201d and \u201cwent through\u201d it. She claimed that she \u201chad $100 in [her] purse, but it was missing\u201d after the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">The four tablets found in the defendant\u2019s wallet were subsequently analyzed as phenobarbital, a controlled substance. Later, approximately four weeks after the incident at the massage parlor, the defendant was arrested and charged with possession .of the drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">We will assume, without deciding, that Detective Cruser\u2019s examination of the defendant\u2019s wallet constituted a search. The crucial question then becomes whether the search was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">A search conducted with the free and voluntary consent of the accused is not an unreasonable search. <em>See Rees </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>203 Va. 850, 866, 127 S.E.2d 406, 417 (1962), <em>cert. denied, </em>372 U.S. 964 (1963). The burden, of course, is upon the Commonwealth to show that consent is freely and voluntarily given. <em>Bumper </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>391 U.S. 543, 548 (1968). Whether consent is voluntary is a question of fact to be determined from all the circumstances. <em>Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 227 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">The defendant contends that her consent to search was not free and voluntary \u201cbut was a submission to [Detective Cruser\u2019s] continued demand for the identification which she was unable to find.\u201d We are of opinion, however, that the Commonwealth fully carried its burden of proving that the defendant freely and voluntarily consented to the search which led to discovery of the incriminating drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">According to the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, which the trial court accepted over the defendant\u2019s obviously untrustworthy version, the defendant was merely asked by Detective Cruser to produce identification indicating her age, the officer being uncertain whether she was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>\u201c18 years of age or under.\u201d Frustrated in her own efforts to find identification, the defendant emptied the contents of her purse, including her wallet, and told the officer to look for himself. This was an unequivocal display of a free and voluntary consent to search the contents, including the wallet in which the incriminating drugs were found.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of conviction will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
