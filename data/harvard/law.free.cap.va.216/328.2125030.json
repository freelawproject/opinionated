Found guilty of the abduction and of murder in the first degree, Turnbull appealed the judgment order of the trial court, entered November 26, 1974, on the jury verdict, sentencing him to confinement in the State penitentiary for 30 years on each charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">We awarded Turnbull a writ of error limited to the questions whether the evidence was sufficient to support his conviction on each charge, and whether the trial court erred in ruling that James Tolley, a witness for Turnbull, was incompetent and in subsequently denying Turnbull\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">On May 25, 1973, at about 8:00 a.m., the badly beaten body of Sandra (\u201cSandy\u201d) Harrell Jones was found beside a farm road in a wooded area of Southampton County. The medical examiner testified that in his opinion Sandra\u2019s death was caused by strangulation and that she died between 5:00 p.m. May 24 and 5:00 a.m. May 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">The principal witness for the Commonwealth was Pamela (\u201cPam\u201d) Blair, who testified that she had pleaded guilty to the abduction and murder of Sandra in Southampton County. The witness related the sordid events in detail. On May 22, 1973, she and James Tolley accompanied Sandra and Turnbull (\u201cMongoose\u201d) to an office building in downtown Norfolk, where Sandra had been employed. Turnbull threatened Sandra with a wrench before she went into the building for her pay check and struck her in the mouth with the back of his hand when she returned without the check. They proceeded to Sandra\u2019s apartment, but the check had not been delivered. Sandra promised to pay Turnbull from her earnings as a dancer at the Jolly Roger, an Ocean View restaurant and night club, and Turnbull <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>warned her that she had better do so because \u201cshe couldn\u2019t rip him off\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">On May 24, Pam testified, Turnbull was angry with Sandra over the money and said that \u201cshe had ripped him off\u201d. He also said that he had found out the day before that Sandra had been informing on the activities of the Pagans, the motorcycle gang of which Turnbull was the leader. Pam saw Sandy in an old maroon Mustang with Linda Grant and June Reed at a service station in the Ocean View section of Norfolk frequented by Pagans and their women. Turnbull ordered Linda \u201cto do what he told her to do, and go teach Sandy a lesson\u201d. Linda, June, and Pam then took Sandra to an apartment where Linda brutally beat her with a belt and cut off her hair. The four returned to the service station around 3:00 p.m. Turnbull directed Linda to take Sandra to Georgia and \u201cif she didn\u2019t make it along the way to just drop her off somewhere\u201d. Pam\u2019s testimony was that Turnbull amplified this command by saying, \u201cI mean I don\u2019t want her to make it\u201d and directing that Linda should \u201cbe sure to burn her hands and face so she can\u2019t be identified\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">With Linda driving, the three girls transported Sandra to Southampton County where, Pam testified, Linda killed Sandra and left her body lying by the side of a dirt road in a remote wooded area. On the way out the car became stuck in a mud hole. The girls found two local men to whom they paid $15 each to pull the car out and then rejoined Turnbull and the others at a motel in Norfolk. When Linda reported that Sandra had been killed in accordance with his instructions, Turnbull expressed his pleasure.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">George Edwards testified that he and a neighbor helped three girls, whom he identified as Linda Grant, June Reed and Pam Blair, by pulling their car out of a mud hole in a woods path in Southampton County, on May 24 at approximately 11:30 p.m. Suspicious of the circumstances he wrote down the license number of the car. The next morning he returned to the area and discovered Sandra\u2019s body some 300-400 yards from the place where the car had been stuck.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">William Woods, a convicted felon and former Pagan, testified that at the time of Sandra\u2019s murder he was aiding State Police undercover narcotics agents as an unpaid informer. He described the organization of the Pagans and the status of their \u201cold ladies\u201d, the women with whom they lived. An \u201cold lady\u201d customarily wore a \u201cproperty patch\u201d which identified her as the \u201cproperty\u201d of a Pagan. Some of the Pagans worked, and others were supported by their \u201cold ladies\u201d. Dur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>ing the time that Woods belonged to the Pagans, Turnbull never worked at a regular job. Woods testified that Sandra was Turnbull\u2019s \u201cold lady\u201d at one time, that Pam and June Reed were James Tolley\u2019s \u201cold ladies\u201d, and that Linda, known as \u201cCrazy Linda\u201d, was Josie Green\u2019s \u201cold lady\u201d. Turnbull was President of the Virginia Beach Chapter of the Pagans and was also over the Norfolk and Portsmouth Chapters, \u201cand anything they said had to be checked over with him before anybody could do anything\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">On May 24 at about 4:30 or 5:00 p.m., Turnbull, Tolley and Green came to Woods\u2019s apartment, and Turnbull advised Woods to have an \u201cairtight\u201d alibi for that night. Tolley explained that \u201cthey were going to get rid of Sandy\u201d, and Turnbull told Woods to say, if he was asked, that when he had last seen Sandy, she and another girl were hitchhiking from Norfolk toward Georgia to work as topless dancers. Woods promptly communicated this information to Jim Smith, an undercover agent of the State Police Narcotics section, and he and Smith looked for Sandra for about eight hours. On the following day Woods saw Sandra\u2019s I.D. card in a pocketbook which Tolley burned behind the service station at Ocean View.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">After Sandra\u2019s body was found, Woods attended a meeting of the Pagans at which Turnbull said that he was going to be picked up for questioning about Sandra\u2019s death. He also said, \u201cI must have been a dumb ass to try to let Crazy Linda try to take care of anything for me\u201d, since Sandra had been taken toward Suffolk instead of to Georgia, and nothing had been done to keep her body from being identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Woods further testified that Turnbull told him that Sandra was supposed to be paid $60 for dancing but that, after she stopped living with him, every time he went after the money she \u201cwould duck out the back door\u201d instead of giving him the money to get his motorcycle out of the shop. Turnbull also told Woods that when the girls picked Sandra up they intended only to beat her up, but they beat her so badly that he was afraid she would die anyway, so he told them to take her \u201ctowards Georgia\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">Other witnesses for the Commonwealth substantiated portions of the testimony of Pam Blair and Woods. Mrs. Judy Edwards recalled seeing Sandra, shortly before her death, evade Turnbull by going out one door at the Jolly Roger as he came in another. James Thorpe testified that Pam and three other girls in an old maroon Mustang stopped at his service station in Hampton on the night of May 24. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>Trooper James Smith, of the State Police, confirmed that Woods had reported to him the threat against Sandra on May 24 and that he and Woods had tried in vain to find her throughout that evening until about 2:00 a.m. on May 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">After his motion to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence had been denied, Turnbull, testifying in his own defense, denied any knowledge of Sandra\u2019s abduction, beating or murder. He also denied that he had ever threatened or struck her, denied that he saw her on May 24, and denied that he talked to Woods on that day. He admitted, however, that Sandra owed him $30 to repay a loan that he made to her in April, and that she might have been afraid of him because of this unpaid debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\"> Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, we hold that it is sufficient to support Turnbull\u2019s conviction on both charges as an accessory before the fact. There was ample evidence that Turnbull ordered the abduction, the beating and the murder. Sandra owed him money, and Turnbull had threatened her, struck her, and pursued her in vain efforts to obtain payment. He ordered her taken to an apartment and beaten to teach her that she could not \u201crip him off\u201d. The jury could reasonably have inferred that Turnbull not only wanted to punish her but also wanted to make certain that she would repay his loan and would not thereafter withhold money from him, thus bringing the abduction within the provisions of Code \u00a7 18.1-38 (Repl. Vol.' 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">The jury could have found from the evidence that, after the Grant woman, aided and abetted by June and Pam, had beaten Sandra too severely, Turnbull, believing that she would die anyway, ordered that she be transported out of the state and murdered. The evidence is thus sufficient to show wilful, deliberate, and premeditated killing, which, under the provisions of Code \u00a7 18.1-21 (Cum. Supp. 1975), constitutes murder in the first degree. <em>See Bailey </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>191 Va. 510, 516-17, 62 S.E.2d 28, 30-31 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">The evidence does not show that Turnbull personally abducted or beat Sandra or that he was present when she was murdered. It is sufficient, however, to show that he planned and instigated the commission of the crimes and was, therefore, an accessory before the fact. <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>179 Va. 96, 99, 18 S.E.2d 314, 315 (1942). <em>See Tolley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 341, 348, 218 S.E.2d 550, 555, this day decided. Under the provisions of Code \u00a7 18.1-11 (Repl. Vol. 1960), an accessory before the fact \u201cmay be indicted, tried and convicted and punished in all respects as if a principal in the first degree....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>Turnbull has challenged the rulings of the trial court that his witness, James Tolley, was incompetent, that Tolley\u2019s testimony should be stricken, and that Turnbull was not thereby entitled to a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Tolley, who had previously been convicted of Sandra\u2019s abduction, was the principal defense witness other than Turnbull himself. Tolley testified extensively on direct examination. He described the strict domination that the members of the Pagans exercised over their respective \u201cold ladies\u201d. He suggested that Linda, June and Pam were jealous of Sandra, who was a \u201choney\u201d (a female follower of the Pagans, inferior to an \u201cold lady\u201d and available to all members of the gang), and angry with her because she had been engaging in sexual intercourse with each of their \u201cold men\u201d, including Tolley. Tolley asserted that Turnbull was with him at the service station in Ocean View throughout the afternoon of May 24; that Linda, June and Pam drove in and wanted to go to Florida; that he did not see Sandra in the car; that the girls stayed only a few minutes and drove away around 3:00 or 3:30 p.m.; and that he and Turnbull remained at the service station until 6:00 p.m. and then visited bars until nearly 2:00 a.m. the next morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">On cross-examination Tolley denied that he and Turnbull had gone to Wood\u2019s apartment on May 24, and denied that Turnbull had ever made any statements about beating or murdering Sandra or making certain that her body could not be identified. Tolley described the muddy appearance of the three girls when they returned to Norfolk early in the morning of May 25. Tolley admitted that Linda reported that she had burned Sandra\u2019s face and hands to prevent identification, but he insisted that Turnbull was asleep on the floor and had no conversation with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">At this point in his cross-examination the Commonwealth Attorney undertook to impeach Tolley with a letter purportedly written to Pam Blair. Tolley refused to admit or deny that he had written the letter and testified that he could not say that the handwriting was his. Out of the presence of the jury the questioning continued and the Commonwealth Attorney asked the trial court to warn the witness of the penalties for perjury and announced his intention to seek a perjury indictment against Tolley if Tolley denied that he wrote the letter. Tolley then stated that he would answer no more questions for either side.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>The trial court asked Tolley whether he had trouble remembering. The witness replied that he had \u201ca lot of trouble remembering\u201d; that he had been in a mental hospital the preceding year; that he remembered a few things that happened eighteen months before (about the time of Sandra\u2019s abduction and murder), but could not remember others; that he sometimes blacked out for perhaps two hours and could not remember what he did; that he had asked to see a neurosurgeon but had not been permitted to do so; and that the doctor would not give him the pills he needed for headaches and his \u201cnerves have almost been shot too\u201d. This final colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-4\">\u201cThe Court: You can\u2019t remember anything about Sandy Harrell Jones and about her death, or anything surrounding that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-5\">\u201cJames Tolley: I don\u2019t remember nothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-6\">\u201cThe Court: Did you remember anything about it a few minutes ago when you were testifying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">\u201cJames Tolley: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t even know if I testified or not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">The Commonwealth Attorney contended that he was still entitled to question Tolley about the letter, and represented to the court that Pam Blair would identify it.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">The record indicates that the court then called counsel to the bench for a conference but there is no record of what transpired. At the conclusion of the conference counsel for Turnbull stated that his motion for a mistrial, based upon surprise at Tolley\u2019s last testimony, had been overruled. The jurors were brought back to the courtroom and the trial court informed them that he had found, after examining him, that Tolley was not competent to testify. The court thereupon directed the jury to disregard Tolley\u2019s testimony, and ordered that the testimony be stricken from the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">It is the function of the trial court to determine whether a witness is competent, that is, whether the witness possesses such understanding as to remember events and a knowledge of right and wrong. <em>Helge </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>212 Va. 485, 487-88, 184 S.E. 2d 794, 796 (1971); <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>66 Va. (25 Gratt.) 865, 874-75 (1874). <em>See </em>McCormick on Evidence, 2d Ed., \u00a7 62, p. 140 (1972). In making this determination the court may, but is not obligated to, consider the opinion evidence of experts. It is a matter within the discretion of the trial court. <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>193 Va. 612, 624, 70 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>S.E.2d 293, 300-01 (1952). Here, there was evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that Tolley was not competent, and we hold that there was no error in this ruling or in the instruction to the jury to disregard Tolley\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Turnbull strenuously maintains, however, that he was entitled to a mistrial when Tolley\u2019s testimony was taken from the jury. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">The trial court may discharge a jury when \u201cthere is a manifest necessity for such discharge\u201d. Code \u00a7 8-208.23 (Cum. Supp. 1975). There is no general rule as to what facts and circumstances constitute such a necessity but the trial coutr is authorized by the statute to exercise its discretion in making the determination according to the circumstances of the case. <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 185, 217 S.E.2d 815 (1975); <em>Mack </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>177 Va. 921, 927, 15 S.E.2d 62, 65 (1941). <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>95 S.Ct. 1013, 1022, n. 12 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">We find no clear abuse of discretion by the trial court in denying Turnbull\u2019s motion for a mistrial. The record does not reflect the discussion between court and opposing counsel when the motion for a mistrial apparently was first made. The mere fact that Turnbull\u2019s counsel was surprised at Tolley\u2019s loss of memory does not entitle him to a mistrial as a matter of law. The trial court might have concluded that in the exercise of reasonable diligence Turnbull\u2019s counsel should have anticipated that Tolley would suffer lapses of memory at trial, in which event he could not claim surprise. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Henson, </em>290 Mo. 238, 234 S.W. 832 (1921). Moreover, we will not consider whether, by failing to produce the letter which caused Tolley\u2019s loss of memory to be revealed, the Commonwealth failed to respond adequately to Turnbull\u2019s pretrial motion for discovery, since Turnbull did not raise this issue in the trial court. Rule 5:7.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">There were other potential witnesses that might have been called by Turnbull. His counsel, however, did not seek a recess or a continuance for that purpose. The trial court, therefore, would have been justified in concluding that no other witnesses would testify in a manner favorable to Turnbull.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">We hold that there was no reversible error in the rulings of the trial court and the judgment order is</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">Compton, J., dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>The majority has decided that the trial court, in declaring the witness Tolley incompetent to testify, did not abuse its discretion. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">I am convinced from a review of the record that, although Tolley was thoroughly impeached during cross-examination, the evidence is insufficient to support a finding that he was a legally incompetent witness. In my view, the question was one of credibility, a matter for the jury to evaluate, and was not a question of competency to be decided as a matter of law by the trial court, especially since the result of the trial court\u2019s action, now approved by this Court, eliminated from the jury\u2019s consideration the entire testimony of the defendant\u2019s principal witness. '\u00edffiis was a clear abuse of discretion by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">In view of the cases relied on to support its opinion on this point, the majority apparently has found the evidence sufficient to support the conclusion that Tolley was untrustworthy as a matter of law because he was <em>mentally incompetent</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Yet the \u201cevidence\u201d on which the trial court apparently relied, and on which my brethren now rely, came from Tolley, the very witness now declared to be unworthy of belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">But aside from this, the record demonstrates to me that Tolley suffered a convenient \u201closs of memory,\u201d as the majority characterizes his state, when pressured during cross-examination. A sudden \u201closs of memory\u201d by a witness is not an unusual development in the trial of a case, particularly when a vigorous cross-examination is conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">In this case, Tolley had testified at length and succinctly during direct examination by defendant\u2019s counsel. Then Tolley answered in excess of 60 questions propounded by the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney during cross-examination before he was asked about a prior written statement, purported to be a letter to Pamela Blair, which was presumably inconsistent with his testimony. The following then transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-9\">\u201cContinuing By Mr. Grizzard [Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney]: Q.

As I say his lawyer is not here and I am not his lawyer, but on the other hand, I did call him as a witness and I think he has stated he doesn\u2019t remember, and I haven\u2019t said one word to him since that letter first came out, nor has my partner, Mr. Christie, and I don\u2019t know anything about the motivation for his answer, but I do know this; he has answered the question and he says he doesn\u2019t remember it and it has not been properly identified for entry into evidence, and he cannot be examined on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-17\">\u201cA. My name is James Tolley.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-18\">\u201cMr. Grizzard Continuing: Q. Do you sign all of your letters James?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-19\">\u201cA. Most of the time Jim or James.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-20\">\u201cQ. And Jimmy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-21\">\u201cA. Occasionally I have, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-22\">\u201cMr. Grizzard: I am going to ask the Court to warn him what the penalties of perjury are because unless he is advised, I think we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>would be taking him to advantage, and if he keeps denying he wrote that letter, the Commonwealth intends to bring a perjury indictment against him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-5\">\u201cMr. Decker: He did not deny it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-6\">\u201cMr. Grizzard: He did not give a yes or no answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-7\">\u201cMr. Decker: He says he can\u2019t remember. The Commonwealth says to answer the question and he answers it, and then he brings a perjury indictment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-8\">\u201cJames Tolley: I am not answering no more questions in this Court. I am finished with it right now. I will not answer another question in this Court as far as the defendant or the prosecution either one. I quit right now. If you want to give me a charge of perjury, give it to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-9\">\u201cThe Court: Are you asking us to tell the jury to disregard everything you have said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-10\">\u201cJames Tolley: I don\u2019t care what you tell the jury. I tried to tell you that I don\u2019t remember writing the letter and everything and he is going to bring charges on me and everything else. What can I do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-11\">\u201cThe Court: Do you have a little trouble remembering?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-12\">\u201cJames Tolley: Yes, I have a lot of trouble remembering. Seethe doctor down here whenever they take me, and I was in the mental hospital last year because I can\u2019t remember what I do sometimes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqr\">\u201cThe Court: Can you remember anything that happened back eighteen months ago?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-13\">\u201cJames Tolley: Yes, I remember a few things that happened eighteen months ago, but some things I don\u2019t remember. Sometimes I have spells I black out for maybe two hours or something and I don\u2019t know what I am doing in those two hours or something or other. I have asked to see a neurosurgeon since I have been down here for eleven months, and I haven\u2019t got to see one yet to find out why this is, and I still haven\u2019t got to see one and the doctor won\u2019t give me the pills I need for headaches or anything else and my nerves have almost been shot too, and I tried to tell the truth and then they bring this stuff like this that I don\u2019t know nothing about, and I can\u2019t recognize it anyway, and I don\u2019t remember doing it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A29\">\u201cThe Court: What do you remember about this whole situation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqdK\">\u201cJames Tolley: Right now, I don\u2019t remember nothing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>It was on the strength of this testimony, and that quoted in the majority opinion, that the trial judge declared Tolley incompetent, telling the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-5\">\u201cLadies and gentlemen of the jury, I have examined the witness who just testified, and after examining this witness I find that he is not competent to testify in this case. I will ask that you disregard any statement that he may have made in this courtroom during this trial. Anything this witness may have said will not be considered by you when you arrive at your verdict in this case. I will ask that his entire testimony be stricken from the record.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">The foregoing incident of trial merely reveals a case wherein a witness has been totally impeached and, upon being threatened with indictment for perjury, has further discredited himself by stating that: \u201cRight now, I don\u2019t remember nothing.\u201d But this circumstance did not authorize elimination of the discredited testimony from the jury\u2019s consideration. I feel, therefore, that the action of the trial court was not justified by the evidence and was an abuse of discretion. For this reason, I would reverse the judgment of conviction and remand the case for a new trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b465-10\"> Turnbull was indicted for abduction under Code \u00a7 18.1-38 (Repl.
