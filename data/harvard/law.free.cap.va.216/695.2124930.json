The taxpayers, alleging that both the 1971 and the 1973 ordinances were invalid, sought refunds, with interest, of taxes which they had paid thereunder. The trial court, concluding that <em>Krauss </em>was controlling, ruled in favor of the taxpayers. By final orders the court restrained the city and its officials from collecting from these taxpayers any taxes under the ordinances, and directed that refunds be made, with interest and costs, of taxes previously paid by them. Upon the petition of the city, filed pursuant to Rule 5:23, we granted it a writ of error to all but one<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the judgment orders, and the matter was briefed and argued before us as a consolidated appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">The city enjoys the broad license taxing powers granted to local governing bodies by the General Assembly.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We recognized in <em>Krauss </em>that a city has been delegated the power to levy license taxes on those \u201cengaged in business\u201d. <em>Id. </em>214 Va. at 95, 197 S.E.2d at 206. We said in <em>Bott </em>v. Commonwealth, 187 Va. 745, 48 S.E.2d 235 (1948), that the word \u201cbusiness\u201d has a meaning broad enough to cover everything about which a person can be employed, including operation of an apartment building. <em>Id. </em>at 749, 48 S.E.2d at 237. <em>See also Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>City of Newport News, </em>196 Va. 627, 85 S.E.2d 345 (1955); and <em>Fallon Florist </em>v. <em>City of Roanoke, </em>190 Va. 564, 58 S.E.2d 316 (1950). We held in <em>Krauss, </em>however, that the city in that case had no authority, by its charter or by statute, to extend or enlarge the definition of \u201cengaged in business\u201d so as to contravene the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>We reject the taxpayers\u2019 argument that a tax on those who engage in the business of renting residential property is unconstitutionally discriminatory. The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not prevent a state from adjusting its system of taxation in all reasonable and proper ways. <em>Bell\u2019s Gap R\u2019d Co. </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>134 U.S. 232, 237 (1889). Recognizing that the states possess broad power to classify according to occupation for purposes of taxation, the Supreme Court has held that equal protection does not compel identity of treatment but \u201conly requires that the classification rest on real and not feigned differences, that the distinction have some relevance to the purpose for which the classification is made, and that the different treatments be not so disparate, relative to the difference in classification, as to be wholly arbitrary\u201d. <em>Walters </em>v. <em>City of St. Louis, Mo., </em>347 U.S. 231, 237 (1954). If the classification is reasonable and not arbitrary, uniformity and equality are not required. <em>Town of Ashland </em>v. <em>Supervisors, </em>202 Va. 409, 415, 117 S.E.2d 679, 684 (1961); <em>Langston </em>v. <em>City of Danville, </em>189 Va. 603, 608, 54 S.E.2d 101, 104 (1949). It is not necessary that legislative classifications be perfect, and a statutory discrimination will not be set aside if any state of facts reasonably may be conceived to justify it. <em>Sheek </em>v. <em>City of Newport News, </em>214 Va. 288, 291, 199 S.E.2d 519, 522 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">In order to avoid the pyramiding of taxes, the City Council could reasonably place those engaged in the business of renting residential property in a different category from those expressly excluded. Thus, the ordinances excluded those engaged in the business of renting specified kinds of residential property, such as motels, for the operation of which licenses were otherwise required by the city. For the same reason the City Council could omit from the classification those engaged in the business of renting non-residential property. The classification is presumptively valid and will be upheld unless it is facially unreasonable or its unreasonableness has been established by clear and convincing proof. <em>Sheek v. City of Newport News, supra, </em>214 Va. at 288, 199 S.E.2d at 521. Here, the presumption of validity has not been overcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">The taxpayers further contend that this license tax will result in double taxation because real estate agents representing the owners\u2019 interests also pay a business license tax. This contention is based on the theory that any tax directly or indirectly affecting property is a tax on that property, a concept which we have repeatedly declined to approve. <em>See Hunton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>166 Va. 229, 244, 183 S.E. 873, 879 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>We conclude that the city could validly impose a license tax on those engaged in the business of renting residential property. It follows that the 1973 ordinance, which conformed to the guidelines enunciated in <em>Krauss, </em>is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">The validity of the 1971 ordinance, however, depends upon a determination whether in the second paragraph the definition of those \u201cengaged in the business\u201d, arising implicitly from the exclusionary language, and conceded by the city to be invalid under our holding in <em>Krauss, </em>can be satisfactorily severed from the rest of the ordinance. The city contends that the ordinance is severable and that the proscribed definition may be excised without destroying the entire ordinance, because the first paragraph, the operative section describing the class to which this license tax applies, would remain intact, and the phrase \u201cengaged in the business\u201d contained therein would necessarily carry its common law meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">The record fails to support the city\u2019s contention that there is an applicable severability clause. Without such a provision the burden of proving severability devolves upon the supporter of the legislation. <em>Hannabass </em>v. <em>Maryland Cas. Co., </em>169 Va. 559, 571, 194 S.E. 808, 813 (1938). Nevertheless, even in the absence of a severability clause, \u201cthe test of severability is whether the legislature would be satisfied with what remains after the invalid part has been eliminated\u201d. <em>Waynesboro </em>v. <em>Keiser, </em>213 Va. 229, 235, 191 S.E.2d 196, 200 (1972). The intent of the lawmakers is controlling. <em>Bd. Sup. James City County </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>216 Va. 128, 147, 216 S.E.2d 199, 214 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">There can be no uncertainty as to the legislative intent in the present case. Deletion of the invalid definition in the 1971 ordinance does not alter the effect of the ordinance in fulfilling the purpose expressed in its first sentence of levying the tax on \u201cevery person engaged in the business of renting residential property\u201d. Moreover, the City Council has since proceeded by amendment to substitute the approved common law definition for the invalidated definition. It has also changed the ordinance to provide that the tax will be levied in a specified amount for each residential unit, rather than in a specified sum for the first four units and in a different amount for each additional unit. We conclude that the 1971 ordinance is severable and that the trial court erred in ruling to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">The taxpayers have misconstrued the effect of our ruling on rehearing in <em>Krauss. </em>We did not resolve the question of severability because this issue was never raised before us except on rehearing, when it was too late. Therefore, we reaffirmed, without opinion, our pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>vious decision. In the present cases, severability was an issue at every stage of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">We agree with the taxpayers that the ordinances present difficult administrative and enforcement problems, but these problems raise questions as to the advisability,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> rather than the validity, of the legislative enactments. An ordinance or a statute is not fatally defective because questions may arise as to its applicability, or opinions may differ as to what falls within its terms, or because it is difficult to enforce. <em>Fallon Florist </em>v. <em>City of Roanoke, supra, </em>190 Va. at 590, 58 S.E.2d at 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">The judgment orders appealed from are reversed and the cases are remanded for further proceedings to determine whether the taxpayers were \u201cengaged in the business of renting residential property\u201d within the meaning of the ordinances and thus were subject to the license taxes in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b832-10\"> Ordinance No. 1971-52 provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b832-11\"># * #</p>\n<p id=\"b832-12\">\u201cSection 87.1.
