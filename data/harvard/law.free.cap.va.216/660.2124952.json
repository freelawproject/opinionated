The convictions were based upon pleas of guilty entered by Kibert on June 4, 1959, to two statutory short form indictments for murder. The voluntariness of Kibert\u2019s pleas long since has been resolved adversely to his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">Following unsuccessful attempts to overturn his convictions in state courts, Kibert filed a petition for habeas corpus relief in the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia. Proceeding upon the belief that the indictments against Kibert charged only second degree murder, the District Judge ruled that at Kibert\u2019s trial the burden was on the Commonwealth to produce evidence to elevate the offenses to first degree murder. Finding that no evidence had been produced at Kibert\u2019s trial, the District Judge held that Kibert\u2019s convictions of murder of the first degree were based solely upon his pleas of guilty and that the convictions were, therefore, \u201cso totally devoid of evidentiary support as to be a denial of due process of law.\u201d Accordingly, the District Judge awarded Kibert habeas corpus relief. <em>Kibert </em>v. <em>Slayton, </em>356 F.Supp. 760 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">In an unreported memorandum decision dated May 29, 1974, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed the judgment of the District Court. Although the Court of Appeals accepted the District Judge\u2019s finding that no evidence had been introduced at Kibert\u2019s trial, the Court held that Kibert\u2019s pleas of guilty to the short form indictments constituted, under Virginia law, pleas to murder of the first degree. Whether, however, under Virginia law, the introduction of evidence was necessary to sustain the convictions, the Court stated, was a question not \u201cdefinitely resolved.\u201d Stating that principles of comity were \u201cmost acute\u201d in the case, the Court refrained from deciding the question to afford Virginia \u201cthe opportunity to have its own tribunals interpret the unsettled state law.\u201d Kibert\u2019s petition for habeas corpus relief was ordered dismissed without prejudice to his right to reassert his \u201cno evidence\u201d claim in federal courts after he had exhausted state remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>Kibert sought and was denied certiorari. 419 U.S. 995 (1974). He then filed in the court below a <em>pro se </em>\u201cPetition for a Writ of Coram Vobis.\u201d While he reasserted a number of grounds for relief which previously had been finally rejected, Kibert did allege that there was \u201cno evidence presented at the trial.\u201d The lower court denied Kibert\u2019s petition, and we granted a writ of error limited to the sole question of the necessity of evidence to sustain a conviction based upon a plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">At the outset, a proposition emerges which, under normal circumstances, would be conclusively dispositive. The orders of conviction in Kibert\u2019s case recite that the court, <em>having heard the evidence, </em>proceeded to find the accused guilty of murder of the first degree. The recital in the orders that the court had heard the evidence is an absolute verity, and it is not subject to collateral attack. <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>Peyton, </em>211 Va. 484, 487, 178 S.E.2d 521, 523 (1971); <em>Hobson </em>v. <em>Youell, </em>177 Va. 906, 916, 15 S.E.2d 76, 80 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">We do not retreat from this proposition, and its unbending application ordinarily would end the case. The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, however, found principles of comity so \u201cacute\u201d that it was prompted to refrain from deciding the important question of state law presented by Kibert\u2019s \u201cno evidence\u201d claim. A reciprocal sense of judicial courtesy prompts us to resolve the question on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">We will assume, therefore, that no evidence was introduced at Kibert\u2019s trial. Having made that assumption, we now inquire whether the Constitution, the statutes, or the case law of Virginia required the introduction of evidence at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">Section 8 of the Constitution of Virginia of 1902, in effect at the time of Kibert\u2019s trial, provided that \u201c[i]n criminal-cases, the accused may plead guilty; and if the accused pleads not guilty, with his consent and the concurrence of the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney and of the court entered of record, he may . . . waive a jury. In case of such waiver, or plea of guilty, the court shall try the case.\u201d These provisions are now found in Article I, \u00a7 8 of the present Constitution of Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">Code \u00a7 19-166, in effect at the time of Kibert\u2019s trial (now \u00a7 19.2-257), provided that \u201c[u]pon a plea of guilty in a felony case ... the court shall hear and determine the case without the intervention of a jury.\u201d Code \u00a7 19-223 (represent \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-257 and -288) provided that \u201c[i]f the accused confess the indictment [for murder] to be true, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>the court shall hear the case without the intervention of a jury, and shall ascertain the extent of the punishment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Kibert contends that these constitutional and statutory sections, which provide that upon a plea of guilty the court shall <em>try </em>the case, shall <em>hear </em>and <em>determine </em>the case, and shall <em>hear </em>the case and <em>ascertain </em>the punishment, clearly require the court to \u201chear and consider the evidence against the accused . . . where a plea of guilty is entered.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">We believe the recited constitutional and statutory provisions do no more than authorize and require a trial court, when a plea of guilty is entered in a criminal case, to dispose of the case without the intervention of a jury. Upon a plea of not guilty, the court may dispose of a criminal case without the intervention of a jury only with the consent of the accused and the concurrence of the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney and the court entered of record. The alternate provisions relating to a plea of guilty are intended, in our opinion, only to make clear that the requirement of consent and concurrence entered of record does not apply when a guilty plea is entered and that it is mandatory for the court to dispose of the case without the intervention of a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">To say, as Kibert would have us say, that under the statutes of Virginia a trial court must hear and consider evidence whenever a plea of guilty is entered would require judicial reenactment of a legislative mandate once contained in the statutes. Section 4041 of the Code of 1887, a predecessor of Code \u00a7 19-223, upon which latter section Kibert presently relies, required th\u00e1t if \u201cthe accused confess the indictment [for murder] to be true, the court <em>shall examine the witnesses and determine the degree of the crime, </em>and give sentence accordingly.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This provision was altered by the 1919 revision of the Code. Section 4919 of the Code of 1919, the immediate predecessor of \u00a7 19-223, omitted the mandate that the court examine the witnesses and determine the degree of the crime. Significantly, a similar mandate has not since appeared in the statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">This brings us to the case law of Virginia. We start with the judicially-declared proposition, overlooked in Kibert\u2019s case by the United States District Court but recognized by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, that the statutory short form of indictment for murder includes the charge of murder of the first degree. <em>Hobson </em>v. <em>Youell, supra, </em>177 Va. at 912, 15 S.E.2d at 78. While, as a general rule, the burden is upon the Commonwealth to elevate a homicide to mur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>der of the first degree <em>(Painter </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>210 Va. 360, 364, 171 S.E.2d 166, 169 (1969)), this rule is inapplicable when the accused pleads guilty to an indictment for murder. In so pleading, he confesses \u201cto the highest degree of the offense which the indictment charges and of which he can be convicted under its averments.\u201d <em>Hobson </em>v. <em>Youell, supra, </em>177 Va. at 913, 15 S.E.2d at 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">In the present case, therefore, when Kibert entered his pleas of guilty, he confessed to murder of the first degree. It was not required that the Commonwealth produce evidence to elevate the offense to its highest degree because, as we said in <em>Hobson </em>v. <em>Youell, supra, </em>177 Va. at 913, 15 S.E.2d at 78-79, a \u201cplea of guilty eliminates the necessity for proof, in so far as fixing the degree of the crime is concerned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">Not only is proof unnecessary to fix the degree of the crime upon a plea of guilty in a murder case but the introduction of evidence to sustain a conviction upon a guilty plea is equally unnecessary in any criminal case. In <em>Crutchfield </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>187 Va. 291, 296, 46 S.E.2d 340, 342 (1948), we said that a \u201cplea of guilty, accepted and entered by the court, is a conviction or the equivalent of a conviction of the offense to which it is directed.\u201d And in <em>Peyton </em>v. <em>King, </em>210 Va. 194, 196, 169 S.E.2d 569, 571 (1969), we held that \u201ca voluntary and intelligent plea of guilty by an accused is, in reality, a self-supplied conviction authorizing imposition of the punishment fixed by law. It is a waiver of all defenses other than those jurisdictional.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">If, as <em>Crutchfield </em>and <em>King </em>teach us, a plea of guilty is a self-supplied conviction of the offense to which it is directed, the law would engage in superfluities to impose a requirement that evidence is necessary to sustain that which sustains itself. And if, as <em>King </em>holds, a plea of guilty is a waiver of all defenses save those jurisdictional, included in the waiver is the potential defense of lack of evidence or of insufficiency of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">In accepting a plea of guilty, any Virginia trial judge is, of course, free to hear the evidence he deems necessary to an understanding of the case and to the fixing of an appropriate sentence. This does not mean, however, that evidence <em>must </em>be heard upon a plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-9\">It is true, as Kibert points out, that we did say in <em>Hobson </em>v. <em>Youell, supra, </em>177 Va. at 915, 15 S.E.2d at 79, that \u201c[o]n a plea of guilty, the accused and the Commonwealth are entitled to the independent judgment of the court upon the degree of his guilt and the punishment to be inflicted.\u201d This statement was made, however, immediately after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>we had recited that in <em>Dixon </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>161 Va. 1098, 172 S.E. 277 (1934), we had held it \u201creversible error for the trial court to impanel a jury to determine the extent of the punishment in a case in which the prisoner had pleaded guilty to an indictment charging a capital offense.\u201d Kibert, therefore, reads the \u201cindependent judgment\u201d statement out of context. The really pertinent statement in <em>Hobson </em>is this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-5\">\u201cWhile generally no evidence of guilt is required in order to proceed to judgment [upon a plea of guilty], for accused has himself supplied the necessary proof, yet in a proper case evidence <em>may </em>be heard as to the aggravation or mitigation of the offense.\u201d 177 Va. at 912-13, 15 S.E.2d at 78 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">In this context, \u201cmay\u201d denotes discretion, not direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">Kibert also misconstrues our holding in <em>Smyth </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>200 Va. 728, 734, 107 S.E.2d 430, 434-35 (1959). <em>Smyth </em>holds merely that a trial court has power, in its discretion, to hear evidence upon a plea of guilty and to convict the accused of a lesser offense. Neither <em>Smyth, </em>nor any other decision of this court, nor any provision of Virginia constitutional and statutory law requires the introduction of evidence to sustain a conviction based upon a plea of guilty in a criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">For the reasons assigned, the judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
