Thomas was awarded a divorce <em>a mensa et thoro </em>from her husband, Edwin Lamar Thomas, on the grounds of desertion. The decree provided \u201cthat the Stipulation Agreement entered into by the parties is hereby ratified and affirmed and made a part of this Decree.\u201d Under that agreement, the husband promised to pay the wife $200 per month \u201cas alimony\u201d and to convey the marital home to her. The parties mutually covenanted to release \u201call curtesy and/or dower interests\u201d. They expressly agreed that their contract would be \u201csubmitted to the Court. . . and made a part of any decree which may be entered in this matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>Upon the husband\u2019s petition, the chancellor entered a decree on December 27, 1972, which provided \u201cthat the decree of divorce a mensa et thoro ... be and hereby is merged into a decree of divorce a vinculo matrimonii\u201d. In that decree, the chancellor also found that the stipulation agreement \u201cappears fair and equitable\u201d and ordered \u201cthat said agreement be ... incorporated into and made a part of this Decree insofar as it relates to the real property rights created by this marriage.\u201d The record reflects no objection to the stipulation agreement by either party before entry of the two decrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">The husband made alimony payments regularly until December, 1974. When he missed the payment for that month, the wife petitioned for an order to show cause why he should not be punished for contempt of court. At the contempt hearing, the husband asserted that the <em>a vincula </em>decree did not obligate him to pay alimony because that decree incorporated the stipulation agreement only insofar as it related to real property rights. By final order entered March 27, 1975, the chancellor found that \u201cthe stipulation agreement . . . was ratified and affirmed and made a part\u201d of the <em>a memo, </em>decree and \u201c[therefore . . . that nothwithstanding the provisions of the decree a vinculo matrimonii, the Defendant remains to be obligated for the payment of alimony as provided in the said stipulation agreement.\u201d Upon these findings, he ordered the husband to pay the wife $200 per month \u201cas alimony as provided in the Stipulation Agreement . . . [and] all arrearages acruing [sic] for his failure to comply with the Stipulation Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">Citing <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>202 Va. 849, 120 S.E.2d 385 (1961), the husband argues that the chancellor had no jurisdiction to enter the March 27, 1975, order granting alimony, because he says the <em>a vinculo </em>decree excluded alimony and contained no reservation of power to re-open the case and modify the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">The dispositive question, then, is whether the <em>a vinculo </em>decree obligated the husband to pay alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">Under Code \u00a7 20-109 (Cum. Supp. 1972), the courts are authorized to modify alimony obligations prospectively. Their authority, however, is expressly limited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-9\">\u201c. . . if a stipulation or contract signed by the party to whom such relief might otherwise be awarded is filed with the pleadings or depositions, then no decree or order directing the payment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>alimony,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> suit money, or counsel fee shall be entered except in accordance with that stipulation or contract unless such party raise objection thereto prior to entry of the decree. . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">When a stipulation agreement is filed and no objection is raised, \u201c\u00a7 20-109 restricts the court\u2019s jurisdiction over awarding \u2018alimony, suit money, or counsel fee\u2019 to the terms of the contract.\u201d <em>McLoughlin </em>v. <em>McLoughlin, </em>211 Va. 365, 368, 177 S.E.2d 781, 783 (1970). A decree which, under such circumstances, expressly adjudicates an elimination of alimony is an \u201c \u2018order directing the payment of alimony\u2019 within the meaning of the proviso in Code \u00a7 20-109\u201d. <em>Dienhart </em>v. <em>Dienhart, </em>210 Va. 101, 103, 168 S.E.2d 279, 281 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">Here, the <em>a vinculo </em>decree provided that the parties\u2019 contract, which had been filed with the depositions and not objected to, be incorporated only \u201cinsofar as it relates to . . . real property rights\u201d. We are of opinion that this provision was an adjudication eliminating the alimony to which the parties had agreed; that it was an adjudication within the intendment of the statutory proviso; and that it was, therefore, an adjudication beyond the jurisdiction of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-9\">In light of the rule in <em>Perry, </em>we consider whether the <em>a vinculo </em>decree obligated the husband to pay alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-10\">Where, as here, an <em>a mensa </em>decree is merged into an <em>a vinculo </em>decree, the latter subsumes the former; the <em>a mema </em>decree loses its separate identity, and all of its provisions not lawfully modified by the trial court assume the integrated identity of the <em>a vinculo </em>decree. The husband contends that the provision in the <em>a mensa </em>decree incorporating the stipulation agreement was modified in the <em>a vinculo </em>decree to exclude the obligation to pay alimony. But, as we have said, under the statutory proviso the chancellor was without jurisdiction to make such a modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-11\">We hold that the <em>a vinculo </em>decree obligated the husband to pay alimony and that the March 27, 1975, order did not violate the rule in <em>Perry.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b879-12\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b879-15\"> By the 1975 amendment, \u201calimony\u201d was changed to \u201csupport and maintenance for the spouse\u201d Ch. 644, Acts of Assembly (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b879-13\">I\u2019Anson, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AeU\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-14\">The final <em>a vinculo </em>decree expressly stated that the stipulation agreement between the parties dated September 26, 1972, was incorporated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>into and made a part of the decree only \u201cinsofar as it relate[d] to the real property rights created by this marriage.\u201d Thus, that decree specifically eliminated the provisions for the payment of alimony in the agreement and the <em>a mensa </em>decree. See Code \u00a7 20-121. This decree, to which the wife raised no objection, became final twenty-one days after its entry, Rule 1:1, even if erroneously entered contrary to the provisions of Code \u00a7 20-109. The final decree could not be modified so as to enforce husband\u2019s obligation to pay alimony in the subsequent contempt proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">I would reverse this case and hold that the chancellor could not modify the final decree which was no longer under his control. The wife\u2019s remedy, if any, should be confined to an action at law upon the contract between the parties.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
