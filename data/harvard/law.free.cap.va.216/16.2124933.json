The offense occurred on January 30, 1974, on Interstate Highway Route 81 in Smyth County. The summons charged the defendant with travelling 70 miles per hour in a \u201c55 zone\u201d in violation of Code \u00a7 46.1-193.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The defendant admits that he was driving at a speed of 70 miles per hour at the time and place in question and that appropriate highway signs had been posted near the scene of the offense showing a maximum speed limit of 55 miles per hour. He contends, however, that the conviction was erroneous because the speed limit, established by legislative enactment, had not been lawfully changed by this executive order. He argues that the Governor did not possess the power on November 26, 1973, to declare a State disaster to exist because of a shortage of motor vehicle fuel. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">The Governor acted during an acute fuel shortage<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> pursuant to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>provisions of the \u201cCommonwealth of Virginia Emergency Services and Disaster Law of 1973.\u201d Acts 1973, c. 260.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">This legislation (hereinafter The Act) was codified in Chapter 3.2 of Title 44 of the Code (Cum. Supp. 1973). The portions pertinent to this litigation stated certain findings of the General Assembly,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> established certain definitions,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and gave certain powers to the Gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>ernor.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Among the powers conferred was the authority to declare a State disaster to exist whenever, <em>in the Governor\u2019s opinion, </em>the safety and welfare of the people of the State requires the exercise of emergency measures.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The crux of the defendant\u2019s argument is that a motor vehicle fuel shortage was not such a \u201cdisaster\u201d as was contemplated by The Act, and, therefore, the Governor\u2019s action was beyond the scope of the powers delegated to him in The Act. We reject this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Our examination of the language of The Act convinces us that the Governor acted within the limits of the authority delegated to him. It is elementary that the health, safety and welfare of the people of this Commonwealth depend upon an adequate supply of motor vehicle fuel. The fuel shortages which developed in 1973 created a potentially serious situation in Virginia, and nationwide. Curtailment of the vital services performed by use of fire, police and other emergency vehicles is but one example of the grave effect a prolonged motor vehicle fuel shortage would have upon the State. Such a situation would have resulted \u201cin damage, hardship, suffering or possible loss of life.\u201d Code \u00a7 44-146.16(1), note 5 <em>supra. </em>Prompt action was required. Manifestly, the \u201csafety and welfare of the people of the State require[d] the exercise of emergency measures.\u201d Code \u00a7 44-146.17(7), note 6 <em>supra. </em>We, therefore, hold that the acute motor vehicle fuel shortage of 1973 was a \u201cdisaster\u201d within the meaning of The Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>The defendant attempts to buttress his argument that an acute energy shortage was beyond the scope of the 1973 Act by pointing to subsequent amendments to the legislation. After the commission of the offense giving rise to the conviction in this case, the 1974 General Assembly amended The Act<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> by adding new provisions. For example, within the \u201cfindings\u201d section, it was declared that preservation of \u201cthe economic well-being\u201d of the people of the State was a purpose of The Act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A \u201cresources shortage\u201d was included among the \u201cdisasters\u201d listed in The Act.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant contends that by making these amendments, the legislature intended to change the law in force at the time of this offense, which, he says, had not previously recognized the shortage of fuel as one of the \u201cdisasters\u201d defined in The Act. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">It is true, as the defendant argues, that in the field of statutory construction, a presumption normally arises that a change in law was intended when new provisions are added to prior legislation by an amendatory act. <em>Richmond </em>v. <em>Sutherland, </em>114 Va. 688, 693, 77 S.E. 470, 472 (1913). But that rule is not controlling here. There were inconsistent decisions in the trial courts of the Commonwealth, on the issue presented in this case, under the 1973 Act, according to a representation in the defendant\u2019s brief. The amendments, by emergency legislation, followed passage of the 1973 Act within a year. Accordingly, we hold that the amendments to The Act pertinent to this litigation were changes of form, which merely interpreted the 1973 Act and made it more detailed and specific. They were not changes of substance, which add rights to, or withdraw existing rights from, an original act. <em>See </em>1A <em>Sutherland Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 22.30 at 179 (4th ed. C. Sands 1972). When amendments are enacted soon after controversies arise \u201cas to the interpretation of the original act, it is logical to regard the amendment as a legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>interpretation of the original act\u2014a formal change\u2014rebutting the presumption of substantial change.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 22.31 at 184.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">For these reasons, the judgment of conviction is</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b153-8\"> The executive order of former Governor Holton provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">\u201cEXECUTIVE ORDER NUMBER THIRTY-SIX</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">I. \u201cBy virtue of the authority vested in me by Section 44-146.17(7) of the Code of Virginia (1950), as amended, I declare a state disaster to exist because of the shortage of motor vehicle fuel.
