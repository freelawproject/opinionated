Kincaid filed his claim with the Industrial Commission of Virginia within one year from the date that a diagnosis was first communicated to him that he had sustained a loss of hearing. It is admitted that he sustained the loss as a result of excessive noise encountered during the course of his employment by Clinchfield Coal Company. Kincaid\u2019s application for a hearing was filed with the Industrial Commission on March 8, 1974, and in it he gave April 1, 1973, as the date of accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-17\">In an opinion by Commissioner Evans it is stated that: \u201cClaimant noticed a diminution in his hearing ability and underwent medical examinations during January and March of 1973. On April 1, 1973, he was advised that he had a hearing loss which, in the opinion of the attending physician, was attributable to the noise encountered in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>his employment.\u201d An award was entered by the Commission on behalf of Kincaid, and it was affirmed on review by the full Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The record in this case consists of Kincaid\u2019s application for a hearing, his testimony, a letter from Dr. Nelson E. Lake, and a report of an audiological. and hearing aid evaluation. Kincaid testified that he noticed a loss of hearing \u201clast February, I believe it was, in \u201973\u201d. He said that he first went to see Dr. W. A. Davis, of Dante, Virginia, who referred him to Drs. Crockett and Link, otolaryngology specialists in Bristol, Tennessee. He said that Dr. Crockett examined him \u201caround the last of February of \u201973; around the 27th, I believe it was, if I\u2019m not mistaken\u201d; that Dr. Crockett told him that he had over 40% loss of hearing; and that he was then referred to William F. Overbey, clinical audiologist at the Bristol Regional Speech and Hearing Center. Kincaid said that Overbey ran him \u201cthrough the same tests as Dr. Crockett. ... he told me about the same thing . . .\u201d and fitted him with a hearing aid. Overbey\u2019s report of his audiological and hearing aid evaluation of Kincaid is dated March 5, 1973, and states that the evaluation was done on March 1, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Dr. Link wrote that he saw Kincaid on January 30, 1973, \u201cfor the chief complaint of being hard of hearing. . . . and it was my opinion that his hearing difficulty was noise induced\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">A careful search of the record fails to substantiate the finding of fact by the Commission that it was on April 1, 1973, that Kincaid was first advised that he had a hearing loss. There is no evidence that Kincaid was seen or examined by anyone after his March 1, 1973 examination by Overbey at the Center. No satisfactory explanation has been given why April 1, 1973, was reported by Kincaid as the date of the accident. Whether we accept Dr. Link\u2019s date of January 30, 1973, or Kincaid\u2019s recollection of an examination by Dr. Crockett in February, 1973, it is clear that the occupational loss of hearing was diagnosed by one of these physicians prior to March 1, 1973, and that Kincaid was so advised. Further, the record is also clear that after the diagnosis was made by physicians and when Kincaid was seen at the Center on March 1, 1973, a hearing aid was prescribed for him and arrangements were made for the aid to be ordered and fitted. Copies of Overbey\u2019s March 5, 1973 report were sent to Dr. Link, Dr. Davis and Kincaid\u2019s union representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">Under the Virginia Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, the right to compensation for an occupational disease such as a hearing loss is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>forever barred unless a claim be filed with the Industrial Commission within one year after a diagnosis thereof is first communicated to the employee. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 65.1-52 and 65.1-56 (17). The requirement that such a claim be filed within the statutory period is jurisdictional and the burden is upon a claimant to prove that he has complied with the statute. <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Clinchfield Coal Co., </em>214 Va. 674, 204 S.E.2d 257 (1974). <em>See also Coal Company </em>v. <em>Pannell, </em>203 Va. 49, 122 S.E.2d 666 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Accordingly, for failure on the part of Kincaid to establish that his claim was timely filed, the award entered by the Commission will be vacated and his application dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
