T-R-K is a joint venture organized in October, 1971, to bid upon and, if its bid were successful, to perform the contract to be awarded by the Virginia Department of Highways for the construction in the City of Hampton (City) of part of a bridge-tunnel complex crossing Hampton Roads. T-R-K\u2019s bid of $47,610,000 was accepted and, on November 12, 1971, it was awarded the contract. T-R-K began to perform the contract in 1971 and continued its work until completion of the project in 1974. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>December, 1971, T-R-K paid a contractor\u2019s license tax for 1971 of $71,450 assessed by the City. The tax was based upon the full contract price agreed upon between T-R-K and the Virginia Department of Highways.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">Although the express terms of the joint venture agreement restricted T-R-K to the performance of the bridge-tunnel contract alone, in January, 1972, T-R-K was again assessed by the City with a contractor\u2019s license tax of $71,450 for the year 1972. The tax imposed by this assessment, based upon the full agreed price under the bridge-tunnel contract, was paid under protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">After hearing the case upon stipulations and upon the <em>ore terms </em>testimony of the Commissioner of the Revenue and a representative of the joint venture, the trial court found, and the uncontradicted evidence shows, that T-R-K- did not enter into or accept any contracts or orders for work during the year 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">The narrow issue for decision here is whether the trial court erred in holding that the 1972 license tax assessment against T-R-K was authorized by \u00a7 22-16 of the Hampton City Code (City Code).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">The ordinance imposing the tax in question is \u00a7 22-54 of the City Code which imposes a license tax upon general contractors <em>i.e., </em>\u201c[ejvery person who accepts. .. orders or contracts for doing work\u201d in specified types of construction. The tax is based and computed upon the \u201cgross orders and contracts\u201d made and accepted by the general contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">The trial court found, and the City here contends, that the City can validly impose the license tax for <em>1972 </em>upon T-R-K under \u00a7 22-16 of the City Code which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-9\">\u201cThe license tax of any person who was licensed at a definite place of business for only a part of the next preceding license year shall be computed for the then current license year on the basis of an estimate of the amount of gross receipts, gross sales or gross purchases which the licensee will make throughout the then current license year; provided, however, that any contractor, commission merchant or wholesale merchandise broker shall be licensed on the basis of gross contracts or orders or gross commissions of the next preceding license year or any parts thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">The license tax under consideration is not imposed upon the performance of work or when that work is performed. The business or activity required to be licensed is the acceptance of \u201corders or con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>tracts for doing work\u201d during the license year. Since T-R-K was not engaged in the acceptance of \u201corders or contracts for doing work\u201d during 1972, no license was required and the assessment cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">We, therefore, reverse and will enter a decree here requiring the City Treasurer to refund to T-R-K the sum of $71,450, the amount heretofore paid by it under the erroneous assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">\n<em>Reversed and final decree.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
