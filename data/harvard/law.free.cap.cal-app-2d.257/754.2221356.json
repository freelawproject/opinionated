J.</author>\n<p id=\"AtO\">On July 14, 1964, the District Attorney of Los Angeles County filed a four-count information against petitioner. He was charged with assault with a deadly weapon (Pen. Code, \u00a7 245), assault with intent to commit murder (Pen. Code, \u00a7 217), robbery (Pen. Code, \u00a7 211) and kidnaping for the purpose of robbery (Pen. Code, \u00a7209). With respect to the violation of section 209 of the Penal Code it was charged that the victim was subjected to bodily harm, which made it a capital offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">On July 24,1964, petitioner, represented by private counsel, pleaded \u201cnot guilty.\u201d On August 3, 1964, while still represented by private counsel, he withdrew his plea of \u201cnot guilty\u201d to count I and the charge of assault with a deadly weapon and pleaded guilty to that count.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">The matter was then continued to September 18 and a probation report was ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">On September 18 defendant appeared without counsel. The court first announced that the matter would be continued to September 25 at the request of the probation officer. Defendant then presented a petition for a writ of habeas corpus to the court. It was prepared by himself. He explained that he had relieved his private counsel. The court then appointed Mr. Powell of the Public Defender\u2019s office to represent petitioner. The petition for a writ of habeas corpus was denied \u201cwithout prejudice. \u2019 \u2019 Mr. Powell was advised that he could renew it if he so desired.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-10\">On September 25 Mr. Powell and petitioner appeared together. Mr. Powell informed the court that he and petitioner had been unable to \u201cget together on procedures for the future\u201d and that petitioner no longer desired his services. He asked to be relieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-11\">Petitioner agreed with Mr. Powell\u2019s statements. The following colloquy ensued between him and the court: \u201cThe Court : You are aware that you are entitled to have an attorney-The Dependant: If I am entitled, I would like to have the Court appoint attorney. The Court: You cannot have an attorney appointed by the Court. You can have an attorney of your own choice if you have the funds. The Dependant: I have a writ of habeas corpus. The Court\": Is that the same writ you had the last time? The Dependant: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>Y.es, it is, your Honor. Me. Powell : Does your Honor relieve the Public Defender? The Coubt : Yes, you are relieved. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">From that point on defendant represented himself. He waived arraignment for judgment. Judgment was pronounced and he was sentenced to state prison for the term prescribed by law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The record shows no disposition of counts II, III and IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">On July 5, 1967, petitioner filed a petitition for a writ of habeas corpus with this court. <em>Inter alia </em>he claims that he did not intelligently waive his right to counsel on September 25. We agree.  No one, of course, disputes that petitioner was entitled to be represented by counsel at the time of the pronouncement of judgment, unless he intelligently waived that right. <em>(In re Perez, </em>65 Cal.2d 224, 228-231 [53 Cal.Rptr. 414, 418 P.2d 6].) The reasons why the assistance of counsel at the time of the pronouncement of judgment is a vital right are fully articulated in <em>Perez </em>and the cases cited therein. They need not be repeated here.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">It is plain that petitioner was permitted to represent himself although the court made no attempt whatever to determine whether his apparent waiver of counsel was intelli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>gently and understandingly made. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>66 Cal.2d 666, 671-673 [58 Cal.Rptr. 614, 427 P.2d 214]; <em>In re Johnson, </em>62 Cal.2d 325, 333-334 [42 Cal.Rptr. 228, 398 P.2d 420].)</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">Respondent relies on <em>People </em>v. <em>Ferry, </em>237 Cal.App.2d 880, 890 [47 Cal.Rptr. 324], for the proposition that conduct can constitute waiver. \u2019 \u2019 <em>Ferry </em>relies principally on <em>In re Jingles, </em>27 Cal.2d 496, 499 [165 P.2d 12], concerning which ease the Supreme Court said in <em>Johnson: \u2018 \u2018 </em>The issue, however, is not as simple today as it may have been nearly two decades ago when <em>Jingles </em>was decided.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>p. 333.)</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">Of course the deputy public defender had asked to be relieved and petitioner had concurred in the request. If this joint request had had the effect of forcing the court to relieve the public defender then it would follow that where it appears later that the defendant cannot make an intelligent waiver of his right to counsel, the court must either go on appointing until it finds one who will proceed as defendant wants him to or it must proceed unconstitutionally. That the former course of action\u2014successive appointments\u2014is not required is well established. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Norman, </em>252 Cal.App.2d 381, 399, 401 [60 Cal.Rptr. 609].) The latter course is unthinkable.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">The solution to the dilemma is very simply that the court was under no obligation to relieve the public defender simply because he and petitioner disagreed on strategy. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>240 Cal.App.2d 1, 5 [50 Cal.Rptr. <em>26]; People </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>186 Cal.App.2d 307, 315-316 [8 Cal.Rptr. 849].)</p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">\u201c [T]here is no constitutional right to an attorney who will conduct the defense of the case in accordance with an indigent defendant\u2019s whims. \u2019 \u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Naltor, </em>240 Cal.App.2d 489, 494 [49 Cal.Rptr. 616]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Mattson, </em>51 Cal.2d 777, 793 [336 P.2d 937] ; <em>In re Atchley, </em>48 Cal.2d 408, 418-419 [310 P.2d 15].)</p>\n<p id=\"b779-10\">We must therefore grant the writ for the sole purpose of appointing counsel\u2014or accepting an understanding and intelligent waiver of such appointment\u2014prior to the pronouncement of judgment. The record before us shows no defect in the adjudication of guilt. Petitioner has informed his counsel that a reference before this court would disclose such defects. Counsel correctly point out that when the matter comes up again in the superior court any defect in the adjudication of guilt serious enough to cause the vacation of that adjudication would be an ample basis for permitting petitioner to withdraw his plea of guilty under section 1018 of the Penal Code. It is \"of course\" far preferable that any factual controversies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>concerning petitioner\u2019s alleged grounds be resolved in the superior court than before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">Counts II, III and IV should be dismissed. With respect to these counts petitioner\u2019s right to a speedy trial has obviously been violated. <em>(Klopfer </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>386 U.S. 213 [18 L.Ed.2d 1, 87 S.Ct. 988]; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 13; Pen. Code, \u00a7 1382, subd. 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">The proceedings of September 25, 1964, are vacated. Petitioner is discharged from the custody of H. V. Fields, Superintendent, California Mens Colony, Los Padres, California, and committed to the custody of the Sheriff of Los Angeles County with directions that counts II, III and IV be dismissed, that petitioner be permitted to move to withdraw his plea of guilty to count I, if so advised, and that he be arraigned for judgment and that judgment be pronounced if such motion is not made or, if made, is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">Hufstedler, J., and McCoy, J. pro tem.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b778-8\">On August 31, 1964, it had been stipulated \u201cthat the Court may determine the validity of [two prior felonies charged against petitioner] at the time of probation and sentence by any information furnished the Court by either [petitioner\u2019s privately retained counsel] or the District Attorney\u2019s office or the Probation Department.\u201d The reporter\u2019s transcript of the proceedings of September 18 and September 25 does not show that the court ever made such a determination, yet the written judgment contains the following recital: \u201c. . . second prior conviction having been found true as alleged, to wit: Rape and Robbery, felonies, Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles, November 25, 1946 and served a term in the State Prison, first prior conviction having been found not true. \u2019 \u2019 Petitioner appealed from the judgment. The record was prepared and filed with this court. Counsel was appointed, but on June 9, 1965, petitioner personally wrote a letter to the court abandoning the appeal. It was dismissed. Petitioner\u2019s present counsel questions the validity of that dismissal. The point is not really before us. If petitioner revives the appeal in spite of the outcome of the present proceeding, he should request of the division which dismissed the appeal that the remittitur be recalled.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b778-9\">There was an additional reason present in the case at bar. Petitioner had pleaded guilty on August 31, 1964, the day our Supreme Court filed the first <em>Dorado </em>[62 Cal.2d 338 (42 Cal.Rptr. 169, 398 P.2d 361) ] opinion. The preliminary transcript shows that after petitioner\u2019s arrest the police elicited a confession from him. He had not been warned of any of his rights. Defendant had confessed the robbery and kidnapping. He had denied being armed. The confession lent support to the prosecution\u2019s theory that he inflicted bodily injury on the victim. Although a rehearing in <em>Dorado </em>was granted on September 24, no one can say that defense counsel\u2019s probable ignorance of the first <em>Dorado </em>decision on August'31 might not have been an adequate basis for a successful motion to withdraw the plea of guilty.

Code, \u00a7 1018.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b780-8\">Re tired judge of the superior court sitting under assignment by the Chairman of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
