In the preliminary hearing, Officer Romero testified that he was on patrol duty on January 7, 1967, at about 3 :50 p.m. eastbound in the 1900 block of Pennsylvania Street, Los Angeles, when he saw defendant eastbound on the south side of the street. The officer saw the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>defendant glance in the direction of the police car and then throw a brown paper sack to the curb. The officer stopped the police ear to question defendant and to ask him what it was that was thrown. The answer of defendant to the officer\u2019s question was \u201cNothing.\u201d The officer and the defendant then walked back to the sack, opened it and found it contained loose material and a cigarette, resembling marijuana. The cigarette was still warm. There was a stipulation which established the narcotic character of the contents of the sack.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">The officer placed defendant under arrest for possessing marijuana after he had inspected the contents of the sack. The officer testified that he stopped people who made such \u201cfurtive actions\u201d under the circumstances\u2014stating further that the defendant had looked quickly in the direction of the officer and police car which was going only about five miles per hour, and then had hurriedly thrown the sack to the curb.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">We are persuaded that there was nothing illegal or unreasonable in the conduct of the officer. While patrolling he saw defendant take the action which he took\u2014the officer then stopped his patrol ear and got out and recovered the sack with the marijuana in it. The sack was in open, plain view for anyone to see. The defendant had had possession of it only a moment before and upon seeing the police abandoned his contraband in a hurry. The abandonment by defendant was not occasioned by some threatened law violation by the officer such as occurred in <em>Gascon </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>169 Cal.App.2d 356 [337 P.2d 201] or any threatened invasion of any constitutional rights. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Stout, </em>66 Cal.2d 184, 192 [57 Cal.Rptr. 152, 424 P.2d 704].)</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">There were no infringements of defendant\u2019s constitutional rights\u2014every action of the officer was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">The order is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">Wood, P. J., and Lillie, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
