J.</author>\n<p id=\"AS4\">On December 29, 1966, the District Attorney of Ventura County filed a complaint against respondent charging him with violations of sections 11500, 11500.5, 11530 and 11530.5 of the Health and Safety Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-13\">We take our summary of the facts which were adduced at the preliminary hearing from defendant\u2019s brief: \u201cAt 5:00 p.m. on December 6, 1966, five officers went to defendant Adolph Castro\u2019s residence in Ventura. The officers were James Burgess, a Detective Sergeant for the Ventura County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>Sheriff\u2019s Department; John Thompson, a State Bureau of Narcotics agent; Detective Bowen, of the Oxnard Police Department; Detective Taylor, of the Sheriff\u2019s Department; and Detective Hurly, of the Oxnard Police Department. Detective Bowen \u2018had information that there was a large quantity of narcotics at the residence at 106 Sunny Way, including heroin, marijuana and some dangerous drugs.\u2019 The purpose of their visit was \u2018to pick up some narcotics.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">\u201c106 Sunny Way is a single dwelling. Detective Burgess knocked and defendant Castro came to the door. There was an elderly lady inside the house, and three or four small children. Detective Burgess identified himself \u2018and his compatriots, \u2019 showed defendant a form of identification, and asked him to \u2018please step outside, I would like to talk to him.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">\u201cDefendant came outside the house, stepped off the porch and stood on a walk with Detective Burgess and Detective Bowen. Burgess thereupon \u2018advised defendant that I was there on a follow-up from a previous arrest of Benny Castro,\u2019 defendant\u2019s nephew, and that \u2018there was a reason to believe there was narcotics at the residence.\u2019 Burgess said:</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">\u201c \u2018I advised the defendant that I had reason to believe that there were narcotics on the premises. I then asked the defendant if there were any narcotics in the residence or in the house and he stated to me that there wasn\u2019t. I then asked him if there were any narcotics on the premises. He again stated that there wasn't. . . .\u2019 That was not all Detective Burgess said.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">\u201c \u2018I told him that we had reason to believe that there were narcotics on the premises. At that time I didn\u2019t know who they belonged to, but <em>that we might as well clear up the matter at this time. </em>\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">\u201cAfter a \u2018slight delay,' defendant advised Detective Burgess to come on and follow him. Defendant took the officers to a shed at the back of the premises, opened the garbage can, took out a paper sack, and handed it to Agent Thompson. Thompson examined it, and Burgess asked, \u2018Isn\u2019t there any marijuana?\u2019 Defendant said \u2018Maybe there is another sack in here\u2019 and took out another sack which he gave to Thompson.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">\u2018 \u2018 The two sacks were found to contain heroin, seconal, marijuana and benzedrine. Defendant was arrested on December 21,1966.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-11\">At the preliminary hearing there was no objection of any kind to the admission of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>' 'After defendant was bound over on all four counts and the information filed in the superior court, a motion to dismiss under section 995 of the Penal Code was granted. The specific basis for the granting of the motion was that defendant\u2019s helpfulness amounted to \u201cassertive conduct,\u201d that he was in custody and that he had not been advised of his constitutional rights. The superior court also found that, the question of the violation of defendant\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights aside, there was sufficient evidence in the record that he should stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">The question whether the evidence discloses a consent search, as urged by the People, or a communication by defendant after he was placed in custody within the meaning of <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 [16 L.Ed.2d 694, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 10 A.L.R.3d 974] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Arnold, </em>66 Cal.2d 438, 446-447 [58 Cal.Rptr. 115, 426 P.2d 515] and <em>People </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>66 Cal.2d 232, 246 [57 Cal.Rptr. 363, 424 P.2d 947], is interesting but in view of the lack of an objection at the preliminary hearing not really before us.  The People point out that <em>Robison </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>49 Cal.2d 186 [316 P.2d 1] squarely holds that failure to object to illegally obtained evidence at a preliminary hearing allows the magistrate to consider such evidence. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Hyde, </em>51 Cal. 2d 152, 157 [331 P.2d 42].) Defendant argues that <em>Robison </em>involved a writ of prohibition after a 995 motion was denied. We do not see the difference. In <em>Robison </em>the question was whether the 995 motion was properly denied. In the case at bar we must decide whether it was properly granted. The criteria are the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">Defendant also argues that the problem is not his failure to object but the prosecution\u2019s failure to sustain its burden of showing that his <em>Miranda </em>rights were not violated. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Arnold, supra, </em>p. 448; <em>People </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>66 Cal.2d 175, 180-181 [57 Cal.Rptr. 130, 424 P.2d 682]; <em>Badillo </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>46 Cal.2d 269, 272 [294 P.2d 23].)</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">While it is perfectly true that in the area of coerced confessions the lack of an objection in the trial court does not preclude review on appeal <em>(People </em>v. <em>Matteson, </em>61 Cal.2d 466, 469 [39 Cal.Rptr. 1, 393 P.2d 161] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rand, </em>202 Cal.App.2d 668, 672-674 [21 Cal.Rptr. 89]), eases involving confessions obtained without compliance with the rules announced in <em>People </em>v. <em>Dorado, </em>62 Cal.2d 338 [42 Cal.Rptr. 169, 398 P.2d 361] have uniformly required an objection as a prerequisite for appellate consideration <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ray, 252 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>Cal.App.2d 932, 958 [61 Cal.Rptr. <em>1]; People </em>v. <em>Crooks, </em>250 Cal.App.2d 788, 793 [59 Cal.Rptr. 39]) although this requirement does not apply to trials before the date of the second <em>Dorado </em>decision on January 29, 1965. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Doherty, </em>67 Cal.2d 9,14-15 [59 Cal.Rptr. 857, 429 P.2d 177].)</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Although no ease involving a hearing after the <em>Miranda </em>decision has been cited to us, we see no reason why the rule should be different.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">The difference between the coerced confession eases and those involving a violation of <em>Dorado </em>and <em>Miranda </em>is undoubtedly due to two factors: first, the difference in the trustworthiness ;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and second, the fact that confessions obtained in violation of <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Dorado </em>are far less offensive to the underlying principles in the enforcement of our criminal laws. Were it otherwise, <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>384 U.S. 719 [16 L.Ed.2d 882, 86 S.Ct. 1772]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>65 Cal.2d 681 [56 Cal.Rptr. 293, 423 P.2d 221] and <em>In re Lopez, </em>62 Cal.2d 368 [42 Cal.Rptr. 188, 398 P.2d 380] could not have been written.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">The order setting aside the information is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">Hufstedler, J., and Stephens, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b668-9\">The preliminary hearing in the ease at bar took place on December 29, 1966, well after <em>Miranda.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b668-10\">We recognize, of course, that a coerced confession is inadmissible even if proved to be true. <em>(Rogers </em>v. <em>Richmond, </em>365 U.S. 534, 540-541 [5 L.Ed.2d 760, 766-767, 81 S.Ct. 735]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ditson, </em>57 Cal.2d 415, 440-441 [20 Cal.Rptr. 165, 369 P.2d 734]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Matlock, </em>51 Cal.2d 682, 697 [336 P.2d 505, 71 A.L.R.2d 6051.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
