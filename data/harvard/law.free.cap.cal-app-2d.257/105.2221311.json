McDaniel, as required by Division IV of said California Labor Code. The fact of said failure, neglect, and refusal on the part of said defendant to secure the payment of such compensation having been discovered by the Director of Industrial Relations on February 17, 1966 and not prior thereto. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">On May 18, 1967, the trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss \"upon the grounds of insufficiency of amended complaint,' \u2019 whereupon the People appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">On October 26, 1967, the appellate department of the superior court filed a memorandum opinion and judgment by which it modified the order dismissing the complaint to permit the People to file a further amended complaint conforming to the views set forth in its opinion. It certified the appeal to this court to settle a new and important question of law. We ordered the appeal transferred pursuant to rule 63 of the California Rules of Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">The order certifying the appeal states the question as follows: \"Labor Code \u00a7 3710.2 relevant to this case provides in part: 'Failure to secure the payment of compensation under this article is a misdemeanor. ... In any prosecution brought under . . . Sections . . . 3710.2 the statute of limitations shall not commence to run until the discovery by the director or his designated agents of the failure to secure the payment of compensation. . . .\u2019 When the accusatory pleading is filed more than one year (the normal statutory limitations period for misdemeanors) after commission of the offense, must the accusatory pleading set forth not only the date of discovery but also facts showing why in the exercise of due diligence the offense could not have been earlier discovered?\u201d The appellate department held that such facts must be so pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">In our opinion the decision of the appellate department is correct for the reasons stated in the opinion of Presiding Judge Aiso in which Judges Meyer and Whyte concurred. Wc accordingly adopt that opinion as our own. It reads as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-10\">\"The People appeal from a pretrial order dismissing their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>amended complaint following defendant\u2019s motion<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that it was insufficient to charge a violation of Labor Code \u00a7 3710.2, a misdemeanor. Section 3710.2 provides, <em>inter alia, </em>\u2018the statute of limitations shall not commence to run until the discovery ... of the failure to secure the payment of compensation. . . .\u2019<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Penal Code \u00a7 801 requires a complaint charging a misdemeanor to be filed within one year after commission of the offense.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-6\">\u201cThe original complaint by William D. Trussa, Deputy Labor Commissioner, executed on September 20, 1966, and filed the same date, charged defendant Doctor with a failure to secure compensation in violation of Labor Code \u00a7 3710.2 on or about March 23, 1965, which is more than 18 months prior to the date of filing. No date of discovery of the violation was pleaded. Certain collateral proceedings led to the filing of the amended complaint.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The amended complaint (undated) filed April 26, 1967, again charged defendant Doctor with a violation on or about March 23, 1965, and additionally averred that the violation was discovered \u2018on February 17, 1966 and not prior thereto. \u2019 Defendant moved for dismissal of the complaint upon grounds of insufficiency and the motion was granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-7\">\u201cAs we view the appeal, the serious question posed is whether when the violation is alleged to have been committed more than a full year prior to the filing of the complaint, in addition to alleging the date of discovery the People must further allege that in the exercise of reasonable or due diligence the violation could not have been earlier discovered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>\u201cThe People assert that <em>such </em>an allegation is not required. They further ask that if the ruling be adverse that they be granted the opportunity of filing a further amended complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-6\">\u201cRespondent (defendant) claims that Labor Code \u00a7 3710.2 is unconstitutional (a) in permitting an imprisonment for a debt, (b) setting up a special statute of limitations rule, and (e) in permitting the '[d]irector to determine in his sole discretion when the statute of limitations commences to run.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A61\">\u201cWe have concluded that grounds (a) and (b) urged by respondent lack merit, but that the People should plead and prove that in the exercise of due diligence the violation could not have been discovered at an earlier date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-7\">\u2018 \u2018 The gist of the offense charged under \u00a7 3710.2 is the \u2018failure to secure payment of compensation\u2019 as required by statute, not the failure to pay an indebtedness. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Barker </em>(1938) 29 Cal.App.2d Supp. 766, 769 [77 P.2d 371].) Failure to make payments in the context of workmen\u2019s compensation statutes has been held to constitute a \u2018ease of fraud\u2019 falling without the constitutional prohibition against imprisonment for a debt. (See, e.g., <em>In re Trombley </em>(1948) 31 Cal.2d 801, 810 [193 P.2d 734]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Neal C. Oester, Inc. </em>(1957) 154 Cal.App.2d Supp. 888 [316 P.2d 784].) It is too late in the day to unsettle such rulings. Furthermore, there are peculiar circumstances present justifying the Legislature\u2019s finding it necessary to make a special provision for the commencement of the statute of limitations for offenses occurring under Labor Code \u00a7\u00a7 3700 to 3710.2. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Barker </em>(1938) <em>supra, </em>29 Cal.App.2d Supp. 766, 773-774.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-9\">\u201cIn contrast to provisions such as Vehicle Code \u00a7 40000,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Labor Code \u00a7 3710.2 does not provide a specific final cut-off date when all prosecutions become barred. In <em>Klopfer </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>v. <em>North Carolina </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 213 [18 L.Ed.2d 1, 87 S.Ct. 988], the United States Supreme Court struck down, as violating the speedy trial and due process clauses<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of the federal Constitution, a statute which in effect gave the prosecutor an indefinite period of time to re-institute a prosecution of a misdemeanor. While Labor Code \u00a7 3710.2 relates to the time period for commencing an action and not to reinstating a misdemeanor prosecution, nevertheless the distinction does not, in our opinion, render inapplicable the constitutional principles applied in <em>Klopfer. </em>Absent a specific cut-off date, \u00a7 3710.2 should be construed together with the constitutional provisions safeguarding the defendant\u2019s rights. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Globe Grain &amp; Mill Co. </em>(1930) 211 Cal. 121, 127 [294 P. 3]; <em>Palermo </em>v. <em>Stockton Theatres, Inc. </em>(1948) 32 Cal.2d 53, 60-61 [195 P.2d 1].) A construction of the phrase \u2018the statute of limitations shall not commence to run until the discovery by the director or his designated agents\u2019 which would permit the Director of Industrial Relations or his agents to hold an indefinite threat of criminal prosecution over an employer, would run afoul of the principles enunciated in <em>Klopfer.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-5\">\u201cIn this connection, we remind ourselves that the bar of the statute of limitations in a criminal action is a matter going to jurisdiction rather than merely to remedy. <em>(People </em>v. <em>McGee </em>(1934) <em>supra, </em>1 Cal.2d 611, 613 <em>; In re Davis </em>(1936) 13 Cal.App.2d 109, 111 [56 P.2d 302]; 1 Witkin, Calif. Crimes (1963) , p. 224.)  \u2018 [A] prosecution within the statutory period specified is an essential element of the offense. \u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Geibel </em>(1949) 93 Cal.App.2d 147, 167 [208 P.2d 743].) A complaint which discloses a bar of the statute of limitations on its face fails to state a public offense. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rehman </em>(1964) 62 Cal.2d 135, 139 [41 Cal.Rptr. 457, 396 P.2d 913] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Holtzendorff </em>(1960) 177 Cal.App.2d 788, 792 [2 Cal.Rptr. 676].)  It is incumbent upon the prosecution to plead (see Witkin, Calif. Crim. Proc. (1963), p. 192 and cases there cited) and prove facts which prevent the statute of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>limitations from being -a bar (see 1 Within, Calif. Crimes (1963), pp. 225-226 and eases there cited).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-6\">\u201cAs noted earlier, violations of workmen\u2019s compensation laws have been equated to a \u2018case of fraud.\u2019 Code of Civ. Proc. \u00a7 338, subd. 4, governing the period of limitations for civil fraud actions, provides, \u2018 The cause of action in such ease not to be deemed to have accrued until the discovery, by the aggrieved party, of the facts constituting the fraud or mistake.\u2019 \u2018[T]he courts have read into the statute [Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 338, subcl. 4] a duty to exercise diligence to discover the facts. The rule is that the plaintiff must <em>plead and prove the facts </em>showing: (a) Lack of knowledge, (b) Lack of means of obtaining knowledge (in the exercise of reasonable diligence the facts could not have been discovered at an earlier date), (e) ITow and when he did actually discover the fraud or mistake.\u2019 <em>(Weir </em>v. <em>Snow </em>(1962) 210 Cal.App.2d 283, 292 [26 Cal.Rptr. 868].) (Accord: <em>Woodring </em>v. <em>Basso </em>(1961) 195 Cal.App.2d 459, 466-467 [15 Cal.Rptr. 805]; <em>Heifer </em>v. <em>Hubert </em>(1962) 208 Cal.App.2d 22, 26-27 [24 Cal.Rptr. 900].)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-7\">\u201cTo comport with the constitutional guarantees of speedy trial and due process enunciated in <em>Klopfer </em>v. <em>North Carolina </em>(1967) <em>supra, </em>386 U.S. 213 [18 L.Ed.2d 1], a duty to exercise due diligence in discovering the violation should be read into Labor Code \u00a7 3710.2, just as the courts have done to Code of Civ. Proc. \u00a7 338, subd. 4. This enjoins on law enforcement agencies nothing more than a regular performance of their duties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-8\">\u201cAbsent a statutory exception, enforcement agencies are required to exercise diligence in discovering the crime within a period calculated from the date of commission even where facts are not so readily discoverable by a third person. (See, c.g.. <em>People </em>v. <em>Kinard </em>(1910) 14 Cal.App. 283 [111 P. 504] (embezzlement) ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Geibel </em>(1949) <em>supra, </em>93 Cal.App.2d 347, 167 <em>(forgery); People </em>v. <em>Darling </em>(1964) 230 Cal.App. 2d 635 [41 Cal.Rptr. 219] (obtaining public monies under false pretenses [fraud]); <em>State </em>v. <em>Weiler </em>(1960) Sup. Ct. of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>Mo., Div. 1, 338 S.W.2d 878, 881 [fraud].) Even where there is a statute providing that concealment of a crime shall operate to toll the statute of limitations, it has been held that nondisclosure as opposed to active concealment fails to cause a tolling. <em>(State </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1937) 145 Kan. 792 [67 P.2d 515, 110 A.L.R. 998, 1000].) Difficulties in discovering violations may justify the statutory exception, but they do not excuse the exercise of reasonable or due diligence on the part of law enforcement officers to discover the violations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-5\">\u201cWe therefore hold that to state an offense under Labor Code \u00a7 3710.2 for a failure to secure payment of compensation occurring more than one full year prior to the filing of the complaint, the accusatory pleading must not only allege the date of discovery of the violation but further allege facts why the violation could not have been earlier discovered in the exercise of reasonable or due diligence. The People have represented in their brief that they are able to plead and prove an exercise of due diligence; the interests of justice dictate their being given an opportunity to do so. \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">For the reasons stated in the foregoing opinion the order dismissing the amended complaint is reversed with directions to the trial court to permit the People to file a further amended complaint conforming to the views herein set forth.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b128-14\"> The original complaint was filed September 20, 1966.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b130-8\"> \"It would have been preferable for a written demurrer under Penal Code \u00a7 1004, subd. 1 or 5, to have been interposed, but in view of Penal Code \u00a7 1012 and eases holding that a defendant can raise a jurisdictional issue, including a statute of limitations problem, at any time <em>(People </em>v. <em>McGee </em>(1934) 1 Cal.2d 611 [36 P.2d 378]; Witkin, Calif.
