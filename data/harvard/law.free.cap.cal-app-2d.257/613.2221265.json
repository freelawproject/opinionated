J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9k\">\u2014Petitioner James Stocker, without counsel, was convicted August 17, 1967, on his guilty plea of violation of Vehicle Code, section 14601 (driving while privilege to do so had been refused, suspended or revoked). The plea was entered in the Justice Court of the El Dorado Judicial District, County of El Dorado. The docket sheet of the justice court shows no waiver of the right to counsel. Stocker was sentenced to pay a fine of $289 or to be imprisoned in the county jail for 57 days. Since he was without funds he went to jail. Thereafter a petition for habeas corpus was presented to the superior court and a hearing was held. (The transcript of that hearing is before us.) Judge Johnson of the justice court testified thereat. After the hearing the writ was denied. On the petition to this court for a writ of habeas corpus we issued an order to show cause and also directed that Stocker be released pro tempore on his own recognizance. Our review of the record has convinced us Stocker made no intelligent waiver of counsel and was offered no fair opportunity to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">Before proceeding in a criminal matter the court has the obligation to determine \u201cwhether there had been a competent and intelligent waiver with a clear understanding of its nature and effect.\u201d <em>(In re Elsholz, </em>228 Cal.App.2d 192, 197 [39 Cal.Rptr. 356].)</p>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">\u201cMoreover, it is settled that \u2018The determination of whether there has been an intelligent waiver of the right to counsel must depend, in each case, <em>upon the particular facts and circumstances surrounding that case, </em>including the background, experience, and conduct of the accused.\u2019 (Italics added.) <em>(Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst </em>(1938) <em>supra, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464 [82 L.Ed. 1461, 1466, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 146 A.L.R. 357] ; accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Chesser </em>(1947) <em>supra, </em>29 Cal.2d 815, 822 [178 P.2d 761, 170 A.L.R. 246].)  Manifestly that determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>must be made <em>before </em>any plea \u2014 guilty or otherwise \u2014 is accepted by the trial court, or the right to counsel loses most of its meaning and effectiveness. The making of this determination in a timely fashion is therefore the \u2018serious and weighty responsibility\u2019 of the trial judge. <em>(Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst </em>(1938) <em>supra, </em>304 U.S. 458, 465 [82 L.Ed. 1461, 1467].)  As we said in <em>Chesser </em>(at pp. 821-822 of 29 Cal.2d), \u2018The fact that defendant pleaded guilty is not conclusive. ... In order for a trial judge to determine whether there has been a competent and intelligent waiver of counsel, he must first ascertain whether the defendant clearly understands the nature and effect of his waiver. \u2019 More particularly, \u2018 the court cannot accept a waiver of counsel from anyone accused of a serious public offense without first determining that he \u201cunderstands the nature of the charge, the elements of the offense, the pleas <em>and defenses </em>which may be available, <em>or the punishments which may be </em>exacted.\u201d \u2019 <em>(In re James </em>(1952) 38 Cal.2d 302, 313 [240 P.2d 596].)\u201d (Italics ours.) <em>(In re Johnson, </em>62 Cal.2d 325, 335 [42 Cal.Rptr. 228, 398 P.2d 420]; see also <em>In re Smiley, </em>66 Cal.2d 606 [58 Cal.Rptr. 579, 427 P.2d 179].)</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The facts in the record (which are principally those disclosed in the transcript of the hearing in the superior court) are unusual: A citation had been issued to Stocker for Vehicle Code violations involving mechanical defects of his automobile. On a citation for those offenses he had promised to appear before Judge Johnson on August 21, 1967. Stocker actually appeared on August 17. He bore with him evidence that the mechanical defects had been remedied. He had a temporary driver\u2019s license. In the meantime the judge had learned Stocker\u2019s right to operate an automobile had been suspended. This, it appears, was because he had not appeared as promised for a San Jose traffic violation. A complaint had issued out of Judge Johnson\u2019s court for the driving-during-suspension violation. (Veh. Code, \u00a7 14601, subd. (a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>) At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>some time\u2014the order of events is not clear\u2014the judge testified he took Stocker into his office. He said that he explained the section 14601, subdivision (a), charge. We quote his testimony from the record: \u201c <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> [A] s far as the records are concerned, you are wanted in San Jose for failure to answer your signed promise to appear.\u2019 He says, \u2018That has been taken care of, \u2019 but we had nothing to show that, and this was out\u2014Then he asked me\u2014His mother wasn\u2019t mentioned, but he stated, \u2018May I go out to the ear and talk to Mother ? \u2019 I said, \u2018Yes, Mr. Stocker, go out and talk to her.\u2019 He was gone a little bit, he come back in and he says, \u2018Mother has gone on home. I\u2019m ready to go to jail.\u2019 Q. Then did you issue a commitment? A. I issued a commitment and called the officer and he went to jail. . . . Q. He was confined pursuant to your commitment? A.-Uh huh. For fifty-seven days or $289.00 [Stocker had asserted he had no money], and thirty minutes after then, he must have known or somebody knew, Mr. Ligda [the public defender] called my secretary and demanded that he have a certified copy of the proceedings within one hour, and after then his mother called me, and I never took such a beating in my life. ...\u201d Judge Johnson was also informed by the mother that she had paid the fine for the San Jose violation \u201clast October or November.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Before that, according to the judge, there had been an arraignment for plea, a plea of guilty, an arraignment for sentence with waivers of time for pronouncing sentence, as well as the contested waiver of counsel, all before sentence was actually pronounced. Judge Johnson testified: \u201cFirst I went over the violations that he was charged with, which was 26453, defective emergency brake; 27150, defective exhaust system; 5200, no front license plate; and 1251 no valid license in possession. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">He stated he had told Stocker of the section 14601 violation. He also said he had read the complaint to Stocker, had informed him of his right to counsel, of his right to a court or jury trial if his plea was not guilty, that he could subpoena and cross-examine witnesses, that \u201che was allowed counsel at all times . . . and we had a Public Defender if he wanted me to appoint him. ...\u201d The judge also stated that Stocker volunteered that he was guilty. His testimony: \u201cI says, \u2018Do you wish to enter your plea at this time?\u2019 He says, \u2018Yes.\u2019 Then I went over each violation of the mechanically <em>[sic] </em>violations, and he answered \u2018 Guilty, \u2019 and the 14601 of the California Vehicle Code, his answer was \u2018 Guilty. \u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>Stocker\u2019s version differs. He testified that when he arrived Judge Johnson had been handed records by his secretary and thereupon started to explain to Stocker what he was charged with. Stocker testified: \u201c [S]ome of it wasn\u2019t clear because I never been served with anything, and he read me some of the charges, and he never said anything about what I could get or anything like that. He told me, he says, of my legal rights, and ... he asked me why I didn\u2019t take care of this ticket down in San Jose. I told him, I says, \u2018Well, I was in the service at the time ... I didn\u2019t have a chance. I sent my Mother the money to take care of the ticket. \u2019 \u2019 \u2019 He also said: \u201c [H]e never let me finish talking . . . and it kind of got me confused. ... I tried to explain why I pleaded guilty, and he wouldn\u2019t let me talk. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Stocker contended that when he was sentenced he thought it was for the San Jose charge\u2014the one for which he had sent money to his mother when he was overseas<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> so that his fine would be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">The foregoing is background. Although Stocker\u2019s testimony is positive that he thought he was pleading guilty to a charge brought against him in San Jose and was only pleading guilty because a fine he thought had been paid, had not been, and although Judge Johnson\u2019s testimony at least partially corroborates that, we do not rest our decision upon that.  We do base our decision upon the facts (1) that Stocker was never informed of lack of knowledge as a defense to a charge of driving with a right to drive suspended, (2) that he was never informed of the possible penalties following a guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">Regarding the first of these omissions, it is to be noted that a person is only guilty of a violation of section 14601, subdivision (a), when he has <em>knowledge </em>of the fact that his privilege of driving has been suspended. (See fn. 1.) There is <em>no </em>evidence in this record that defendant had such knowledge, or that the judge informed him lack of knowledge was a defense. All of the evidence is to the contrary.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>As the evidence first quoted above\u2014the judge\u2019s own testimony\u2014demonstrated, Stocker had expressly told him he did <em>not </em>know his right to drive had been suspended for the San Jose violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">As regards Judge Johnson\u2019s failure to explain the possible punishment for a violation of section 14601, subdivision (a), such failure was tacitly admitted: \u201cQ. Was there any discussion between yourself and the petitioner prior to his waiver of counsel as to what the consequences of a guilty plea might be, or what the punishment might be? A. I don\u2019t know as I did. I did tell him\u2014I says, \u2018Bach one of these carries a penalty of $59.00, these other violations. \u2019 Q. Did you explain that to him? A. I don\u2019t know that I did that thoroughly or not. I couldn\u2019t say.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">(The charges to which the judge referred were the so-called \u201cmechanically\u201d violations on which he was not sentenced.) He was asked on direct examination by the prosecuting attorney : \u201cYou did tell him what the essence of the 14601 charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>was, but you don\u2019t recall if you told him what the punishment for that section was?\u201d To this question the judge answered: \u201cI don\u2019t know as I did. I couldn\u2019t say, I wouldn\u2019t say.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">The offense for which Stocker was sentenced provides a maximum punishment for a first offense of six months in the county jail, and for a second offense, a year in the county jail. (See fn. 1.) We apply here the rule of <em>In re Johnson </em>(1965) <em>supra, </em>62 Cal.2d at page 335, followed in <em>In re Smiley </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 606, at page 621 [58 Cal.Rptr. 579, 427 P.2d 179] : \"[I] n cases involving serious misdemeanor charges the courts must make a reasonable and timely effort to determine whether the defendant understands his predicament\u201d before he can make an intelligent waiver of counsel. It seems obvious that on the record before us Stocker\u2019s waiver of counsel was made with no real understanding of his \"predicament. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">It is equally obvious he had not been informed of a substantial defense possibly available (lack of knowledge of the suspension of his license). <em>(In re James, </em>38 Cal.2d 302, 313 [240 P.2d 596]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1967) 252 Cal.App.2d 147, 155-157 [59 Cal.Rptr. 905].) Because of those omissions there was not a knowing and intelligent waiver of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">The writ is granted. Petitioner, now released on his own recognizance, shall be discharged, without prejudice to a valid proceeding on pending charges for violation of section 14601.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">Friedman, J., and Regan, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b639-9\"> Questioned by Public Defender Ligda he said: \u201cQ. [T]ou initially told me you recalled Judge Johnson sent you to jail for a ticket in San Jose? A. He told me that he was dropping the charges on the one that was up here, and that he was going to charge me with the other one down there. Q. Is that what you actually believed? A. Yes, sir.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b639-10\"> Stocker testified on cross-examination by the prosecuting attorney [Mr. Pinney] : \u2018 \u2018 Q.
