He appeals from the judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">On the morning of May 4, 1966, two undercover police officers parked their car adjacent to 522 East 59th Place. They inquired about purchasing narcotics. Defendant came over to the car. One of the officers asked defendant for five rolls of reds (seconal). Defendant told them he had no reds; that all he had was tuinal. The officer said he would take three rolls. Defendant then walked off. He returned about five minutes later and handed one of the officers three small foil-wrapped packages. Defendant was paid and the officers drove away. Inside the packages were red and blue capsules. The packages were initialed and booked at the property division of the police department. The contents of the capsules were chemically tested and found to be secobarbital. They were received in evidence without objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">Defendant was arrested on July 12,1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">In his testimony defendant denied any involvement. He indicated the first contact he had with the officers was when they arrested him on July 12th.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-11\">Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, the evidence is sufficient to uphold his conviction. Devoid of merit is the argument that the prosecution did not establish that the pills the officers purchased were the same pills which were introduced at the .trial. The testimony of the officers provided ample foundation for the introduction of this evidence. ' \u2022 '</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>[See fn. 2.] Defendant suggests the record fails to contain the required written stipulation permitting a judge pro tempore to preside at the preliminary hearing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The superior court file does contain such a stipulation. The record on appeal is augmented to include a certified copy of that stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">The argument is made by defendant that the more than two-month delay in arresting him was a violation of his constitutional rights. The testimony of the officers indicates the delay was occasioned because the officers were making \u201cbuys\u201d from other \u201cstreet hustlers.\u201d The record contains no showing that defendant was prejudiced by the delayed arrest. Under such circumstances his rights were not violated. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gilmore, 239 </em>Cal.App.2d 125, 129 [48 Cal.Rptr. 449].)</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Lastly, defendant contends he did not have adequate representation in the court below. To support this position, he points to the fact his trial counsel did not make a timely motion for new trial. After defendant was sentenced, his counsel, a deputy public defender, indicated he wished to make a late motion for new trial. The court permitted the motion (which was made \u201con all statutory grounds\u201d and submitted without argument), and then denied it. At the trial, the prosecution witnesses were vigorously and thoroughly cross-examined and some discrepancies in their testimony were elicited. There were no grounds for a new trial. No eom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>plaint was made by defendant in the trial court about his representation. No reason is shown for any complaint. The record shows he was well represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Files, P. J., and Kingsley, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b587-12\"> Defendant\u2019s notice of appeal recites that the appeal-is from the judgment and from the order denying his motion for new trial. The attempted appeal from the order must be dismissed since the order is nonappealable. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1237, subd. 1.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
