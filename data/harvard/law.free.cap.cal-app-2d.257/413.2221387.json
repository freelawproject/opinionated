Code) and possession of marijuana (\u00a7 11530, Health &amp; Saf. Code); he appeals from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-13\">Officer Burke assigned to narcotic detail had information from three separate confidential informants that one Cano, driving a green and white 1956 Buiek, was making deliveries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>of heroin around 8th and Magnolia. On April 5, 1965, he and Officers Northrup and Walker saw a green and white 1956 Buick parked one block west of the area in front of an apartment house on Westmoreland; it was registered to one Batista on Albany Street. He supplied the manager with a description of the person for whom he was looking, and it proved to be that of the person living in apartment 107; he then determined that the person who drove the Buick lived there. Shortly thereafter, the officer saw defendant and one Torres walk out of the apartment house and start to get into the Buick; he and Sergeant Walker approached defendant, identified themselves and asked his name. The officer asked if he had any narcotics on his person; defendant said he did not. Officer Burke then asked if he \u201ccould cheek him out\u201d and defendant said, \u201cYes, go ahead\u201d; he had defendant raise his hands and walk 25 feet away, patted him down and felt an object in his sweater pocket; he pulled the pocket open, saw inside a white paper bindle and removed it. The bindle contained heroin. Defendant was placed under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">After advising defendant of his constitutional rights, Officer Burke asked how much narcotic was in the package and defendant answered, \u201cAbout a spoon\u201d; asked if there was any more back in the apartment defendant answered, \u201cYes, I have about two pieces in the apartment. ... You can go get it [if] you want to and I wilf take you there \u2019 \u2019; asked where it was, defendant said, \u201cIt is behind an ironing board cabinet in the kitchen.\u201d They went to the apartment and opened the door with the key taken from defendant. In the kitchen defendant removed from behind an ironing board a plastic bag in which were 17 balloons containing heroin, a small quantity of marijuana, a package of zigzag wheat straw papers, a handkerchief, a \u201chype outfit\u201d and a plastic vial containing 5 scored tablets. Officer Burke, an expert in the manner and means of sale of narcotics in Los Angeles County, was of the opinion that the narcotics were packaged for the purpose of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">Defendant testified that as he walked to his ear, he heard a commotion behind and two persons approached him; one held him and the other took a white bindle from his sweater pocket saying, \u201cI got it\u201d; he did not hear the words, \u201cPolice officer\u201d or anything, and no one said he wanted to talk with him; the officer did not ask what the bindle was or if it was his, did not open it or look at it and did not show it to him. He and Torres were handcuffed with their hands behind their backs and walked around the corner to a church; all the keys in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>pocket were removed by an officer who did not ask his permission and said nothing; they asked i\u00a3 they were keys to his apartment and he replied they were; Officer Burke said, \u2018 Let\u2019s go,\u201d and took them to his apartment; no one asked for permission or consent to enter; the apartment was already opened and the landlady and two officers were inside; the officer asked him where the rest of the \u201cstuff\u201d was and he showed it to them in the kitchen behind the ironing board. He told them that the balloons contained heroin and were his; actually, they were not his but he took the blame.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Appellant claims that the critical issue, a factual one, is his \u201calleged consent\u201d to the search; he concedes that if consent was given and it was voluntary, the evidence was properly admitted. Recognizing that we will not resolve any conflict arising from the testimony, he urges a rejection of the trial court\u2019s finding as based on testimony inherently improbable; that Officer Burke\u2019s testimony is a complete fabrication because it is \u201cmost improbable\u201d that a person knowingly carrying heroin in his pocket would casually consent to a search, it is \u201cincredible and fantastic\u201d that thereafter he would lead the officer to additional narcotics in his apartment, and the officer\u2019s statement that he opened the door with the key \u2018 \u2018 taken from\u201d him is inconsistent with his testimony concerning his voluntary consent.  \u201cThe applicable rule has been thus stated, \u2018 \u201cAlthough an appellate court will not uphold a judgment or verdict based upon evidence inherently improbable, testimony which merely discloses unusual circumstances does not come within that category. [Citation.]  To warrant the rejection of the statements given by a witness who has been believed by a trial court, there must exist either a physical impossibility that they are true, or their falsity must be apparent without resorting to inferences or deductions. (Citing cases.)  Conflicts and even testimony which is subject to justifiable suspicion do not justify the reversal of a judgment, for it is the exclusive province of the trial judge or jury to determine the credibility of a witness and the truth or falsity of the facts upon which a determination depends. [Citation.]\u201d \u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>47 Cal.2d 311, 319-320 [303 P.2d 329]; <em>People </em>v. <em>White, </em>43 Cal.2d 740, 747-748 [278 P.2d 9].) \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>65 Cal.2d 709, 712 [56 Cal.Rptr. 312, 423 P.2d 240].) As said in <em>People </em>v. <em>Haydon, </em>18 Cal.App. 543, 555-556 [123 P. 1102, 1108], \u201cA statement, to bear upon its face the brand of improbability, or which may be said to be unbelievable, <em>per se, </em>must involve, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>think, a claim that something has been done that it would not seem possible could be done under the circumstances described, or involve conduct that no one but a person of a seriously calentured mentality would be likely to do.\u201d (See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Collier, </em>111 Cal.App. 215, 226 [295 P. 898]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Nunley, </em>194 Cal.App.2d 233, 236 [14 Cal.Rptr. 874]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Guerrero, </em>207 Cal.App.2d 400, 403 [24 Cal.Rptr. 553].)</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">The argument that no right thinking person would have acted to his own detriment in the manner described by Officer Burke is unsound. At the time defendant was approached by the officers he could not know what or how much they knew of his narcotics activities. First he denies having any narcotics; when asked by the officer if he could \"cheek him out,\u201d in all probability he then realized that he could no longer avoid arrest for he knew he had narcotics on him with no apparent defense or means of escape. Such action is not unusual and is often motivated by the hope of incurring the police officer\u2019s goodwill and obtaining clemency. The Attorney General has pointed out but a few of the cases in which one voluntarily provided law enforcement officers with evidence clearly leading to his arrest and conviction. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>149 Cal. App.2d 282, 284-285 [308 P.2d 461] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>141 Cal. App.2d 399, 401 [296 P.2d 913] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>48 Cal.2d 241, 248 [309 P.2d 1]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Michael, </em>45 Cal.2d 751, 752 [290 P.2d 852].) Moreover, appellant\u2019s claim that it is \u201cincredible and fantastic \u2019 \u2019 that he would tell the officers that he had more narcotics in his apartment and where they were, ignores his own testimony that when he was in the apartment and asked by the officers \u201cwhere the rest of the stuff\u201d was, \u201cI showed to him where it was ... In the kitchen. . . .Behind the\u2014you know, those\u2014board like you press clothes.\u201d Officer Burke\u2019s use of the phrase \u201ctaken from\u201d the defendant in describing the key he used to open the apartment is no contradiction of his testimony of defendant\u2019s voluntary consent to being \"checked out\u201d and to going to his apartment to search for narcotics. If the key was \u201ctaken\u201d from defendant prior to his arrest and at the same time the bindle of heroin was removed from his pocket, we may presume in support of the trial court\u2019s ruling that it was \u201ctaken\u201d in the same manner and under the same circumstances as the bindle of heroin\u2014with defendant\u2019s consent; if it was \u201ctaken\u201d from defendant\u2019s person after his arrest, it was removed from defendant\u2019s person as the result of a proper search. In any event, how the key was \u201ctaken\u201d from defendant is immaterial in the light of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Officer Burke\u2019s testimony that defendant told him that he had narcotics in his apartment, he could go get it if he wanted to and he would take him there, and his further testimony that in the kitchen of the apartment defendant went to the place where the heroin was hidden and removed it for the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Totally invalid is appellant\u2019s complaint that the trial court failed to rule on the issue of consent. When the cause was submitted on the transcript of the testimony taken at the preliminary hearing, defense counsel stated to the court, \u201cthere will only be one issue, but it\u2019s got to be developed. That is, the issue of probable cause for the arrest and subsequent search of the defendant\u201d; further, he stated that he would \u201ccall the defendant in his own behalf on the basis of the issue involved.\u201d Defendant\u2019s testimony related almost entirely to his lack of permission\u2014to remove the heroin from his pocket, to take his keys, to enter his apartment and to search it. After all of the evidence was in, defense counsel objected to the offer of the exhibit (envelope containing narcotics) in evidence. Thereafter he argued at length the issue of the legality of the arrest, search and seizure, and at the conclusion, referring to defendant\u2019s testimony, he said, \u201cNow, I don't believe that can be a consensual search on the basis of the Haven case.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Haven, </em>59 Cal.2d 713 [31 Cal. Rptr. 47, 381 P.2d 927], relates to the issue of consent to search.) After further argument the court again read the preliminary transcript and ruled, \u201cThe exhibit will be received. I am satisfied with the evidence.\u201d The issue of consent was raised and directly brought to the trial court\u2019s attention; thus, implicit in the ruling admitting the exhibit in evidence is the court\u2019s finding adverse to defendant on all issues raised by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">The common complaint of inadequate representation in the trial court is here without merit. While he argues that the conduct of trial counsel indicates a complete misunderstanding of the crucial issue (consent) in his ease, that he should have argued the validity of the search and that he failed to urge the inherent improbability of Officer Burke\u2019s testimony, establish a coerced consent and conduct even a minimal cross-examination of the officer, the burden of establishing inadequate representation \u201c \u2018not as a matter of speculation but as a demonstrable reality,\u2019 \u201d is on appellant. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Reeves, </em>64 Cal.2d 766, 774 [51 Cal.Rptr. 691, 415 P.2d 35].)  Defendant had the same counsel at the preliminary hearing as at the trial; counsel was of defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>own choice. While he did not cross-examine Officer Burke at length, it may have been his judgment at that time from information in his possession that further attack could lead only to more damaging evidence on cross-examination or redirect examination or even through a rebuttal witness. Such strategy did not reduce the trial to a \u201cfarce or a sham,\u201d the test used to determine whether counsel\u2019s representation was ineffective. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wein, </em>50 Cal.2d 383, 410 [326 P.2d 457]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Robillard, </em>55 Cal.2d 88, 96-98 [10 Cal.Rptr. 167, 358 P.2d 295, 83 A.L.R.2d 1086]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>57 Cal.2d 89, 99 [17 Cal.Rptr. 617, 367 P.2d 33] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ibarra, </em>60 Cal.2d 460, 464 [34 Cal.Rptr. 863, 386 P.2d 487]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>64 Cal.2d 130, 139 [48 Cal.Rptr. 879, 410 P.2d 383].)  In the heat of the trial defense counsel is best able to determine proper tactics in the light of the evidence offered. Except in rare cases an appellate court should not attempt to second guess trial counsel. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>64 Cal.2d 130, 140 [48 Cal.Rptr. 879, 410 P.2d 383].) A substantial defense was offered by his own testimony, and appellant\u2019s claim that his counsel failed to argue the issue of consent is not borne out by the record; the fact is that it was considered by the trial judge who resolved the issue against him. Appellant has failed to point to any conduct of trial counsel that \u201ccost [him] a crucial defense. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Nicolaus, </em><footnotemark>*</footnotemark> (Cal.) 48 Cal.Rptr. 353, 409 P.2d 193; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ibarra, </em>60 Cal.2d 460, 464 [34 Cal.Rptr. 863, 386 P.2d 487].) \u201d <em>(In re Kelly, </em>242 Cal.App.2d 115,123 [51 Cal.Rptr. 148].)</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">Wood, P.
