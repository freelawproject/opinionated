The former company was a domestic corporation, manufacturing paper bags and sacks; the latter a foreign corporation manufacturing paper. The rolls of paper were delivered at 485-487 Washington street, Manhattan borough, New York city, the purchaser\u2019s place of business. The paper was rejected as not of the quality ordered and by agreement the purchase was canceled. Brown Company, however, requested Miller, Tompkins &amp; Co. to hold the merchandise in its place of business for further instructions. The paper remained in the premises of Miller, Tompkins &amp; Co. until it was destroyed by fire on January 13, 1923.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The defendants had insured Miller, Tompkins &amp; Co. against loss by fire, the policies covering <em>\u201c </em>on stock, materials and supplies, including labor performed thereon in <em>all </em>stages, including packages and labels, contained in said premises No. 485-487 Washington Street, New York City, the property of the assured or held in trust or on commission, or sold but not delivered or held on joint account with others and also the property of others for which the assured may be or agree to become liable in case of loss or damage by fire.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">The insured had not agreed to become liable for the property of the Brown Company in case of loss or damage by fire, and was not liable for any negligence in causing the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Miller, Tompkins &amp; Co. refused to include any claim for such merchandise belonging to the Brown Company in its proof of loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">The property of Miller, Tompkins &amp; Co. was also damaged and destroyed to the amount of $55,049.69, the total amount of the insurance under the policies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>issued by the defendants being $61,000. There was insurance sufficient to cover all losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">With notice of the claims and the loss of the Brown Company, the defendants settled with Miller, Tompkins &amp; Co., but failed and refused to pay the loss of the Brown Company, denying all and any liability to it under the policies. ' The defense is that the policies covered only the property of Miller, Tompkins &amp; Co. and not that which it held as bailee. The Brown Company, on the other hand, claim that under the <em>\u201c </em>trust and commission \u201d clause, so called, the policies covered its nineteen rolls of paper which the Miller, Tompkins Co. was holding in its place of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">The plaintiff in this action is an assignee of the Brown Company\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">We are of the opinion that the policies in this case covered the Brown Company\u2019s paper. It was property <em>\u201c </em>held in trust \u201d by the Miller, Tompkins Co. for the Brown Company, within the meaning which has been given to these words in the insurance business and insurance law.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\"><em>\u201c </em>The words \u2018 in trust \u2019 may, with entire propriety, be applied to any case of bailment, where goods belonging to one person are entrusted to the custody or care of another, and for which the bailee is responsible to the owner.\u201d <em>(Stillwell </em>v. <em>Staples, </em>19 N. Y. 401.)</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">\u201c The phrases describing property <em>\u2018 </em>as held in trust,\u2019 or \u2018 on commission,\u2019 and kindred terms, in a policy to an agent, factor or the like, have been held as giving to the owner of the property a right to take the place of the insured, to adopt the contract, and to enforce it in his own name or that of his agent.\u201d <em>(Waring </em>v. <em>Indemnity Fire Ins. Co., </em>45 N. Y. 606, p. 610, p. 612. See, also, <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Home Insurance Co., </em>199 App. Div. 556; affd., without opinion, 234 N. Y. 498; and <em>Home Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Baltimore Warehouse Co., </em>93 U. S. 527, where it was said that the phrase \u201c held in trust \u201d is to be understood in its mercantile sense.)</p>\n<p id=\"b308-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number><em>Utica Canning Co. </em>v. <em>Home Insurance Co. </em>(132 App. Div. 420) was decided upon facts similar to these before us now. While that case did not come to this court, we see no reason for departing from the principles and the result there stated. True, the presiding justice in his opinion included a quotation which said that this form of <em>\u201c </em>trust or commission \u201d policy is similar in its legal effect to the policy <em>\u201c </em>for whom it may concern,\u201d and arises in much the same way. Even though the latter clause, generally found in marine policies, is much broader than the former phrase used in fire insurance policies <em>(Hooper </em>v. Robinson, 98 U. S. 528, 537), the reasoning of the opinion is correct and would not be affected by omitting the comparison.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">The Brown Company\u2019s paper was, therefore, covered by the defendant\u2019s policies. Yet it will do the company little good unless this action can be maintained. Miller, Tompkins Co. refused to include the loss in its proof of claim; it settled for the damage to its own property, leaving out the Brown Company, and of course refused to maintain any action on the policies in behalf of the latter company. Its position was and is that the policies did not cover the Brown Company\u2019s damage. The insurance companies took a like position and settled with the Miller, Tompkins Co., knowing of the Brown Company\u2019s loss and claim. Unless this action lies, the Brown Company and its assignee are without remedy. Such lapses the law seeks to avoid.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">What would be the procedure if an insured included in his proof of loss the damage suffered to his bailor\u2019s property and was willing to undertake its collection, we are not called upon to decide upon the facts here presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Cardozo, Ch. J., Pound, Andrews, Kellogg and O\u2019Brien, JJ., concur; Lehman, J., not sitting.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
