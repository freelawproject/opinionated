HELEN JAMES, Defendant and Appellant.</parties>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b558-13\">Helen James, in pro. per., for Defendant and Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b558-14\">Sam Houston Allen for Plaintiff and Respondent.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b558-15\">FILES, P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AaI\">Following a trial and an adverse judgment, the defendant made a motion to vacate the judgment upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>sole ground that it is \u201cvoid on its face.\u201d The motion was heard and denied. Defendant is appealing from the order denying that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">The judgment attacked is the one which is the subject of plaintiff\u2019s appeal in 2d Civil No. 30395, decided this day.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">Defendant\u2019s brief argues that the complaint and the findings of fact are fatally defective. Our examination discloses that the complaint states a cause of action for rescission of a fraudulent real estate transaction, and that the findings, on their face, determine the material issues raised by the pleadings and the pretrial statement, except for the error of law discussed in the opinion written upon the plaintiff\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">Defendant has not appealed from the judgment. There is nothing on the face of the judgment, or elsewhere in the record, to support any argument that the judgment is void.  \u201c It is thoroughly settled in this state that the failure of a complaint to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action does not render a judgment void.\u201d <em>(Gillespie </em>v. <em>Fender, </em>180 Cal. 202, 203 [180 P. 332].) Nor is a judgment void by reason of the absence of appropriate findings. <em>(Estate of Ross, </em>180 Cal. 651, 659 [182 P. 752], See 29 Cal.Jur.2d, Judgments, \u00a7 206, p. 159.)</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-11\">Jefferson, J., and Kingsley, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-12\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied November 15, 1967.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
