The lands were required for use as an underground reservoir of natural gas in connection with the prosecution of the war effort. An evaluation proceeding was held and appellant was named as one of the defendants therein since he claimed an interest in the condemned property.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After a hearing before a jury, a verdict was returned finding the fair market value of the condemned properties to total $194,-500. Judgment was entered upon the verdict July 13, 1949. On October 30, 1950, a second judgment was entered ordering distribution of the condemnation award. As part of the distribution order Wynn was awarded $11,502, as representing 6% of the proceeds after payment of expenses.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> All parties appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">On appeal from the condemnation suit Wynn specifically claimed that the district court had made a mathematical error in the computation of his six per cent interest in the condemnation award, and further that he, together with certain others collectively known as the \u201cAdamant Group\u201d, were entitled to an equitable lien upon R.F.C.\u2019s share of the condemnation award since R.F.C. was the successor in interest to the Treasure Co. against whom the Adamant Group had claims for alleged unpaid royalties, the determination of which was then pending in other suits in the state and federal courts. This court, upon appeal, held that Wynn and the Adamant Group had no equitable lien upon R.F.C.\u2019s share of the award, and, further held that the mathematical distribution was correct. United States v. Adamant Co., 9 Cir., 1952, 197 F.2d 1, 11. Acordingly, we affirmed the judgment, but remanded the cause with directions to withhold execution and enforcement of the order of distribution as to appellants other than R.F.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-15\">The Instant Action</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-16\">This action was filed in the Superior Court in and for the County of Los Angeles in the State of California, on September 16,1952. The complaint seeks to set aside a contract entered into between R.F.C., the Southern California Gas Co., and the Trust Oil Company as representative of Treasure Co., Samark and Oil Co., and Empire Oil Co., dated May 31, 1949. Wynn, the plaintiff-appellant, alleges that he is a creditor of Treasure Co., and that the contract entered into between the United States and Trust Oil Co. was an attempt of G. de Bretteville as president of Trust Oil Co. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>and of each of the subsidiary oil companies, to transfer the assets of, among \u2022others, Treasure Co. to R.F.C., in fraud \u2022of its creditors. Wynn also seeks to quiet title to his six per cent interest in the named property and asks that a receiver be appointed as to all of the property held by Treasure Co. and G. de Bretteville at the time the contract of May 31, 1949, was entered into and that the defendants be enjoined from disposing of any of the property or the proceeds thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">The action was removed to the United States District Court on October 6, 1952, By defendants, and Wynn made a motion to remand the case to the Superior Court on December 19, 1952. On December 4, 1952, defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. On June 8, 1953, the United States District Court denied the motion to remand and granted a partial summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 (d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. The District Court found that Wynn had no interest in the land condemned by the United States. See United States v. Adamant Co., 9 Cir., 1952, 197 F.2d 1. The District Court denied summary judgment as to Wynn s cause of action in regard to the properties of Treasure Co. which were not part of the condemnation suit.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1003-13\">Wynn is here appealing from the order denying his motion to remand to the Superior Court and from the partial summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-14\">Partial Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-15\">The appellate jurisdiction of this court is limited to appeals from <em>final </em>judgments <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and from such interlocutory orders as are specifically made appealable by statute.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We turn first to the so-called \u201cpartial summary judgment\u201d, the issuance of which is authorized by Rule 56 (d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Title 28 U.S.C.A. The notes of the Advisory Committee on Amendments to Rules, in referring to Rule 56(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, state that \u201ca partial summary \u2018judgment\u2019 is not a final judgment\u201d.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As Professor James W. Moore points out in his treatise on federal practice, a more accurate description of the action taken by a court pursuant to Rule 56(d) would be an \u201cin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>terlocutory summary adjudication\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> or, as suggested in several cases, a \u201cpretrial order\u201d.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> And such court action would be non-appealable prior to the entry of a final judgment in the case, in the absence of a specific statute authorizing an appeal.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">A further and necessary exception to the non-appealability of a partial summary judgment is made where the District Court has erroneously treated such judgment as final and orders execution thereon.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">No statutory provision for permitting an interlocutory appeal in this instance has been made manifest to this court, nor has the District Court treated its partial summary judgment as final in nature. Nor is there any <em>res </em>within the jurisdiction of this court or the District Court which is threatened with dissipation. The money awarded to R.F.C. in the condemnation proceeding has already been ordered distributed by order of this court. United States v. Adamant Co., 9 Cir., 1952, 197 F.2d 1. The distribution of the balance of the award money is being stayed until this and other suits in claim of it have been finally adjudicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-6\">Appellant\u2019s contention that the District Court\u2019s \u201cpartial summary judgment\u201d was final and thus appealable as to the property involved in the prior condemnation suit is also rebutted by Rule 54(b) which provides that where there is more than one claim for relief in an action \u201cthe court may direct the entry of a final judgment upon one or more but less than all of the claims only upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for the entry of judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The District Court order from which the instant appeal was taken is designated as an \u201cORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR. PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT UNDER RULE 56(D) OF FEDERAL RULES OF PROCEDURE\u201d. There is m&gt; express determination as to the necessity for speed, nor is there an express direction for the entry of judgment. Indeed,, the action taken by the court is consistent, only with the theory that it was making-an interlocutory or pre-trial finding, and not a formal final judgment.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Notice the order is under 56(d) and not under 54(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-13\">Motion to Remand</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-14\">We next consider whether an appeal will lie from the denial of the motion to remand. This court has jurisdiction to hear appeals from certain specified interlocutory orders, including orders re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>fusing to dissolve injunctions.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Therefore, it has been held that an interlocutory appeal may be taken from a district court injunction or refusal to dissolve an injunction against further proceedings in a state court on removed proceedings and that in such a circumstance the denial of the motion to remand may be considered as an integral part of the issues presented by the appeal.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> However, the instant case involves the attempt to appeal, not from any refusal to dissolve an injunction, but from the denial of a motion to remand the case to the state court. It is not an appeal from a final judgment nor from an order specifically made ap-pealable by statute, and therefore, is not the proper subject for an interlocutory review.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1005-10\">The appeal is dismissed and cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1001-17\">.

Advisory Committee\u2019s Note of 1946 to Subdivision (d) of Rule 56, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A., 6 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice (1953) pp. 2011-2012, \u00a7 56.01 [7]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-11\">\u201cSubdivision (d). Rule 54(a) defines \u2018judgment\u2019 as including a decree and \u2018any order from which an appeal lies.\u2019 Subdivision (d) of Rule 56 indicates clearly, however, that a partial summary \u2018judgment\u2019 is not a final judgment, and, therefore, that it is not appealable, unless in the particular case some statute allows an appeal from the interlocutory order involved. The partial summary judgment is merely a pretrial adjudication that certain issues shall be deemed established for the trial of the case. This adjudication is more nearly akin to the preliminary order under Rule 16, and likewise serves the purpose of speeding up litigation by eliminating before trial matters wherein there is no genuine issue of fact.
