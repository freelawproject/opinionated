D.C.Code 1951, Tit. 22, \u00a7 2501. The first three counts concerned his testimony before the Reconstruction Finance Corporation Subcommittee of the Senate Banking and Currency Committee. The fourth concerned his testimony before the grand jury. He was found guilty on all four counts and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of from four months to two years, to run concurrently, on each. Since the sentences are to run concurrently the judgment of the District Court must be upheld if the conviction of appellant on any count is valid. Kiyoshi Hirabayashi v. United States, 1943, 320 U.S. 81, 63 S.Ct. 1375, 87 L.Ed. 1774. We consider appellant\u2019s conviction on the first count to be clearly valid. We accordingly affirm on that count, and in this opinion will discuss only those contentions of the appellant which are applicable to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-23\">At the outset appellant attacks the validity of the indictment. Each count asserts that an oath was duly taken before \u201ca competent tribunal * * * in which a law of the United States authorizes an oath to be administered * * It does not set forth the name of the individual who administered the oath or his authority to do so. This, appellant urges, renders the indictment fatally defective. He relies on a section of the District of Columbia Code which provides that a perjury indictment must set forth \u201cby what court, or before whom the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>oath was taken (averring such court, or person or persons, to have a competent authority to administer the same) * * * \u201d D.C.Code 1951, Tit. 23, \u00a7 204. Since the passage of this section,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> how-ever, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C.A. have been promulgated. Rule 7(c) provides that \u201cThe indictment or the information shall be a plain, concise and definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged. * * * It need not contain * * * any other matter not necessary to such statement. * * * \u201d The substantive elements of perjury in this jurisdiction are set out in Section 22-2501 of the District of Columbia Code. That section is nearly identical in its terms to Section 1621 of Title 18 of the United States Code, and under the latter section an allegation of the name or authority of the individual who administered the oath has been held to be unnecessary. United States v. Debrow, 1953, 346 U.S. 374, 74 S.Ct. 113. Similar ' reasoning is applicable here. We do not consider that Section 23-204 of the District of Columbia Code \u2014 which is purely procedural \u2014 has the effect of adding to the substantive elements of perjury (\u201cthe essential facts constituting the offense charged\u201d) a requirement that the name of the giver of the oath be alleged. The instant indictment thus complies with Rule 7(c), and that compliance sustains it. See Fed.R.Crim.P. 1; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 687 (1946)<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>; United States v. Bickford, 9 Cir., 1948, 168 F.2d 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">Appellant also attacks the indictment on the basis of the selection of the grand jury panel. The jury commissioners excluded from the jury list all persons who voted outside the District of Columbia, on the ground that they could not be \u201cresidents\u201d of the District of Columbia.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This practice, which has since been discontinued, was certainly erroneous.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The question is whether it warrants reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-11\">Appellant relies primarily on Ballard v. United States, 1946, 329 U.S. 187, 67 S.Ct. 261, 91 L.Ed. 181, and Thiel v. Southern Pacific Co., 1946, 328 U.S. 217, 66 S.Ct. 984, 90 L.Ed. 1181. In those cases convictions were reversed because of the exclusion from the jury panel of women (Ballard) and daily wage earners (Thiel). In both cases a cohesive class, united by common interests, was excluded.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Court stressed this fact and demonstrated a concern to secure jury panels which were representative of the communities from which they were drawn. In Thiel it listed six groups\u2014 economic, social, religious, racial, political and geographical \u2014 which could not be excluded. 328 U.S. at page 220, 66 S.Ct. at page 985. Here none of these were excluded. Persons who reside in the District of Columbia but vote elsewhere come from either sex and from all racial, religious and political groups. They comprise no cohesive group. Their exclusion does not threaten the representative nature of jury panels. We do not believe, therefore, that the Ballard and Thiel cases are applicable. The exclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>sion here is a mere irregularity and does not warrant reversal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Appellant next contests the competency of the Subcommittee before which he testified. He alleges that at the time he gave the testimony on which the first three counts are based the Subcommittee was not engaged in a legislative function.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">The instant Subcommittee was authorized by the Senate to conduct a study of the operations of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Pursuant to this authorization it conducted extensive hearings and issued three interim reports. The third, issued on February 5, 1951, was entitled \u201cFavoritism and Influence.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It said that \u201cthere has been improper use of the Corporation\u2019s vast authority in response to the influence which persons outside of the RFC have over individual members of the Board of Directors.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It added: \u201cThe individual named most frequently in the reports of alleged influence which have reached the subcommittee is E. Merl Young. * * * By July of 1948 his salary at RFC had risen to $7,193 a year. More recently, Merl Young has been an $18,000-a-year vice president of the Lustron Corp. and, simultaneously, a $10,000-a-year official of F. L. Jacobs Co. Both were RFC borrowers at the time. * * * It seems that Young acquired and held both of these positions because of the influential atmosphere which surrounds him.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">The third report favorably reported a bill \u2014 S. 514 \u2014 proposing a reorganization of the RFC.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On February 19, 1951, the President submitted to Congress an executive reorganization plan which also proposed to( reorganize the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. As a result the passage of S. 514 was rendered unlikely, at best. On February 21, 1951, the Subcommittee on the Reconstruction Finance Corporation re-commenced its hearings. The chairman stated, at that time, that the purpose of the hearings would be to clarify the third interim report, to rebut criticism of it, to develop evidence in its support, and to afford persons mentioned in it an opportunity to reply.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It was at this set of hearings that the testimony in question was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-16\">Appellant argues here that the Subcommittee\u2019s purpose was- one of \u201cventilation\u201d and that this is not a valid legislative purpose. He points to the chairman\u2019s remarks and the fact that S. 514 had been, in effect, superseded by the President\u2019s reorganization plan. There is no merit in this argument. Certainly a committee can hold hearings to substantiate an earlier report, where the bill reported is pending before Congress. Here, to be sure, S. 514 appeared doubtful of passage, in view of the presidential reorganization plan. But the report was also pertinent to that plan. And at the time of the hearings in question the plan was before Congress for its acceptance or rejection.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It was entitled to know whether or not the report of the Subcommittee was subject to refutation.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>The clearly valid legislative purpose which thus underlay these hearings was not vitiated by the incidental desire of the Subcommittee to give interested parties a chance to reply to statements made in the third report. That desire was fair and reasonable. The mere \u201cventilation\u201d of sensational facts, of a sort not conceivably linked or linkable to valid congressional legislation, has been the target of much criticism.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> But nothing of that kind is present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">Appellant next alleges that the District Court erred in denying a motion for acquittal. He urges that the evidence is insufficient on all counts. We briefly summarize the evidence as to the first count, to which this opinion is limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Count I charges appellant with perju-riously testifying: \u201cWhile I was employed by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation I never had anything to do with the loan applications made by Lus-tron.\u201d This representation was contained in a prepared statement read by appellant at the hearing of February 21, 1951.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">The Lustron Corporation first applied for a loan in 1947. Appellant was then a loan examiner in the RFC. It is conceded that he had nothing to do with the application for this loan. He did, however, \u201cservice\u201d the loan after it was granted.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In June of 1948 Lustron applied for an additional loan of $10,000,-000. It is this second application with which appellant was found to have been connected. The primary evidence connecting him with it is a document of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation review committee recommending the loan. in the lower left hand corner of the last page of this document, underneath the word \u201cconcur,\u201d is appellant\u2019s signature. Hubert Steele, a former loan examiner at the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, testified that it was usual for an examiner who was servicing a loan to make a recommendation on any additional loan requested by that borrower. Harvey J. Gunderson, a Director of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation at the time, testified that when the review committee\u2019s recommendation came before the Directors they sent it back for appellant\u2019s signature. He implied that this was because appellant was servicing the original Lustron loan. Appellant testified that he signed the document because he was servicing the original loan and because he received a memorandum from the head of his division asking him to do so. (It read: \u201cPlease sign and return.\u201d) He denied that he made an official recommendation and said that he was not qualified to write a report on so large a loan. He further testified: \u201cAs far as trying to show that me quitting RFC on the same day as the Lustron loan was approved, that has no significance whatsoever.\u201d The offer of employment from Lustron came, he said, some two or three weeks earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-12\">Such, in brief, was the evidence on the first count. To return a verdict of guilty on a charge of perjury a jury must, of course, be convinced, beyond a reasonable doubt, not only that the accused testified falsely but that he did not, at the time, believe his testimony to be true.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The first inquiry in a de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>termination of whether or not the evidence was sufficient for the jury to find an accused guilty of perjury relates to the application of the \u201ctwo witness rule.\u201d This rule is misnamed. It does not require the testimony of two witnesses. Properly stated it is that \u201cthe uncorroborated oath of one witness is not enough to establish, for purposes of conviction of perjury, the falsity of sworn testimony.\u201d Maragon v. United States, 1950, 87 U.S.App.D.C. 349, 350, 187 F.2d 79, 80, certiorari denied, 1951, 341 U.S. 932, 71 S.Ct. 804, 95 L.Ed. 1361. See Hammer v. United States, 1926, 271 U.S. 620, 46 S.Ct. 603, 70 L.Ed. 1118; Weiler v. United States, 1945, 323 U.S. 606, 65 S. Ct. 548, 89 L.Ed. 495. Defendant\u2019s admissions and documentary evidence go toward its fulfillment. Maragon v. United States, supra. We think the evidence offered on the first count satisfies the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">Fulfillment of the two witness rule is necessary for conviction of perjury. It is not, however, sufficient for conviction. An additional requirement is that the jury could reasonably believe that there was no reasonable doubt as to defendant\u2019s guilt. Curley v. United States, 81 U.S.App.D.C. 389, 160 F.2d 229, certiorari denied, 1947, 331 U.S. 837, 67 S.Ct. 1511, 91 L.Ed. 1850. This requirement, of course, relates to both elements of perjury: the falsity of the testimony and the lack of a belief in its truth. Generally, a belief as to the falsity of testimony may be inferred by the jury from proof of the falsity itself.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In some cases perhaps this might not be so \u2014as where the testimony concerned a triviality or an occurrence of long before. See Fotie v. United States, 8 Cir., 1943, 137 F.2d 831. We do not think any such situation exists here. Of course, the jury could have found that there was a reasonable doubt that appellant believed his testimony on which the first count is based to be inaccurate. But we also think that the jury could reasonably find, and did find as to that count, that there was no reasonable doubt as to appellant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">Finally, appellant complains of several of the questions asked and remarks made at the trial by the prosecutor. We have studied the record as to these incidents. We do not believe they warrant a new trial, and hence do not deem it necessary to detail them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">For these reasons, the judgment of the District Court must be</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b286-5\">. Section 204 was incorporated into the District of Columbia Code by the Act of March 3, 1901, 31 Stat. 1189.

Both cases concern the converse of the instant issue; a prospective juror was challenged as not being a resident of the District of Columbia beeause he voted elsewhere. Held, the juror was a resident. The applicable statute differed from the present one only in that it contained no requirement that jurors be able to read or write.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b286-13\">, See, also, Dow v.
