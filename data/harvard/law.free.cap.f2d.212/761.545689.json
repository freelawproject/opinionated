His attempted appeal to this court from the judgment of conviction was dismissed as not having been taken in time, 197 F.2d 509. He then moved in the court below D.C., 106 F.Supp. 209, under \u00a7 2255 of Title 28 for an order vacating the sentence as void, for the reason that he was prosecuted upon an information only, with no indictment by a grand jury, and none waived, and also because he was denied trial by jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-12\">The information was filed, and the-case was tried, in conformity with a general order or rule of the District Court of Guam, made July 17, 1951, as-follows: \u201cIt is herewith ordered that in prosecutions before the District Court, of Guam, wherein the accused is charged with an offense against the United States, the United States may proceed by information, rather than by indictment. It is further ordered that trials, criminal and civil, shall be conducted before the court without a jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b810-13\">Clearly enough, the contention that Pugh should have been prosecuted by indictment of a grand jury, or tried by petit jury, raises no constitutional question, for \u00a7 3 of the Organic Act of Guam, Title 48, U.S.C.A., \u00a7 1421a, recites that \u201cGuam is declared to be an unincorporated territory of the United States\u201d. Thus Congress took cognizance of the doctrine of territorial incorporation as first expounded by Mr. Justice White in Downes v. Bidwell, 182 U.S. 244, 287, 21 S.Ct. 770, 45 L.Ed. 1088, and thereafter developed in a series of decisions by the Supreme Court in eases having to do with the question as to the extent to which the Constitution followed the flag.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As Guam has not been incorporated into the United States, neither \u00a7 2 of Article III, relating to trial by jury, nor the Fifth, Sixth nor Sev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>enth Amendments, relating to grand or petit juries, have any application to the Island of Guam or to the courts therein in the absence of some act of Congress extending their application there.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">Section 5 of the Organic Act, 48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1421b, contains a \u201cbill of rights\u201d for Guam. It contains no provision for indictment or trial by jury. However, \u00a7 22 of that Act, Title 48, \u00a7 1424, which creates the District Court of Guam, and defines its jurisdiction, provides in subdivision (b) thereof:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-5\">\u00a7 1424(b). \u201cThe rules heretofore or hereafter promulgated and made effective by the Supreme Court of the United States pursuant to * * sections 3771 and 3772 of Title 18, in criminal cases * * * shall apply to the District Court of Guam and to appeals therefrom.\u201d Aug. 1, 1950, c. 512, \u00a7 22, 64 Stat. 389.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">Rule 7(a) of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C.A., thus made applicable, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-7\">\u201cAn offense which may be punished by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year or at hard labor shall be prosecuted by indictment or, if indictment is waived, it may be prosecuted by information. * * #\u00ab</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-9\">The offense here involved was one so punishable. There was no waiver of indictment here. Therefore through the Act\u2019s provision that Rule 7 (a) \u201cshall apply to the District Court of Guam\u201d, there exists a statutory requirement of indictment by grand jury. In United States v. Seagraves, D.C., 100 F.Supp. 424, the judge of the District Court of Guam stated at length his reasons for holding an indictment not required, and disclosing reasons why, in his view, the use of grand and petit juries in Guam was not practical. The most serious obstacle there stated was the failure of Congress, at least expressly, to make Chapter 121 of Title 28, relating to the qualifications and manner of selecting jurors, applicable to the District Court of Guam. If, as we assume, Chapter 121 does not apply there, then provision for jurors must be made by the territorial legislature as it is in Alaska.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See Alaska Compiled Laws Ann.1949, \u00a7\u00a7 55-7-1 to 55-7-56 and \u00a7 66-8-1. Cf. Hauptman v. United States, 9 Cir., 43 F.2d 86. What the judge there said might well be brought to the attention of Congress, but in our view the language of Rule 7(a), so incorporated in the Organic Act, is so explicit and unqualified that no considerations of expediency can warrant our disregarding it.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-15\">The question remains whether the lack of an indictment, while an error which would require a reversal upon appeal, is also a matter which can be raised in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding. It has been suggested that the language used in the Organic Act in setting up the court below is such that it imports a requirement that in respect to its trial of causes arising under the laws of the United States, the district court of Guam shall proceed under the same restrictions as are imposed by Constitutional limitations upon a district court of the United States. Such a court in the United States proper is subject to the constitutional mandate with respect to requiring indictment by a grand jury and affording a trial by jury in criminal cases. \u00a7 22(a), creating the district court of Guam, is set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>forth in the margin.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The suggestion just mentioned is predicated upon the words: \u201cThe District Court of Guam shall have, in all causes arising under the laws of the United States, the jurisdiction of a district court of the United States as such court is defined in section 451 of Title 28\u201d. Under familiar rules, a district court of the United States may lose jurisdiction if and when it denies an accused person rights which he has under the Constitution. Johnson v. Zerbst, 804 U.S. 458, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461. But we think the use of the word \u201cjurisdiction\u201d in the language just quoted has no such connotation here. Plainly this refers to the jurisdiction of the subject matter. It states what cases the court may try. Since Congress carefully saw to it that Guam be not incorporated in the United States, and hence that the constitutional provisions relating to grand and petit juries did not extend there, there is no occasion for a holding that since indictment by grand jury and trial by petit jury were lacking here, the court was without jurisdiction for the same reason that a district court in continental United States would lack jurisdiction in such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">The reference to the court having \u201cthe jurisdiction of a district court of the United States\u201d does not stamp the failure to procure an indictment as a defect stemming from something akin to a constitutional requirement. The requirement of a grand jury is simply a statutory provision, brought about by \u00a7 22(b) incorporating by reference criminal rule 7(a). Yet we think the defect in this respect, that is, in regard to the lack of indictment, is a matter which can be raised in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> For this reason the judgment must be reversed. And since the failure to make use of a grand jury requires this result, we have no occasion to consider the other quite different questions that have been argued here with respect to failure to afford a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded with directions to vacate the sentence and to dismiss the information.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b810-14\">.

Such discussion is no more than <em>brutum fulmen </em>about the obvious fact that the Constitution does not follow the flag, thus obscuring the single issue in the case and at the same time ignoring the principal contention made#at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>That single issue is, <em>has Congress created in the Guam district court </em>by the express language of 48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1424 (a) the jurisdiction to try persons accused of felonies only by indictment unless waived, as in the district courts of the United States and as it has created such limited jurisdiction in the district courts of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">The pertinent portions of 48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1424(a) and 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 451, to which the former refers, <em>expressly </em>confer on the Guam district court the same jurisdiction as that of a continental district court of the United States in such a case as this of a federal felony. They are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-6\">\u201cThe District Court of Guam shall have, in all causes arising under the laws of the United States, <em>the jurisdiction of a district court of the United States </em>as such court is defined in section 451 of Title 28 * * (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-8\">\u201c\u00a7 451.

Cf. Roche v. Evaporated Milk Ass\u2019n, 319 U.S. 21, 26, 63 S.Ct. 938, 87 L.Ed. 1185.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-16\">Congress further indicates that it conferred on the Guam district court the same jurisdictional requirements of indictment as in the continental courts by applying to Guam the Federal Code of Crimes and Criminal Procedure, 18 U. S.C., of which Section 3321 provides for the number of grand jurors and the method of summoning them; \u00a7 3432 providing for a service of the indictment in capital cases; \u00a7 5032 providing for indicting juvenile offenders for the crimes punishable by death or life imprisonment; and \u00a7\u00a7 3288 and 3289 which provide for re-indictment where a defective indictment was found before and after the expiration of the period of limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-17\">The court\u2019s opinion quotes the pertinent sentence of \u00a7 1424(a): \u201cThe District Court of Guam shall have, in all causes arising under the laws of the United States, the jurisdiction of a district court of the United States as such court is defined in section 451 of Title 28,\u201d and states \u201cwe think the use of the-word \u2018jurisdiction\u2019 in the language just quoted has no such connotation here [as it does for the district courts of the United States]. Plainly this refers to the jurisdiction of the <em>subject </em>matter. It states <em>what cases the court may try\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b813-18\">That is to say, the court would amend this sentence of \u00a7 1424(a) by deleting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>the significant comma after the word \u201chave\u201d and inserting the word \u201cjurisdiction\u201d before the words \u201cin all causes arising under the laws of the United States\u201d and, after deleting the second comma, by striking out all the succeeding words \u201cthe jurisdiction of a district court of the United States as such court is defined in section 451 of Title 28\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">After such legerdemain so mauling the statute, the sentence would read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayq\">\u201cThe District Court of Guam shall have [jurisdiction] in all cases arising under the laws of the United States, the jarisdietion ef a district ee-u-r-fe ef the United StatC3 as saeb eeart is defined.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">Such an absurdity of statutory construction obviously violates the elementary principle that the words of a statute shall be construed to give them effect and not to make them nugatory. As stated by the Supreme Court in Market Co. v. Hoffman, 101 U.S. 112, 115, 116, 25 L.Ed. 782, \u201cWe are not at liberty to construe any statute so as to deny effect to any part of its language. It is a cardinal rule of statutory construction that significance and effect shall, if possible, be accorded to every word. As early as in Bacon\u2019s Abridgment, sect. 2, it was said that \u2018a statute ought, upon the whole, to be so construed that, if it can be prevented, no clause, sentence, or word shall be superfluous, void, or insignificant.\u2019 \u201d The same statement is repeated in Ex parte Public Bank, 278 U.S. 101, 104, 49 S.Ct. 43, 73 L.Ed. 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">The only construction of the sentence which gives effect to the jurisdictional provision of 48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1424(a) is that the District Court of Guam has the same jurisdiction as the district courts of the United States in all causes arising under the laws of the United States. Indeed, this is so clear from the text that we have no reason to consider the Committee reports, for, as stated in Helver-ing v. City Bank, 296 U.S. 85, 89, 56 S.Ct. 70, 72, 80 L.Ed. 62:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-7\">\u201cWe are not at liberty to construe language so plain as to need no construction, or to refer to committee reports where there can be no doubt of the meaning of the words used.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ako6\">Also, in Browder v. United States, 312 U.S. 335, 338, 61 S.Ct. 599, 601, 85 L.Ed. 862, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-9\">\u201cThe plain meaning of the words' of the act covers this use. No single argument has more weight in statutory interpretation than this.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b814-10\">However, when we examine the Senate report on the bill creating the District Court of Guam, we find its purpose was to give the litigants in that court the same \u201crights of American law and legal procedure\u201d as they have in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. That is to say, that court could obtain its jurisdiction to prosecute one accused of a felony only by indictment, unless waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-11\">In the original draft of the Organic Act (see H.R. 7273, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., as introduced on Feb. 13, 1950), no provision was made for a District Court. Instead, Section 22 vested the judicial authority of Guam in one Supreme Court and in such inferior Courts as may be established under the laws of Guam. The problem of enforcement of the laws of the United States, as opposed to the laws of Guam, was taken care of in Sec. 24 of the proposed bill by extending the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California to include Guam, and providing for special terms of that Court to be held in Guam.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-12\">Later the bill was amended to establish a District Court in Guam. The reason for this change is given on page 4 of Senate Report No. 2109, U.S.Code Congressional Service 1950, p. 2840, cited supra:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-13\">\u201cGiven a period of peace, the growth of Guam as a transportation and commercial center for American interests in the Far East seems almost a foregone conclusion. American business enterprise in the area will want, and need, a center in which it can have the <em>full protection </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number><em>of American laws and legal procedure. </em>Formerly this need was supplied by the United States Court for China, which had its headquarters in Shanghai, but that court was abolished by the treaty with China ending extraterritoriality. The nearest American court to far eastern economic centers is that in Hawaii, which is 12 or more hours away from Guam by air. If Guam is to afford American business enterprise the protection and stability needed, a court in Guam which will have on-the-spot jurisdiction in matters involving admiralty and business reorganization is clearly indicated.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">We thus see that the considered alternative for Guam of the United States Court for the Northern District of California was the United States District Court of Hawaii where, again, jurisdiction of a felony could be obtained only by indictment, unless waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">In addition to these continental businessmen needing these \u201crights of American law and legal procedure\u201d are some 15,000 continentally-reared soldiers and sailors of the Armed Forces on Guam. A sailor accused of second degree murder of a Guamanian, committed off a military reservation, as much is entitled to indictment as is the businessman.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">We should take judicial notice of the following facts before Congress in enacting Sec. 1424(a). Apart from the businessmen and the 15,000 military, the original inhabitants, the Guamanians, are capable of producing trial jurors as well as grand jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">Beginning in 1900 and continuing for the succeeding fifty-four years, save in the Japanese occupancy, they have been compelled by the military authorities to send their children to English-speaking schools from the age of 7 to 12. <em>They are people, excepting the few aged, speaking in English and literate in English </em>and taught in the schools the elements of American ideals. Since 1935 they have been governed by the common law as developed in the California Civil and Criminal Codes, then made the law of Guam. It is clear that if they are not now able to supply jurors for the jury system, <em>they never will be.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">Contrast this with the conferring of the grand and petit juries on the Puerto Ricans in 1900 where, according to the 1929 edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica, page 263, \u201cIn 1899, out of a reported total but 15% could read or write. The total number in all schools at that time was 22,265, or about 2% of the population.\u201d Nevertheless, the Commission, appointed by the President under 48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1421c(b) to determine the federal statutes applicable to Guam in 1950 which should remain applicable, stated that Guam\u2019s status is comparable to that of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands,\u201d and \u201cIf the Congress has extended a statute to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, the Commission considered that act to be presumptively appropriate for application to Guam.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
