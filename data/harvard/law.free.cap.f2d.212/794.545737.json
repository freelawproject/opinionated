Our study of the record brings us to the view that there was no error in this instruction to the jury. We also find no prejudicial error in other respects that were saved for review by timely objection or obvious on the face of the record. Wherefore, the judgment below is .</p>\n<p id=\"b842-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
