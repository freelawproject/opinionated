This eleven-story structure was a specialty building erected in 1905 to serve the printing and book binding industry; and there had been placed in it costly and expensive heavy machines with special installation such as wiring connections and the foundations. Defendant removed such of these as were removable before delivery of possession to the Government, leaving the foundations and irremovable connections. After the first report came in from the commissioners, Judge Knox returned the case to them to find the value of fixtures installed by the tenant, United States v. Certain Parcels of Land in Borough of Manhattan, etc., D.C.S.D. N.Y., 102 F.Supp. 854, but thereafter refused to change his order when it appeared that all the installations had been made prior to the present lease. An appeal originally taken by the present owners of the building claiming an increased allowance to cover such fixtures was abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-16\">Thus defendant to succeed here must show error in Judge Knox\u2019s ruling that it was entitled to an award only for such trade fixtures as it installed during its term of rental. This ruling seems to us clearly right under the terms of its lease, which in Article 13 provided for termination of the lease on condemnation, and in Rider 4 for joinder of the tenant with the landlord\u2019s permission in the condemnation proceedings and for receipt by the tenant of such part of any award as may reflect certain expenses or matters not here pertinent \u201cand/or the value of any improvements made by the tenant to the extent that same were not amortized over the balance of the term of the lease.\u201d Hence any claim in the premises is that of the owners which has been finally settled on the abandonment of their appeal. Nothing is therefore due this tenant for such fixtures. We add that had the lease not been thus specific, defendant, it seems, would have had difficulty in showing the amount or the value of this rather aged machinery \u2014 its attempts to show reproduction costs led to evidence far from convincing \u2014 or even affirmative ownership or right in itself to the property claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
