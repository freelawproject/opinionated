The charge was unfair labor practices committed in Savannah, Georgia, in this Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-13\">The Board held (1) respondent guilty of violating Section 8(a)(1) because its Vice President, Fred Shearouse, interrogated Isaac Jackson, Jr., as to how he felt about an impending strike, and requested that he persuade his fellow employees not to strike; and, also (2) of violating Section 8(a)(1) and (3) in refusing to reinstate striker Joe Brown after the strike had ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-14\">On August 22, 1950, the Board had certified the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers, called Union, as exclusive bargaining agent for respondent\u2019s employees. Respondent refused to recognize the union on the ground that the Board had no jurisdiction to certify it, because at that time the parent, CIO, with which Union was af-filated, had not complied with Section 9(h) of the Act by having its officers file affidavits of Non-Communism.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-15\">Pursuant to vote, members of the Union struck on October 5, 1950, but on January 9, 1951, the strike was called off and all employees returned to work unconditionally.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-16\">Respondent\u2019s position throughout has been to deny any violation of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-17\">CIO complied with the Act on December 22, 1949, and on September 15, 1950, expelled the Union, some 20 days before the strike began on October 5th.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-18\">There is little dispute as to the facts in either charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-19\">1. Learning that those of its employees who had joined the union were about to strike, Fred Shearouse, Vice President of the Company, approached Isaac Jackson, Jr., and asked what he thought about it. The latter\u2019s reply was that he did not know. He was then asked if he would talk to the other employees and arrangements were made that he should do so and urge them not to strike. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>Pertinent parts of the testimony of both Jackson and Shearouse appear in footnotes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> &amp; <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"At_\">Under the Wagner Act, as interpreted by the Board an employer was not allowed to do anything that might in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>fluence the action of his employees in union matters. However, the present statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-4\">\u201cThe expressing of any views, arguments, or opinion, or the dissemination thereof, whether in written, printed, graphic, or visual form, shall not constitute or be evidence of an unfair labor practice under any of the provisions of this subchapter, if such expression contains no threat of reprisal or force or promise of benefit.\u201d 61 Stat. 136, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">No \u201cthreats, coercion or promise of benefits\u201d can be deduced from the testimony of either Jackson or Shearouse, and there is no other evidence to support that conclusion. It is true that Jackson was given a full day\u2019s pay, notwithstanding he consumed about two hours in visiting and talking with his fellow employees at the suggestion of Shearouse, but it requires a strained and unreasonable interpretation to say that on this ground alone he received the extra or special benefits contemplated by the section of the Act quoted. It does not appear that he held any position of any great influence with his fellow workers. What was done certainly could not have been any worse than the expression by respondent \u201cof any views, arguments, or opinions, or dissemination thereof * * * in written, printed, graphic, or visual form * * * The burden \u201cwas upon the Board to prove its charges by competent and credible evidence and not upon the Respondent to disprove them.\u201d National Labor Relations Board v. Ray Smith Transport Co., 5 Cir., 193 F.2d 142, 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">2. As to the second charge under section 8(a)(1) and (3), that Joe Brown was refused reinstatement because of his union activities, here, again, the facts are largely undisputed. He was a head fireman in charge of the boilers that provided steam power for the entire plant, who worked from one to 7 o\u2019clock, a. m., or six hours. On the day of the strike he was visited about 6:00 a. m at his post of duty by two strikers and informed that it had started. Without consulting anyone in authority, he immediately began cooling the boilers down, putting cold water in them and pulling the fires. This had the effect of stopping and preventing the operation of all machinery, thus making it impossible to resume operations at the usual hour of 7:30 a. m.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">While it is true that Brown testified he sent his helper to request his foreman, Lehman Jackson, to send someone to relieve him, none came and he walked off his job, leaving the boilers unattended. This undoubtedly created a very dangerous situation and was a violation of positive instructions that it should never be done. He must have known, since he had worked for the company many years at different times, that in 1945 a fire had broken out under similar conditions, resulting in a loss of some $200,000, and at that the time the plant had to be shut down for some six months while the sawmill was rebuilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-11\">Brown had also claimed that he did not leave his job until about 7:45 a. m., whereas the time clock showed that he checked out at 7:12 a. m., after walking some 250 yards from the boiler room to the office for that purpose, indicating that he must have left his post of duty at approximately 7:00 o\u2019clock a. m., or about the end of his regular period.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-12\">Pertinent portions of his testimony are quoted in footnote.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>He attempted to justify leaving his post of duty by the fact that he pulled the fires, cooled the boilers down and attempted to get word to his foreman, Jackson. Nevertheless he left without succeeding. Testimony of witness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>Shearouse and Lehman Jackson is also quoted in the footnotes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>&amp; </em><footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-23\">Of course, it is argued that Brown had the right to join the strike, even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>though he had not gotten any responsible relief when he checked out. It would seem as logical to say that the cashier in a store and others responsible for the protection of its contents might walk out, leaving the employer\u2019s property unattended, in such a situation, as to attempt to justify what Brown did with his knowledge of the danger. It will hardly be contended that, without a strike, the employer could be blamed for discharging him for disregarding instructions and creating such a hazardous situation. So long as the employer is not actuated by a desire to impose punishment for union activities, he is free to use his own judgment in such circumstances.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-4\">\u201cNo order of the Board shall require the reinstatement of any individual as an employee who has been suspended or discharged, or the payment to him of any back pay, if such individual was suspended or discharged for cause. * * * <em>61 </em>Stat. 136, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 160(c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-14\">The only support for the examiner\u2019s conclusion that refusal to reinstate Brown was due to union activities, rests upon inferences and suspicion, and not upon evidence as to matters where the burden of proof was, as above stated, upon the Board to prove it. National Labor Relations Board v. Ray Smith Transport Co., supra; Rubin Bros. Footwear, Inc., v. National Labor Relations Board, 5 Cir., 203 F.2d 486. In the absence of such proof the employer still has the right to discharge for just cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-15\">Enforcement is</p>\n<p id=\"A8\">Denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b205-4\">.

My duties was looking after the boilers, keeping accurate steam, taking care of the water system, seeing that we have plenty of fuel in the furnace to hold the steam, keeping boilers cleared out, blowed out from three to four times a night, and in other words, keep a, what you might call an anchor steam on the dry kiln.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-10\">*******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-11\">\u201cQ.

Was he usually there before seven? A. About from five to ten minutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-27\">\u201cQ. Were there ever any occasions when he was not there on time before October 5th, I mean. A. Well, seldom ever that would happen, but some mornings if he run, that is, if he was not there, his helper was there. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>\u201cQ. Did you ever have any occasion when either one of them was not there; I mean when both of them were not there? A. Well, I have had it like probably on maybe some Sunday morning; seldom ever would that happen, though.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-4\">\u201cQ. What would you do on those occasions? A. Well, the only thing I would do on those occasions, I let my helper go as usual, knock off time and I would hang around there and stick around there until the helper, his helper or him come, which is the head fireman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-5\">\u201cQ. You were just staying overtime then? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-6\">\u201cQ.

What instructions did he give? A. The only thing he ever told me was if any morning that I had to stay any overtime, before I go to punch out, was to report to him as to how much and how long I had stayed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-9\">\u201cQ. You mean before you stayed the overtime? Or after you worked the overtime. A. Just like if I was in the shift in the morning, and the head fireman and his helper was late coming in and I stayed half an hour, or hour, whenever my release come before I go to the punch office to punch out, I see Mr. Jackson and tell him, \u2018Sir, my release was late coming in. I made an hour or half hour overtime.\u2019 I would have to report to him about that before I even went to the punch office.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-10\">$ \u00ab \u2019H $ $ * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-11\">\u201cQ.

Well, had you done anything to cool them down about 7 o\u2019clock? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-13\">\u201cQ. When did you start cooling them down? A. I started to cool them down about, I will say 20 or 25 minutes to 7.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-14\">\u201cQ. Why did you start cooling down the furnaces at that time? A. After I had that report that the gate was clogged out with mens up there, I didn\u2019t know what time that I would have a release, and I said I would start a little ahead of time in order that I could get them cooled down before 8 o\u2019clock anyway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-15\">\u201cQ. Did you start cooling down all the furnaces? A. Yes, sir, all five of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-16\">\u201cQ. Will you tell us just what you did to each one to cool them down? A. Well, I went and speed my pump up a little bit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-17\">\u201cQ. What did the pump do? A. The pump put water into the boilers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-18\">\u201cQ. And you speeded up the pump? A. Speeded up the pump a little and fulled them up with water.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-19\">\u201cQ. And filled the boilers with water? A. With water.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-20\">\u201cQ. And then what did you do? A.

On that particular morning, I left the boiler room about, I will say around 7:35.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-23\">*******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-24\">\u201cQ. Had you been relieved at that time? A. No, sir, I had not had any release at all at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-25\">\u201cQ. Had you seen Mr. Jackson at that time? A. I hadn\u2019t seen him at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-26\">\u201cQ. Was anyone in the boiler room when you left? A. No, sir, there wasn\u2019t anyone in the boiler room. They was a millwright there. I don\u2019t know his name, but he was down to the mill that morning. He came down. If I don\u2019t make no mistake, he may full in a lubricating on the little engine that pulls the fuel down the boiler room.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-27\">*******</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-28\">Testimony of Brown \u2014 Cross Examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-29\">\u201cQ. (By Mr. Hitch) Joe, have you got any specific knowledge why you haven\u2019t been reinstated ? A. Why, no, sir, I don\u2019t have any ideas about that so much. The only thing I would say, that during my work period I have been a few times late getting to work at night. I think my boss man, Jackson, told me once or twice about that and I made that perfectly clear, that I\u2019d always try to be on time in order that none of them would have to lay over and work none of my period of time.\u201d *******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-30\">\u25a0 \u201cQ. Now, have you ever had express instructions from Lehman Jackson not to leave your post of duty till your replacement comes? A. Well, I don\u2019t remember having any question like that, with Mr. Jackson, no more than we did have a question about being late some time coming to work. We didn\u2019t have any question\u2014 .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-31\">\u201cTrial Examiner Ward: Will you fix the time of this matter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-32\">\u201cMr. Hitch: I certainly will.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-33\">\u201cQ. (By Mr. Hatch) Now, I want to follow that question up that he told you when some one was late, that you were to stay till they came. Is that right? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-34\">\u201cQ. In other words, there was somebody, some head fireman who was sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>posed to be there all the time; is that right? A. There are supposed to be, yes, sir. I have knowed helpers to stay there in place of head fireman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-5\">\u201cQ. You have known helpers to stay there ? A. Absolutely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-6\">\u201cQ. That is a pretty dangerous operation, isn\u2019t it? A. Yes, sir, it takes a man knows what he is doing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-7\">\u201cQ. And it is dangerous from a fire standpoint, isn\u2019t it? A. It is when the mill is operating, when you got them steam blowers open.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b209-8\">. Testimony\u2019 of Fred Shearouse:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-9\">\u201cQ. Have you ever had a fire in your mill? A. One in 1945.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-10\">\u201cQ. Tell us a little about that. A. Well, tlie fire started in the sawmill. I believe it was in June. And it completely destroyed the sawmill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-11\">\u201cQ. How long were you out of operation? A. For about six or seven months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-12\">\u201cQ. How much did it cost you? A. Two hundred dollars, approximately. (Evidently meaning .$200,000.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-13\">\u201cQ. Now, is your sawmill near your boiler? A. About a hundred feet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-14\">\u201cQ. Tell us a little about your operations, just as quickly as possible. A. Well, it is pretty hard to tell a layman\u2014 anyhow, we make our own fuel for the boiler \u2014 from the sawmill and the planer mill \u2014 it goes into a fuel house \u2014 all of the fuel from both places.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-15\">\u201cThe fuel house sits directly in between the sawmill and the boiler mill and it has light, fine, dry shavings as well as the green material and it is fed up against the boilers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-16\">\u201cAnd the fuel goes in there; then we take it out of there, and feed the boilers in the daytime. It is automatic and at night you have to put a man in there to shove it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-17\">\u201cQ. Tell us a little about the boiler room. A. We have two men. The head fireman is responsible for the water, which is the most hazardous part. If you try to fire a boiler with no water you will have an explosion, so we try to get pretty good men for the firemen. Then the helper is \u2014 he is just a man \u2014 you might say a common laborer to help him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-18\">\u201cQ. You have there two men on each shift? A. On each shift.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-19\">\u201cQ. Each shift? A. That is right.\u201d *******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-20\">\u201cQ. And by now you have taken all of the strikers back except Joe? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-21\">\u201cQ. Now, did you lose any time in the operations on October fifth? A. Yes, we lost about two days, I believe, in the sawmill and about one day in the planer. Of course we lost that day the day of the strike.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-25\">\u201cQ. Now, when Joe Brown asked for reinstatement did you thoroughly investigate Joe\u2019s activities? A. Yes, sir, I sure did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-26\">\u201cQ. Did Mr. Manley? A. Yes. We talked it over very carefully; went over it, all over it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-27\">\u201cQ. Over it all? A. That is right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-28\">\u201cQ. Will you explain for purposes of the record exactly why you didn\u2019t reinstate him, and won\u2019t reinstate him? A. <em>Well, there was two main reasons that I didn\u2019t think we should take him taok. One reason was that he didn\u2019t leave the toiler room seeme, and the second reason is, he cooled them down without any authority to cool the toilers down.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-29\">\u201cTrial Examiner Ward: Mr. Reporter, will you please read that last question and answer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-30\">(Record read.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-31\">\u201cQ. (By Mr. Hitch) You were out there the morning of the strike, weren\u2019t you? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-32\">\u201cQ. When did it first become apparent to you that there wasn\u2019t anybody down the boiler house? A. He came to me, Joe Brown, and told me that he had cooled the boilers down and had left them down.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-33\">* * * s\u00a1: \u00a1i: $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-34\">\u201cQ. What did you do then? A. Well, presently I saw Mr. Jackson. Of course there was a lots of confusion around. I told him that he\u2019d better send somebody down and see about the boilers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-35\">\u201cQ. Now, how far would you say it is from the boiler room, from where you talked with Joe Brown? A. It is two hundred fifty yards, I think.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-36\">\u201cQ. About what time was this? A. A little after seven o\u2019clock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-37\">\u201cQ. A little after seven o\u2019clock? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-38\">\u201cQ. Had you had any conversation with Joe Brown after he requested reinstatement? A. Yes. He was \u2014 let\u2019s see \u2014 he talked to Mr. Manley the same day of the strike \u2014 some rigamarole talk out in front of the office \u2014 so when he came back, why, I told him that I didn\u2019t think we were going to put him back but I wanted to be fair about it, and I thought it might be a good idea, since he was the only one we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>weren\u2019t putting back, to talk to Mr. Manley about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-4\">\u201cTrial Examiner Ward: Fix the time of this conversation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-5\">\u201cQ. (By Mr. Hitch) When was this? A. The day after the last man came back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-6\">\u201cQ. Now, when did the last man come back? A. He came back on the day I got notice from the union; on the tenth, I think it was. The Union called it off on the 9th and this conversation evidently was on the 10th, January the tenth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-7\">\u201cQ. Now, did you have a fireman shot (luring the strike? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-8\">\u201cQ. Who was it? A. I cannot think of his name. I don\u2019t believe I have his name.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-9\">Mr. Hitch: Roger Burke; is that who it was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-10\">\u201cThe Witness: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-11\">\u201cQ.

Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-13\">\u201cQ. He was shot while on duty? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-14\">\u201cQ. Did you have any other violence during the strike? A. Yes, sir, three days after Burke was shot, we had a truck bring us a crew into the mill and they were ambushed and I believe it was about eighteen that were shot and had to go to the hospital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-15\">\u201cQ. Did you see them? A. Yes, sir, I saw them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-16\">\u201cQ. Then, was anybody seriously injured? A. Yes, some of them were shot pretty bad; there was two of them that lost the sight of an eye, and some of them were hospitalized for about one week to two weeks. Most of them did leave the same day, though.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-17\">\u201cQ. Were those men coming in in the usual manner? A. Usual manner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-18\">\u201cQ. They weren\u2019t strikebreakers or anything like that? A. No, there was some, quite a few, of the others didn\u2019t ever enter into the strike and there was some that we had hired since the strike started.\u201d (Emphasis by the writer.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b210-19\">. Lehman Jackson gave testimony as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-20\">\u201cQ. When did you first see Joe Brown out there? A. When I first saw Joe Brown that morning?

Why, Frank comes on at seven o\u2019clock and works till one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-24\">\u201cQ. He was supposed to come on at seven and work till one? A. He was there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-26\">\u201cQ. When you saw Joe Brown there, and Kittles, what did you do? A. What did I do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-27\">\u201cQ. Yes. A. When I saw Joe Brown and Kittles I went to Frank \u2014 Frank was there standing outside the gate, and I asked Frank did he want to go in to work, and he said he didn\u2019t know, that he was afraid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-28\">\u201cAnd I said, T don\u2019t think there is going to be any harm to you if you want to go in and go to work\u2019. I said, T will go into the gate.\u2019 I said, \u2018Come on, walk in with me,\u2019 so Frank started in with me, and some of them said something to Frank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-29\">\u201cFrank stopped. He didn\u2019t go in the gate at that time, so later on, I\u2019d say about \u2014 it must have been around 20 minutes after seven or something like that, Mr. Shearouse said something to me about the boiler room, about seeing about the boiler room.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-30\">\u201cSo I sent Nix down. I told him to go down and see about the boiler room, so Nix went down to the boiler room and told me that the boilers had water in them and the fires was pulled, and during that; time it was about \u2014 I\u2019d say around 8 o\u2019clock, I asked Frank again did he want to go in, and Frank said, \u2018Yes,\u2019 he wanted to go to work. I said, \u2018Let\u2019s come on and better let\u2019s go to work', so Frank come in the gate with me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-31\">\u201cI sent Frank \u2014 I told Frank \u2014 I said, \u2018You go to the boiler room, and just wait until you get further instructions from me.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-32\">\u201cIn just a few minutes I was talking to Mr. Shearouse again and he asked me what I had done about the boiler room. I says, \u2018Wei1, I hadn\u2019t done anything. I had Frank down there to watch after them.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-33\">\u201cAnd he says, \u2018Well, go down there and tell \u2014 have a couple of them fired up. We will pull the kilns and we will unload some of those logs.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-34\">\u201cI went on down there, and when I got to the boiler room, Frank had the water hose, and a pile was out on the floor in front of the trough which comes into the boiler. It was piled up, I\u2019d say, 12 inches of the boiler.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-35\">\u201cQ. Within 12 inches of the boiler? A. Yes, the pile that feeds into the furnace, and it was on fire, and Frank had the hose out on the fire; he didn\u2019t have it completely out when I got down there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-36\">\u201cAnd I told Frank, I says, \u2018Frank, when you finish out in this fire, go ahead and fire two boilers, because we are going to unload some logs and pull the kilns.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>\u201cQ. Let me ask you: You have been working in a sawmill a long time; is that right? A. Around eighteen years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-6\">\u201cQ. If Frank hadn\u2019t gotten down there w-hen he did, what is your estimate of the time that fire would have got in the what you call <em>the </em>\u2014 A. Fuel house? From the looks of this boiler that they got on the stand \u2014 the fuel trough \u2014 this boiler was scorched\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-7\">\u201cQ. Yes, go on. A. It would have been just a matter of minutes before that boiler would have caught on fire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-8\">\u201cQ. A matter of minutes ? A. Yes, sir, before this boiler would have caught on fire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-9\">\u201cQ. How big is that fuel house? A. It is a big thing \u2014 about twenty feet by 30-something feet floor space.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-10\">\u201cQ. It is closed in \u2014 your dust mill \u2014 A. That is right. We have shavings and dust, together, mixed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-11\">\u201cQ. As a matter of policy, what are your directions \u2014 your instructions to your firemen about leaving their post unattended? A. I have instructed all my fire-mens from way back, that \u2014 not to ever leave the boiler room if the man don\u2019t show up to relieve them except they notify me, and they always have a helper that they can send to look me up so that I can make arrangements to put another man up there without them leaving the boiler room themselves.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-17\">\u201cQ. In other words, your instructions are that they are never to leave the boilers until they are replaced; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-18\">A. That is right. I have them double up sometimes if a man don\u2019t show up. Lots of times if a man didn\u2019t show up at once they will be at my house waking me up at one o\u2019clock in the morning, and I\u2019d have to get another man \u2014 hunt a man up. I went and told them that I wanted them \u2014well, if a man didn\u2019t show up, just to go ahead and make this extra time and double over.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-19\">\u201cQ. Did you, long before this strike, tell Brown that? A. Oh, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-20\">\u201cQ. If there hadn\u2019t been any strike, and he left his place unattended, what would you have done with him? A. I would have replaced him with another man.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-21\">\u201cQ. How do you mean, \u2018replace\u2019? A. I would have fired him.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
