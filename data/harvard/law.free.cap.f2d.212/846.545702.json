Bou-dreaux filed with the National Labor Relations board, called Board, charges that the International Longshoremen\u2019s Association Local No. 1418, AFL, called Union, had and was engaged in unfair labor practices, within the meaning of Section 8(b) (1), 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(b) (1),. but for some reason the Board did not issue its complaint against the Union until May 29, 1952. The complaint recited' (Paragraph 6 and 7) that Boudreaux had', charged respondent, \u201cits officers, agents- and members, did on or about June 22,. 1949, cause\u201d the corporations named<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in Paragraph I and other stevedoring corporations doing business in the port of New Orleans, to refuse employment to-complainant because of his non-membership in respondent Union, and had continued to do so ever since.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-20\">The Trial Examiner scheduled a hearing for June 23,1952, and respondent answered on June 6th of that year, denying-the charges generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-21\">The hearing began on time and the Intermediate Report was filed on September-15, 1952, finding respondent guilty of the-charges and recommending action by the-Board.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number><footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Board approved the Examiner\u2019s findings in all respects.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b895-4\">The Board seeks enforcement and respondent opposes on the sole ground that the charges are not supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">The Examiner stated the issue as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-6\">\u201cThe gravamen of the complaint here is that the Respondent Union, after expelling Ivy P. Boudreaux from membership for reasons other than nonpayment of dues, blacklisted him from employment in the Port of New Orleans, first as a longshoreman and later in other capacities as well, and during the period covered by the complaint has caused waterfront employers to honor that blacklisting.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ayd-dedup-1\">The Taft-Hartley Act became effective August 22, 1947, but allowed contracts theretofore made between Union and employers to continue, in this instance for approximately one year. It had been entered into three days before the Act went into effect, August 19, 1947, and provided that only members of the two unions, Local 1418 and 1419 (white and colored) should \u201cbe hired * * * in the loading and unloading of ships under this contract.\u201d After the amendment, in view of Section 102, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158 note, such provisions were eliminated. Instead, the contracts, where employees are organized, require applicants, as a condition of employment, to become union members on or after the 30th day from the beginning of their employment, or the effective date of the applicable agreement, whichever is the longer.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">Local No. 1418 and 1419 were certified December 6, 1949, as having been chosen at an election by the stevedore employees. The contracts provided that men should be supplied by foremen or superintendents only. The report of the Examiner described the method of hiring as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-11\">\u201cIn actual practice longshoremen are usually hired by foremen, almost all of whom are members of the Union, although such membership has never been contractually required as a condition of their employment. Foremen are not necessarily attached to any given stevedoring company. Many work for different companies at different times as their services are required, and when not working as foremen seek employment as longshoremen on the gangs of other foremen. The hiring practices followed, generally speaking are these: Each stevedoring company has a number of regular or extra foremen listed with it. When a ship arrives in port, the stevedoring company working it will determine the number of longshore gangs required, and will contact the necessary number of foremen so that each may assemble his own gang. The hiring of longshoremen is done each day at \u2018shape-ups\u2019. Foremen seeking gangs and longshoremen seeking work appear at these \u2018shape-ups\u2019 where all hiring is done, and the gangs necessary for the day\u2019s work are assembled. A foreman who works steadily as such will usually have a steady crew that follows him about from job to job, and he will give preference to his steady men, hiring extras from whomever is around. Long<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>shoremen who are not on steady gangs will go from foreman to foreman until they succeed in finding one that requires his services for that day. Union men who are prepared to work steadily and are good workers usually experience little difficulty in finding placement on a regular gang.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">Boudreaux began work as a stevedore about 1935, joining Local No. 1418 shortly thereafter and for some ten years found no difficulty in obtaining employment in one capacity or another. In May, 1945, he was appointed secretary-treasurer by the president of said Union, A1 Chittenden, and was subsequently elected to that position by the membership. In the fall of 1947, while so serving, Boudreaux became involved, along with one Joseph Doane, the Union\u2019s vice president, in a controversy with Chitten-den, about the affairs of the Union and the manner in which they were being administered. These two filed with the South Atlantic and Gulf Coast District of the International Longshoremen\u2019s Association, charges that Chittenden had misappropriated union funds and was conducting the Union\u2019s affairs \u201cin a dictatorial manner\u201d. In turn, Chittenden induced the executive board to suspend Doane and Boudreaux upon charges of removing union records from the hall without the knowledge of the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">A hearing was had by the District Board and while Chittenden was cleared of the charge of misappropriating funds, it was found that he had assumed too much authority in conducting the Union\u2019s affairs. The Board made certain recommendations for the future handling and auditing of local accounts, as well as for \u201ca more democratic and cooperative spirit with the membership in handling the affairs of the Local\u201d. It also recommended that Doane and Boudreaux be restored to their offices without loss in pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">At subsequent meetings of Local 1418, the row between Chittenden on the one part, and Doane and Boudreaux on the other, broke out afresh, they contending he had suppressed parts of the District Board\u2019s report. Whereupon he called on the Union to again suspend them but this was voted down. Notwithstanding this action of the Union, Chittenden ordered them from the hall with the statement they were suspended. The matter again found its way to the office of International President Ryan in New York, who appointed a representative to conduct further investigation of the Local\u2019s affairs. In January, 1948, Boudreaux and Doane were again restored and were ordered to be paid their salaries while out of office.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">The controversy again went back to the Local where other members of the Union began taking part by making charges against Doane and Boudreaux, and in March, 1948, they resigned their offices. Subsequently they were formally expelled on charges not disclosed by the record. Appeals to the District authorities were unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-9\">Boudreaux has never given up the fight and it has continued on through the years.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-10\">The N.L.R.B. found that until the controversy arose between Chittenden and Boudreaux, the latter never had any trouble obtaining employment on the waterfront, including the period following his resignation as secretary-treasurer of the Union in January, 1948, and until March of that year when he was expelled. Without going into great detail, the reason for his inability to get work on the New Orleans waterfront is, we think, correctly summarized by the Trial Examiner\u2019s report quoted in footnote.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The examiner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>reviews many other instances of Chitten-den communicating with persons, both with the stevedoring companies and in the Unions, requesting that Boudreaux should not be given employment and that he be \u201cknocked off\u201d, that is, refused employment, which we also find fully supported by the record and not necessary to discuss at length here. To give a few illustrations, it appears that James Tank-erson, a walking delegate for Local No. 1419 (colored) testified that Chittenden, shortly after the expulsion of Boudreaux and Doane, stated they were no longer members of Local 1418 and requested that they be \u201cknocked off\u201d, or denied employment. Paul Guillory, also a walking delegate for Local 1419, confirmed the testimony of Tankerson about Chittenden saying that Boudreaux was no longer a member of Local 1418 and should be \u201cknocked off\u201d if he tried to get employment on the waterfront. The evasive character of the latter\u2019s testimony reflects very clearly that he told only what he was compelled to tell, but there is no doubt that all connected with the steve-doring business both on the side of employers and employees knew full well what \u201cknocking off\u201d in this instance meant.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-12\">Dave A. Dennis was president of Local 1419 and had worked as a longshoreman since 1935. He testified that in 1948 he had a telephone call from Chittenden pri- or to their convention of that year and gave testimony as indicated in the footnote.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It was respondent\u2019s contention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>that anything that happened before June 21, 1949, did not come within the period involved in the complaint. However, from the latter portion of the quotation of Dennis\u2019 testimony it appears quite clearly that Chittenden\u2019s activities extended well within the six months period preceding December 19th, 1949.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number> Exact rules of evidence applied in court trials do not have to be followed in hearings before a trial examiner, and it is sufficient if, from the whole case, there is substantial proof of the charges made in a proceeding of this kind. We find it unnecessary to indulge in an extended discussion of the delicate situation involved in a controversy of this kind, where the president of a local union is engaged in a feud with one of its members. There is naturally an unwillingness on the part of the stevedore companies to get mixed up in such matters and the ship owners are also very reluctant to do anything that might cause them trouble in their business, such as Chittenden could give them, Stevedore employees are equally averse to being drawn into opposition to one exercising power such as Chittenden wielded in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">Without further discussion, it is sufficient to say that there is ample proof in this record to support the Board\u2019s finding both as to fact and law, and its order will accordingly be</p>\n<p id=\"AUfW\">Enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b894-22\">. \u201cI.

When he reported for that assignment shortly after his expulsion, he was told that he could no longer be hired as a foreman because Wharf Superintendent Mohre of Strachan had complained that he was not producing enough work. That same afternoon, Boudreaux called on Mohre to inquire whether the reason given was. a true one. Mohre assured Boudreaux that he had always regarded him as a good work<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>er, both as a longshoreman and as a foreman. Mohre went on to explain however, that he, too, had \u2018bosses\u2019, and that he had received orders no longer to hire Boudreaux as a foreman until Boudreaux got \u2018this business straightened out with Mr. Chittenden.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">\u201cThat same day Boudreaux obtained a job with Nicky Boss, a foreman employed by Straehan, loading supplies on board ship. As has already been noted, the job of loading stores was one considered outside the coverage of the Union\u2019s closed-shop contract. Boudreaux continued to work under Nicky Boss, apparently in the same capacity, until some time toward the end of April. After the work gave out, Boudreaux never again was able to find work on the riverfront, except, as hereinafter more fully noted, as a water-boy and sack-sewer, categories carrying hourly rates about half that paid longshoremen.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b897-6\">.
