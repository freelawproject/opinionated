Appellant argues that this case is not governed by the Sam Schnitzer case, 13 T.C. 43, affirmed by this court at 183 F.2d 70, because here appellant\u2019s payment was not to Oregon Steel, but to Alaska Junk. Hence, he says, it could not be a contribution to the former\u2019s capital, particularly since he did not pay it until after his stock was sold. I think the Tax Court could properly view the transaction as one in which, pursuant to understanding, Alaska first made the advances, as contributions, on appellant\u2019s behalf, and appellant\u2019s payments were merely to reimburse Alaska. This finding of the Tax Court cannot be disturbed by us.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
