The validity of the trust receipts was attacked on the ground that they did not sufficiently describe the articles and that there had been no compliance with the provisions of the Maryland Traders Act, Code Maryland 1951 art. 2 \u00a7\u00a7 18, 20. We think that there is no merit in either of these contentions and that the decision appealed from should be affirmed on grounds adequately stated in the opinion below, which is adopted as the opinion of this court. See, D.C., 117 F.Supp. 590.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
