Prior to this sale, the automobile had been driven more than 8,000 miles by an executive of General Motors Corporation, Buiclc Motor Division. The defendant sold the car as if new, less discount for its previous service. The district court held that the vehicle was-a. \u201cused automobile\u201d within the OPS regulations' in effect at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>time of sale,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and awarded the plaintiff treble damages. D.C.N.J.1953, 116 F. Supp. 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">We do not agree. If, as defendant contends, this automobile was a \u201cdealer owned executive car,\u201d it was not a used automobile because the model admittedly had been sold by the manufacturer within the four months preceding this transaction, and plaintiff received a new car guarantee. If, as plaintiff contends, this vehicle was not a \u201cdealer owned executive car,\u201d it was a used automobile only if it previously had been sold at retail. Plaintiff claims that it had been sold at retail within the regulation because possession of it had been transferred from General Motors Corporation to its Buick Motor Division. However, plaintiff concedes that Buick Motor Division is not a separate corporation but merely a part of General Motors. Assuming that a transfer of possession equals a sale at retail,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we are unable to see how there could have been any such transfer in these circumstances. There was no transfer by any one to any one else.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">It should be noted that, effective August 23, 1952, the regulations were amended to exclude from the definition of \u201cnew automobile\u201d any car which is used prior to sale by the manufacturer, CPR 83, \u00a7 18(2); 17 Fed.Reg. 7575 (1952). Thus, as to future cases, the problem is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">The judgment of the district court is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b671-8\">. The pertinent language is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-9\">\u201c \u2018New automobile\u2019 is an automobile that has never been sold at retail. A demonstrator or dealer-owned executive car, however, is new if the model is currently being sold by the manufacturer or was sold by the manufacturer within the preceding 4 months, and if the dealer sells the demonstrator or dealer-owned executive car with a new car guarantee.\u201d CPR 83, \u00a7 18(a) (2); 16 Fed.Reg. 10595 (1951).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-14\">\u201cA used automobile is an automobile which has been sold at retail * * * A demonstrator or dealer owned executive car is a used automobile if the model is not currently being sold by the manufacturer or was not sold by the manufacturer within the preceding 4 months.\u201d OPR 94, \u00a7 11(a) (2); 16 Fed.Reg. 11641 (1951).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"abh-dedup-0\">. The regulations define a sale at retail as \u201cany sale to an ultimate user,\u201d and state that the term \u201csale\u201d means \u201csell, supply, dispose, barter, exchange, transfer and deliver * * * .\u201d CPR 94, \u00a7 11 <em>(g) </em>(1) (3); 16 Fed.Reg. 11641 (1951). From these provisions, the district court concluded that a transfer of possession is the equivalent of a sale at retail.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
