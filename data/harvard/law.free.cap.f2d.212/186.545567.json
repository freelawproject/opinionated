He has heretofore attacked, the validity of that judgment in a proceeding under Title 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255-in which he challenged the constitutionality of the statute under which he was tried and sentenced, and that remedy is-exclusive. Holloway v. Looney, 10 Cir., 207 F.2d 433; Clough v. Hunter, 10 Cir., 191 F.2d 516; Barnes v. Hunter, 10 Cir., 188 F.2d 86; Nelson v. Looney, 10 Cir., 1954, 211 F.2d 89. The petitioner not, having served the sentence under which, he is confined, is not entitled to any relief in habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-20\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b234-21\">PHILLIPS, Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A2V\">(concurring)..</p>\n<p id=\"b234-22\">I concur in the result. However, I desire to reserve the question whether,, when a prisoner has filed a motion under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255, which sets up facts entitling him to have his sentence vacated, set aside, or corrected under the provisions of that section, has supported his motion by proof, has been denied relief, and has been denied the right to prosecute an appeal in forma pauperis, the remedy under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-23\">Here, the petitioner\u2019s motion under \u00a7 2255 was wholly without merit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
