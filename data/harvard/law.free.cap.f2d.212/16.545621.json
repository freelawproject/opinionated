He reserved the right to change the beneficiary of the policy, to borrow on the policy (which right he had exercised), and to demand its cash value. However, due to loans on the policy, it had no cash value on the date of his death. Claim was made against the proceeds qf said policy, since his estate was insufficient to pay the income tax determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-19\">As the policy had no cash value, no transfer is involved that would authorize the imposition of transferee-liability against appellant wife. The failure of the husband to change the beneficiary from his wife to his estate is not a voluntary transfer of the proceeds of said policy within the meaning and scope of the Federal Transferee Statute, \u00a7 311 (a) (1), (f) of the Internal Revenue Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-20\">The appellant places strong reliance on the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in the case of Pearlman v. Commissioner, 3 Cir., 153 F.2d 560.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-21\">That case is distinguishable from the case at bar since the deceased husband in that case was insolvent prior to death, and his income-tax difficulties were in litigation prior to his death. In the present case the husband was solvent at date of death, by reason of loans on the policy it had no cash value, and he was involved in no dispute or litigation concerning his income-tax liability during his lifetime. In fact, it was not until his fiduciary filed his income-tax return that the amount of tax was determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-22\">Each of the other cases cited by ap-pellee is readily distinguishable \u2014 as to the factual situation and the questions of law involved \u2014 from the case at bar, and does not control the disposition of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-23\">Under the facts in this case, neither at common law nor under the Uniform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>Fraudulent Conveyance Act of Michigan, Comp.Laws Mich.1948, \u00a7 566.13, has there been a transfer of assets such as is contemplated under the Internal Revenue Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">See Mertens Law of Federal Income Taxation, Vol. 9, \u00a7 53.10, page 498.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Equitable Life Assurance Society v. Hitchcock, 270 Mich. 72, 258 N.W. 214, 106 A.L.R. 591.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">We believe the law should protect from the claims of creditors, and the United States is a creditor, the insurance taken out by a husband where a wife is named beneficiary, when there is no fraud, the deceased husband is solvent until the date of death, and the policy has no cash value at the date of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">We conclude that under the facts and circumstances of the present case the Tax Court was in error, and the widow--beneficiary is not liable, as a transferee, for the income-tax deficiencies of her deceased husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">The decision of the Tax Court is reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b65-15\">.
