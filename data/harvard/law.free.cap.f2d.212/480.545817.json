The sole specifications of error made on the appeal from the judgment are that the court erred in sustaining objections to the introduction of allegedly competent, relevant and material evidence offered by the appellants, and that it erred in overruling appellants\u2019 objections to the introduction of allegedly incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial evidence produced on behalf of the appellees. We have examined the record, and find that no error of a prejudicial character was committed in the respects indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-19\">The judgment is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
