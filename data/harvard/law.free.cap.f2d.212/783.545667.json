United States, 4 Cir., 194 F.2d 1012. The questions which the . motion attempted to raise related to matters connected with the trial which could be raised only by appeal. Appellant was represented on the trial by competent counsel and there is nothing to indicate a denial of due process or that the sentence was void for any other reason. It is argued that the sentence of 20 years was excessive, but it appears that appellant was sentenced for kidnapping under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201 which authorizes a sentence \u201cfor any term of years or for life\u201d. The motion was entirely without merit and the order denying it will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-25\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
