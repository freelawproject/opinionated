Every question which she presents for review that has any color of merit was answered by Judge Lemley fully and accurately in United States v. Hughey, D.C., 116 F.Supp. 649. He has stated the facts with precision and in detail and has cited an abundance of authority to sustain the Government\u2019s contention that the evidence was sufficient to make the issue of the guilt or innocence of the defendant one of fact for the jury and that the judgment entered upon the jury\u2019s verdict is unassailable. Merely to repeat or paraphrase what Judge Lem-ley has written in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal or a new trial would be unjustified.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-20\">The judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
