The sentences imposed upon Segelman were not imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States and the court had jurisdiction to impose the sentences. Segelman appealed from the judgments against him, D.C., 86 F.Supp. 114, but his appeal was dismissed by this court for want of prosecution. No question cognizable under Section 2255 was before the court below. 117 F.Supp. 507. Accordingly, the judgment appealed from will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
