F. Prichard, Sr., Aliene Power Prichard, E. F. Prichard, Jr., and Lucy Prichard.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">At the hearing on the District Court\u2019s order directing the appellant bank to show cause why it should not be punished for contempt of court in failing to obey the summons, a special .agent of the Bureau of Internal Revenue testified in substance, that from his investigation he had concluded that there was strong suspicion of a false or fraudulent tax return by E. F. Prichard, Sr., for a certain year or years prior to the statutory limitation. See sections 275, 276, Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 275, 276. The special agent was not obliged to disclose in detail the facts relative to his investigation and conclusion, nor was the District Court obliged to require proof of facts showing reasonable grounds to believe that the tax returns of E. F. Prichard, Sr., and others were false or fraudulent.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-13\">The testimony of the special agent clearly justified the District Court\u2019s judgment requiring the appellant bank to obey the summons to appear and produce the books, records, papers, and memoranda in question. Section 3633, Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3633. For the reasons stated in the opinion below, D.C., 112 F.Supp. 720, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
