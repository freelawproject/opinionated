Piatkowski.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly rendered summary judgment in favor of the defendants on his claims of spoliation of evidence and in favor of the agency on his claim of unfair trade practices in violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq., and that the court erred in striking his CUTPA claim against Ryan Ryan Deluca LLP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After examining the record and the briefs and considering the arguments of the parties, we are persuaded that the judgment rendered by the trial court should be affirmed. The issues raised by the plaintiff were resolved properly in the thoughtful and comprehensive memorandum of decision filed by the trial court. Further discussion by this court would serve no useful purpose.
