On appeal, the defendant claims that (1) the trial court erred by admitting uncharged sexual misconduct evidence, (2) the prosecutor engaged in impropriety that deprived him of the constitutional right to a fair trial, and (3) the trial court violated his right to due process at sentencing by penalizing him for exercising his fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Although we agree with the defendant that one of the prosecutor's comments was improper, we, nevertheless, conclude that the defendant was not deprived of his due process right to a fair trial. We reject the defendant's other claims, and we, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On the basis of the evidence presented at trial, the jury reasonably could have found the following facts. M is the mother of the victim. M became romantically involved with the defendant when the victim was approximately three or four years old. M had two children, G and the victim, from a previous relationship. The defendant was a father figure to the victim, and she was considered his stepdaughter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Approximately one year after the defendant and M began dating, they had a child together named A. At some point in 2000, the defendant moved in with M. They lived together with the three children, the victim, G, and A, in an apartment in Hartford until they purchased a house in 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2006 or 2007, when the victim was approximately twelve years old,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   she arrived home after school and went into her mother's bedroom to play a game on the family's computer. While she was playing on the computer, the defendant came up behind her and began kissing her neck. The victim froze. Then the defendant picked her up and threw her on the bed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   He locked the bedroom door and \"did something near the side of the bed\" before lifting up the victim's shirt and licking her breasts. The defendant proceeded to lick the victim's vagina before taking off his pants and attempting to put his penis in her vagina. The victim closed her legs, and the defendant got off of her.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Several years after that incident, on the evening of December 18, 2011, the defendant and M were involved in an incident outside of a restaurant in Newington. That evening, M had gone to the restaurant without the defendant. She was socializing with a female friend and\n   another man. The defendant, who had been waiting impatiently for her to come home, decided to go to the restaurant to find her. When he arrived, he saw M socializing with a man he did not recognize. He became angry. He confronted M in the parking lot and an argument ensued. The defendant struck M multiple times. The police arrived shortly thereafter and arrested the defendant. In January, 2012, a protective order was issued as a result of the incident. Thereafter, the defendant stopped providing financial assistance to M, and he moved out of the house and into his own apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Shortly after the defendant moved out of the house, A ceased all communication with him. The lack of communication between A and the defendant concerned M. As a result, M asked the victim to talk to A in order to figure out why A was ignoring the defendant. On February 7, 2012, the victim started a conversation with A via text messages concerning the change in her relationship with the defendant. In those communications, A told the victim that the defendant had molested her. The victim also revealed that the defendant had molested her, and the victim encouraged A to tell their mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Shortly after this conversation, the victim told M that A had been abused by the defendant. Upon learning about the abuse, M contacted A's therapist, Mary Mercado, who reported the abuse to the Department of Children and Families (department). The department referred the case to the Hartford Police Department, and Detective Frank Verrengia investigated the case. The victim and A both participated in forensic interviews in March, 2012. The victim disclosed her abuse during the forensic interview on March 8, 2012. Following an investigation, the police arrested the defendant on April 18, 2013. The case involving A, however, was administratively closed in May, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The state charged the defendant with one count of sexual assault in the first degree, one count of attempt to commit sexual assault in the first degree, and one count of risk of injury to a child. At trial, the defendant's theory of defense was that the victim and her sister both fabricated\n   the allegations of sexual abuse. Specifically, he claimed that they made these false allegations in retaliation for his having hit their mother during the restaurant incident, and for withdrawing all financial support from the family after moving out of the house. The jury found the defendant guilty on all counts. The court accepted the verdict, rendered a judgment of conviction, and sentenced the defendant to a total effective sentence of forty-five years imprisonment, execution suspended after thirty-three years, with twenty-five years of probation. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The defendant first claims that the trial court abused its discretion by permitting the state to introduce evidence regarding uncharged sexual misconduct involving A, the defendant's biological daughter. We are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to our discussion. Prior to trial, the state filed a \"notice of other evidence\" detailing the expected testimony of A regarding three incidents of the defendant's prior uncharged sexual misconduct with respect to her. The defendant filed a motion in limine seeking to preclude A's testimony concerning uncharged sexual misconduct, and the court held a hearing outside the presence of the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At the hearing, A testified that the defendant began abusing her when she was eleven years old, approximately four or five years after the sexual abuse of the\n   victim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The first incident occurred while the defendant still was living in the family's house in Hartford. A was talking to the defendant in his bedroom when he started to tongue kiss her. The defendant removed her shirt and continued kissing her, but she was able to push him off of her. She put her shirt back on and left the bedroom. The second incident occurred approximately one week later. This time the defendant attempted to remove A's shirt and touch her breasts at the family home. A was able to get away from him because her sister-in-law arrived at the house and interrupted him. The third incident occurred after the defendant had moved out of the family home to his own apartment. Again, the defendant started by tongue kissing her, and, then, he removed her shirt. The defendant was trying to touch her vagina and breasts, despite A's attempts to push him off of her. During this incident, the defendant attempted to get undressed while he continued touching A, until she suggested that they go to the movies in order to get out of the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After hearing argument from both the state and the defendant, the court issued an oral decision on the motion in limine. The court ruled that A's testimony was admissible. The court found that there were a number of similarities between the uncharged conduct and the charged offense, namely, that A was approximately the same age as was the victim at the time of the alleged abuse, that the sisters looked very similar physically, that the defendant was in a position of authority over both girls, and that the pattern of the conduct that began with kissing and progressed to touching and disrobing was consistent. Finally, the court also concluded that the evidence was more probative than prejudicial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Following the court's ruling on the uncharged misconduct, the jury heard A's testimony with regard to\n   the three instances\n   of sexual abuse perpetrated by the defendant. At the conclusion of her testimony, the court issued a limiting instruction to the jury. Also, in its final charge to the jury, the court specifically explained that \"evidence of the defendant's commission of another offense or offenses is admissible and may be considered by you for its bearing on any propensity or tendency to engage in criminal sexual behavior. However, evidence of another offense on its own is not sufficient to prove the defendant guilty of the crimes charged in the Information.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We begin by setting forth the applicable standard of review and legal principles that govern our analysis of the defendant's claim. \"The admission of evidence of ... uncharged misconduct is a decision properly within the discretion of the trial court.... [E]very reasonable presumption should be given in favor of the trial court's ruling.... [T]he trial court's decision will be reversed only where abuse of discretion is manifest or where an injustice appears to have been done.... [T]he burden to prove the harmfulness of an improper evidentiary ruling is borne by the defendant ...

Specifically, the defendant argues that the conduct involving A \"was significantly different from his conduct with [the victim], and the things they had in common were merely general similarities that occur in the majority of sexual assault cases.\" The defendant further argues that the probative value of A's testimony did not outweigh its prejudicial effect. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The first prong in our relevancy analysis requires that we evaluate the time between the charged and uncharged misconduct. Here, although the sexual abuse of the victim occurred approximately four or five years\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   prior to the abuse of A, a\n   gap in time is not dispositive in our analysis. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Antonaras\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6780205\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/137/703/#p717\">\n    137 Conn.

In fact, this court has concluded that a gap of twelve years between charged and uncharged misconduct;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=56%20A.3d%20716\">\n    id.,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 716 ; was \"not too remote to render the uncharged misconduct irrelevant to prove that the defendant had a propensity to engage in the charged abuse, particularly in light of the other two prongs.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=56%20A.3d%20716\">\n    Id., at 717\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, the gap of four or five years, in the circumstances of this case, does not render the uncharged misconduct too remote in time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As to the second prong of our relevancy analysis, namely, the similarity of the uncharged misconduct to the charged offense, the defendant argues that the conduct alleged by A is dissimilar both in frequency and severity to the charged offense. The defendant specifically claims that whereas A testified that he had molested her on three separate occasions, the victim recounted only one incident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Also, the defendant claims that the conduct involved in the charged offense was more severe than the uncharged conduct because it involved cunnilingus and attempted vaginal penetration, rather than only \"kissing and touching\" A. We are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \"It is well established that the victim and the conduct at issue need only be similar-not identical-to sustain the admission of uncharged misconduct evidence.... Additionally, differences in the severity of misconduct may not illustrate a behavioral distinction of any significance when a victim rebuffs or reports the misconduct.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Acosta\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12490069\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/164/672/#p411\">\n    326 Conn. at 416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12490069\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/164/672/#p411\">\n    164 A.3d 672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"With\n   respect to the similarity of the charged and uncharged misconduct, this court has repeatedly recognized that it need not be so unusual and distinctive as to be like a signature ....

[was] charged.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Devon D.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485081\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/849/#p668\">\n    321 Conn. 656\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 668,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485081\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/849/#p668\">\n    138 A.3d 849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In the present case, the charged and uncharged misconduct are sufficiently similar to be relevant. The incidents all occurred in the defendant's bedroom when he was alone with each girl. In each instance of abuse, the defendant began by kissing the girls before undressing them. The defendant attempted to touch each girl's breasts and vagina. A testified that she attempted to push the defendant off of her on each occasion that he kissed and touched her, and, on one occasion, the abuse only stopped because A's sister-in-law arrived at the defendant's house and interrupted the incident. Although A did not claim that the defendant performed cunnilingus during any of the incidents, or that he attempted to vaginally penetrate her, we conclude that this does \"not illustrate a behavioral distinction of any significance\" under these circumstances.

Thus, under these\n   circumstances, the court properly concluded that the defendant's conduct was sufficiently similar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Regarding the third and final relevancy prong, the similarity between the witness and the victim, the defendant argues that \"there is a qualitative difference between [the] defendant sexually abusing his own biological daughter and abusing someone unrelated to [him].\" We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   First, the trial court specifically noted that the two girls were near the same age when the abuse occurred, they are \"startlingly similar in appearance,\" and the defendant was a parental figure to both girls. Second, the defendant had lived with the victim since she was approximately five or six years old, and he was regarded as her stepfather. Indeed, he considered her to be his stepdaughter, and she considered him to be her stepfather. Considering the similarities of the two girls in this case, and the nature of the defendant's relationship with each girl, it is insignificant that the victim was his stepdaughter rather than his biological daughter.

The defendant claims that the probative value of the uncharged misconduct involving A was outweighed by its prejudicial effect.

In its oral decision, the court noted that the evidence \"is not shocking [and] doesn't unduly delay the trial.... [W]hile it's not helpful to the defendant, the probative value here strongly outweighs the prejudicial effect.\" We agree and conclude that, although the uncharged misconduct evidence was not helpful to the defendant, it was not the type of evidence that improperly would arouse the emotions of the jury. In light of the fact that the victim was regarded as the defendant's stepdaughter, the defendant's assertion that because\n   A's testimony involved incest, the uncharged misconduct was even more egregious than the charged crime, is unavailing. Moreover, the uncharged misconduct was less severe than the charged misconduct-i.e., groping versus cunnilingus and attempted vaginal penetration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Furthermore, at the conclusion of A's testimony, the court issued a limiting instruction explaining to the jury the appropriate use of uncharged misconduct evidence. Additionally, the court issued another limiting instruction in its final charge to the jury at the close of the evidence. The limiting instructions minimized any prejudicial effect of this evidence. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting A to testify regarding the uncharged sexual misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The defendant next claims that the prosecutor committed several improprieties during cross-examination and closing argument that deprived him of a fair trial.

At trial, the defendant testified on his own behalf. On both direct examination and cross-examination, the defendant denied the allegations made by both A and the victim.

The defendant essentially argues that the prosecutor mischaracterized the evidence by implying that the defendant\n   never told the police that the allegations were false. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The record reveals the following additional relevant facts and procedural history. Detective Frank Verrengia was the lead investigator for the cases involving A and the victim. Approximately three months after the girls' initial complaints, Verrengia interviewed the defendant at his attorney's office. Verrengia testified at the trial and, during his testimony, defense counsel attempted to elicit from him whether the defendant had denied the allegations made by A and the victim during that initial interview. The prosecutor objected on hearsay grounds and the court sustained the objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   During the defendant's testimony, defense counsel inquired of the defendant whether he had denied the allegations during the interview with Verrengia, and the defendant responded: \"I answered all of his questions.\" When the defendant was asked how he felt when he learned about the accusations, he said: \"My world collapsed. I was angry, I was stressed. I couldn't believe\n   my family would do something like this to me, my own daughter, my stepdaughter as well.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   On cross-examination, the prosecutor repeatedly asked the defendant whether he was able to provide Verrengia with an explanation for the allegations of sexual abuse, and he claimed that he told the detective that the victim likely was mad at him for moving out of the house and refusing to provide financial support to M.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following the defendant's testimony, the prosecutor called Verrengia as a rebuttal witness. The prosecutor asked whether the defendant provided an explanation\n   for why A would have accused him of sexual abuse, and Verrengia responded that he did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Defense counsel repeatedly referred to the timing of the girls' accusations of sexual assault against the defendant in relation to the domestic violence incident. In particular, during his cross-examination of M, defense counsel emphasized the fact that the allegations of sexual assault only surfaced a mere fifty-four days after he had been arrested for hitting M, despite the fact that the sexual assaults allegedly had occurred several years prior to his assault\n   of M. He asked M, \"[i]s the reason these allegations came out fifty-four days after [the defendant] gets arrested for hitting you because you were mad at him?\" Then, in his closing argument, defense counsel argued that the girls' allegations were fabricated and that they only made these claims of sexual abuse after the domestic violence incident with M on December 18, 2011. He also referred to the interview with Verrengia, claiming that the defendant \"denied the allegations and that was it.\" Defense counsel further argued: \"If you didn't do something, you say I didn't do it, this is false, and that's what he did.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The prosecutor, in her rebuttal argument, responded to defense counsel's closing argument, arguing that the defendant could have said \"this is all made up, [M] made these kids make this up because I hit her. He doesn't say any of that. He doesn't come up with any reason why [A] would say this at all and what he says with [the victim] is he says she's mad that I left the house.\" In her final remarks, the prosecutor commented: \"Wouldn't you expect somebody who is falsely accused of this to say I cannot believe these children said this about me, I cannot believe [M] put them up to this? But that is not what he says when he's interviewed by the police and it's not what he says in the courtroom.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The defendant contends that the prosecutor mischaracterized the evidence because there was no evidence that he did not say to Verrengia that the allegations were made up. Moreover, according to the defendant, the prosecutor's comments \"injected extraneous matters into the trial by suggesting that in her experience, that was how innocent people behaved.\" The state responds that the challenged remarks had an adequate basis in the evidence and were intended to challenge the defendant's theory, raised for the first time at trial, that M had encouraged the girls to make the accusations of sexual abuse. We agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \"Claims involving prosecutorial impropriety during the course of closing arguments require a court to evaluate a prosecutor's statements not for their possible meaning, but for the manner in which the jury reasonably and likely would have understood them. Because the meaning of words and statements typically is dependent on the context in which they are used, a court must carefully consider a prosecutor's challenged statements by carefully considering their context in the entire trial, including the remainder of the state's closing argument.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    LaVoie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=158%20Conn.%20App.%20256\">\n    158 Conn.

He argued that \"if you didn't do something, you say you didn't do it, this is false, and that's what he did.\" In reiterating the defense's theory of the case, he argued: \"[I]t happened four or five years ago, but fifty-three days ... after [the defendant] hits [M] the allegations come out. After the allegations come out, the cat's out of the bag, you can't uncork that genie, it's out there.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In response, the prosecutor challenged the defendant's theory by also directing the jury to the defendant's interview with Verrengia. The prosecutor invited the jury to draw a reasonable inference from the defendant's failure to mention the domestic violence incident to Verrengia, and his inability to provide a reason to explain A's allegations. That inference was that because he did not tell Verrengia about M's motive to encourage the girls to make the allegations, the defendant never said to Verrengia: \"[M] made these kids make this up because I hit her.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Here, the prosecutor's comments regarding what the defendant did not say during the interview with Verrengia did not \"invite sheer speculation unconnected to the evidence.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Fasanelli\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=163%20Conn.%20App.%20170\">\n    163 Conn.

The jury heard evidence from Verrengia that the defendant was unable to provide a reason to Verrengia for A's accusations. Additionally, the defendant testified that he did not tell Verrengia that he had been arrested for hitting the girls' mother. The prosecutor argued that if the defendant believed that M encouraged the girls to fabricate the allegations of abuse as a response to the domestic violence incident, then he would have told Verrengia about the incident and he would have offered that explanation for the allegations during that initial interview. His own acknowledgement that he did not tell Verrengia about hitting M, and that he was unable to provide an explanation for why A would make up these allegations, support the inference that he did not say to Verrengia that these allegations are made up because he hit M.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Our review of the trial transcript convinces us that the prosecutor's remarks were not improper. Presumably, defense counsel did not believe the remarks were improper because he did not object at the time that the remarks were made. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Carlos E.\n   </em>\n   , supra, 158 Conn.

The defendant focuses on portions of the prosecutor's comments in isolation. When the closing arguments are examined in full, however, it is clear that the prosecutor's remarks simply invited the jury to draw a reasonable inference from the evidence presented at trial. Specifically, the prosecutor sought to have the jury infer from the defendant's failure to tell Verrengia about the girls' motive to falsely accuse him, that defense counsel's argument that M encouraged the girls to make these accusations was not the truth. Rather, it was simply a trial strategy developed by the defendant. Just as defense counsel offered his view of the\n   testimony regarding the defendant's interview with Verrengia, so too did the prosecutor. Accordingly, we conclude that the prosecutor did not\n   improperly refer to facts not in evidence during rebuttal argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The defendant next claims that the prosecutor appealed \"to the prejudices of the jurors against non-English speaking persons and persons of a different ethnicity through her gratuitous questioning of [the] defendant.\" He argues that the prosecutor's questioning \"injected [the] defendant's ethnicity into the case and used it in an attempt to inflame the jurors against him ....\" The defendant's claim refers to two separate portions of the prosecutor's cross-examination of the defendant, and a portion of the prosecutor's closing rebuttal argument. We address each in turn.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   First, the defendant argues that the prosecutor's question regarding Puerto Rico, and subsequent reference to Puerto Rico during rebuttal argument, improperly appealed to the jury's racial prejudices. Specifically,\n   he argues that \"[i]t was particularly offensive that the prosecutor asked [the] defendant if he had been taught in Puerto Rico that it was [alright] to sexually assault a young girl and [then argued in closing] 'that even he recognized' it was inappropriate.\" We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to this aspect of the defendant's claim. During the prosecutor's cross-examination of the defendant, with the assistance of a Spanish interpreter, the following colloquy occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: You are originally from Puerto Rico?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   \"[The Defendant]: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: And you are not say[ing] that in Puerto Rico that behavior of licking a girl's breasts or genitals would be considered okay?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   At this point, defense counsel objected claiming that the question is prejudicial, and the court instructed the prosecutor that the question should be rephrased. The prosecutor then continued:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Where you [are] originally from, were you taught that it was okay for a male to lick [the] breasts or genitals of a twelve year old girl?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   \"[The Defendant]: Can the question be repeated?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Sure.

The court instructed the prosecutor to ask the question again.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Where you were from originally, were you taught that it was okay for an adult male to lick the breasts or genitals of a twelve year old girl?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   \"[The Defendant]: No.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The prosecutor returned to this exchange during rebuttal argument, explaining to the jury that she \"was trying to elicit from the defendant ... that in any culture where [he has] been, it hasn't been okay for an adult to do that. That even he recognizes that it's not okay for an adult to basically have this kind of sexual contact with a minor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   In evaluating the defendant's claim, we are mindful that \"the line between comments that risk invoking the passions and prejudices of the jurors and those that are permissible rhetorical flourishes is not always easy to draw. The more closely the comments are connected to relevant facts disclosed by the evidence, however, the more likely they will be deemed permissible.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Albino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=312%20Conn.%20763\">\n    312 Conn. 763\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 773,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=97%20A.3d%20478\">\n    97 A.3d 478\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Contrary to the defendant's contention, the prosecutor's questions did not improperly inject the defendant's ethnicity into the trial. Although we recognize, as did the trial court, that the prosecutor's question could have been asked without the reference to Puerto Rico, we do not conclude that such a reference indicates an improper appeal to the passions or prejudices of the jury. The defendant testified on direct examination that he was born and raised in Puerto Rico and lived there until 1990, when he was approximately twenty-one years old. Thus, there was evidence that the defendant was born and raised in Puerto Rico, which the prosecutor was permitted to reference while exploring the\n   defendant's background and his views on relationships with minors. The prosecutor was not focused on Puerto Rico; she merely was making the point that having sexual relations with a twelve year old girl is impermissible in all of the United States. Again, the prosecutor certainly did not have to reference Puerto Rico in order to make this point, and, although the reference may even have been ill-advised, \"[w]e cannot ... place the weight of unconstitutionality on [this reference], taken in [its] proper context ....\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Heredia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"545249\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/253/543/#p560\">\n    253 Conn. 543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 560,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=754%20A.2d%20114\">\n    754 A.2d 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000).

Specifically, the defendant argues that his ability to speak English was not at issue in this case and, therefore, \"the prosecutor's persistent cross-examination and closing argument [on his English speaking ability] was an implicit appeal to the racial prejudices and emotions of the jurors.\" The defendant contends that the prosecutor effectively diverted the jurors' attention away from the relevant issues and invited the jury to decide the case based on their prejudices and emotions. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to the defendant's claim. From his initial court appearance, the defendant required the services of an interpreter. On direct-examination, defense counsel asked the defendant where he was born and whether he spoke English. The defendant responded that he was born in Puerto Rico and that he does not speak English. The defendant also testified that at the time that the victim claimed the sexual assault occurred, he would not have been home because he was working a second job. There\n   is nothing in the record that suggests that the defendant had claimed this alibi prior to his testimony at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   During cross-examination, the prosecutor questioned the defendant regarding his ability to speak English. The prosecutor asked the defendant approximately fourteen distinct questions concerning his ability to speak and understand English.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Our review of the record reveals that the prosecutor's questions, when viewed in the context of the defendant's entire testimony, were not improper. On direct examination, defense counsel asked the defendant if he speaks English. The defendant answered that he did not and the prosecutor explored this answer during cross-examination. During closing argument, the prosecutor relied on the defendant's subsequent admission that he, in fact, spoke some English in order to argue that he was capable of denying the allegations and claiming that M put the girls up to making the allegations against him at the beginning of the investigation, as opposed to offering this explanation for the first time at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   We agree with the trial court's conclusion that the prosecutor's inquiry was relevant and appropriate. Although the prosecutor asked several questions regarding the defendant's ability to speak English, we note that the court overruled several of defense counsel's objections during cross-examination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   When\n   defense counsel\n   objected on the basis of relevance, the prosecutor explained that her inquiry was directed at the nature of the interview in order to address what the defendant told Verrengia during that initial interview; the court agreed, and overruled the objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Our resolution of this claim is informed by our Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Heredia\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"545249\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/253/543/#p560\">\n    253 Conn. at 543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=754%20A.2d%20114\">\n    754 A.2d 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The defendant argues that, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Heredia\n   </em>\n   , his ethnicity and ability to speak English were not issues in the present case. According to the defendant, his ability to speak English was not relevant because he did not claim that he could not understand the officer's questions or that he was unable to answer questions\n   due to his inability to speak English. Our review of the record contradicts the defendant's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Although the defendant argues that his ability to speak English was not an issue in this case, his ability to communicate with Verrengia was relevant to several of his claims at trial. First, the defendant testified that he did not speak English. In fact, he claimed to have difficulty answering all of Verrengia's questions, stating: \"There were things I couldn't answer because I didn't know what he was saying because my English is not that good.\" Second, he attempted to establish an alibi for the first time at trial, testifying that he was working two jobs at the time the alleged abuse occurred, despite never revealing this to Verrengia during the initial investigation. Finally, despite his failure to mention the domestic violence incident to Verrengia, the defense's theory of the case was that these allegations simply were retaliation for that incident. Thus, the prosecutor's questions regarding the defendant's ability to speak English were relevant to her argument that he was perfectly capable of telling Verrengia these details during the initial interview. In other words, the prosecutor sought to establish that the defendant spoke and understood English well enough to have informed Verrengia about his alibi, and that the girls had a motive for accusing him of sexual abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Under these circumstances, we do not agree that the prosecutor's questions were improper. The questions, although numerous, were not \"irrelevant to the issues in the case\" and there is no indication that prosecutor attempted to challenge the defendant's need for the services of an interpreter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   D\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Having concluded in part II A of this opinion that the prosecutor's questions that required the defendant to comment on the veracity of other witnesses' testimony\n   were improper, we now must determine whether the impropriety deprived the defendant of his due process right to a fair trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   \"An appellate court's determination of whether any improper conduct by the prosecutor violated the defendant's right to a fair trial is predicated on the factors established in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"501421\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/204/523/#p540\">\n    204 Conn. 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 540,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=529%20A.2d%20653\">\n    529 A.2d 653\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987).

As the present case demonstrates, however, that general proposition is not a universal truth. In a case that pits the testimony of the defendant against that of the victim, such that the victim's version of events is directly at odds with the defendant's account of the facts, and there is no way to reconcile their conflicting testimony except to conclude that one of them is lying, it is unlikely that asking the defendant directly whether the victim is lying ever could be so prejudicial as to amount to a denial of due process.

In contrast, the victim and A testified that the defendant inappropriately touched them in a sexual manner. There was no forensic evidence in this case. Therefore, with these two diametrically opposed positions, just as in\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   , the jury was required to determine which of these two conflicting\n   stories was the truth and which was a lie. \"Thus, the answer that the defendant gave in response to the prosecutor's improper ... question, although irrelevant, could not have caused the defendant undue harm.\" Id., at 47,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=128%20A.3d%20431\">\n    128 A.3d 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to this claim. At the sentencing hearing, the state did not provide a specific recommendation for a sentence. The state simply requested a \"significant sentence\" for the defendant, while making clear that there was a mandatory minimum for the charged offenses. The state also noted that the defendant's \"unwillingness to participate in any sex offender treatment programs or to acknowledge any criminal behavior ... puts him at a much higher risk\" to reoffend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The defendant was afforded an opportunity to address the court and present additional mitigating evidence. The court heard from several individuals in support of the defendant's good character. One such\n   individual was the defendant's current romantic partner, who has a teenage daughter, with whom the defendant had been residing during the proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Before being sentenced, the defendant engaged in the following colloquy with the court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   \"[The Defendant]: The jurors found me guilty. I am innocent of these charges presented against me, and I want to appeal this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   \"The Court: Well I appreciate your position, but in a case like this, the lifetime effects on the victims can be lessened if the person who committed these acts, particularly in a familial relationship, whether father or stepfather, takes responsibility.

But how would I say sorry for something that I did not do, these are just allegations? I love my daughter; I worked really hard for them. This was hard for me. And I work hard to support this family, two, three jobs to have our home and to lose everything because of these allegations it's not fair.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   \"The Court: Well that's your decision, sir. If you wish to continue to deny it, that's your absolute right.\n   <em>\n    The court will not punish you for that\n   </em>\n   ; however,\n   <em>\n    you do not get any extra credit\n   </em>\n   .

The court considered the defendant's demeanor during the trial and his successful completion of a family violence education program. The court, however, repeated that \"in this type of case, it is most helpful to the victims to have an admission or an apology.\" Importantly, the court expressed concern that the defendant was currently living with another woman and her teenage daughter. After noting that it had \"taken all these things into account and ... tried to balance the seriousness of this offense,\" the court sentenced the defendant to a total effective sentence of forty-five years imprisonment, execution suspended after thirty-three years, to be followed by twenty-five years of probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   We begin by noting that the defendant did not object to the claimed violation of his fifth amendment rights at the sentencing hearing. Therefore, this claim is unpreserved. The defendant's claim, however, is reviewable pursuant to\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"566558\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/213/233/#p239\">\n    213 Conn. at 239-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=567%20A.2d%20823\">\n    567 A.2d 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , because the record is adequate for review and the claim that the defendant was punished for exercising his fifth amendment right is of constitutional magnitude.

Defense counsel did object to the question referencing Puerto Rico, but he did not object to the subsequent reference in closing argument. Moreover, defense counsel did not seek any curative instruction. Additionally, these comments were not frequent and the defendant's ethnicity was not central to his credibility, the critical issue in this case. Finally, the state's case was strong in that the victim's allegations were corroborated by three constancy of accusation witnesses, and A's testimony.
