We disagree and, accordingly, affirm the decision of the board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts, as found by the commissioner, and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this appeal. The claimant met the respondent in the fall of 2011. The claimant worked as a self-employed window washer, as well as a laborer, performing tasks such as roofing, siding and landscaping. At that time, the claimant and his girlfriend were expecting a child and the claimant was looking for additional work. The respondent owned several rental properties in the Manchester area and worked as a remodeling contractor. The respondent was the principal and sole member of two domestic limited liability companies, Fresh Start General Remodeling &amp; Contracting, LLC (Fresh Start), and Fresh Start Realty, LLC, both of which list their business address at 122 Oakland Street in Manchester.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Around the end of October, 2011, the respondent hired the claimant to assist him in moving from his house in Manchester to a new house in Bolton. The claimant helped the respondent pack up items in the Manchester house and helped get the Bolton house\n   ready for the move by cleaning up, painting and making the bathrooms functional. The respondent paid the claimant $8 an hour in cash for his labor\n   because he did not have his own tools and required transportation to and from work each day. For a period of less than two weeks, the claimant assisted the respondent at a Fresh Start remodeling job in Avon. The Avon job was completed by November 17, 2011, and, thereafter, the claimant went back to helping the respondent with the residential move. The respondent and his girlfriend moved into the Bolton house at the end of November, but he continued to employ the claimant to help make the house livable. The claimant performed tasks such as cutting down trees, splitting and stacking firewood, painting, putting up Sheetrock, and assisting with plumbing and laying tile. For a period of approximately eleven weeks, the claimant generally worked four to five days a week for the respondent and earned an average of $300 a week.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On January 23, 2012, the claimant filed workers' compensation claims, pursuant to the act, which stemmed from injuries that he had sustained in a car accident that occurred on January 13, 2012, while he was being driven by the respondent's girlfriend to the respondent's Bolton home where he worked. In accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 31-294c (a), the claimant filed three form 30Cs\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   in order to commence the present action: the first directed to the respondent; the second directed to Fresh Start General Remodeling &amp; Contracting, LLC; and the third directed to Fresh Start Realty, LLC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On September 14, 2012, a formal hearing was held before the commissioner on the issue of compensability of the injuries sustained by the claimant as a result of\n   the motor vehicle accident. Both the claimant and the respondent appeared at the contested hearing and testified as to the nature of the employment relationship, specifically, whether there was an employer-employee relationship between the claimant and Fresh Start on the date of the accident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The record closed on November 26, 2012, with the claimant having submitted a brief. The respondent, however, did not submit a brief. On March 26, 2013, the commissioner issued a finding and award determining that both the respondent and Fresh Start were liable for the claimant's medical bills and certain benefits (2013 finding and award). On October 29, 2013, Fresh Start filed a motion to open the 2013 finding and award on the grounds that notice to it was sent to the incorrect address, and that the respondent was incorrectly named as a respondent. The respondent subsequently filed a brief in support of the motion to open, which claimed that, as a result of this clerical error, he did not understand that the claimant was pursuing the respondent in his personal capacity, he was never afforded the opportunity to fully respond to the claimant's claim and evidence,\n   and he was not notified of the date to submit a brief and proposed findings. On March 18, 2015, the same commissioner, then acting for the eighth district, granted the motion to open, and\n   vacated the 2013 finding and award, which had determined that the respondent was personally liable for the claimant's medical bills and certain benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 30, 2015, the respondent submitted proposed findings and a brief on the merits of the personal liability claim. The claimant elected to stand on his prior filings. On that same date, the commissioner deemed the record of the formal hearing closed and the matter submitted to the commissioner for a decision. The commissioner issued a finding and award on June 2, 2015, determining that the respondent was personally liable as the employer for the claimant's medical bills and payment of benefits under the act (2015 finding and award).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 22, 2015, the respondent appealed the commissioner's 2015 finding and award to the board. On June 10, 2016, the board affirmed the 2015 finding and award entered by the commissioner. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On appeal to this court, the respondent asserts that the claimant failed to prove that he was an employee of the respondent and subject to coverage under the act, and that the respondent was not afforded reasonable due process regarding any notice that he was potentially liable as an individual. In response, the claimant argues that the commissioner correctly found that the claimant was an employee within the meaning of the act, and that the respondent was afforded due process sufficient to hold him personally liable as the employer. We agree with the claimant and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The respondent first claims that the board erred in affirming the commissioner's finding that the claimant was the respondent's \"employee\" under the act for two\n   reasons: (1) the claimant did not qualify for compensation under the act because \u00a7 31-275 (9) (B) (iv) excludes from the definition of employee any person engaged in any type of service in or about a private dwelling provided he is not \"regularly employed\" by the owner or occupier over twenty-six hours per week; and (2) the claimant was a casual laborer excluded from compensation by \u00a7 31-275 (9) (B) (ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As a threshold matter, we note that \"[t]he principles that govern our standard of review in workers' compensation appeals are well established....

Section 31-275 (9) (A) defines \"employee\" as \"any person who ... (i) [h]as entered into or works under any contract of service or apprenticeship with an employer ....\" Section 31-275 (9) (B) expressly excludes from this definition in subparagraph (ii) \"[o]ne whose employment is of a casual nature and who is employed otherwise than for the purposes of the employer's trade or business,\" and in subparagraph (iv) \"[a]ny person engaged in any type of service in or about a private dwelling provided he is not regularly employed by the owner or occupier over twenty-six hours per week.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   With this background, we first address the respondent's claim that the claimant was not regularly employed for over twenty-six hours per week and, thus, was excluded from coverage under the act pursuant to \u00a7 31-275 (9) (B) (iv). The respondent argues that the commissioner should have examined the hours worked by the claimant over a fifty-two week applicable period\n   as set forth in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Yurkovsky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"913220\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/265/816/\">\n    265 Conn. 816\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=830%20A.2d%20743\">\n    830 A.2d 743\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , our Supreme Court interpreted the phrase \"regularly employed\" in \u00a7 31-275 (9) (B) (iv), and rejected the use of averaging the hours per week worked by the claimant as a means to determine regular employment.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=830%20A.2d%20743\">\n    Id., at 821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=830%20A.2d%20743\">\n    830 A.2d 743\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Instead of employing averaging, the commissioner should examine the number of hours actually worked by the [claimant]. We conclude that regular employment is to be determined by the employer's usual practice in using an employee for a majority of the applicable time period. We look to the practice during the majority of the applicable period because we have construed regular employment to be that which is done most of the time. When it is said that an employer regularly employs an employee,\n   <em>\n    it is meant that he usually does so, or that he does so most of the time, so that such employment becomes the rule and not the exception\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=830%20A.2d%20743\">\n    Id., at 826-27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=830%20A.2d%20743\">\n    830 A.2d 743\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court also held that fifty-two weeks, or one full year, was the time period that was reasonable for determining whether the claimant in that case was \"regularly employed\" under the act.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=830%20A.2d%20743\">\n    Id., at 821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=830%20A.2d%20743\">\n    830 A.2d 743\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The present case, however, is distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   because of the difference in the length of employment between the claimant in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   and the claimant in the present case. The claimant in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   had worked for the respondents\n   as a part-time home health aide from July 1, 1995, through April 16, 1998; initially, the claimant worked between four to nine hours per week, but her hours increased substantially during tax preparation season each year.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=830%20A.2d%20743\">\n    Id., at 818\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=830%20A.2d%20743\">\n    830 A.2d 743\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court utilized a fifty-two week period in order to \"moderate the effect of seasonal and temporary impacts on employment status.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=830%20A.2d%20743\">\n    Id., at 827\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=830%20A.2d%20743\">\n    830 A.2d 743\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . By contrast, the claimant in the present\n   case had only worked for the respondent for approximately eleven weeks at the time of his injury. The holding in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   requires the commissioner to determine what the \"usual practice\" was or what was done \"most of the time.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=830%20A.2d%20743\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   The fifty-two week period used in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   is not a reasonable time period to determine if the claimant in the present case was regularly employed by the respondent. The commissioner, therefore, properly examined the eleven week period of employment to determine what the usual practice was between the respondent and the claimant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The commissioner found that the claimant had a consistent schedule over the eleven week period, worked an average of thirty-eight and one-half hours per week, and that his average weekly wage was $310. The commissioner also found that the claimant worked four to five days each week for approximately six to ten hours per day. These facts support the commissioner's conclusion that the claimant was an employee of the respondent entitled to benefits under the act. Although the commissioner found that \"most of the claimant's work was performed for purposes not associated with [the respondent's] trade or business,\" he was regularly employed during that time for more than twenty-six hours per week. We already have concluded that the commissioner's decision did not result from an incorrect application of the law to the subordinate facts, and we now conclude that the decisions did not result from an inference illegally or unreasonably drawn from them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the commissioner's conclusions on this issue must stand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We next address the respondent's claim that the claimant was a casual laborer who was excluded from\n   coverage under the act pursuant to \u00a7 31-275 (9) (B) (ii). In challenging the board's decision, the respondent argues that the commissioner's finding that the claimant was not a casual laborer is not supported by the evidence. An employee is barred from compensation under the act if the employment is both casual in nature and not for the purposes of the employer's trade or business.\n   <em>\n    Vanzant\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"523961\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/219/674/#p678\">\n    219 Conn. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=594%20A.2d%20967\">\n    594 A.2d 967\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see also\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Twiss\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1628667\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/90/444/#p452\">\n    90 Conn. 444\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 452,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=97%20A.%20328\">\n    97 A. 328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1916).

In commencing the workers' compensation action, the claimant mailed three form 30Cs, one each to the respondent, Fresh Start, and Fresh Start Realty, LLC, all addressed to 122 Oakland Street in Manchester. The respondent resided at 65 Shoddy Mill Road in Bolton. Nevertheless, there is no dispute that the respondent received all three forms. Upon receipt of the form 30C that listed \"Michael Gramegna\" as the employer, the respondent was put\n   on notice that he, as an individual, was one of three respondents potentially liable to be found as the employer of the claimant. The respondent appeared and represented Fresh Start at the first formal hearing on September 14, 2012. At that hearing, the commissioner heard testimony from the claimant, the respondent, and several witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   When the pro forma formal hearing for submission of briefs and proposed findings\n   was scheduled for November 26, 2012, however, notice of the hearing was only sent to Fresh Start's business address, 122 Oakland Street in Manchester, rather than the respondent's residential address, 65 Shoddy Mill Road in Bolton. It is undisputed, and was a matter of public record, that the respondent had moved to Bolton with his family prior to the date of the claimant's injury, as the claimant helped the respondent move as part of his employment. The notice of the pro forma formal hearing lists \"Mr. Michael Gramegna\" as \"Not Notified\" under \"Other(s),\" and he is not listed as a respondent. On March 26, 2013, the commissioner issued the 2013 finding and award, which inconsistently referred to Michael Gramegna as \"the respondent,\" or, alternatively, \"the respondent's principal.\" The respondent received the 2013 finding and award at his Bolton address on April 8, 2013, and argues that this is the first time he understood that he could be held personally liable for the claimant's injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Even if we assume, without deciding, that the respondent was deprived of due process prior to the 2013 finding and award because he was not afforded notice of the pro forma formal hearing and an opportunity to file a brief and proposed findings on the issue of personal liability, we conclude that the respondent is not entitled to relief in this appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The 2013 finding and\n   award is not the operative award in this appeal, and, in fact, that decision was vacated. The respondent suffered no due process deprivation with regard to the 2015 finding and award that he now challenges. The respondent had a full and fair opportunity to be heard on the issue of personal liability when he was given an opportunity to submit a brief and proposed findings to the commissioner prior to the 2015 finding and award. The respondent submitted proposed findings and a brief to the commissioner on April 30, 2015. The respondent was also on notice from the 2013 finding and award that the claimant sought to hold him personally liable for the claimant's injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On the basis of the forgoing, we conclude that the board properly concluded that the claimant was an employee subject to coverage under the act, and that the procedures used by the commissioner prior to the 2015 finding and award afforded the respondent sufficient due process to be held personally liable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The decision of the Workers' Compensation Review Board is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Fresh Start General Remodeling &amp; Contracting, LLC, and the Second Injury Fund are also named as respondents in this appeal. For the purposes of this opinion, any reference to the respondent is to Michael Gramegna only. No finding and award was entered with respect to Fresh Start Realty, LLC. Any references to \"Fresh Start\" in this opinion are to Fresh Start General Remodeling &amp; Contracting, LLC, which is not participating in this appeal.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Because neither the respondent nor Fresh Start possessed workers' compensation insurance coverage, the Second Injury Fund was added as an interested party to the matter. See General Statutes \u00a7 31-355 (h). The Second Injury Fund is not participating in this appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    \"The workers' compensation commission created the form 30C for use in complying with \u00a7 31-294c (a).\"\n    <em>\n     Mehan\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Stamford\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5735431\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/127/619/#p626\">\n     127 Conn.
