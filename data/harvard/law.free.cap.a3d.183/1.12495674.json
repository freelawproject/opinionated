Walker, appeals from the judgment of conviction, rendered following a jury trial, of felony murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c ; manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55a(a) ; attempt to commit robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49(a)(2) and 53a-134(a)(2) ; and criminal possession of a pistol or revolver in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-217c(a)(1). The defendant claims that the trial court (1) violated his right to confrontation by permitting a laboratory analyst to testify regarding a known DNA sample processed by another analyst in the same laboratory; (2) violated his right to due process when it declined to either strike certain testimony or grant the defendant's motion for a mistrial; (3) erred in admitting certain testimony under\n   the coconspirator exception to the hearsay rule; (4) erred in denying his motion to sever his trial from that of his codefendant; (5) erred in admitting certain evidence at trial; and (6) violated double jeopardy by convicting him of both manslaughter and felony murder. We affirm the judgment in part, and we reverse the judgment in part.\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this appeal. On the night of October 28, 2012, Anthony Adams, the codefendant in this consolidated trial, telephoned Alexis Morrison to ask if she knew \"somebody that could sell him some weed.\" Morrison called Neville Malacai Registe, the victim, to arrange for him to meet with Adams in the parking lot of her West Haven residence. When the victim received Morrison's telephone call, he was with his friend, Stephon Green, at his mother's home in New Haven. After some time, the victim and Green left in the victim's Acura. As they approached the designated parking lot, the victim called Morrison. Morrison then telephoned Adams to tell him that the victim \"was there.\" Adams replied that he had already left because the victim \"took too long ... and that Day-Day and GZ [were] going to get the weed.\" \"Day-Day\" and \"GZ\" were nicknames for Daquane Adams, who is Anthony Adams' cousin, and the defendant, respectively, both of whom Morrison knew.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   When the victim and Green arrived in the parking lot, the victim backed his car into a parking space. Green, who was rolling a marijuana joint in the front passenger seat, looked up and noticed two men approaching the Acura. He returned his attention to his task, and the victim opened the driver's door to talk to one of the men. The man, who was wearing a black bandana and who was later identified as the defendant, held a revolver inside the car and said, \"run it,\" meaning, \"give me it. It's a robbery ....\" A physical altercation ensued. The second man, later identified as Daquane Adams, stepped away from the Acura and placed a cell phone call to someone. A Toyota arrived, and a third man exited that car and asked the defendant for the gun.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The struggle over the gun continued inside the\n   victim's Acura, and someone knocked Green into the backseat. Daquane Adams and the third man pulled the defendant out of the car and, as Green was climbing back into the front passenger seat, a shot was fired. Green heard the victim say, \"oh, shit,\" and then heard a second shot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The defendant, Daquane Adams, and the third man got in the Toyota and drove toward the parking lot exit. With the victim slumped over in the driver's seat, Green pursued the Toyota. He caught up to it at the end of the street and rammed the Acura into the back of the Toyota. The victim's Acura was disabled, but the Toyota was able to be driven away. The victim died of a gunshot wound to his head.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The defendant's case was consolidated for trial with that of his codefendant, Anthony Adams.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following trial, the jury found the defendant guilty of felony murder, manslaughter in the first degree with\n   a firearm, attempt to commit robbery in the first degree, and criminal possession of a pistol or revolver. The jury found him not guilty of the charge of conspiracy to commit robbery. The court imposed a total effective sentence of forty-five years incarceration followed by ten years special parole. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The defendant first claims that he was deprived of his right to confrontation under the federal constitution when the court permitted a forensic science examiner to testify about the results of a comparison she made\n   between (1) a DNA profile she generated from crime scene evidence and (2) a DNA profile another analyst in the laboratory generated from the defendant's buccal swab, without requiring the other analyst to testify.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The following additional facts that the jury reasonably could have found are relevant to this claim. The police recovered a black bandana from the Acura and sent the bandana and the victim's bloodstain to the state's Division of Scientific Services laboratory for analysis. The police also obtained and sent additional known samples to the laboratory, including buccal swabs from the defendant, his codefendant and Daquane Adams. Although Heather Degnan, a supervisory forensics examiner, visually inspected all of the samples, including the buccal swab obtained from the defendant, per standard laboratory procedure the known samples were processed by the laboratory's \"known processing group\" (group). Degnan processed the bandana using the standard forensic DNA typing techniques used in the laboratory. She isolated DNA from two sites on the bandana and generated DNA profiles (evidentiary profiles) that contained a mixture of DNA from at least two contributors, one of which was deemed a major contributor and the other, a minor contributor. An analyst in the group generated DNA profiles from the known samples (known profiles) and sent them to Degnan. Degnan compared the evidentiary profiles she had extracted from the DNA on the bandana with the known profiles. Degnan's analysis determined\n   that the defendant was included as a major contributor to the DNA that was on the bandana.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   She also entered the evidentiary profile of the major contributor to the DNA found on the bandana into the Connecticut and national DNA databases\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and obtained a \"hit\" for the defendant because his DNA profile had been entered due to a prior felony conviction. Degnan prepared a report summarizing her findings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At trial, Tammy Murray, the detective who took the buccal swab from the defendant,\n   testified that she obtained a subpoena for nontestimonial evidence and testified about the established procedure she followed to take the sample from the defendant. The buccal swab itself was introduced into evidence along with the bandana. After Murray's testimony, the state called Degnan to testify about her analysis and findings. She first testified about the procedures she followed when analyzing the DNA found on the bandana. Degnan explained that she swabbed the bandana and generated an evidentiary profile from each side of the bandana, and that the group processed and generated the known profiles from the defendant's buccal swab and the victim's bloodstain. According to Degnan, this division of tasks took place according to \"standard operating procedure.\" The group then provided the known profiles to Degnan for comparison with the evidentiary profiles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Prior to the admission of Degnan's findings, defense counsel objected to Degnan's testimony and the admission of her report on the grounds that Degnan was not competent to testify about the known profiles and that there was a lack of foundation for this evidence. Specifically, the defendant's counsel objected because Degnan had not been formally qualified as an expert. Counsel for Anthony Adams objected on the ground that Degnan did not process the known samples herself but, rather, obtained the results \"second hand.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court,\n   <em>\n    Markle, J.\n   </em>\n   , overruled the objections and allowed Degnan to testify as to the results of her analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Degnan testified that, on the basis of her analysis and comparison, the defendant was a major contributor to the DNA found on both sides of the bandana. On cross-examination, Degnan elaborated that she had \"examined the known samples and then sent those samples to the known processing group for extraction and amplification,\" but had not been present for that stage of the process. She was, however, familiar with the group's functions. She noted that the laboratory's use of known control samples ensured that the machines used in the testing processes were working properly. She further explained that whenever a DNA profile is generated, including a known profile, it is analyzed independently by a second analyst, who also reviews the paperwork associated with that analysis to determine if the initial analyst generated the profile properly. Degnan's analysis of both the evidentiary and known profiles was independently reviewed by Dahong Sun, another DNA analyst at the laboratory, who cosigned Degnan's report. The court admitted Degnan's report\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   containing her findings but redacted it to eliminate references to the known samples of the other defendants, Anthony Adams and Daquane Adams.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On appeal, the defendant claims that he was deprived of his right to confrontation under the sixth amendment to the federal constitution when the court permitted Degnan to testify about the results of her comparison of the DNA profiles, without requiring an analyst from the known processing group to testify. The state argues that the defendant's confrontation claim was not preserved because it was not raised at trial and was not subsumed within the defendant's evidentiary objections regarding lack of competence and foundation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The state further claims\n   that had the defendant properly presented his claim as one of confrontation that was based on testimonial hearsay, as opposed to a challenge to Degnan's competence to render an opinion regarding the known profile, the state may have chosen to call the known processing group analyst, assuming he or she was available to testify.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The state argues that raising the confrontation issue for the first time on appeal amounts to an ambush on the state and the trial court. Nonetheless, as the state concedes, our Supreme Court has reviewed a confrontation claim under the bypass rule of\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"566558\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/213/233/\">\n    213 Conn. 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=567%20A.2d%20823\">\n    567 A.2d 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989), even when there was a claim of waiver.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3963702\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/289/598/#p619\">\n    289 Conn. 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 619,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=960%20A.2d%20993\">\n    960 A.2d 993\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008) ; see also\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Holley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491832\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/175/514/#p590\">\n    327 Conn. 576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 590,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491832\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/175/514/#p590\">\n    175 A.3d 514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018).

The defendant claims that the court violated his right to confrontation by allowing Degnan to testify about the results of the comparison she made, without anyone from the known processing group being called to testify. Because Degnan, the analyst who conducted the critical analysis and made the resulting findings, testified and was subject to cross-examination, we conclude that there was no confrontation clause violation, and thus this claim fails under the third prong of\n   <em>\n    Golding.\n   </em>\n   See id., at 240,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=567%20A.2d%20823\">\n    567 A.2d 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The sixth amendment to the United States constitution provides in relevant part: \"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him ....\" The sixth amendment right of confrontation extends to the states through the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.\n   <em>\n    Pointer\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1525264\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/380/400/#p403\">\n    380 U.S. 400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 403,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1525264\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/380/400/#p403\">\n    85 S.Ct. 1065\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1525264\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/380/400/#p403\">\n    13 L.Ed. 2d 923\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1965).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"In\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Washington\n   </em>\n   , [\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    541 U.S. 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    158 L.Ed. 2d 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004) ], the [United States] Supreme Court substantially revised its approach to confrontation clause claims.

Morrison was not an eyewitness to the crime; instead, she identified the defendant from a photograph in the prosecutor's office, and then in court, as the person she knew as GZ. Although the only photographs in the prosecutor's office were those of the defendants, and although Morrison only saw the defendant \"once in a blue moon,\" Morrison testified that at the time of the incident, she had known the defendant for, \"[l]ike, a couple of years.\" The prosecutor did not ask Morrison to identify the individual in the defendant's photograph. Instead, she saw the photograph during her discussion with the prosecutor about the defendant, and told the prosecutor that it was a photograph of GZ.

In the present case, the defendant has not demonstrated that the court abused its discretion by declining to strike Morrison's testimony or to declare a mistrial as a remedy for noncompliance with the discovery rules. First, the defendant has not demonstrated that the prosecutor violated Practice Book \u00a7 40-13A. As the state notes in its brief, the record does not indicate that the defendant made the written request required by \u00a7 40-13A. Additionally, Morrison's comment to the prosecutor, made prior to trial, identifying the defendant, was not a discoverable \"statement\" pursuant to \u00a7 40-13A. The term \"statement,\" as used in that section, is defined as \"(1) A written statement made by a person and signed or otherwise adopted or approved by such person; or (2) A stenographic, mechanical, electrical, or other recording, or a transcription thereof, which is a substantially verbatim recital of an oral statement made by a person and recorded contemporaneously with the making of such oral statement.\" Practice Book \u00a7 40-15.

Morrison testified that Anthony Adams asked her to arrange a marijuana purchase and that he later informed her that Daquane Adams and the defendant would be making the purchase. The defendant did not object to this testimony. The defendant only later argued that the state had failed to satisfy the foundational requirements of\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Vessichio\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"695357\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/197/644/#p653\">\n    197 Conn. at 653-60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=500%20A.2d%201311\">\n    500 A.2d 1311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , for the admission of Morrison's statements under the coconspirator exception to the hearsay rule. According to the defendant, Morrison's statements could not be used as evidence of a conspiracy for purposes of establishing a foundation for Daniels' testimony because Morrison's statements were also inadmissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   During the state's offer of proof outside the presence of the jury, Daniels testified that when Daquane Adams came to see her at work at approximately midnight on October 29, 2012, he informed her that her car had been stolen and that she should report her car as having been stolen, implying that he had been robbed. The defendant objected on the ground that there was insufficient independent evidence to establish the existence of a conspiracy. The defendant argued that the only potential evidence of a conspiracy was Morrison's testimony regarding what Anthony Adams had told her about the marijuana purchase, which, likewise, was improperly admitted under the coconspirator exception. The court sustained the objection to Daniels' testimony, reasoning that the state had not met its burden, at that time, of demonstrating that her statements were admissible under the coconspirator exception. Later in the trial, the state recalled Daniels to testify. The defendant again raised a\n   <em>\n    Vessichio\n   </em>\n   issue with respect to Daquane Adams' statements to Daniels. The court ruled that it would allow the statements into evidence but the state would \"have to tie it in at some point and ... it's subject to the tie-in.\" Daniels then testified in front of the jury that Daquane Adams had told her that he had been robbed and to report her car as stolen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The defendant also objected to two portions of Green's testimony on the ground that a conspiracy had not been established pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Vessichio\n   </em>\n   . First, the defendant objected to Green's testimony that, while the victim and the individual with the bandana struggled over the gun, a third individual approached and said, \"just give us the gun ....\" The court overruled the objection, finding that the statement was admissible both under the coconspirator exception and to show the effect of the statement on Green. Second, the defendant objected to Green's testimony that the individual with the bandana said, \"run it,\" which Green understood to mean that this was a robbery. The court also overruled the second objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Later, Bello testified that after midnight on October 29, 2012, Anthony Adams telephoned her and asked her for a favor. The defendant objected on\n   <em>\n    Vessichio\n   </em>\n   grounds. The court overruled the objection, subject to the state \"linking it in ....\" Bello proceeded to testify that Anthony Adams had telephoned her and asked her to \"pick [Daquane Adams] up and bring him to the hospital\" because he \"had to pick keys up from the hospital.\" She stated that when she arrived to pick up Daquane Adams, the defendant was also present, and he sat in the backseat while she drove Daquane Adams to the hospital. En route to the hospital, she heard the defendant exclaim, \"[o]h, shit. Fuck.\" The defendant objected to this testimony, and the court overruled the objection. Bello testified that later that night, Anthony Adams telephoned her to thank her and said that \"some wild shit happened,\" but that \"we didn't go into details about what the wild shit [that] had happened was.\" After the state rested, the defendant renewed his objection to the hearsay statements by Morrison and Daniels regarding what Anthony Adams and Daquane Adams had said to them, respectively, and argued that the state had not proven the existence of a conspiracy sufficiently for the court to admit the coconspirator hearsay statements under the exception. The court stated that it\n   had reserved judgment on Morrison's statements and that it had let other statements in under the coconspirator exception. The court then ruled that the statements were admissible under the coconspirator exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The defendant primarily challenges the sufficiency of the state's evidence admitted to establish by a fair preponderance that a conspiracy to commit robbery existed. The defendant further contends that even assuming a conspiracy existed, there was no evidence that the defendant was a participant in that conspiracy. We conclude that the court did not err in its preliminary determination that a conspiracy existed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \"The standard of proof of a fact by a fair preponderance has been met when all the evidence considered fairly and impartially evinces a reasonable belief that it is more probable than not that the fact is true.... In reviewing a claim that the state failed to meet the threshold of proof regarding the existence of a conspiracy with the defendant as a participant to permit evidence of out-of-court statements by coconspirators, we must construe the evidence in a way most favorable to sustaining the preliminary determinations of the trial court; its conclusions will not be disturbed on appeal unless found to be clearly erroneous.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Haggood\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"731475\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/36/753/#p766\">\n    36 Conn.

He contends that the court was required to make a determination regarding the admissibility of the testimony under the coconspirator exception based only on the evidence elicited at trial prior, and not subsequent, to the admission of the testimony. We disagree, as\n   <em>\n    Vessichio\n   </em>\n   contains no such requirement. The court's conditional admission of the hearsay testimony subject to the state's later admission of the sufficient foundational evidence is permitted under \u00a7 1-3(b) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence, which provides: \"When the admissibility of evidence depends upon connecting facts, the court may admit the evidence upon proof of the connecting facts or subject to later proof of the connecting facts.\" In such an instance, \"there can be no prejudice where ... the necessary foundation is finally established.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Anonymous (83-FG)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"679093\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/190/715/#p725\">\n    190 Conn. 715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 725,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=463%20A.2d%20533\">\n    463 A.2d 533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In the present case, the state later introduced the necessary connecting facts. During their investigation, the police found a black bandana containing the defendant's DNA in the victim's Acura. The center console of the Acura contained a bullet hole, and the interior frame on the driver's side door had a ricochet mark from a bullet. The police discovered Daniels' Toyota, which had been used in the robbery and which Daquane Adams had used to drive Daniels to work earlier that night, abandoned on a street near the West Haven parking lot in which the incident had occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Bello testified that she picked up the defendant and Daquane Adams on the night of October 28, 2012, at a nearby location in West Haven. On November 1, 2012, the defendant met with his probation officer, and when his probation officer asked him to remove his sun-glasses, he noticed that the defendant's eyes were \"a deep red.\" Cell phone records showed calls between Anthony Adams and Daquane Adams during the time of the incident that utilized cell phone towers in West Haven.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The cell phone records also showed calls that evening, at the times in question, between Anthony Adams and Morrison, between Anthony Adams and Daquane Adams, and between Anthony Adams and Bello.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The defendant also argues that the court erred in relying on coconspirator hearsay testimony in reaching its determination that the hearsay testimony that it had conditionally admitted into evidence was supported by the necessary foundational evidence of a conspiracy. He contends that the court improperly failed to rely exclusively on independent evidence. We disagree. There is no indication from the record that the court improperly considered the hearsay statements in its analysis. The court mentioned coconspirator hearsay statements in addition to independent evidence when discussing whether the state had established the existence of a conspiracy by a preponderance of the evidence. Defense counsel, however, asked the court to clarify its basis, arguing that it could not \"take [into account] the coconspirator hearsay declaration statements themselves.\" The court responded by specifying that it had relied on \"the other independent evidence that was established.\" Defense counsel asked the court to clarify whether this independent evidence included Morrison's and Daniels' hearsay statements, and the court confirmed that it did not. It is clear from this colloquy that the court based its ruling only on independent evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Because\n   <em>\n    Vessichio\n   </em>\n   does not require the court to determine the admissibility of the testimony under the coconspirator exception based only on the evidence elicited at trial prior, and not subsequent, to the admission of the statement, and because the court considered independent evidence that could establish by a preponderance of the evidence that a conspiracy to rob the victim existed and that the defendant was a participant in that conspiracy, the court's admission of the challenged statements was not improper.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The defendant next claims that the court erred in denying his motion to sever his trial from that of his codefendant, Anthony Adams. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The following procedural history is relevant to this claim. Prior to the start of trial, the court,\n   <em>\n    Iannotti, J.\n   </em>\n   , granted the state's motion to consolidate the trials of the defendant and Anthony Adams. At a hearing on the motion, defense counsel stated that he was not objecting to consolidation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Prior to jury selection, the court,\n   <em>\n    Markle, J.\n   </em>\n   , questioned counsel regarding whether the joinder of the trials presented any issues under\n   <em>\n    Bruton\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1767670\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/391/123/\">\n    391 U.S. 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1767670\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/391/123/\">\n    88 S.Ct. 1620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1767670\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/391/123/\">\n    20 L.Ed. 2d 476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1968).\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court expressed concern that Anthony Adams' testimony could place the defendant at the scene of the crime. Anthony Adams' counsel stated that defense counsel \"freely admits that his client was in the vicinity around the time of the shooting and is ... claiming mere presence.\" Both counsel for the defendant and Anthony Adams stated that there were no\n   <em>\n    Bruton\n   </em>\n   issues, and that they did not object to the state's motion to consolidate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   The cases remained consolidated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   During Morrison's direct examination, and after she testified that she knew the defendant by his nickname, defense counsel moved for severance. Defense counsel argued that Morrison testified that Anthony Adams stated that \"Day-Day and GZ\" would purchase the marijuana, identifying \"Day-Day\" as Daquane Adams, and, to counsel's surprise, \"GZ\" as the defendant. Defense counsel contended that he did not know that Morrison would identify the defendant as GZ, that her identification of GZ was a result of a suggestive pretrial procedure; see part II of this opinion; and that her testimony as to Daquane Adams arguably placed the defendant at the scene of the crime. The court denied the motion for severance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Later, Danielle Zakar, an acquaintance of Anthony Adams, testified that on December 27, 2012, while Anthony Adams and another man were at her New York residence, the police arrived, causing the two men to flee. On direct examination, Zakar denied hearing Anthony Adams say why he was in New York. Joseph Thomas, a detective with the Fugitive Task Force Marshal Service, then testified, under\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Whelan,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"559597\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/200/743/\">\n    200 Conn. 743\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=513%20A.2d%2086\">\n    513 A.2d 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6502338,6503652,6503432,6503134,6503325,6503216,6503540,6502614,6502713,6502525,6502425\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/994/\">\n    479 U.S. 994\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=107%20S.%20Ct.%20597\">\n    107 S.Ct. 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=93%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20598\">\n    93 L.Ed. 2d 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986),\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   that he took Zakar's statement, in which she indicated that she had over-heard Anthony Adams state that he had killed a man in Connecticut and was now on the run from the Connecticut police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   On appeal, the defendant argues that severance was necessary because evidence was admitted at the joint trial that would not have been admissible against him at a separate trial. The evidence the defendant identifies as being inadmissible against him in a separate trial is as follows: hearsay statements Anthony Adams made to Morrison and Bello, which the defendant argues were inadmissible under the coconspirator exception to the hearsay rule; see part III of this opinion; and Zakar's statement to the police that\n   she had heard Anthony Adams say that he was on the run because he had killed someone in Connecticut. Although the defendant argues that this issue is reviewable, he did not move for severance on the basis of this evidence and, as such, his claim is unpreserved.

Murray testified that as part of the investigation, the police seized both the Acura and the Toyota, and that a black bandana was seized from the front passenger seat floor of the Acura. The prosecutor showed Murray a photograph and asked if it was an accurate representation of what the bandana looked like and where it was located before it was seized. Murray responded affirmatively. The prosecutor\n   then sought to offer the photograph as an exhibit, and defense counsel objected. During voir dire, Murray stated that she did not remember who took the photograph or whether it was taken at the scene or at the West Haven Police Department. The court admitted the photograph as a full exhibit on the basis of Murray's testimony that it was a fair and accurate representation of what she observed at the West Haven Police Department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Murray further testified on direct examination that she recognized the black bandana as being the one recovered from the Acura, that the bandana was taken into police custody, and that it remained in the possession of the West Haven Police Department prior to being sent to a laboratory for analysis. When the state sought to admit the bandana into evidence, defense counsel objected on the ground that Murray did not know the bandana's location prior to seeing it at the West Haven Police Department after the Acura had been towed to that location and, therefore, a chain of custody had not been established. The court overruled the objection, and the bandana was admitted as a full exhibit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The defendant argues that the state failed to lay a proper foundation for the admission of the photograph, the bandana, and the DNA evidence. With respect to the photograph of the bandana, the defendant contends that the state failed to establish its authenticity because Murray could not identify who took it or where it had been taken. Regarding the bandana itself and the DNA evidence derived from the bandana, the defendant argues that the state failed to establish a sufficient chain of custody because the state \"could not demonstrate that the bandana was originally in the Acura at the scene, and had not been moved or tampered with in any respect before it was seized at the police department.\" In making this argument, the defendant contends that Green had not seen the shooter without the bandana, the first officer to arrive at the scene did not see the bandana in the Acura after conducting a plain view search of the vehicle, and an inventory listed the black bandana as having been seized from the Toyota rather than from the Acura. The defendant argues that the only evidence linking the bandana to the Acura was Murray's testimony, which related to the bandana's location at the police department, not at the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   We first address the defendant's claim with respect to the photograph and conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the photograph into evidence. \"Under [the foundational] standard [for photographs], all that is required is that a photograph be introduced through a witness competent to verify it as a fair and accurate representation of what it depicts.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Swinton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8458606\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/268/781/#p802\">\n    268 Conn. 781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 802,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=847%20A.2d%20921\">\n    847 A.2d 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004). \"[T]he testimony of the photographer is not essential for the authentication of a photograph, as long as other evidence is produced that satisfies the court.\"\n   <em>\n    Gioielli\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mallard Cove Condominium Assn., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"734267\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/37/822/#p834\">\n    37 Conn.

Following the incident, Green, who was driving the Acura, followed the Toyota. The Acura became disabled after hitting the Toyota in the vicinity of Glade Street and Terrance Street in West Haven. Seth Twohill, an officer with the West Haven Police Department, arrived on the scene at approximately midnight, and saw the Acura at that location and Green attempting to revive the victim. Twohill blocked off the area with crime scene tape. Joseph D'Amato, another responding officer, testified that Green and the victim were in the Acura when he arrived, and that he did not see anyone disturbing the integrity of the crime scene. Murray testified that the Acura was later towed from its location in West Haven to\n   the West Haven Police Department. Robert Fazzino, a detective with the West Haven Police Department, and Murray testified that the black bandana was removed from the Acura. Murray further testified that the black bandana was in police custody prior to being sent to the laboratory. At trial, Murray recognized her initials on the packaging containing the bandana.
