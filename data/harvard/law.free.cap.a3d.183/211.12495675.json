Code (Repl. Vol. 2012), \u00a7 16-205.1 1 of the Transportation Article, (\"TRANSP.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In affirming the ALJ, the circuit court found\n   that there was substantial evidence supporting the ALJ's decision that Respondent did not voluntarily submit to the testing. As a result, the Maryland Department of Transportation-Motor Vehicle Administration (\"MVA\"), timely noted an appeal to the Court of Appeals. The MVA presents the following question for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   Did the administrative law judge err in dismissing an Order of Suspension for a driver who had a breath alcohol concentration test result of .18 because the investigating officer refused to allow her to visit the restroom before submitting to alcohol chemical testing, where the officer (1) had reasonable grounds to believe that she had been driving while under the influence of alcohol and (2) fully and correctly advised her of the administrative sanctions that could be imposed?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For reasons we shall explain\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , we answer the question in the affirmative, vacate the judgment of the circuit court, and remand the case with instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The administrative hearing adduced the following facts. On April 19, 2016, Officer Christopher Ditoto pulled Respondent over on Great Mills Road, near the intersection of Light Westbury Boulevard in Saint Mary's County, at approximately 2:05 am. Officer Ditoto observed Respondent operating a motor vehicle without her headlights activated. During the course of the stop, Officer Ditoto detected a strong odor of alcohol, and asked Respondent to exit the vehicle and perform field sobriety tests. After Respondent failed to execute the field sobriety tests in a satisfactory manner, Officer Ditoto\n   detained her under the suspicion that she was driving under the influence or while impaired by alcohol and transported her to the Maryland State Police barracks. While at the police barracks, Officer Ditoto read the DR-15 form (Advice of Rights) to Respondent,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   which included information regarding the nature of the detention, and the sanctions associated with any refusal to submit to a chemical test.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Officer Ditoto read the form to\n   Respondent and thereafter she signed it. Respondent asked no questions but requested to use the restroom prior to taking the chemical test, but Officer Ditoto denied the request. In testifying before the ALJ, Officer Ditoto explained why the request was denied stating, \"[s]he would not have been allowed to use the bathroom until after the [i]ntoximeter.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   After deciding to submit to testing, the subsequent test revealed a blood alcohol concentration of 0.18, more than twice the legal limit, of 0.08.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Administrative Proceedings\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Office of Administrative Hearings heard the matter on August 31, 2016 and November 16, 2016. On the first day of the hearing, the ALJ considered testimony from several witnesses, including Respondent and her parents. On the second day of the hearing, the ALJ considered testimony from Officer\n   Ditoto, who testified that the procedure used comported with his statutory duty under COMAR 10.35.02.08G\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and TRANSP. \u00a7 16-205.1. Additionally the ALJ heard arguments concerning Respondent's Motion for No Action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Respondent advanced several arguments, which included that she suffered from Trisomy X syndrome\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   , a cognitive disorder that severely affected her ability to understand the DR-15 form. Respondent further asserted that she desperately needed to use the restroom, and when combined with the effects of her condition, resulted in an inability to consider the choices before her. In support of this argument, Respondent's father testified that Respondent was permanently disabled, and while in some ways self-sufficient, still required continued assistance throughout her day-to-day activities. Respondent presented no other evidence to support her cognitive deficit argument, the impact of the alleged deficit, or that Officer Ditoto was aware of any alleged deficit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the conclusion of the evidence, the ALJ rendered several Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and granted Respondent's\n   Motion for No Action. Although the ALJ determined that Respondent failed to satisfy her burden of demonstrating that she did not understand the DR-15 form, the ALJ found that Respondent had been coerced by Officer Ditoto's refusal of her\n   request to use the restroom, which impacted her ability to knowingly and voluntarily submit to the alcohol chemical test required under TRANSP. \u00a7 16-205.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Circuit Court Hearing\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The MVA sought judicial review to the Circuit Court for Saint Mary's County pursuant to TRANSP. \u00a7 12-209(a)(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The circuit court considered arguments during a hearing on May 16, 2017. In its written opinion on June 19, 2017, the court determined that the ALJ decision was supported by substantial evidence in the record, and that the officer's refusal to allow Respondent to use the restroom constituted a \"road block\" that impacted Respondent's ability to exercise her statutory rights under TRANSP. \u00a7 16-205.1.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Forman v.

As such, we will determine whether there was\n   substantial evidence to support the ALJ findings while addressing the application of TRANSP. \u00a7 16-205.1\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We must consider the sufficiency of the due process afforded to Respondent and determine whether the officer's\n   actions impermissibly induced Respondent to submit to an alcohol breath test. Under TRANSP. \u00a7 16-205.1, where an officer determines that reasonable grounds exist to believe that a person has been driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, while impaired by alcohol, while so far impaired by any drug, any combination of drugs, or a combination of one or more drugs and alcohol that the person could not drive a vehicle safely, the officer \"shall\" detain the suspected driver, advise the driver of the possible administrative sanctions associated with the offense, and attempt to conduct an alcohol breath test. TRANSP. \u00a7 16-205.1(a)(2) further indicates that the operator of a motor vehicle in Maryland is \"deemed to have consented\" to a breath test that measures blood alcohol concentration if the person should be detained on presumption of driving or attempting to drive while under the influence of alcohol. The MVA asserts that Respondent was advised of her statutory rights as required by TRANSP. \u00a7 16-205.1, and that Officer Ditoto's handling of Respondent was in accordance with COMAR 10.35.02.08G. In that regard, the MVA argued that Officer Ditoto's conduct was not coercive but related to his obligation to ensure the integrity of any examination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   COMAR 10.35.02.08G. For the reasons discussed\n   <em>\n    infra,\n   </em>\n   we find that the officers' actions did not violate Respondent's due process rights and that the ALJ's determination was erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The issue before us relates to the due process afforded to individuals detained on suspicion of drunk driving. To establish a due process violation, one must demonstrate the deprivation of a protected liberty or property interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Town of La Plata v. Faison-Rosewick LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3723195\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/434/496/#p526\">\n    434 Md. 496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 526,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3723195\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/434/496/#p526\">\n    76 A.3d 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1019 (2013). The inquiry begins with the determination of the specific interest involved in the challenge, followed by an examination of the sufficiency of the process afforded to the individual. This analysis requires us to evaluate three factors articulated by this Court in,\n   <em>\n    In re Ryan W.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3723279\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/434/577/#p609\">\n    434 Md. 577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 609,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3723279\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/434/577/#p609\">\n    76 A.3d 1049\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1068 (2013). In\n   <em>\n    Ryan,\n   </em>\n   the Court compared the potential risk for deprivation against the procedure employed in order to ascertain the individual risk level.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We subsequently determined that where the risk of deprivation is substantial, and the procedure in place minimal, a due process violation exists. In determining the risk the\n   <em>\n    Ryan\n   </em>\n   court articulated the following factors which aid in the evaluation of risk: \"[1] the private interest that will be affected by the official action; [2] the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and [3] the Government's interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3723279\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/434/577/#p609\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ultimately, \"[i]n determining what process is due, this Court will balance both the government interests and the private interests affected.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3723279\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/434/577/#p609\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally, when evaluating the invocation or waiver of a due process right, the inquiry turns on whether the invocation or waiver was made knowingly and voluntarily. As we will demonstrate, the procedure afforded to Respondent did not violate due process, and her decision to submit to chemical testing was voluntary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   During the administrative hearing, Respondent asserted that Officer Ditoto violated her due process rights in refusing her request to use the restroom until she decided whether to take the test, thereby influencing whether she should submit to testing. In support, Respondent alleged that she suffered from cognitive delays that affected her understanding of the DR-15 form, exacerbated when Officer Ditoto refused her request to use the restroom. As such, Respondent perceived that her only option was to submit to testing in order to use the restroom. Although the ALJ noted that Respondent might suffer from Triple X syndrome, which could affect cognitive development, Respondent presented no evidence regarding the condition or its severity, nor did she establish any impairment evidencing that the condition affected the advisement or that she failed to understand the rights as advised. The ALJ also noted that the DR-15 form did not confuse Respondent, and that Officer Ditoto was not aware of the condition. Ultimately, the ALJ concluded that while Respondent may suffer from the condition, it did not influence her appreciation of the\n   rights as advised. Therefore, we must consider whether the refusal of a request to use the restroom constitutes coercive action sufficient to violate a detained driver's due process rights. To address this question, we must examine factors articulated by this Court in\n   <em>\n    Ryan\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Weighing competing goals: the private interest versus the governmental interest\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The first and third factors articulated by the\n   <em>\n    Ryan\n   </em>\n   Court, call for a balance between an individual's interest and any interest held by the government. Often these interests are in opposition, requiring one to yield to the other. In this case, there are two rights in opposition. On one hand, we have the individual right to due process before the imposition of State sanctions. Meaning, before the state may impose a sanction on a detained driver there must be compliance with due process requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hare v.

To protect this right there is an explicit advising requirement mandating the disclosure of rights prior to the imposition of alcohol breath testing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TRANSP. \u00a7 16-205.1. In this case, Respondent argued that the refusal of her bathroom request infringed upon her ability to decide whether to submit to testing, thereby violating her due process rights. The right to refuse to submit to alcohol testing, however, is not absolute, but subject to balancing against the State's restraint of that interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On the other hand, the State has an equally compelling interest in subjecting suspected drivers to alcohol chemical testing.

This process has been limited however because TRANSP. \u00a7 16-205.1 provides that implied consent can be withdrawn. In determining whether a due process violation has occurred, we must evaluate the interest of the respective parties as well as the process applied thereto. If a suspected driver is properly advised, that individual is free to refuse alcohol chemical testing. Since the ALJ found that Officer Ditoto advised Respondent, we can safely conclude that her due process rights were protected. When viewed in the context of\n   <em>\n    Ryan,\n   </em>\n   we see that there is a proper balance between the public or individual interest and that of the government.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ryan W.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3723279\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/434/577/#p609\">\n    434 Md. at 609\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 76 A.3d at 1068 (holding that the Court must weigh the factors to ascertain the sufficiency of the process).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Determining the extent of the risk of an erroneous deprivation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   An evaluation of the second\n   <em>\n    Ryan\n   </em>\n   factor to TRANSP. \u00a7 16-205.1 reveals that it provides sufficient protections to prevent the erroneous deprivation of constitutional rights. This factor requires an evaluation of the process applied with an eye toward the likelihood of erroneous deprivation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In addition, we must evaluate the procedures applied and any burdens resulting from additional procedures. To address this factor, we must examine the process applied. TRANSP. \u00a7 16-205.1, in relevant part provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (a)(2) Any person who drives or attempts to drive a motor vehicle on a highway or on any private property that is used by the public in general in this State is deemed to have consented, subject to the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 10-302 through 10-309, inclusive, of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, to take a test if the person should be detained on suspicion of driving or attempting to drive while under the influence of alcohol, while impaired by alcohol, while so far impaired by any drug, any combination of drugs, or a combination of one or more drugs and alcohol that the person could not drive a vehicle safely, while impaired by a controlled dangerous substance, in violation of an alcohol restriction, or in violation of \u00a7 16-813 of this title.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The plain language of the statute creates a presumption that a person implicitly consents to testing when suspected of driving while intoxicated, simply by obtaining licensing in the State. Implied consent is in some ways limited, as the statute states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (b)(1) Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, a person may not be compelled to take a test. However, the detaining officer shall advise the person that, on receipt of a sworn statement from the officer that the person was so charged and refused to take a test, or was tested and the result indicated an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   TRANSP. \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(1). This section reflects that a person cannot be compelled to submit to alcohol chemical testing despite the inherent implied consent contained\n   in TRANSP. \u00a7 16-205.1 except in instances where the driver is involved in a fatal or life threatening accident. Additionally, this section imposes a requirement that the suspected driver be apprised of the sanctions associated with the refusal to submit to testing. In\n   <em>\n    Motor Vehicle Administration v. Dove\n   </em>\n   we stated, \"[an] officer must advise a driver of consequences of refusing the alcohol concentration test, thus affording the driver the opportunity to make an informed choice.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3690802\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/413/70/#p83\">\n    413 Md. 70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 83,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3690802\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/413/70/#p83\">\n    991 A.2d 65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 73 (2010). Therefore, before testing can be imposed, the statute requires proper advisement. Specifically, drivers may not be subject to involuntary testing and are explicitly informed of this freedom prior to the administration of testing. Next, if an individual refuses testing, the refusal must be the product of a knowing, voluntary, and informed decision. Finally, the implicated driver has the opportunity to challenge the deprivation of a right during the administrative hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In sum, the application of the\n   <em>\n    Ryan\n   </em>\n   factors to TRANSP. \u00a7 16-205.1 weigh in favor of the sufficiency of the process. Here, the potential risk of deprivation is low when evaluated against the process afforded. The statute includes a process by which individuals are advised of their rights and given the opportunity to refuse testing if they so choose. A part of that advisement includes written acknowledgement, obtained through the Advice of Rights form, which outlines the potential sanctions, and affords the suspected driver the opportunity to consider whether to submit to testing. The driver also has the opportunity to challenge the sufficiency of the process as applied to them during an administrative hearing. Therefore, we determine that the current process is sufficient to protect a suspected driver's due process rights when being asked to submit to alcohol testing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Evaluating the voluntariness of the waiver\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In addressing the voluntariness of any consent to testing, this Court has stated, \"a person detained for drunk driving must be capable of making a knowing and voluntary decision to refuse the alcohol concentration test.\"\n   <em>\n    Forman v.

Once Officer Ditoto stopped Respondent for driving without activating her headlights, he detected the odor of alcohol upon approaching her vehicle. Suspecting that Respondent was driving under the influence of alcohol, he directed her to exit the vehicle and perform field sobriety tests, which she did not complete satisfactorily. These reasonable suspicions triggered TRANSP. \u00a7 16-205.1, which requires that an officer detain an individual upon reasonable suspicion. Thereafter, Respondent was taken into custody and transported to the Maryland State Police barracks, where she was provided a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Right form that contained a list of rights and the sanctions applicable to the submission or non-submission to chemical testing. Officer Ditoto read Respondent the form and thereafter she signed it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   We have previously determined that the refusal to submit to testing is appropriate when the suspected driver is advised of the consequences of that refusal, and that such a refusal is\n   complete when it is communicated to the officer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dove\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3690802\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/413/70/#p83\">\n    413 Md. at 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3690802\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/413/70/#p83\">\n    991 A.2d at 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . No such communication occurred here. No evidence was offered to demonstrate that Respondent considered refusing the testing, that any conduct influenced her decision to take the test, or that the officer's conduct affected that decision. Additionally, assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that there was a violation of Respondent's due process rights, the exclusionary rule is \"inapplicable to license suspension proceedings conducted pursuant to the Statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Motor Vehicle Administration v.

Additionally, Respondent failed to establish that the refusal of her request to use the restroom impaired her ability to appreciate the gravity of the circumstances or overcame her intention to refuse testing. Accordingly, we determine that the process applied to Respondent afforded appropriate due process protections, and the refusal to permit her to use the restroom prior to her decision whether to take the test did not justify the grant of a Motion for No Action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR SAINT MARY'S COUNTY IS VACATED.

The issue in this case is not whether there is a right to refuse testing under Md. Code Ann., Transp. (1977, 2012 Repl. Vol., 2015 Supp.) (\"TR\") \u00a7 16-205.1, \"commonly known as the 'implied consent, administrative per se\n   law,' \"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Motor Vehicle Admin. v.

TR \u00a7 16-205.1, by its plain language, legislates that a person has implicitly consented to testing. Specifically, TR \u00a7 16-205.1(a)(2) provides for \"implied consent\" as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Any person who drives or attempts to drive a motor vehicle on a highway or on any private property that is used by the public in general in this State\n   <strong>\n    is deemed to have consented\n   </strong>\n   , subject to the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 10-302 through 10-309, inclusive, of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article,\n   <strong>\n    to take a test\n   </strong>\n   if the person should be detained on suspicion of driving or attempting to drive while under the influence of alcohol, while impaired by alcohol, while so far impaired by any drug, any combination of drugs, or a combination of one or more drugs and alcohol that the person could not drive a vehicle safely, while impaired by a controlled dangerous substance, in violation of an alcohol restriction, or in violation of \u00a7 16-813 of this title.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   (Emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   If a person is detained on suspicion of driving or attempting to drive under the influence of drugs or alcohol, the person is\n   deemed to have consented to alcohol or drug testing, and is subject to a mandatory suspension of his or her driver's license for not consenting to take a test. Thus, under ordinary circumstances, if a driver decides to take an alcohol concentration test, there would be no issue of voluntariness with respect to consent,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , by operation of TR \u00a7 16-205.1, the driver is deemed to have impliedly consented to testing without an assessment of whether the driver's decision was voluntary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   An issue of voluntariness, however, could arise where, unlike in this case, a driver refuses testing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Forman v.

Under that circumstance,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , where a driver refuses alcohol concentration testing, a driver could properly raise an issue as to whether he or she was induced or coerced into refusing to take the test, thereby incurring the penalty for refusal. Rather than holding that a driver has a right to refuse to take an alcohol concentration test and that Smith's consent was voluntary,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Maj. Op. at 689-90, 691-92, 693-94, 183 A.3d at 218, 220, 220, I would hold that the issue of voluntariness is at stake only where a driver refuses to take an alcohol concentration test because, under TR \u00a7 16-205.1, a driver is deemed to have consented to such testing and the statute is designed to encourage drivers to take alcohol concentration\n   tests. In other words, I would cabin the issue of voluntariness to the situation in which a driver refuses to take an alcohol concentration test. As this Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Forman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2021750\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/332/201/#p215\">\n    332 Md. at 217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2021750\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/332/201/#p215\">\n    630 A.2d at 762\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , an \"officer certainly must not in any way induce [a] driver into\n   <strong>\n    refusing\n   </strong>\n   [an alcohol\n   concentration] test, a result running counter to [ TR \u00a7 16-205.1 ]'s purpose of encouraging drivers to submit to alcohol concentration tests.\" (Emphasis added) (citation omitted).

In short, there is no support in this Court's case law for the proposition that voluntariness can be at issue where a driver takes an alcohol concentration test. Such a determination is counterintuitive because under TR \u00a7 16-205.1 a driver is already deemed to have consented to testing without the necessity of a finding of voluntariness. Put simply, I would adopt the rationale of this Court's existing case law, which concludes that the decision to refuse to take an alcohol concentration test must be knowing and voluntary, and that voluntariness is not at issue where a driver takes an alcohol concentration test.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   For the above reasons, respectfully, I concur.

Despite TR \u00a7 16-205.1(a)(2)'s embodiment of \"implied consent,\" a person cannot be compelled to take an alcohol concentration test unless the \"person is involved in a motor vehicle accident that results in the death of, or a life[-]threatening injury to, another person and the person is detained by a police officer who has reasonable grounds to believe that the person has been driving or attempting to drive while\" impaired, TR \u00a7 16-205.1(c)(1) ; see TR \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(1) (\"Except as provided in [TR \u00a7 16-205.1 ](c) [ ], a person may not be compelled to take a test.\").

The majority opinion appears to conflate the two. It goes without saying that a driver who is stopped or detained on suspicion of driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol is entitled to a proper advisement of rights pursuant to the Advice of Rights form, which was drafted by the Motor Vehicle Administration \"[t]o assist law enforcement officers with making the advisements that TR \u00a7 16-205.1(b)\" and \"advises detained drivers of certain consequences of either failing or refusing to take an alcohol concentration test.\"\n    <em>\n     Motor Vehicle Admin. v.

Indeed, it is through the proper advisement of rights that a law enforcement officer determines whether a driver refuses or consents to testing. Under TR \u00a7 16-205.1, with proper advisement of rights, consent is deemed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
