She apportioned the $105,063.80 award as follows:\n   fifty percent or $52,531.90 payable by defendant State of New Jersey; twenty percent or $21,012.76 payable by the City of New Brunswick on behalf of defendant City Clerk Daniel Torrisi; twenty percent or $21,012.76 payable by Middlesex County on behalf of defendant County Clerk Elaine Flynn; and ten percent or $10,506.38 payable by the New Brunswick Board of Education on behalf of its secretary, defendant Richard Jannarone.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   All defendants appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As Judge Jacobson explained, this litigation \"buil[t] on\" the October 17, 2007 agreement reached with the State in another consequential election case,\n   <em>\n    Green Party of New Jersey; New Jersey Conservative Party; and New Jersey Libertarian Party, Inc. v.

The consent order in that case states: \"the provisions in N.J.S.A. 19:13-5 and 19:13-7 which, when read together, require a person certifying the signatures on a direct nominating petition to be a legally qualified voter residing within the district in which the nominee is seeking office [are] hereby declared to be void and unenforceable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The consent order committed the State to make available, through the Division of Elections, revised direct nomination petition forms by December 31, 2007.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The order cited to\n   <em>\n    Buckley v.

On March 31, 2014, Judge Jacobson decided the matter on motions and cross-motions for summary judgment by all the parties, including the Democratic and Republican State Committees who \"participated in the case as defendants pursuant to court order.\" She partially granted EON's motion by eliminating the in-district residency requirement, finding it unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The judge denied EON's request that petition circulators need not be voter-eligible-circulators continued to be required to be over eighteen, citizens, and New Jersey residents. The judge also denied EON's request that circulators in partisan primary elections not be required to be registered voters of the relevant party.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   EON's success in this litigation, the judge observed, \"changed the landscape of election law in New Jersey,\" as \"all 5.88 million registered voters in New Jersey now ha[d] expanded petition rights.\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [T]he available petition circulator base is [now] about [eleven] times higher in Bergen County, the largest jurisdiction in New Jersey, ....

After the defendants filed the appeal, the State sought a brief remand to the trial court, alleging it had discovered a form letter circulated to local governments disclosing the\n   <em>\n    Green Party\n   </em>\n   settlement. The State had not previously been able to produce any proof of efforts to communicate the terms of the\n   <em>\n    Green Party\n   </em>\n   order to the affected entities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On remand, Judge Jacobson was unconvinced the letter satisfied the State's\n   <em>\n    Green Party\n   </em>\n   obligations and constitutional requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   She found that since as late as 2011, four years after the\n   <em>\n    Green Party\n   </em>\n   consent order was signed, the State continued to promulgate model forms inconsistent with\n   <em>\n    Buckley\n   </em>\n   , the State was not entitled to modification of the award. Even in 2012, the State's website had posted a recall petition form that was \"inconsistent with\n   <em>\n    Buckley\n   </em>\n   .\" The judge also found that the State's letter did not adequately explain the unconstitutionality of local district residency requirements. Despite the communication, \"the State did not ensure that all the model forms it promulgated and continued to promulgate after the\n   <em>\n    Green Party\n   </em>\n   consent order were completely consistent with the\n   <em>\n    Buckley\n   </em>\n   decision.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The State now asserts on appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    POINT I\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   STATE DEFENDANTS ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ATTORNEY'S FEES OR COSTS AWARDED TO EON BECAUSE EON DID NOT PREVAIL ON ITS CLAIMS AGAINST STATE DEFENDANTS AND STATE DEFENDANTS WERE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FEES INCURRED BY EON AS A RESULT OF THE MUNICIPAL DEFENDANTS' RESIST[A]NCE TO THEIR CLAIMS\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   A.

Torrisi and Jannarone echo the argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Judge Jacobson found the non-State defendants liable because \"the state election statutes provide that clerks are the election officials responsible for certifying the results of petitions-not the State\" and, therefore, defendants were \"not without some fault.\" She relied on the analysis found in decisions from the First, Eighth, and Ninth Federal Circuits, holding that \"enforcement authority over unconstitutional statutes is a sufficient basis to assess liability to officials responsible for enforcing laws they did not themselves create.\" The non-State defendants cite contrary opinions from the Second, Fourth, Fifth, Seventh, and Tenth Circuits.

But, the significant overall success achieved justified EON being awarded a substantial portion of the amount requested. The judge deducted from the lodestar hours the time spent by counsel in unsuccessfully litigating the second preliminary injunction request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   When determining the appropriate amount of a counsel fee award, the court should award fees \"to the extent that the\n   litigant was successful.\"\n   <em>\n    Washington v.

Put another way, it is not \"necessarily significant that a prevailing plaintiff did not receive all the relief requested,\" as \"a plaintiff who failed to recover damages but obtained injunctive relief, or vice versa, may recover a fee award based on all hours reasonably expended if the relief obtained justified that expenditure of attorney time.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298707\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/424/#p429\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298707\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/424/#p429\">\n    at 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298707\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/424/#p429\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1933\n   </extracted-citation>\n   n.11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   However, a reduction is appropriate \"if the relief, however significant, is limited in comparison to the scope of the litigation as a whole.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298707\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/424/#p429\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298707\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/424/#p429\">\n    at 440\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298707\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/424/#p429\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1933\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If the court determines that an adjustment of the award is required to account for partial success, the court has discretion to exclude the number of hours spent litigating unsuccessful claims, to reduce the entire award, to account for limited success, or to combine both methods.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rode v.
