The primary issue is whether a contract-based cause of action exists in his favor to enforce the ten-year period where subsequent state legislation increased the registration period to fifteen years and the Commonwealth was not a party to the plea agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Neither the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania nor the Pennsylvania State Police (\"PSP\") was a party to the negotiations or the plea agreement. At the time, Megan's Law III was in effect. Based on the offense to which Appellant pled guilty, that enactment required Appellant to register as a sex offender for ten years upon his release from prison.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.1(a)(3) (superseded).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the context of the plea agreement, Appellant understood and took into account this ten-year period when he pleaded guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Appellant was released from federal custody in March 2007 and began registering his address with PSP as required under Megan's Law III.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Since then, he has satisfied all requirements imposed on him at sentencing and has complied with Megan's Law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2012, before Appellant completed his ten-year registration period, Megan's Law III was replaced by Megan's Law IV, also referred to as the Sexual Offender Registration and Notification Act (\"SORNA\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

In light of this development, PSP told Appellant in December 2012 that he would be reclassified under SORNA's three-tier system. In January 2013, PSP notified Appellant that he was deemed a Tier-1 offender,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9799.14(b)(21), and, as such, his registration term had been enlarged from ten to fifteen years.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12349012\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/173/723/#p724\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 9799.15(a)(1). Thus, Appellant's registration period is now set to expire in 2022 instead of 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Appellant filed in the Commonwealth Court's original jurisdiction an amended Petition for Review (the \"Petition\"), naming PSP as the sole respondent. In the Petition, Appellant sought mandamus relief in the form of a directive to PSP to conform Appellant's registration status to the requirements of Megan's Law III rather than SORNA. He asserted that: as a result of his plea agreement, a contract was formed between himself and the Commonwealth; the contract incorporated the ten-year period reflected under Megan's Law III; and retroactive application of SORNA's 15-year period would breach the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   PSP filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer, averring that: (a) in light of Appellant's guilty plea, Appellant is now required by statute to register for fifteen years; (b) the six-month statute of limitations for mandamus actions had expired by the time Appellant commenced this litigation; (c) in any event, the elements of mandamus-including a clear right to relief on the part of the petitioner and a mandatory, ministerial duty on the part of the respondent-are absent in view of SORNA's 15-year requirement as applied to Appellant; (d) PSP cannot be liable on a breach-of-contract theory since neither it nor the Commonwealth ever entered into an implied contract with Appellant, given that his plea agreement was with the federal government and not the state government; and (e) to the extent a breach-of-contract claim might otherwise be viable, it is barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The court disposed of PSP's preliminary objections in a published opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Konyk v.

Accordingly, the court overruled PSP's mandamus-related preliminary objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In terms of the contract claim, the court recited that Appellant's theory was that, by entering into a plea agreement with the United States with the understanding that he only had to register as a sex offender for ten years, Appellant also entered into an implied contract with the Commonwealth that incorporated Megan's Law as it existed at the time of the agreement,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Megan's Law III. The Commonwealth Court rejected this theory, however, noting that Appellant had not alleged that the\n   Commonwealth \"was involved or participated in the plea negotiations, was an intended beneficiary of the plea agreement, or benefited from the agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6819895\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/132/590/6819895/#p599\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 101 (citing\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

Super. 2015) (rejecting a nearly identical claim) ). The court thus sustained PSP's contract-related preliminary objections and dismissed the Petition with prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Threshold issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   PSP initially raises threshold issues concerning the appropriateness of Appellant having brought suit in the Commonwealth Court, and of PSP having been named as a defendant in the litigation. PSP suggests we need not reach the merits of Appellant's contract-based claims for relief because he has commenced an action in the \"wrong forum\" against the \"wrong entity.\" Brief for Appellee at 12, 13. PSP indicates that, because Appellant was sentenced in federal court, he should have brought his contract claim there. The agency adds that, in all events, it only has a ministerial role relative to Megan's Law and, as such, Appellant should have named the Commonwealth, rather than PSP, as respondent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We disagree on both points. Addressing the agency's jurisdictional argument, we note that Appellant's action (albeit mislabeled) asserts a claim against PSP based on an alleged breach of contract. Whether or not that claim is meritorious, it is a civil action against the Commonwealth government.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 102 (defining \"Commonwealth government\" to include \"departments, boards, commissions, authorities and officers and agencies of the Commonwealth\");\n   <em>\n    Machipongo Land &amp; Coal Co. v. Dep't of Envtl. Res.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"463531\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/544/271/#p274\">\n    544 Pa. 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 274,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"463531,7859468\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/676/199/\">\n    676 A.2d 199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 201 (1996) ;\n   <em>\n    Barr v.

Cmwlth. 2002). As such, it falls within the scope of the Commonwealth Court's exclusive original jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 761 (generally giving the Commonwealth Court exclusive original jurisdiction over civil actions against the Commonwealth government, subject to certain exceptions which are not presently relevant). Further, we are unaware of any authority-and PSP has not brought any to our attention-suggesting the jurisdiction conferred by Section 761 is negated where the agreement on which the claim is based was reached in a federal forum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As for PSP's contention that Appellant should not have named it as respondent, the agency portrays its role as purely ministerial and lacking any discretion or ability to make judgments concerning the length of an individual's Megan's Law registration period. However, that premise is not entirely accurate. PSP must occasionally interpret the governing statutory provisions to determine a particular registrant's obligations, particularly in cases where the statute's requirements are ambiguous in their application.

PSP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280216\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/636/403/\">\n    636 Pa. 403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280216,6787905\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/143/896/\">\n    143 A.3d 896\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016), for example, PSP construed the two-or-more-convictions predicate for lifetime registration to encompass a situation in which a defendant was convicted of multiple offenses based on the same conduct-a construction with which this Court ultimately disagreed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the present dispute, since\n   Appellant was not convicted of a Pennsylvania offense, PSP was required, initially under Megan's Law III and then under SORNA, to determine the Pennsylvania crime which is similar to his federal offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.1(a)(3) (superseded) (subjecting individuals convicted of out-of-state, foreign, or federal \"offenses similar to\" the enumerated Pennsylvania predicate offenses to a ten-year registration requirement);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280216,6787905\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/143/896/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 9799.14(b)(21) (same, albeit relative to a different list of predicate offenses).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Just as important, as PSP has enforcement authority with regard to the requirements of SORNA,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   note 3, it is responsible for taking the actions that Appellant claims violate his contractual rights. Hence, if Appellant's claim is meritorious and he is ultimately found to be entitled to a reduction in his registration period, an order directing PSP to provide the requested relief would be effectual given that agency's central role in creating and maintaining the sex-offender registry. Other jurisdictions have recognized that this factor supports the validity of naming the government agency in question as a defendant,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Schepers v. Comm'r, Ind. Dep't of Corr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3508912\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/691/909/#p913\">\n    691 F.3d 909\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 913 (7th Cir. 2012) (concluding that the Indiana state corrections department was a proper defendant in a registrant's lawsuit seeking a process to correct Indiana's sex-offender registry errors, where the department was the governmental body responsible for the creation, publication, and maintenance of the registry);\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ainscough v.

Breach-of-contract theories\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Commonwealth as a third-party beneficiary\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Appellant initially maintains that the Commonwealth is a third-party beneficiary of the agreement he reached with the United States, since Pennsylvania enacted Megan's Law and is legally entitled to enforce the Megan's Law obligations triggered by his guilty plea. With regard to the statute, he observes that Section 9795.1(a)(3) of Megan's Law III,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.1(a)(3) (superseded), was designed to ensure that persons convicted of federal crimes in Pennsylvania would have to register with PSP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Under Pennsylvania law, with certain exceptions not presently relevant, a\n   person assumes third-party beneficiary status-and, as such, has standing to recover under a contract-only where both parties to the contract express an intention to benefit the third party and that intention appears in the contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scarpitti v.

Thus, the concept of a third-party beneficiary exists to give intended beneficiaries, under certain circumstances, standing to bring suit to obtain the benefits in question.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Estate of Agnew v.

It does not exist to impose judicially-enforceable obligations on a person or entity who was not a party to the contract and may not even have known of its existence. As one federal court has aptly explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   A third-party beneficiary is one who is given rights under a contract to which that person is not a party. Obligations under such a contract, including any obligations to third parties, are created by agreement between the signatories....

Therefore, even if we assume,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , that the Commonwealth benefits in some sense from the plea agreement in question, the Petition's factual averments do not support the precept that the Commonwealth, as a purported third-party beneficiary, is subject to\n   <em>\n    legally-enforceable obligations\n   </em>\n   in favor of Appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

He offers that his own actions in pleading guilty and then staying in Pennsylvania after his release from custody reflect his agreement to be bound by the ten-year registration term under Megean's Law III. As for any actions by the Commonwealth, Appellant refers to the fact that the Legislature passed Megan's Law III with the intent that any federal conviction of a similar offense trigger the then-prescribed sex-offender registration obligations on the part of the defendant.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Brief for Appellant at 27 (arguing that, in creating Megan's Law legislation, the Commonwealth took into consideration that some offenders convicted in a non-Pennsylvania forum would be required to register in Pennsylvania).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   A contract may be implied in fact when the actions of the parties reflect a \"mutual agreement and intent to promise, [and] the agreement and promise have simply not been expressed in words.\"\n   <em>\n    Bricklayers of W.

To the extent Appellant relies on the General Assembly's prior action in passing the version of Megan's Law which was in effect at the time of his plea, there is no suggestion in the Petition that the legislative body thereby manifested an affirmative promise to federal defendants that their registration periods would remain intact notwithstanding the enactment of amendatory or replacement legislation in the post-plea timeframe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

Pennsylvania responded by passing SORNA, which aimed \"to bring the Commonwealth into substantial compliance with the [Adam Walsh Act].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12323520\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/164/1189/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9799.10 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   SORNA abandoned Megan's Law's dual classification system of ten-year reporting and lifetime reporting, replacing it with a three-tiered rubric designed to comply with the federal statute. Notably, SORNA does not govern only those convicted in a state court. SORNA's tiers, terms, and conditions also apply to federal defendants who are convicted of, or pleaded guilty to, a federal offense in a federal court. Under SORNA, an \"offender\" includes,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , one who \"on or after the effective date of this section, is, as a result of a conviction for a sexually violent offense, an inmate in a Federal correctional institution or is supervised by Federal probation authorities and who ... has a residence within this Commonwealth.\" 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9799.13(2.1)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The relationship between the relevant parties is straightforward. Through its Adam Walsh legislation, Congress urged states to pass a law creating a tiered system for supervising sexual offenders. Our General Assembly responded by enacting SORNA. In so doing, this Commonwealth agreed to supervise all federal sexual offenders in Pennsylvania. Thus, every time a federal prosecutor offers a plea bargain to a defendant who lives, works, or attends school in this Commonwealth, that prosecutor knows that the defendant will be supervised by the PSP per the terms of the bargain. The defendant also is informed by the federal court that he will be supervised by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, not by the federal government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   By enacting SORNA, this Commonwealth has agreed to accept and supervise those offenders. Through this statutory relationship, the Commonwealth has made itself a party to those federal plea bargains, and has done so willingly. To become a part of the process, the Commonwealth is not required to send a lawyer or probation officer or state trooper to the federal sentencing hearing. The Commonwealth has interposed itself implicitly, by statute. The federal prosecutor and the defendant both know this when negotiating the plea, and the PSP knows this by accepting, per the terms of SORNA, supervision of federal offenders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   An implied contract arises when the parties first agree to the obligations to be incurred. By agreeing via SORNA to accept federal sexual offenders, Pennsylvania has undertaken the obligation at issue here. It is of no moment that the parties have not expressly stated their intentions. The ongoing and systematic statutory relationship demonstrates clearly the intent of the parties to abide by this agreement. Under these circumstances, the elements of an implied contract are manifest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The effects of the Majority's contrary holding are disconcerting. Less than two years ago, this Court held that a criminal defendant is entitled to the benefit of the sexual offender reporting terms of his or her plea bargain, despite the fact that the subsequent enactment of SORNA would have altered those terms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

Our holding did not turn upon the particular venue in which the plea was taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The same considerations should animate our ruling in this case. The federal prosecutor and Konyk both agreed to the terms of a plea bargain. Both parties are entitled to the benefit of their bargain. The effect of plea bargaining on the criminal justice system, and the mutual benefits that such bargains provide, are patent and unquestionable. The only thing that distinguishes this case from\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   at this juncture is that Konyk pleaded guilty in a federal forum rather than in a state court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   distinction should not matter. The\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   considerations must apply with equal force to a federal plea bargain. Indeed, the distinction is rendered immaterial inasmuch as the Commonwealth by statute agreed to accept and supervise the federal defendants. Federal prosecutors reasonably cannot expect that the terms of their negotiated pleas are subject to alteration by state authorities. The Commonwealth must accept the offender as is, and,\n   <em>\n    per\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   , should be unable to change or revoke the bargain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Federal prosecutors will be hesitant to offer plea deals, and federal defendants will be hesitant to accept them, if those agreements are subject to subsequent state amendment. Permitting such\n   <em>\n    post hoc\n   </em>\n   changes contravenes the rationales that drove our decision in\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   . The promise of\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   has proven illusory for Konyk. There is no justification for such disparate treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Equity cannot countenance the unjust dichotomy created by the Majority's decision. Nonetheless, equity is not the basis for relief. Contract law is. SORNA creates an implied contract between the federal government and this Commonwealth. It is the existence of this contract that compels the denial of PSP's preliminary objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Konyk has demonstrated that an implied contract existed, and that no viable principle precludes facial application of our rationale and holding in\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   . These conclusions suffice to warrant denial of PSP's preliminary objections. I would remand the case to the Commonwealth Court for the case to be litigated in the normal course, and to allow for the development of a factual record sufficient to determine whether Konyk's averments entitle him to the benefits of\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   and enforcement of his plea bargain.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , note 5.

Accordingly, the Commonwealth Court overruled PSP's mandamus-related preliminary objections in this regard.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    The Commonwealth Court's conclusion in\n    <em>\n     Dougherty\n    </em>\n    that PSP's role in SORNA's statutory scheme is essentially ministerial, as it is limited to the collection and dissemination of information in the registry, and enforcement of the registration requirement, is supported by the description of PSP's duties contained in the statute itself.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9799.32.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    While, in\n    <em>\n     A.S. v. Pennsylvania State Police\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280216\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/636/403/\">\n     636 Pa. 403\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280216,6787905\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/143/896/\">\n     143 A.3d 896\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 899 (2016), this Court affirmed the grant of mandamus relief against PSP, PSP's proper-party status was not challenged. In that case, A.S. pled guilty to one count of sexual abuse of children and one count of unlawful contact, both of which were enumerated offenses for purposes of sexual offender registration. The trial court informed A.S. that he was subject to a ten-year period of registration under Megan's Law II. After the expiration of the ten-year-registration period, A.S. contacted PSP and requested they remove his name from the registry. PSP refused his request, claiming that his guilty plea to the two above-noted offenses subjected him to lifetime registration because he had two or more convictions. A.S. filed a \"Petition for Review in the Nature of a Complaint in Mandamus\" to compel PSP to remove his name from the registry. The Commonwealth Court granted A.S. relief and ordered PSP to change his designation on the registry. On appeal, this Court affirmed the award of mandamus relief, as a majority of this Court concluded that Megan's Law II required an act, a conviction, and a subsequent act to trigger lifetime registration for multiple offenses. As noted, however, PSP did not dispute that mandamus relief was appropriate if this Court sustained A.S.'s reading of the statute.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Martinez\n    </em>\n    , we addressed three consolidated cases, which arose where three defendants each were awarded identical relief on identical claims by the same trial judge.\n    <em>\n     Martinez\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12192992,12279898,12279900,12192911\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/147/517/\">\n     147 A.3d at 520\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    As the Majority notes, because this case is at the preliminary objection stage, we are bound to accept Konyk's factual averments as true.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Maj. Op. at 984, n.1 (citing\n    <em>\n     Sernovitz v. Dershaw\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280728\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/633/641/\">\n     633 Pa. 641\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280728,6835919\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/127/783/\">\n     127 A.3d 783\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 785 n.2 (2015) ). In his petition, Konyk pled that the ten-year reporting term was \"an important consideration\" in his decision to plead guilty.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Petition for Review, 10/14/2014, at 6 \u00b6 5. Accordingly, Konyk stands in a position similar to that occupied by the appellants in\n    <em>\n     Martinez\n    </em>\n    . For present purposes, the only factor that distinguishes this case from\n    <em>\n     Martinez\n    </em>\n    is the forum in which the plea was taken. This factual distinction does not serve to displace the applicability of any of the factors that we considered in reaching our\n    <em>\n     Martinez\n    </em>\n    decision. For preliminary objection purposes, there is no reason to posit some jurisprudential differentiation between the two cases, nor to deny Konyk the benefit of the\n    <em>\n     Martinez\n    </em>\n    holding.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    Of course, before Konyk might be entitled to the full relief that he seeks, he must prove his factual averments to a fact-finder. Only then would he be able to establish that the sexual offender term was a negotiated factor in his plea, and that he is entitled to specific performance of that bargain. For today, it suffices to say that Konyk's averment of the bargain is adequate to overcome PSP's preliminary objections.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
