Applicant Chris Khamnei appeals a decision of the superior court affirming the Burlington Public Works Commission's denial of his request for permits to complete plumbing work in a building he owns because he failed to identify the name of a licensed professional plumber who would perform the work. On appeal, applicant argues that the applicable statute and accompanying regulations allow property owners to perform this type of work without a plumbing license. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. The underlying facts are not disputed. Applicant owns property located in Burlington, Vermont. Applicant does not reside in the property. In February 2016, he submitted applications for two permits to perform plumbing work at the property, which he described as follows: (1) connect a hot-cold water supply to a Jacuzzi instant hot water heater, and (2) repair a deteriorated cast iron sewer-waste pipe. The city plumbing inspector determined that this work required a licensed professional plumber, and because applicant had failed to identify one, denied the permits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3. Applicant appealed to the Burlington Public Works Commission. Before the Commission, he argued that the statute exempted property owners or their maintenance workers from the obligation of having a licensed individual perform the type of work that applicant was proposing. The Commission held a hearing at which both applicant and the plumbing inspector appeared. The plumbing inspector testified regarding the scope of work that would be required to perform the tasks that applicant had listed on the permit applications. The inspector stated that to connect the water supply to the new Jacuzzi water heater would require installation of shut-off and anti-scald valves as well as an expansion tank, and that to replace the cast iron pipe would entail disconnecting branch lines and installing updated fittings. The inspector opined that this work was more than maintenance, repair, or alteration, and thus fell outside of the statutory exception to the requirement that a licensed plumber perform the work. The Commission took a narrow view of the statutory exceptions in light of the licensing and permitting laws' purpose of protecting public health, safety, and welfare. The Commission concluded that the work described was more than simple maintenance, repair, or alteration, and affirmed the plumbing inspector's decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4. Applicant appealed the Commission's decision to the superior court, which conducted an on-the-record review.

We begin with the statutory framework. Pursuant to statute, \"[a]ll plumbing and specialty work performed in Vermont shall be performed by persons licensed under [the plumbing] chapter.\" 26 V.S.A. \u00a7 2198(a). The statute contains seven exceptions to this licensing requirement. One applies to single-family owner-occupied dwellings and broadly exempts \"[a]ny plumbing and specialty work performed by an owner or the owner's regular employees.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2397920\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/141/68/#p74\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2397920\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/141/68/#p74\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00a7 2198(a)(1). The two most relevant to this appeal exempt certain types of work performed either by the owner or a regular maintenance worker on an owner's property not occupied by the owner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 7. Section 2198(a)(3) exempts from the licensing requirement work performed by \"[a] person who regularly employs a maintenance person whose duties include the maintenance\n   of plumbing on the property of that person.\" Applicant agrees that the work he proposes is not \"maintenance.\" He contends, however, that there was an error in the statutory drafting and that the statute should be read to also exempt installation. Some statutory history is necessary to understand this argument. The provision at issue was adopted in 1959, and exempted work by \"[a] person who regularly employes [sic] a maintenance man whose duties include installation and maintenance of plumbing on the property of that person.\" 1959, No. 215, \u00a7 16(c). The statute was amended in 1969 and 1980, but neither amendment changed the language of \u00a7 2198(a)(3). See 1969, No. 84, \u00a7 9; 1979, No. 122 (Adj. Sess.), \u00a7 6. In 1994, \u00a7 2198(a) was substantially amended. 1993, No. 176 (Adj. Sess.), \u00a7 18. The session law indicates the changes that were made by indicating deleted language with a bracket and asterisk while showing added language with underlining. Many changes are indicated in this manner throughout \u00a7 2198(a). Although the text of (a)(3) is not bracketed or underlined, two changes to the text appear in the session law: first, \"maintenance man\" is changed to \"maintenance person\"; and second, \"installation and\" is removed. The revised provision, which remains in effect, exempts work by \"[a] person who regularly employs a maintenance person whose duties include the maintenance of plumbing on the property of that person.\" 26 V.S.A. \u00a7 2198(a)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 8. Applicant argues that because the changes to \u00a7 2198(a)(3) were not properly notated in the session law, there was a mistake and therefore the words \"installation and\" should be read back into the statute. In construing statutes, our \"principal goal is to effectuate the intent of the Legislature.\"\n   <em>\n    Tarrant v. Dep't of Taxes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"174384\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/169/189/#p197\">\n    169 Vt. 189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 197,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"174384\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/169/189/#p197\">\n    733 A.2d 733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 739 (1999). We first look to the language and give effect to the plain meaning of the statutory language used \"because we presume that it shows the intent of the Legislature.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Papazoni\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5775944\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/159/578/#p580\">\n    159 Vt. 578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 580,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5775944\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/159/578/#p580\">\n    622 A.2d 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 503 (1993). If the language is ambiguous, \"legislative intent must be determined through consideration of the entire statute, including its subject matter, effects and consequences, as well as the reason and spirit of the law.\"\n   <em>\n    Tarrant\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"174384\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/169/189/#p197\">\n    169 Vt. at 197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"174384\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/169/189/#p197\">\n    733 A.2d at 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 9. Here, the statute as written is unambiguous. It exempts maintenance, not installation. Applicant's argument is that \"installation and\" should be read back into the statute because it was not properly removed in the session law. He asserts that removal of \"installation and\" was a mistake. Courts in general are very cautious to make changes to the express language used by the Legislature unless it is evident that the language does not promote the intent of the statute. See\n   <em>\n    In re C.S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4837613\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/158/339/#p343\">\n    158 Vt. 339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 343,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4837613\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/158/339/#p343\">\n    609 A.2d 641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 643 (1992) (\"We may correct a statute whose language does not promote the intent of the Legislature due to clerical error in transcription, writing, or redrafting.\"); see also\n   <em>\n    Cave City Nursing Home, Inc. v.

Courts supply words to a statute under very limited circumstances including where necessary \"to avoid repugnancy or inconsistency with legislative intent\" or where \"words obviously are omitted.\" 2A N. Singer and S. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 47:38 (7th ed.). The Indiana Supreme Court set forth the following test:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   courts may provide minor omissions or make minor substitutions in the enactments of the legislature where (1) such action is necessary in order to give vitality to or prevent absolute absurdity in the acts of the legislature; (2) an omission has occurred or a correction is necessary because of a clerical or typographical error; (3) the legislation, as enacted, was obviously not within the comprehension of the legislative body, and (4) the legislative intention, with respect to the enactment, is clear.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Woerner v. City of Indianapolis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1772483\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ind/242/253/\">\n    242 Ind. 253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=177%20N.E.2d%2034\">\n    177 N.E.2d 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 38 (1961).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 10. These narrow exceptions do not apply in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   While it is evident that the statutory language was altered without the proper notation in the session law, it is not obvious that the revision was done erroneously. The revisions in \u00a7 2198(a)(3) are not contrary to the purpose of the statute and do not produce an absurd result. In fact, the alterations to \u00a7 2198(a)(3) are consistent with the other changes made at that time and with the overall\n   intent of the statute. The first alteration changed \"maintenance man\" to \"maintenance person\" and this was in keeping with other changes made in the same session law to adopt gender-neutral language. Further, deleting installation from the exception is consistent with other changes made at the time, which indicate a desire by the Legislature to provide broader public protections and to define exceptions more precisely. For example, the purpose of the chapter, which is to \"protect and improve the general health and welfare of\" Vermonters through regulation and use of licensed individuals, 26 V.S.A. \u00a7 2171, was revised in 1994 to expand its reach to \"water treatment, domestic supply and hydronically related hot water heating.\" 1993 No. 176 (Adj. Sess.), \u00a7 1. In addition, the change to the owner-occupied exception in \u00a7 2198(a)(1) made at the same time supports a conclusion that \"installation and\" in \u00a7 2198(a)(3) was purposefully removed. The exception related to work in an owner-occupied dwelling was revised to delete the reference to \"Installation and maintenance\" and replace it with \"Any plumbing and specialty work.\" 1993 No. 176 (Adj. Sess.), \u00a7 18. It is logical that the Legislature would make the exception for work done by an owner in an owner-occupied single dwelling broader than the exception for work done by a maintenance person in a rental property because the need for public protection is greater in a rental property where there could be a larger number of people living, and the person working on the property does not live there and may not be known to the occupants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 11. For these reasons, we decline to read \"installation and\" into \u00a7 2198(a)(3) and apply its language as written. Given applicant's concession that the work he proposed was not maintenance, this exception does not relieve applicant of the obligation to have a licensed individual perform the work he proposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 12. Applicant also argues that the work did not require a licensed plumber under the statutory exemption for work performed by \"[a] person who performs miscellaneous jobs of manual labor on the person's own property in the course of which plumbing repairs or alterations are made.\" 26 V.S.A. \u00a7 2198(a)(5). Applicant asserts that under this exemption, he, as the property owner, does not require a license to do the plumbing work that he proposed in his permit application.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 13. To ascertain whether the work applicant proposes fits within the statutory exemption involves questions of law and fact. The scope of the work to be performed is a factual question; the meaning of the statutory language is a legal question. As to the factual determination, the Commission credited the testimony of the plumbing inspector that the work proposed by applicant required installation of additional plumbing fixtures, including shut-off and anti-scald valves, an expansion tank, and updated fittings. On appeal, we employ the same standard as the superior court and give deference to the findings of the Commission.\n   <em>\n    Soon Kwon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3700650\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/189/598/\">\n    2011 VT 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3700650\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/189/598/\">\n    189 Vt. 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3700650\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/189/598/\">\n    19 A.3d 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because these findings are supported by the evidence, we accept them on appeal. Therefore, we must determine whether there was a reasonable basis for the Commission's decision that the work proposed was\n   not \"repairs or alterations\" within the meaning of \u00a7 2198(a)(5). See\n   <em>\n    Soon Kwon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3700650\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/189/598/\">\n    2011 VT 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3700650\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/189/598/\">\n    189 Vt. 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3700650\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/189/598/\">\n    19 A.3d 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that this Court will affirm agency decision that has \"any reasonable basis\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 14.

The statutory scheme and the statutory purpose also provide some guidance about the intended scope of repairs and alterations. See\n   <em>\n    State v. Love\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20VT%2075\">\n    2017 VT 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9, --- Vt. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491627\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/174/761/\">\n    174 A.3d 761\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"If the statutory language provides insufficient guidance to ascertain legislative intent, we look beyond the language of a particular section standing alone to the whole statute, the subject matter, its effects and consequences, and the reason and spirit of the law.\" (quotation omitted) ). The exemption related to work by an owner in an owner-occupied residence exempts \"[a]ny plumbing and specialty work,\" which demonstrates that repairs and alterations was meant to be something less than \"any\" plumbing work. To construe repairs and alterations broadly would produce an effect contrary to legislative intent. That the \u00a7 2198(a)(5) exemption was intended to be more limited than that for owner-occupied single-family dwellings is also consistent with the public-protection purpose of the statute. Both the common definitions and the statutory structure and intent support a conclusion that the Legislature's use of the words repairs and alterations was meant to exempt work by an owner that fixes broken plumbing or makes slight changes to the structure of the plumbing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 16. We conclude that there was a reasonable basis for the Commission's conclusion that the work applicant proposed in this case was not \"repairs or alterations.\" 26 V.S.A. \u00a7 2198(a)(5). The first item-connecting the water supply to the Jacuzzi-required installation of shut-off and anti-scald valves and a new water heater. This was not even arguably a repair within the meaning of the statute because applicant did not allege that the work was required to fix broken plumbing. Further, given the extent of the additional features to be installed as part of the work, it was reasonable for the Commission to conclude that this was more than a slight change to the plumbing's existing structure. It is a closer question as to whether the second item-the replacement of the sewer pipe-was exempt as a repair or alteration. Applicant indicated the pipes were \"deteriorating,\" but the facts do not demonstrate that the plumbing was broken or that the work he proposed was required to put the plumbing into working condition. Moreover, given that the undisputed facts indicate that the work entailed disconnecting branch lines and installing updated fittings, applicant has failed to demonstrate that the Commission's determination that this work went beyond a simple alteration was in error.

The Commission also acted reasonably in determining that this was not a simple repair of a broken item and that it went beyond a slight change in structure. Therefore, \u00a7 2198(a)(5) does not exempt applicant from the requirement of obtaining a permit for the work that he proposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    The Commission's decision was split three to three, which resulted in an affirmance of the plumbing inspector.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    There is no support for applicant's assertion that because the alterations to \u00a7 2198(a)(3) were not shown in the session law, the law as written in 1959 remains in force.

Therefore, to read \"installation and\" back into the statute would require this Court to revise the existing language.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    In contrast to the exemption in \u00a7 2198(a)(3), the exemption in \u00a7 2198(a)(5) applies only to work performed by the owner of the property. In his application, applicant did not identify who would perform the work on his property. The Commission's factual findings indicate that applicant testified that he employs a person capable of performing maintenance work.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
