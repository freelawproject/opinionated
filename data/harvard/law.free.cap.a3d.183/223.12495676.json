Specifically, to the east of the Disputed Property lies a farm that was formerly owned by the Estate of Charles Howard Zimmerman (\"the Estate\"), Petitioner, which consists of three tracts of land at 8260 Dollyhyde Road in Mount Airy, Maryland (\"the Zimmerman Farm\"). By a deed dated January 1, 2013, Robert Clayton Stevens, the Estate's personal representative, on the Estate's behalf, conveyed the Zimmerman Farm to George C. Stevens (\"George\") and himself in his individual capacity. To the west of the Disputed Property lies a farm that is known as the Laughlin Farm, which is currently owned by Erich E. Blatter and Dr. Susan V. M. Maharaj, Respondents, located at 7977 Timmons Road in Union Bridge, Maryland (\"the Laughlin Farm\"). Neither the Estate nor Respondents is the record owner of the Disputed Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Indeed, apparently, the record owner of the Disputed Property is an individual who has been deceased for more than 100 years, with no known personal representative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On June 4, 2014, on the Estate's behalf, Stevens filed in the Circuit Court for Frederick County a complaint against Respondents seeking to quiet title to the Disputed Property, alleging that the Estate owned the Disputed Property through adverse possession.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Respondents also claimed ownership of the Disputed Property, and filed a counterclaim against the Estate for trespass. No record owner of the Disputed Property was made a party to the action to quiet title. Following a two-day bench trial, the circuit court denied the counterclaim and ruled that, as between the parties, the Estate had the right to possess and use the Disputed Property by adverse possession. The circuit court noted that it could not rule that the Estate had \"absolute ownership\" of the Disputed Property because no record owner had been made a party to the action. On November 2, 2015, the circuit court issued an order consistent with its oral ruling, denying the counterclaim and determining that, \"as between the parties[,]\" the Estate had the right to possession and use of the Disputed Property by way of adverse possession. In other words, the circuit court's ruling would not be effective against the record owner of the Disputed Property or any other person with an interest in the Disputed Property, and the circuit court did not determine ownership of the Disputed Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Respondents appealed. On June 26, 2017, in an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals vacated the circuit court's judgment and remanded this case to the circuit court with instructions to dismiss this case. The Court of Special Appeals determined that, although the circuit court correctly observed that the action to quiet title lacked a necessary party,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the record owner of the Disputed Property, the circuit court erred in proceeding with \"trial to determine\n   which party to the action had a superior right to possess the Disputed\" Property. Thereafter, the Estate filed a motion for reconsideration, which the Court of Special Appeals denied. On September 19, 2017, the Estate filed in this Court a petition for a writ of\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   , which this Court granted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Estate of Zimmerman v. Blatter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12315505,12491417,12315509,12491415\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/456/251/\">\n    456 Md. 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12315513,12315505,12315509,12491414,12491415,12491416,12491417,12315516\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/173/153/\">\n    173 A.3d 153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In the meantime, while this case was pending in the Court of Special Appeals, but before that Court issued its unreported opinion, effective October 1, 2016, the General Assembly amended the statute governing actions to quiet title, Md. Code Ann., Real Prop. (1974, 2015 Repl. Vol.) (\"RP (2015)\") \u00a7 14-108, and added a new subtitle governing actions to quiet title, Md. Code Ann., Real Prop. (1974, 2015 Repl. Vol., 2016 Supp.) (\"RP\") \u00a7\u00a7 14-601 to 14-621.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20Md.%20Laws%205703\">\n    2016 Md. Laws 5703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -04, 5711 (Vol. VII, Ch. 396, H.B. 920). And, effective April 1, 2017, this Court adopted a new chapter in the Maryland Rules, Maryland Rules 12-801 to 12-811, governing actions to quiet title.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Court of Appeals of Maryland, Rules Order at 2-3, 154-69 (Dec. 13, 2016),\n   <em>\n    available at\n   </em>\n   https://mdcourts.gov/sites/default/files/rules/order/191ro.pdf\n   [https://perma.cc/6UA5-JZJP].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Both before and after October 1, 2016, RP \u00a7 14-108(b) has provided that \"[a]ny person who appears of record, or claims to have a hostile outstanding right, shall be made a defendant in the proceedings.\" In other words, a record owner of a property is required to be joined as a defendant in an action to quiet title. Importantly, however, the new subtitle and Maryland Rules governing actions to quiet title provide specific procedures by which a plaintiff may proceed with an action to quiet title even where there exists a person required to be joined as a defendant,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , a record owner, who is deceased with no known personal representative. Stated otherwise, although a record owner of a property may be deceased with no known personal representative, as of October 1, 2016, Maryland law provides a mechanism by which a plaintiff may nevertheless proceed with seeking to quiet title to the property. Under those circumstances, RP \u00a7 14-610(b) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (1) If a person required to be named as a defendant is dead, or is believed by the plaintiff to be dead, and the plaintiff knows of no personal representative, the plaintiff shall state those facts in an affidavit filed with the complaint.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (2) If the plaintiff states in an affidavit under paragraph (1) of this subsection that a person is dead, the plaintiff may join as defendants \"the testate and intestate successors of ____________ (naming the deceased person), deceased, and all persons claiming by, through, or under the decedent\".\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (3) If the plaintiff states in an affidavit under paragraph (1) of this subsection that a person is believed to be dead, the plaintiff may join the person as a defendant, and may also join \"the testate and intestate successors of ____________ (naming the person), believed to be deceased, and all persons claiming by, through, or under the person believed to be deceased\".\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Consistently, Maryland Rule 12-805(b)(2) provides: \"If a person required to be named as defendant ... is dead, or is believed by the plaintiff to be dead, and the plaintiff knows of no personal representative, the plaintiff shall state those facts in an affidavit filed with the court.\" And, Maryland Rule 12-805(b)(3) provides that, where a plaintiff avers in an affidavit that a person is dead or believed to be dead, then the plaintiff \"may join as defendants\" the person's \"testate and intestate successors\" and all persons who would claim \"by, through or under\" the person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Against this backdrop, we decide whether RP \u00a7\u00a7 14-601 to 14-621 and Maryland Rules 12-801 to 12-811, all of which became effective while this case was pending in the Court of Special Appeals, apply to this case-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , whether the new statutes and Maryland Rules apply retroactively-and, if so, whether, under the circumstances of this case, dismissal for nonjoinder of a deceased record owner who has no known personal representative is required. We hold that RP \u00a7\u00a7 14-601 to 14-621 and Maryland Rules 12-801 to 12-811 apply retroactively to all cases that were pending when the statutes and Maryland Rules became effective, including this case,\n   which was pending in the Court of Special Appeals. Specifically, we conclude that the new statutes and Maryland Rules apply retroactively because they govern procedures that are related to actions to quiet title and are remedial in nature, they do not impair any substantive or vested rights, and neither the General Assembly nor this Court, in enacting the new statutes and adopting the new Maryland Rules, respectively, has shown an intent to the contrary. With respect to\n   RP \u00a7\u00a7 14-601 to 14-621, the General Assembly did not express any intent whatsoever to limit the applicability of the statutes to actions to quiet title that were initiated after October 1, 2016. And, with respect to Maryland Rules 12-801 to 12-811, this Court's Rules Order explicitly provided for retroactive application to all pending actions, \"insofar as practicable[.]\" Rules Order at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Additionally, we hold that, when applied to this case, the new statutes and Maryland Rules do not require dismissal for failure to join a deceased record owner who has no known personal representative. To be sure, under RP \u00a7 14-108(b), a record owner is required to be made a defendant to an action to quiet title. Automatic dismissal, however, is not required under the circumstances of this case, as the Court of Special Appeals concluded. Rather, we determine that the proper course of action is to reverse the Court of Special Appeals's judgment and remand this case to that Court with instructions to vacate the circuit court's judgment and remand this case to the circuit court for further proceedings, so that the Estate can follow the procedures that are outlined in the new statutes and Maryland Rules concerning joinder of a defendant who is a deceased record owner with no known personal representative. In other words, on remand, the Estate would be permitted to file an amended complaint that is accompanied by the necessary affidavit that is described by RP \u00a7 14-610(b) and Maryland Rule 12-805(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and remand this case to that Court with instructions to vacate the circuit court's judgment and remand this case to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent\n   with this opinion, namely, the filing of an amended complaint to quiet title with the appropriate affidavit in accordance with the new statutes and Maryland Rules governing actions to quiet title. For purposes of the remand, we determine that there is no issue preclusion on the merits of complaint or counterclaim, and we express no opinion as to the merits of either party's claim to the Disputed Property or as to Respondents' counterclaim for trespass.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On June 4, 2014, on the Estate's behalf, Stevens filed in the circuit court a complaint against Respondents seeking to quiet title to the Disputed Property, alleging that the Estate owned the Disputed Property through adverse possession.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the complaint, the Estate alleged that the Disputed Property is unimproved real property, consisting of approximately six acres that were conveyed by a deed dated April 19, 1886 from Preston S. Devilbiss and Mollie L. Devilbiss, husband and wife, to Abner C. Devilbiss. The Estate alleged that the Disputed Property does not have a Maryland property tax identification number or a map/parcel number. The Estate also alleged that the Disputed Property lies between the Zimmerman Farm and the Laughlin Farm. The Estate alleged\n   that Respondents' chain of title includes a deed dated September 16, 1908, by which Cephas M. Thomas and Milton G. Umer, as trustees, conveyed 191 acres of land to Mollie L. Devilbiss, an undivided one-third interest for her life, with the balance to Roger B. Devilbiss, Bayard Devilbiss, Hilda Devilbiss,\n   and Preston S. Devilbiss. According to the Estate, the 1908 deed expressly excluded the Disputed Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In the complaint, the Estate requested that the circuit court determine, among other things, that: (1) the Estate \"has actual peaceable possession of the\" Disputed Property; (2) in the alternative, the Estate \"is in constructive and peaceable possession of the\" Disputed Property; (3) its possession of the Disputed Property is \"under color of right by reason of\" its and its \"predecessor's adverse possession for more than the statutory period\"; (4) as between the parties, the Estate \"has absolute ownership of the\" Disputed Property and \"the right of disposition of the\" Disputed Property. Accordingly, the Estate requested that the circuit court \"[e]nter a decree\" that, as between the parties, the Estate has \"absolute ownership of[,]\" \"and the right of disposition of[,] the\" Disputed Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On August 25, 2014, Respondents filed an answer to the complaint, denying that the Estate was in actual or constructive peaceable possession of the Disputed Property and that the Estate had the right to possess the Disputed Property through adverse possession. On the same day, Respondents filed a counterclaim against the Estate, alleging that the Disputed Property \"has always been regarded as a part of the\" Laughlin Farm \"and deemed by all parties who had involvement with either parcel to be a part of the\" Laughlin Farm, including the late Charles Howard Zimmerman (\"Zimmerman\"). Respondents alleged that they, and previously the Laughlin family, had given permission to Zimmerman and his wife \"for limited use of the\" Disputed Property, but that they had \"formally noted the withdrawal of their consent and license for any use of the land by the heirs of the Estate ... by letter.\" Respondents requested that the circuit court issue an order prohibiting the Estate and \"its agents, successors, heirs, and assigns\" from trespassing onto the Disputed Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On September 24, 2014, the Estate filed an answer to the counterclaim denying that Respondents held title to the Disputed\n   Property, arguing that Respondents failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, and asserting affirmative defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On September 15 and 16, 2015, the circuit court conducted a bench trial. At the beginning of trial, the Estate's counsel attempted to clarify an issue in the case, advising the circuit court that the dispute between the parties pertained \"not necessarily [to] ownership[,]\" but rather concerned \"the degree of possession that the [E]state has exercised over\" the Disputed Property. The Estate's counsel explained that \"legal ownership of the\" Disputed Property \"is with Abner C. Devilbiss, that the land was conveyed to him in 1886, deed recorded in the land records, and there ha[ve] been no further conveyances[.]\" The Estate's counsel stated that Abner had died, and that the Disputed Property's legal owner \"would be the personal representative of his granddaughter[,] but they are not a party to th[is] case.\" At that point, the circuit court asked the Estate's counsel how this case could be decided and whether there was a lack of a necessary party. The Estate's counsel responded that the dispute at issue was strictly between the parties, and that the circuit court could issue a judgment in the matter, although\n   that judgment would \"not [be] good against the world\" and would be \"good [only] against the parties[.]\" According to the Estate's counsel, the record owner would not be bound by the judgment and \"would be free to re-litigate the issues.\" After being asked by the circuit court why the record owners were not joined as parties to the action to quiet title, the Estate's counsel responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   I think ... it would have required opening at least three decedents' estates, and trying to find[ ] heirs of[ ] parties ... one of whom has been dead for almost 120 years. The second party, I believe, died in 1958. And [ ] the granddaughter, I think, died in the 1970s.... The last decedent died after 1970, which means [that] whatever interest she had would have gone to her estate.... Her estate was administered in Allegany County, but there's nothing in the inventory that shows any.... [T]he [Disputed P]roperty has been forgotten about ... because they thought-you\n   have this 160-acre farm here. And the six acres that[ are] in dispute w[ere] considered part of the whole, and, [ ] conveyed out. No thought was given to the fact that the later deeds did not specifically mention [the Disputed Property.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In response, Respondents' counsel argued that the Estate's failure to join the Disputed Property's record owner rendered the circuit court unable to decide the matter. Stated otherwise, according to Respondents' counsel, the record owners were necessary parties. The circuit court advised Respondents' counsel that \"[t]he want of a necessary party is a required pretrial motion[,]\" and that it would treat Respondent's counsel's argument as a motion to dismiss. The circuit court recessed to review the parties' arguments and consider the matter. After a brief recess, the circuit court stated that it had reviewed the case law, and determined that it could decide the issue between the parties and determine whether one party's claim was superior to the other party's claim, but that it could not grant title or allow conveyance of the Disputed Property in the absence of its record owner. The circuit court asked whether the parties desired to proceed with the understanding that the circuit court could decide only which party had a superior claim, and counsel for both parties responded in the affirmative. Thereafter, the trial proceeded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   At trial, to demonstrate satisfaction of the elements of adverse possession, witnesses testified on behalf of the parties concerning each party's use of the Disputed Property. And, through exhibits and witness testimony, the following pertinent evidence was adduced. Beginning in the 1950s, Zimmerman and his wife resided on what is now known as the Zimmerman Farm with their \"foster child,\" George, and Zimmerman and George began operating the Zimmerman Farm as a dairy farm. By a deed dated September 28, 1965, Hilda Davies conveyed the Zimmerman Farm to Zimmerman and his wife, as tenants by the entireties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Later, George's son, Stevens, who also grew up on the Zimmerman Farm, helped\n   George and Zimmerman with the dairy farm. In 1999, the Zimmerman Farm ceased to operate as a dairy farm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On December 20, 2001, Respondents purchased Laughlin Farm from John Laughlin, successor trustee of the Henry P. Laughlin Family Trust. According to Respondents, they believed that they owned the Disputed Property from the\n   time that they purchased the Laughlin Farm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In 2010, Zimmerman had a land survey conducted. Stevens testified that he first learned that the ownership of the Disputed Property was unknown upon review of the survey results. On January 29, 2011, Zimmerman died. In a letter dated October 5, 2011, Dr. Maharaj wrote to Stevens, who was serving as the Estate's personal representative, and claimed ownership of the Disputed Property. In a letter dated January 18, 2012, Dr. Maharaj opened a claim with her title insurance company, stating that she believed that the Disputed Property was inadvertently excluded from the Laughlin Farm deed and asking who rightfully owned it. In a letter dated December 13, 2012, the title insurance company's assistant vice president and claims counsel traced the chain of title for Respondents' property and concluded that the Disputed Property was conveyed out of Respondents' chain of title through \"two out-conveyances\" by deeds dated March 20, 1857 and April 19, 1886. The title insurance company's vice president and claims counsel did not identify the record owner of the Disputed Property. The title insurance company ultimately determined that Respondents' \"property [was] described as insured[,]\" and denied Dr. Maharaj's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   At the conclusion of the trial, the circuit court heard closing arguments and recessed to consider the case. Thereafter, the circuit court orally ruled from the bench, denying the counterclaim and ruling that, as between the parties, the Estate had the right to possess and use the Disputed Property through adverse possession. The circuit court first addressed the counterclaim, ruling that it could not grant the relief requested,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a no-trespass order, in the absence of evidence that Respondents had title to the Disputed Property. As to the\n   Estate's adverse possession claim, the circuit court summarized the evidence relating the elements of adverse possession and ruled:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   And so I do find that the use of [the Disputed P]roperty meets the criteria of adverse possession. I do find that, as between the parties, the right to possess the [Disputed Property] is with the Estate[.] That is[ ] by adverse possession. And that[,] henceforth, between the parties, the[ Estate] ha[s] the right of use of th[e Disputed Property].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   I cannot rule that the[ Estate] ha[s] absolute ownership of the [Disputed Property.] ... [The Estate] certainly did not prove that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On November 2, 2015, the circuit court issued an order consistent with its oral ruling, denying the counterclaim and ordering\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   that[,] as between the parties to this action, the right to possession and use of the [Disputed Property], Six (6) acres, two (2) rood, and twenty-five (25) perches +/- which comprise the area of unknown ownership between the properties of the [Estate] and [Respondents], is with the Estate ... by adverse possession.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In other words, the circuit court's ruling and subsequent order was to be ineffective against the record owner of the Disputed Property or any other person with an interest in the Disputed Property. The circuit court did not identify, either in its oral ruling or subsequent order, who the record owner of the Disputed Property is; rather, the circuit court determined only that, as between the parties, the Estate had the superior claim to the right to possess and use the Disputed Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On November 30, 2015, Respondents\n   noted an appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   On June 26, 2017, the Court of Special Appeals vacated the circuit court's judgment and remanded this case to the circuit court with instructions to dismiss this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Erich E. Blatter, et ux. v. Estate of Charles Howard Zimmerman\n   </em>\n   , No. 2146, Sept. Term, 2015,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202730237\">\n    2017 WL 2730237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. June 26, 2017). The Court of Special Appeals determined that, although the circuit court correctly observed that the action to quiet title lacked a necessary party,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the record owner of the Disputed Property, the circuit court erred in proceeding with \"trial to determine which party to the action had a superior right to possess the Disputed\" Property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1. The Court of Special Appeals explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   The Court of Appeals'[s] interpretation of [ RP \u00a7 14-108 ] leaves no room for doubt in this case. The record owner is [a] necessary party and must be joined to a quiet title action. [RP] \u00a7 14-108(b). Outstanding claims to a property are clouds on that property's title and prevent a court from granting the relief provided for in the quiet title action-absolute ownership and the right to dispose of the property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The limited relief granted by the circuit court was a clear indicator that something was amiss. As the Estate admitted at trial, there was a record owner it did not name as a defendant in the action. [RP] \u00a7 14-108(b) plainly required the Estate to join the record owner. We hold, therefore, that the [circuit] court erred in conducting trial without ordering the Estate to join the record owner or any person who may \"claim[ ] to have a hostile outstanding right\" to the Disputed [Property] as a party, and we reverse the judgment of the [circuit] court with instructions to dismiss this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7. As to the amendment of RP \u00a7 14-108 and the enactment of RP \u00a7\u00a7 14-601 to 14-621, which occurred while the appeal was pending, the Court of Special Appeals noted the \"substantial changes\" and stated in a footnote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Subtitle 6 prescribes precise procedures for actions to quiet title that did not exist prior to 2016. Although Subtitle 6 [had] not [been] enacted [when] the Estate filed the quiet title action in this case, its provisions further inform and support the purpose of quiet title actions related here.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4 n.9. Because the Court of Special Appeals determined that the Estate's failure to join a necessary party to the action to quiet title was dispositive, it did not address Respondents'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   arguments that the Estate had failed to meet its burden to prove adverse possession.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *4 n.8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Estate filed a motion for reconsideration, which the Court of Special Appeals denied. On September 19, 2017, the Estate filed in this Court a petition for a writ of\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   , raising the following two issues, among others:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   1.

According to the Estate, the changes in the law altered the procedures concerning actions to quiet title, and did not impair any substantive or vested rights, and, thus, the changes apply to all actions, including pending actions, unless there is an express intent to the contrary. In other words, the Estate argues that the new statutes and Maryland Rules governing actions to quiet title apply retroactively, even to cases pending on appeal. The Estate points out that the Rules\n   Order adopting the new Maryland Rules governing actions to quiet title expressly states that the changes shall \"apply to all actions [that were] commenced on or after April 1, 2017 and, insofar as practicable, to all actions [that were] then pending[,]\" and that, in enacting the new statutes governing actions to quiet title, the General Assembly did not express an intent that the statutes apply only prospectively. The Estate maintains that Respondents \"do not appear to have any substantive or vested rights\" to the Disputed Property such that applying the new statutes and Maryland Rules would impair a right possessed by Respondents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Estate contends that the new statutes and Maryland Rules eliminated any requirement of automatic dismissal of an action to quiet title for nonjoinder of a deceased record owner who has no personal representative. The Estate maintains that, because the new statutes and Maryland Rules apply retroactively and eliminated any requirement of automatic dismissal for nonjoinder of a deceased record owner with no personal representative, this Court should remand this case to the Court of Special Appeals with instructions to review and decide the other questions presented by the parties in their briefs to the Court of Special Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Respondents respond that RP \u00a7 14-108 is a substantive statute, not simply a procedural or remedial statute, because it provides the authority to bring an action to quiet title, and that the new statutes governing actions to quiet title \"were enacted to promote consistent procedures in\" actions to quiet title. Respondents contend that the new statutes and Maryland Rules did not nullify RP \u00a7 14-108(b)'s requirement that all record title owners be joined as parties in an action to quiet title. Respondents acknowledge that the new Maryland Rules apply to pending actions if practicable, but argue that it would have been impracticable to apply them after trial and on appeal, as in this case. Stated otherwise, Respondents assert that an appeal is too late a stage to facilitate adding new parties, such as a deceased record owner. Respondents maintain that, in any event, had the Court of Special Appeals applied the new statutes and Maryland Rules to this case, that\n   application would not have excused the Estate's failure to name the necessary parties in the action to quiet title.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Respondents contend that the Court of Special Appeals correctly instructed the\n   circuit court to dismiss this case for failure to join necessary parties because, given the circumstances, \"there is no realistic option but to require the Estate to start anew\" so that the Estate can comply with the law. Respondents argue that a remand to allow the Estate to amend its complaint to add the record owners as defendants in the action to quiet title, after a trial on the merits has occurred on certain issues between the parties, would create several procedural problems, including an issue as to whether Respondents have the right to litigate their claim to the Disputed Property once the record owners are joined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Maryland Rule 8-131(c) governs review of a bench trial and provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   When an action has been tried without a jury, the appellate court will review the case on both the law and the evidence.

In particular, House Bill 920's Fiscal and Policy Note stated that House Bill 920 \"establishes rules of practice and procedures\n   for actions to 'quiet' title (that is, to determine the validity of adverse claims or other clouds on title) to real property and requires an action to quiet title under existing law to be maintained in accordance with the bill's provisions.\" H.B. 920, 2016 Leg., Reg.

As to the \"Current Law/Background\" governing actions to quiet title and the impetus behind House Bill 920, the Fiscal and Policy Note stated, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   The purpose of an action to quiet title is to determine conflicting claims to real property or remove a cloud on title to property. However, State law does not specify the procedures to be followed in an action to quiet title.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   ... Any person who appears on record, or claims to have a hostile outstanding right, must be made a defendant in the proceedings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   The Maryland Land Title Association reports that its members are seeing inconsistent processes used from case to case and county to county.

In relevant part, as to parties to an action to quiet title, the Fiscal and Policy Note summarized House Bill 920's provisions as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   The plaintiff must name as defendants the persons having adverse claims to the title of the plaintiff that are of record or known to the plaintiff or reasonably apparent from an inspection of the property against which a determination is sought....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   If a person required to be named as a defendant is dead the plaintiff knows of a personal representative, the personal representative must be joined as a defendant. If a person required to be named as a defendant is dead, or is believed\n   by the plaintiff to be dead, and the plaintiff knows of no personal representative, the plaintiff must state those facts in an affidavit filed with the complaint. The bill specifies how persons who are unknown, dead, or believed to be dead must be named in a complaint.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   The court on its own motion, or on motion of any party, may issue any appropriate order to join any additional parties to the action that are necessary and proper.

The Fiscal and Policy Note also observed that, under House Bill 920, a trial court is required to order service by publication and mailing where a plaintiff demonstrates by affidavit, \"to the [trial] court's satisfaction[,] that the plaintiff has used reasonable diligence to ascertain the identity and residence of and to serve a summons on the persons named as unknown defendants and persons joined as testate or intestate successors of a person known or believed to be dead.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The existing statutory language of RP (2015) \u00a7 14-108 was changed under House Bill 920 to include stylistic improvements, such as replacing the word \"his\" with \"the person\" or \"the person's,\" and to add a reference to the new subtitle governing actions to quiet title, such that the end of RP \u00a7 14-108(a) now provides that \"the person may maintain a suit in accordance with Subtitle 6 of this title in the circuit court for the county where the property or any part of the\n   property is located to quiet or remove any cloud from the title, or determine any adverse claim.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20Md.%20Laws%205704\">\n    2016 Md.

For example, as to general procedures governing actions to quiet title, RP \u00a7 14-606 requires that a complaint to quiet title be verified and include certain information, including \"[a] description of the property that is the subject of the action, including both its legal description and its street address or common designation, if any[,]\" as well as \"[t]he title of the plaintiff as to which a determination is sought and the basis of the title[,] and [i]f the title is based on adverse possession, the specific facts constituting the adverse possession[.]\" RP \u00a7 14-606(1), (2). Likewise, RP \u00a7 14-607 provides that an answer to a complaint to quiet title must be verified and include three specific items,\n   including \"[a]ny claim the defendant has to the property that is the subject of the action[.]\" RP \u00a7 14-607(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   As to the defendants in an action to quiet title, RP \u00a7 14-608(a) sets forth who must be joined as a defendant in an action to quiet title, stating that \"[t]he plaintiff shall name as defendants in an action under this subtitle the persons having adverse claims to the title of the plaintiff that are of record or known to the plaintiff or reasonably apparent from an inspection of the property against which a determination is sought.\" If, however, there exists an unknown defendant, RP \u00a7 14-609(a) provides: \"If the name of a person required to be named as a defendant is not known to the plaintiff, the plaintiff shall state in the complaint that the name is unknown and shall name as parties all persons [who are] unknown in the manner provided in [RP] \u00a7 14-613 [.]\" RP \u00a7 14-609(b) sets forth additional information that must be included in a complaint where a defendant is unknown, providing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   (1) If the claim or the share or quantity of the claim of a person required to be named as a defendant is unknown, uncertain, or contingent, the plaintiff shall state those facts in the complaint.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   (2) If the lack of knowledge, uncertainty, or contingency is caused by a transfer to an unborn or unascertained person or class member, or by a transfer in the form of a contingent remainder, vested remainder subject to defeasance, executory interest, or similar disposition, the plaintiff shall also state in the complaint, so far as is known to the plaintiff, the name, age, and legal disability, if any, of the person in being who would be entitled to the claim had the contingency on which the claim depends occurred before the commencement of the action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   RP \u00a7 14-613, which RP \u00a7 14-609(a) references, sets forth the manner in which an unknown defendant is to be identified in a complaint to quiet title, providing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   In addition to the persons required to be named as defendants in an action under this subtitle, the plaintiff may name as defendants \"all persons unknown, claiming any legal or\n   equitable right, title, estate, lien, or interest in the property described in the complaint adverse to the plaintiff's title, or any cloud on the plaintiff's title to the property.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   As to a deceased defendant, as opposed to an unknown defendant, RP \u00a7 14-610(a) provides that, where \"a person required to be named as a defendant is dead[,] and the plaintiff knows of a personal representative, the plaintiff shall join the personal representative as a defendant.\" By contrast, where a defendant is deceased, or believed to be deceased, and there is no known personal representative, RP \u00a7 14-610(b) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   (1) If a person required to be named as a defendant is dead, or is believed by the plaintiff to be dead, and the plaintiff knows of no personal representative, the plaintiff shall state those facts in an affidavit filed with the complaint.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   (2) If the plaintiff states in an affidavit under paragraph (1) of this subsection that a person is dead, the plaintiff may join as defendants \"the testate and intestate successors of ____________ (naming the deceased person), deceased, and all persons claiming by, through, or under the decedent\".\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   (3) If the plaintiff states in an affidavit under paragraph (1) of this subsection that a person is believed to be dead, the plaintiff may join the person as a defendant, and may also join \"the testate and intestate successors of ____________ (naming the person), believed to be deceased, and all persons claiming by, through, or under the person believed to be deceased\".\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   And, generally, as to joinder of additional parties, RP \u00a7 14-611(1) provides that the trial \"court[,] on its own motion or on motion of any party[,] may issue any appropriate order to require ...

On December 13, 2016, this Court adopted Maryland Rules 12-801 to 12-811 as a new chapter governing actions to quiet title.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rules Order at 2. This Court's Rules Order provided \"that the rules changes hereby adopted ... shall take effect and apply to all actions [that were] commenced on or after April 1, 2017 and, insofar as practicable, to all actions [that were] then pending[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The new Maryland Rules set forth procedures related to actions to quiet title that correspond to RP \u00a7\u00a7 14-601 to 14-621. For example, Maryland Rule 12-804 requires that a complaint to quiet title \"shall be signed and verified by the plaintiff and shall contain[,]\" at a minimum, information related to ten items. In relevant part, Maryland Rule 12-804 mandates that a complaint to quiet title \"shall contain\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   (d) the names of all persons having adverse claims to the title of the plaintiff that are of record, known to the plaintiff, or reasonably apparent from an inspection of the property;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   (g) if the name of a person required to be named as a defendant is not known to the plaintiff, a statement that the name is unknown and, if applicable, a statement that there are persons unknown to the plaintiff who may (1) have a legal or equitable interest in the property or (2) assert that there may be a cloud on plaintiff's title[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Similarly, Maryland Rule 12-809(a) states that an answer to a complaint to quiet title \"shall be verified and shall set forth\" certain information. As to joinder of additional parties, Maryland Rule 12-805(a) provides that a trial \"court on its own motion or on motion of any party may issue any appropriate order to require joinder of any additional parties that are necessary or proper.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   With respect to a deceased defendant with a known personal representative, Maryland Rule 12-805(b)(1) provides: \"If a\n   person required to be named as a defendant pursuant to Rule 12-804(d) is dead or is believed by the plaintiff to be dead, and the plaintiff knows of a personal representative, the plaintiff shall join the personal representative as a defendant.\" By contrast, where a defendant is deceased and there is no known personal representative, Maryland Rule 12-805(b)(2) provides: \"If a person required to be named as defendant pursuant to Rule 12-804(d) is dead, or is believed by the plaintiff to be dead, and the plaintiff knows of no personal representative, the plaintiff shall state those\n   facts in an affidavit filed with the court.\" Under that circumstance, Maryland Rule 12-805(b)(3) provides that, where a plaintiff avers in an affidavit under Maryland Rule 12-805(b)(2) that a person is dead or believed to be dead, then the plaintiff \"may join as defendants\" the person's \"testate and intestate successors\" and all persons who would claim \"by, through or under\" the person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Maryland Rule 12-806 provides that, upon motion of a party or on its own motion, a trial court may order \"appointment of an attorney to protect the interest ... of any party whose identity or whereabouts is unknown.\" Maryland Rule 12-808(b)(1) concerns service by publication, and requires a trial court to order service by publication,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   [i]f, on affidavit of the plaintiff, it appears to the satisfaction of the court that the plaintiff has used reasonable diligence to ascertain the identity and residence of the persons named as unknown defendants and persons joined as testate or intestate successors of a person known or believed to be dead[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   As to judgments in actions to quiet title, Maryland Rule 12-811(a) requires that the prevailing party record the judgment \"in the land records of the counties in which any portion of the property is located.\" And, Maryland Rule 12-811(b) requires the clerk of the court to index the judgment in a certain manner, \"with the parties against whom the judgment is entered as grantor, and the party in whose favor the judgment is entered as grantee.\" In sum, like new statutes governing actions to quiet title, the new Maryland Rules set forth procedures concerning actions to quiet title, and provide a\n   specific mechanism through which a plaintiff may proceed with seeking to quiet title to property, even where there is a deceased defendant with no known personal representative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    Retroactive Application Versus Prospective Application\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   As to whether a statute applies retroactively or prospectively, in\n   <em>\n    Langston v.

Specifically, we conclude that the new statutes and Maryland Rules apply retroactively because they govern procedures that are related to actions to quiet title and are remedial in nature, they do not impair any substantive or vested rights, and neither the General Assembly nor this Court, in enacting the new statutes and adopting the new Maryland Rules, respectively, has shown a contrary intent. With respect to RP \u00a7\u00a7 14-601 to 14-621, the General Assembly did not express any intent to limit the applicability of the statutes to actions to quiet title that were initiated after October 1, 2016. And, with respect to Maryland Rules 12-801 to 12-811, this Court's Rules Order explicitly provided for retroactive application, stating \"that the rules changes hereby adopted ... shall take effect and apply to all actions [that were] commenced on or after April 1, 2017 and, insofar as\n   practicable, to all actions [that were] then pending[.]\" Rules Order at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Additionally, we hold that, when applied to this case, the new statutes and Maryland Rules do not require dismissal for the failure to join a deceased record owner who has no known personal representative. To be sure, under RP \u00a7 14-108(b), a record owner is required to be made a defendant to an action to quiet title. Nevertheless, under the circumstances of this case, dismissal is not automatically required; rather, we determine that the proper course of action is to reverse the Court of Special Appeals's judgment and remand this case to that Court with instructions to vacate the circuit court's judgment and remand this case to the circuit court for further proceedings, so that the Estate can follow the procedures that are outlined in the new statutes and Maryland Rules concerning\n   joinder of a defendant who is a deceased record owner with no known personal representative. In other words, on remand, the Estate would be permitted to file an amended complaint that is accompanied by the necessary affidavit described in RP \u00a7 14-610(b) and Maryland Rule 12-805(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   As an initial matter, we conclude that the circuit court improperly proceeded with trial in the absence of joinder of a necessary party,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the record owner of the Disputed Property, and with making a determination as to who, between the parties, had the right to possess and use the Disputed Property without the record owner of the Disputed Property being joined as a defendant. Under RP \u00a7 14-108(b) and its predecessors, \"[a]ny person who appears of record, or claims to have a hostile outstanding right, shall be made a defendant in the proceedings[ to quiet title].\" Simply put, a record owner of property that is subject to an action to quiet title is a necessary party, and must be joined as a defendant to the action. Indeed, in\n   <em>\n    Jenkins v. City of College Park\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"16447\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/379/142/#p157\">\n    379 Md. 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 157,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"16447\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/379/142/#p157\">\n    840 A.2d 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 147 (2003), this Court expressly stated that RP \u00a7 14-108(b)'s predecessor \"clearly mandate[d] that, in pursuing an\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   proceeding to quiet title, a plaintiff\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   name\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   persons identified by the land records as having an\n   interest in the property or otherwise claiming an interest in the property in question.\" (Emphasis in original). This is obviously so because any outstanding claims to a property, such as those that a record owner who is not a defendant may have, are clouds on the property's title that would prevent a trial court from granting the relief that is afforded by RP \u00a7 14-108(b) -namely, \"a decree that the plaintiff has absolute ownership and the right of disposition of the property[.]\" It is undisputed in this case that the Estate did not name and join the Disputed Property's record owner as a defendant in the action to quiet title, although RP (2015) \u00a7 14-108(b) clearly required that the Estate do so. Thus, in this regard, we agree with the Court of Special Appeals that the circuit court should not have proceeded with a bench trial under the circumstances of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   We disagree, however, that reversing the circuit court's judgment and remanding this case to the circuit court with instructions to dismiss the case is the correct disposition of the case. Instead, we hold that RP \u00a7\u00a7 14-601 to 14-621 and Maryland Rules 12-801 to 12-811 apply retroactively to all cases that were pending when the new statutes and Maryland Rules became effective, including to this case, which was pending in the Court of Special Appeals when the new statutes and Maryland Rules became effective. In determining whether a statute or Maryland Rule applies retroactively or prospectively, we begin with the general presumption that a statute \"is intended to have purely prospective effect[,]\" and that, \"[i]n the absence of clear legislative intent to the contrary, a statute is not given retro[a]ctive effect.\"\n   <em>\n    Langston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"192023\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/359/396/#p406\">\n    359 Md. at 406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"192023\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/359/396/#p406\">\n    754 A.2d at 394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (cleaned up).

Among other things, the new statutes and Maryland Rules institute procedures that are related to the filing of a complaint to quiet title and an answer, requiring that a complaint and answer be verified and contain certain information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RP \u00a7 14-606 (complaint); RP \u00a7 14-607(a) (answer); Md.

R. 12-811(b) (requiring the clerk of the court to index the judgment in a certain manner).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   In sum, a review of the new statutes and Maryland Rules confirms that they establish uniform procedures and rules of practice concerning actions to quiet title,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that they effect a change in procedure only. These procedures govern the process\n   by which plaintiffs file an action to quiet title and join all necessary defendants, and relate generally to the filing and adjudication of actions to quiet title. Additionally, the new statutes and Maryland Rules do not substantively change the law with respect to the ability to quiet title, or otherwise create or alter a substantive right with respect to actions to quiet title. The ability and right to seek to quiet title,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a substantive right, has long been provided for in RP \u00a7 14-108 and its predecessors, and nothing in the new statutes or Maryland Rules disturbs that right. Indeed, rather than creating\n   a new right or obligation as to the ability to quiet title, the new statutes and Maryland Rules effect a change only in procedure by establishing, for the first time, uniform procedures and rules of practice that relate to actions to quiet title. As such, because RP \u00a7\u00a7 14-601 to 14-621 and Maryland Rules 12-801 to 12-811 \"effect[ ] a change in procedure only, and not in substantive rights,\" we apply the new statutes and Maryland Rules \"to all actions whether[,] accrued, pending[,] or future, unless a contrary intent is expressed.\"\n   <em>\n    Langston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"192023\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/359/396/#p406\">\n    359 Md. at 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"192023\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/359/396/#p406\">\n    754 A.2d at 394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (cleaned up).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Additionally, we conclude that RP \u00a7\u00a7 14-601 to 14-621 and Maryland Rules 12-801 to 12-811 are remedial in nature, in that they \"improve or facilitate remedies already existing for the enforcement of rights and the redress of injuries\" and generally \"relate[ ] to practice, procedure, or remedies[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Langston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"192023\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/359/396/#p406\">\n    359 Md. at 408-09\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"192023\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/359/396/#p406\">\n    754 A.2d at 395\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (cleaned up). The remedy of quieting title obviously existed long before the new statutes and Maryland Rules became effective, as provided by RP \u00a7 14-108 and its predecessors. The new statutes and Maryland Rules, however, improve and facilitate the process by which a plaintiff seeks to quiet title by establishing uniform rules of practice and procedure governing actions to quiet title and standardizing existing law concerning actions to quiet title across the State. Thus, the new statutes and Maryland Rules have a remedial effect, and fall under the exception to the presumption of prospective application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gregg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3681105\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/409/698/#p715\">\n    409 Md. at 715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3681105\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/409/698/#p715\">\n    976 A.2d at 1008\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Although we conclude that RP \u00a7\u00a7 14-601 to 14-621 and Maryland Rules 12-801 to 12-811 are procedural and remedial, and, thus, ordinarily would apply retroactively under the exceptions to the presumption of prospective application, our retroactivity analysis is not complete until we determine whether the new statutes and Maryland Rules \"interfere with vested or substantive rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Langston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"192023\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/359/396/#p406\">\n    359 Md. at 418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"192023\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/359/396/#p406\">\n    754 A.2d at 400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As to that point, we determine that the new statutes and Maryland Rules do not impair or interfere with any vested or substantive rights. Indeed, we are unable to\n   discern any vested or substantive rights that are impacted by the new statutes and Maryland Rules, and we conclude that Respondents, as defendants to the action to quiet title, do not have any vested rights at stake in this case that are impaired as a result of the new statutes and Maryland Rules. Simply put, the new statutes and Maryland Rules governing actions to quiet title do not make it possible for individuals to do something that they could not do before, or prevent individuals from doing something that they could do before. As to substantive rights specifically, the new statutes and Maryland Rules do not grant any new right to either a plaintiff or a defendant in an action to quiet title. Rather, the new statutes and Maryland Rules simply provide methods or procedures by which an action to quiet title is initiated and adjudicated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Having concluded that RP \u00a7\u00a7 14-601 to 14-621 and Maryland Rules 12-801 to 12-811 are procedural and remedial and do\n   not interfere with any substantive or vested rights, and that, accordingly, the new statutes and Maryland Rules are to be applied retroactively to all cases that were pending in court as of the effective dates, our retroactivity analysis could end at this point. Nonetheless, we observe that, even when analyzed in accordance with the two-part test concerning retroactivity of statutes-and not under one of the exceptions to the presumption of prospective application-the presumption of prospective application is also readily overcome by the clear intent that the new statutes and Maryland Rules governing actions to quiet title be procedural and remedial in nature and apply retroactively, and that retroactive application does not contravene any Constitutional right or prohibition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pautsch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703671\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/423/229/#p263\">\n    423 Md. at 263-64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703671\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/423/229/#p263\">\n    31 A.3d at 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We address each point in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   With respect to an intent to apply retroactively, we note that nothing in the language of RP \u00a7\u00a7 14-601 to 14-621 indicates one way or the other the General Assembly's intent. Thus, we look to the legislative history of the new statutes, in particular, House Bill 920. A review of House Bill 920 demonstrates the General Assembly's clear legislative intent that the new statutes be procedural and remedial, and thus apply\n   retroactively. House Bill 920's purpose clause provided that House Bill 920 was to, among other things, \"provid[e] for the venue and application of certain rules in an action under this Act; [and] establish[ ] requirements for a complaint, an answer to a complaint, naming of defendants, joinder of parties, and service of process in an action under this Act[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20Md.%20Laws%205703\">\n    2016 Md. Laws 5703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Vol. VII, Ch. 396, H.B. 920).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   And, significantly, House Bill 920's Fiscal and Policy Note is replete with information that clearly demonstrates that the purposes of the new statutes are to establish procedures and uniform processes to be followed in actions to quiet title. For example, at the outset, the Fiscal and Policy Note stated that House Bill 920 \"establishes rules of practice and procedures for actions to 'quiet' title (that is, to determine the validity of adverse claims or other clouds on title) to real property and requires an action to quiet title under existing law to be maintained in accordance with the bill's provisions.\" Fiscal and Policy Note at 1. In summarizing the current law and background of House Bill 920, the Fiscal and Policy Note stated, in relevant part, that \"State law d[id] not specify the procedures to be followed in an action to quiet title[,]\" and that the Maryland Land Title Association had \"report[ed] that its members [were] seeing inconsistent processes used from case to case and county to county[,]\" which caused \"uncertainty concerning the process under existing laws,\" resulting in some title insurance underwriters \"refus[ing] to insure the title of a person who has brought an action to quiet title.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5. The Fiscal and Policy Note also summarized House Bill 920's provisions, outlining the various procedures established by House Bill 920.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-4. In other words, the Fiscal and Policy Note shows that the General Assembly's main purpose in enacting the new statutes was to establish and implement uniform procedures governing actions to quiet title, and to remedy the problems that were caused by then-existing inconsistent processes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   As a final point, given the clear legislative intent that the new statutes are procedural and remedial in nature, we note that House Bill 920's effective date clause-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that House\n   Bill 920 \"shall take effect October 1, 2016[,]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20Md.%20Laws%205711\">\n    2016 Md. Laws 5711\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Vol. VII, Ch. 396, H.B. 920)-does not express an intent to limit the applicability of the new statutes only to actions to quiet title that were initiated after October 1, 2016.\n   Stated otherwise, despite enacting new statutes that are procedural and remedial, and thus ordinarily would apply retroactively, the General Assembly did not indicate any intent that was contrary to retroactive application, either in the effective date clause or elsewhere.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Similarly, we note that, although nothing in the language of Maryland Rules 12-801 to 12-811 indicates whether the new Rules were intended to apply prospectively or retroactively, a review of the rule history plainly demonstrates the clear intent that the new Maryland Rules be procedural and remedial, and thus apply retroactively. In the cover letter to this Court accompanying the One Hundred Ninety-First Report of the Rules Committee, the Chair of the Rules Committee stated that, although actions to quiet title had long been authorized by RP \u00a7 14-108 and its predecessors, \"no Rules were adopted to set forth the procedures for prosecuting them, and the Maryland Land Title Association reported that inconsistent procedures were being used in the various counties.\" One Hundred Ninety-First Report at 16. Most significantly, in this Court's Rules Order adopting Maryland Rules 12-801 to 12-811 as a new chapter governing actions to quiet title, this Court expressly provided \"that the rules changes hereby adopted ... shall take effect and apply to all actions [that were] commenced on or after April 1, 2017 and, insofar as practicable, to all actions [that were] then pending[.]\" Rules Order at 3. Simply put, we clearly stated our intent that the new Maryland Rules governing actions to quiet title were to apply retroactively to all actions, including, insofar as practicable, all actions that were then pending when the new Maryland Rules became effective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   In short, the legislative and rule history of RP \u00a7\u00a7 14-601 to 14-621 and Maryland Rules 12-801 to 12-811, respectively, confirms that the new statutes and Maryland Rules are\n   procedural and remedial, and intended to apply retroactively, thus overcoming the presumption of prospective application. And, we have no difficulty in concluding that retroactive application does not contravene any Constitutional right or prohibition. Accordingly, whether under the exceptions to the presumption of prospective application or the two-part test for retroactive application, it is plain that RP \u00a7\u00a7 14-601 to 14-621 and Maryland Rules 12-801 to 12-811 apply retroactively to \"cases [that were] pending in court when the statute[s and Maryland Rules] bec[a]me[ ] effective[,]\"\n   <em>\n    Pautsch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703671\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/423/229/#p263\">\n    423 Md. at 263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703671\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/423/229/#p263\">\n    31 A.3d at 509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted),\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \"to all actions[,] whether accrued, pending[,] or future,\"\n   <em>\n    Langston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"192023\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/359/396/#p406\">\n    359 Md. at 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"192023\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/359/396/#p406\">\n    754 A.2d at 394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (cleaned up).

As such, the new statutes and Maryland Rules governing actions to quiet title should have been applied to this case while the case was pending in the Court of Special Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   In our view, applying RP \u00a7\u00a7 14-601 to 14-621 and Maryland Rules 12-801 to 12-811 to this case does not yield the result that the Court of Special Appeals reached-vacating the circuit court's judgment and remanding this case to that court with instructions to dismiss this case. Stated otherwise, the new statutes and Maryland Rules do not require automatic dismissal for the failure to join a deceased record owner who has no known personal\n   representative. Although RP \u00a7 14-108(b) requires that a record owner be made a defendant to an action to quiet title-and, undisputedly, that did not occur in this case-under the instant circumstances, we determine that the proper course of action is to reverse the Court of Special Appeals's judgment and remand this case to that Court with instructions to vacate the circuit court's judgment and remand this case to the circuit court for further proceedings. On remand, the Estate should follow the procedures that are\n   outlined in the new statutes and Maryland Rules concerning joinder of a defendant who is a deceased record owner with no known personal representative. In other words, on remand, the Estate would be permitted to file an amended complaint that is accompanied by the necessary affidavit that is described in RP \u00a7 14-610(b) and Maryland Rule 12-805(b), and to provide any other information that the new statutes and Maryland Rules require with respect to a deceased defendant with no known personal representative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Having determined that RP \u00a7\u00a7 14-601 to 14-621 and Maryland Rules 12-801 to 12-811 apply retroactively, and that this case is to be remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the filing of an amended complaint with the necessary affidavit, we also briefly address the matter of issue preclusion with respect to the complaint to quiet title and the counterclaim.

As a practical matter, because we are vacating the circuit court's judgment, there is no longer a final judgment on the merits concerning the complaint or the counterclaim, and any facts or issues that were decided by the circuit court, and that\n   are encapsulated by that soon-to-be vacated judgment, are no longer conclusive in any action. Additionally, we note that another requirement of collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, is that there be two actions between the same parties,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a prior adjudication and a subsequent action. Here, by virtue of vacating the circuit court's judgment and remanding this case for further proceedings in the same case, there is but one action between the parties, not two. In short, we determine that there is no issue as to collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, given that we are ordering that the circuit court's judgment be vacated and that this case be remanded for the filing of an amended complaint. And, for purposes of the remand, we refrain from expressing an opinion as to the merits of either party's claim to the Disputed Property or as to Respondents' counterclaim for trespass, but we note that the counterclaim barely makes out a cause of action, consisting of only six one-sentence paragraphs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   In sum, we hold that RP \u00a7\u00a7 14-601 to 14-621 and Maryland Rules 12-801 to 12-811 apply retroactively to all cases that were pending in court when the statutes and Maryland Rules became effective, including this case, which was pending in the Court of Special Appeals, because the new statutes and Maryland Rules govern procedures that are related to actions to quiet title and are remedial in nature, they do not impair any substantive or vested rights, and neither the General Assembly nor this Court, in enacting the new statutes and adopting the new Maryland Rules, respectively, has shown an intent to the contrary. And, we hold that, under the circumstances of this case, the proper disposition is to reverse the Court of Special Appeals's judgment and remand this case to that Court with instructions to vacate the circuit court's judgment and remand this case to the circuit court for further proceedings, so that the Estate can follow the procedures that are outlined in the new statutes and Maryland Rules concerning joinder of a defendant who is a deceased record owner with no known personal representative. Finally, for purposes of the remand, we determine that there is no issue preclusion as to the complaint or counterclaim, and we express no opinion as to the merits of either party's claim to the Disputed Property or as to Respondents' counterclaim for trespass.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

REAL PROP. \u00a7 14-108(b). A quiet title action seeks to secure the resolution of absolute ownership and the right to dispose of the property. The record seems to indicate that the disputed property was originally in Respondent's chain of title, but in 1886, was conveyed out of the chain of title. The record does not reflect the circumstances of the conveyance out of title. In this case, a personal representative of the deceased owner was a necessary party, and \" [REAL PROP.] \u00a7 14-108(b) plainly required the [e]state to join the record owner.\"\n   <em>\n    Blatter v.
