On April 12, 2012, the child was a kindergarten student at D.C. Moore Elementary School (school), a public school in East Haven. There was a wooden playscape on the school's playground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   During recess on the date in question, the child was attempting to climb the ladder of the playscape when he fell and sustained injuries to his left arm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The plaintiffs commenced the present action on January 17, 2014. In their amended complaint of September 22, 2015, the plaintiffs alleged that the playscape consisted of a tower, several slides, a wooden ramp, and a five rung ladder,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that it was intended for use by students at the school. They also alleged that the playscape was in a decrepit condition and that the protective mulch underneath the playscape had eroded, resulting in a hard and uneven dirt surface. The ladder was in a similar decrepit condition in that the first four metal rungs were bolted to three parallel wooden posts and were in the shape of a \"W\" but the fifth rung was missing a bolt and was in the shape of a \"U.\" Moreover, they alleged that the wood at the base of the \"U\" had begun to wear away due to friction caused by the chain, that\n   <em>\n    school officials and employees\n   </em>\n   were aware of the playscape's dilapidated condition, and that\n   <em>\n    school employees\n   </em>\n   were present at all times while students were playing on the playscape.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The plaintiffs also alleged that when the child, who was climbing the ladder, reached the fifth rung, he slipped, fell to the ground, and sustained serious injuries to his left arm. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendant is liable for the child's injuries and damages pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-557n\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   due to the negligence of\n   the school officials.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its memorandum of law in support of its motion for summary judgment, the defendant pointed out that the plaintiffs failed to allege that the acts and omissions of which they complained were ministerial in nature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 11, 2014, the defendant filed an amended answer to the plaintiffs'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   January 27, 2014 complaint and four special defenses. The defendant alleged, among other special defenses, that it was \"immune from suit\" pursuant to the doctrine of governmental immunity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiffs denied the defendant's special defenses. On March 17, 2015, the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment, along with supporting exhibits and affidavits, claiming that there were no genuine issues of material fact (1) that it owed no duty to the child to maintain the facilities at the school and, in the alternative, (2) that the plaintiffs' negligence claims were barred by the doctrine of governmental immunity pursuant to \u00a7 52-557n in that the acts complained of\n   were discretionary in nature and that no exception to the immunity doctrine applied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiffs filed an objection to the motion for summary judgment with a supporting memorandum of law and exhibits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The trial court heard the motion at short calendar on February 15, 2016, and granted the motion for summary judgment in a memorandum of decision issued on May 9, 2016. The court found that the defendant owed the plaintiffs a duty of care because the board of education was the defendant's agent despite the fact that the plaintiffs had failed to cite the board of education as a defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nonetheless, the court concluded that the inspection and repair of the playscape was a discretionary act; see General Statutes \u00a7 10-220 (a) ; and that the defendant was not liable to the plaintiffs for the child's injuries because the identifiable victim-imminent harm exception to the doctrine of governmental immunity was inapplicable. The court, therefore, granted the motion for summary judgment in favor of the defendant. The plaintiffs appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We first set forth the standard of review by which we consider appeals from summary judgments. \" Practice Book \u00a7 17-49 provides that summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any\n   other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. ... The party moving for summary judgment has the burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue of material fact and that the party is, therefore, entitled to judgment as a matter of law.... The test is whether the party moving for summary judgment would be entitled to a directed verdict on the same facts....

To oppose a motion for summary judgment successfully, the nonmovant must recite specific facts ... which contradict those stated in the movant's affidavits and documents.... The opposing party to a motion for summary judgment must substantiate its adverse claim by showing that there is a genuine issue of material fact together with the evidence disclosing the existence of such an issue....

The court found that the plaintiffs failed to identify a policy that required the defendant to inspect or maintain the playscape in a particular manner and, therefore, the alleged acts of negligence were discretionary in nature. The court concluded that no reasonable juror could find that the defendant was liable to the plaintiffs because their claims were barred by the doctrine of governmental immunity and that the identifiable person-imminent harm exception to governmental immunity did not apply because the harm to the child was not imminent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Our Supreme Court recently reviewed the law concerning governmental immunity regarding the imminent harm to an identifiable person exception in\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    New Haven\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491968\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/176/531/\">\n    328 Conn. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491968\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/176/531/\">\n    176 A.3d 531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018).

The court stated that the plaintiffs had failed to produce evidence that the condition of the bolt on the fifth rung of the ladder was apparent to the defendant. The court noted that, rather than submitting evidence that the defendant was aware of, or was put on notice of the missing or loose bolt, the plaintiffs argued that the entire playscape was in an apparent, decrepit condition. The court reasoned that the harm that befell the child was not caused by the overall decrepit condition of the playscape but by the bolt that was missing or loose. The plaintiffs presented no evidence that the condition of the bolt was evident to the defendant or its officials. The court also found that the plaintiffs failed to produce evidence of the third and fourth\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   prongs, that is, that the probability of injury to the child was so high that the defendant had a clear and unequivocal duty to act immediately to prevent harm.

They conceded, however, that their amended complaint that alleges that the bolt was missing is at odds with Nichole McCarroll's affidavit attesting that the bolt was loose.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   They also acknowledge that photographs of the ladder were \"inadvertently omitted\" from the affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We have reviewed the entire record, the briefs and arguments of the parties and the court's thorough memorandum of decision. On the basis of our review, we conclude that the court properly determined that the defendant's duty with respect to the defendant's alleged conduct was discretionary and the harm suffered by the child was not imminent. Whether the bolt was missing or loose, the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that the probability of the child being injured was so high that the defendant had a clear and unequivocal duty to act to prevent harm.

The court denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment with respect to its claim that it did not owe the child a duty of care. The court concluded that the defendant owed the child a duty of care on the basis of agency. The defendant did not file a cross appeal but argues in its brief on appeal that the court improperly concluded that it owed the child a duty of care on the basis of agency.

If you removed the bolt from the hole, which was easy to do because it was so loose, it would fall down and strike the wooden post that the bolt was inserted into.
