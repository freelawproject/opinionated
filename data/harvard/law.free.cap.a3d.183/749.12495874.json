This opinion focuses only on the June 2018 primary election; it does not address any other potential application of ranked-choice voting in Maine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b6 2] We accept the Report, answer Question 3 on its merits, conclude that the other questions raise nonjusticiable issues, and remand the matter to the Superior Court for entry of a final judgment. In summary:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   (1) We assume, without deciding, that the Maine Senate, a single body of the bicameral Maine Legislature, has standing to seek a declaration regarding the legal status of ranked-choice voting in the June 2018 primary elections and to challenge in court the operational planning of the Secretary of State, who is a constitutional officer;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (2) We answer Reported Question 3 and determine that ranked-choice voting is the current statutory law of Maine for the primary elections to be held on June 12, 2018;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (3) We determine that Reported Questions 1 and 2, which ask the Court to act in contravention to the constitutional provision respecting the separation of powers of the three independent Branches of government, are not justiciable; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (4) We determine that the remaining questions are moot.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b6 3] The history of ranked-choice voting in Maine to date could provide the substance of an entire civics course on the creation of statutory law in the State of Maine. We provide the highlights here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b6 4] In 2016, the people of Maine enacted citizen-initiated legislation to implement ranked-choice voting for general and primary elections occurring on or after January 1, 2018, for the offices of United States Senator and Representative, State Senator and Representative, and Governor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   L.D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   1557, \u00a7\u00a7 1-6 (referred to the voters, 127th Legis. 2016) (effective Jan. 7, 2017) (codified at 21-A M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1(27-C), 1(35-A), 601(2)(J), 722(1), 723-A (2017) );\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Me.

The Ranked-Choice Voting Act\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   created by the citizens' initiative did not, however, amend 21-A M.R.S. \u00a7 723(1) (2017),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   which states that \"[i]n a primary election, the person who receives a plurality of the votes cast for nomination to any office, as long as there is at least one vote cast for that office, is nominated for that office.\" Thus, section 723(1) continued to provide that the winner of a primary election would be determined by a plurality of the votes, even while section 1(27-C) named primary elections as among those elections to be conducted using ranked-choice voting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b6 5] On May 23, 2017, at the request of the Maine Senate pursuant to Me. Const. art. VI, \u00a7 3, we, as individual Justices of the Maine Supreme Judicial Court, issued a unanimous Advisory Opinion stating that specific aspects of the RCVA conflict with three portions of the Maine Constitution- Me. Const. art. IV, pt. 1, \u00a7 5 ; Me. Const. art. IV, pt. 2, \u00a7 4 ; and Me. Const. art.

V, pt. 1, \u00a7 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b6 6] In the months that followed, a number of legislative efforts were commenced regarding ranked-choice voting.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   L.D. 1256 (128th Legis. 2017); L.D. 1624 (128th Legis. 2017); L.D. 1625 (128th Legis. 2017). Ultimately, the Legislature enacted \"An Act To Implement Ranked-choice Voting in 2021,\" which we refer to as the Implementation Act. P.L. 2017, ch. 316, \u00a7\u00a7 1-14 (effective Feb. 5, 2018);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Comm. Amend. B to L.D. 1646, No. H-568 (128th Legis. 2017). The Implementation Act, P.L. 2017, ch. 316, \u00a7\u00a7 1-14, had two essential components:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 It delayed all aspects of the implementation of ranked-choice voting until December 1, 2021, and\n   \u2022 It provided for an automatic repeal of all ranked-choice voting provisions on December 1, 2021, if, by that date, the Maine Constitution had not been amended to allow ranked-choice voting for the offices of Maine Senator, Maine Representative, and Governor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [\u00b6 7] Three days before the effective date of the Implementation Act, a people's veto of portions of the Implementation Act was initiated by the submission of signatures later certified by the Secretary of State.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Me. Const. art. IV, pt. 3, \u00a7\u00a7 17, 20 ; 21-A M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 901 - 906 (2017). Pursuant to Me. Const. art. IV, pt. 3, \u00a7 17 (3), the Secretary of State announced that the statewide vote on whether to veto the challenged portions of the Implementation Act would take place on June 12, 2018, the same day as the primary elections for the United States House and Senate, Governor, and State House and Senate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b6 8] As a result of the initiation of the people's veto, certified by the Secretary of State, the effect of those challenged portions of the Implementation Act was \"suspended\" as of February 2, 2018, pending the vote on June 12, 2018. Me. Const. art. IV, pt. 3, \u00a7 17 (2). Critical to the matter before us, the delay of the implementation of ranked-choice voting until 2021 was\n   <em>\n    suspended\n   </em>\n   . As a result, the RCVA, along with certain portions of the Implementation Act, became immediately effective, thus effectuating ranked-choice voting for the June 2018 primary elections.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Me. Const. art. IV, pt. 3, \u00a7 17 (2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [\u00b6 9] With the challenged portions of the Implementation Act suspended, the provisions of law that are pertinent to the primary elections are:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 The preexisting and unamended portions of the elections statutes,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 The provisions put in place by the citizens' enactment of the RCVA in 2016, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 Those portions of the Implementation Act that are not suspended by the people's veto.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   [\u00b6 10] On February 16, 2018, the Committee for Ranked-Choice Voting and congressional and gubernatorial candidates Lucas St. Clair, Jim Boyle,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mark Dion, Mark Eves, Sean Faircloth, Diane Russell, Betsy Sweet, and Ben Chipman (collectively, the Committee) filed a complaint in the Superior Court against the Secretary of State seeking a declaratory judgment that the Secretary of State is required to implement ranked-choice voting in the primary elections.\n   <em>\n    Comm. for Ranked-Choice Voting v. Sec'y of State\n   </em>\n   , AUGSC-CV-2018-24, at 9 n.4 (Me. Super. Ct., Kennebec Cty., Apr. 3, 2018). We understand that the Secretary of State initially announced that his office\n   <em>\n    would\n   </em>\n   implement ranked-choice voting for the primary elections, with the\n   initial result that the suit was not aggressively pursued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   [\u00b6 11] On March 29, 2018, the Secretary of State indicated that there was a conflict between 21-A M.R.S \u00a7 1(27-C) -directing the use of ranked-choice voting in primary elections-and 21-A M.R.S \u00a7 723 -providing for plurality winners in primary elections. Immediately after the Secretary of State raised this issue, the Committee pressed its suit, requesting a temporary restraining order \"requiring the Secretary of State to continue the implementation of ranked-choice voting for the June 12, 2018 primary election.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Comm. for Ranked-Choice Voting\n   </em>\n   , AUGSC-CV-2018-24, at 9. The Senate did not move to intervene in the litigation commenced by the Committee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   [\u00b6 12] The court (\n   <em>\n    Murphy, J.\n   </em>\n   ), recognizing the urgency of the matter, conducted a hearing on the afternoon of March 29, 2018, and entered a thorough order dated April 3, 2018, to which the parties agreed, addressing and resolving the statutory conflict and requiring the Secretary of State to \"continue implementation of the system of ranked-choice voting for the June 12, 2018 primary election in accordance with 21-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1(27-C) and 21-A M.R.S. \u00a7 723-A.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Comm. for Ranked-Choice Voting\n   </em>\n   , AUGSC-CV-2018-24, at 13-14. No appeal from that order has been taken, and the parties to that proceeding have indicated that no appeal will be pursued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   [\u00b6 13] On the same day that the Superior Court declared that ranked-choice voting would be applicable to the primary elections, the Maine Senate filed a five-count complaint against the Secretary of State seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to halt the implementation of ranked-choice voting in the primary elections. The parties agreed to a stipulated record, and, by order dated April 11, 2018, the Superior Court reported to us, pursuant to M.R. App. P. 24(a), the following questions.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   1. Has the Senate proven, on the Stipulated Record appended hereto, that the Secretary of State's commitment or expenditure of funds for the purpose of implementing ranked-choice voting in the June 12, 2018 primary election constitutes a violation of the Legislature's appropriation authority or the Separation of Powers clause in the Maine Constitution, Article III, \u00a7 2, where the appropriation for the Secretary of State in the biennial budget law (P.L. 2017, c. 284) does not contain language explicitly referencing ranked-choice voting and the enactment of P.L. 2017, c. 316 was partially suspended by a People's Veto Petition?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   2. Has the Senate proven, on the Stipulated Record appended hereto, that\n   the current statutory framework, including without limitation 21-A M.R.S. \u00a7 723-A, does not provide sufficient authority for the Secretary of State to arrange for the retrieval and transport of ballots cast by voters at the June 12, 2018 primary election from municipalities to a central location in order to determine the winners of the election by ranked-choice voting?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   3. Has the Senate proven, on the Stipulated Record appended hereto, that the current statutory framework, including without limitation 21-A M.R.S \u00a7\u00a7 1(27-C), 1(35-A), 339, 695, 722(1), 723(1), some of which are suspended by the filing of the People's Veto Petition pursuant to the Constitution of Maine, art. IV, pt. 3, \u00a7 17, prohibits determining the winners of the June 12, 2018 primary election by ranked-choice voting?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   4. Has the Senate shown that it has standing to bring any and all of the legal claims set forth in its Complaint?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   5. Has the Senate shown that any or all of the legal claims set forth in the Senate's Complaint are justiciable under the political question doctrine?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   6. Has the Senate shown that any or all of the legal claims set forth in its complaint are ripe for adjudication?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   7. Has the Senate identified a cause of action for any of the legal claims set forth in its Complaint?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   A. Reported Questions\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   [\u00b6 14] We begin by addressing the vehicle by which this matter reaches us-a Report pursuant to M.R. App. P. 24(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because there has been no trial court adjudication of facts or other matters ordinarily resolved by the trial court, we do not automatically accept such a report.\n   <em>\n    Conservatorship of Emma\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12315476\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/153/102/\">\n    2017 ME 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12315476\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/153/102/\">\n    153 A.3d 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"When the trial court reports questions for review, we independently determine whether acceptance of the report is consistent with our basic function as an appellate court or would improperly place us in the role of an advisory board\" due to the lack of a final trial court judgment to review.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12315476\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/153/102/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quotation marks omitted). Although we emphasize that the acceptance of a reported question is the exception, not the rule,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12315476\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/153/102/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , in these unusual circumstances, we do accept the Report pursuant to Rule 24(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   B. Question 3\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   [\u00b6 15] We address Question 3 first. The Senate asks whether the contradiction between the application of ranked-choice voting to the primary elections delineated in 21-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1(27-C) and the plurality provision for primary elections described in 21-A M.R.S. \u00a7 723(1) prevents the Secretary of State from implementing ranked-choice voting in the June 12, 2018, primary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   [\u00b6 16] The Senate's argument on Question 3 addresses the very issue decided by the Superior Court in\n   <em>\n    Committee for\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ranked-Choice Voting v. Secretary of State\n   </em>\n   , AUGSC-CV-2018-24 (Me. Super. Ct., Kennebec Cty., Apr. 3, 2018). Had the parties in this case been able to fully address the issue of the Senate's decision not to seek intervention in\n   <em>\n    Committee for Ranked-Choice Voting\n   </em>\n   , it is possible that we would have determined that the Senate was precluded from advancing the same argument now.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Taylor v. Sturgell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674228\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/880/#p893\">\n    553 U.S. 880\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 893-95,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674228\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/880/#p893\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674228\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/880/#p893\">\n    171 L.Ed.2d 155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008) (identifying six circumstances in which the assertion of collateral estoppel is permitted against a nonparty under the federal common law). We have never addressed the issue of nonparty preclusion in these circumstances, however, and we do not take this occasion to opine on it now. Accordingly, we address the merits of Question 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   [\u00b6 17] For decades, Maine's election laws have explicitly provided that the winner of a primary election is determined by a plurality of the votes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   21-A M.R.S. \u00a7 723(1) ; P.L. 1985, ch. 161, \u00a7 6 (effective Sept. 19, 1985).\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Section 723(1) provides, in pertinent part, \"[i]n a primary election, the person who receives a\n   <em>\n    plurality\n   </em>\n   of the votes cast for nomination ... is nominated for that office.\" 21-A M.R.S. \u00a7 723(1). When the RCVA was enacted by the citizens' initiative in 2016, it addressed the application of ranked-choice voting to the primary elections through the enactment of 21-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1(27-C), which declared that an office elected by ranked-choice voting \"includes any nominations by primary election to such offices.\" L.D. 1557, \u00a7 1. The RCVA, however, contained no reference to or amendment of section 723(1), thus creating a direct conflict in the applicable statutory provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   [\u00b6 18] When the RCVA was addressed by the Legislature in 2017, the reference in section 723(1) to plurality voting for primary elections was left in place until December 1, 2021. P.L. 2017, ch. 316, \u00a7 6. At the same time, the format of 21-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1(27-C) was amended so that, upon a later effective date, primary elections would proceed as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    27-C. Elections determined by ranked-choice voting\n   </strong>\n   . \"Elections determined by ranked-choice voting\" means:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   A. Primary elections for the offices of United States Senator, United States Representative to Congress, Governor, State Senator and State Representative.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   P.L. 2017, ch. 316, \u00a7 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   [\u00b6 19] As a result of the people's veto, the changes to section 723(1) that deferred rank-choice voting in primary elections for several years were suspended, thus removing any temporal impediment to the original plurality language of section 723(1).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Me. Const. art. IV, pt. 3, \u00a7 17 (2). Separately, the requirement of ranked-choice voting in the primary elections established by 21-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1(27-C) became immediately effective and would apply to the June 2018 primary elections. Because determining the winner of an election through plurality voting is inconsistent with determining the winner through a ranked-choice voting process,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Opinion of the Justices\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12317374\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/162/188/\">\n    2017 ME 100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 64-69,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12317374\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/162/188/\">\n    162 A.3d 188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   the two statutes are in conflict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   [\u00b6 20] The legal issue presented by the conflict presents an age-old question-which of two conflicting provisions applies?\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Knight v.

The wisdom of ranked-choice voting is not before us. Our role is to determine and effectuate the intent of the legislation unless it conflicts with the Maine Constitution or the United States Constitution. Neither Constitution is implicated by the questions presented here, but the statutory conflict is clear. Despite the existing reference to plurality voting in the primary elections in section 723(1), both the RCVA as first enacted by the people in 2016 and the amendments to ranked-choice primary voting enacted by the Legislature in the Implementation Act in 2017 and immediately effectuated through the people's veto expressly provide for primary elections to be governed by ranked-choice voting.

These questions ask us to address the internal funding and administrative decisions of the Office of the Secretary of State and seek the Court's intervention into the prospective logistical arrangements for securing, possessing, and transporting the ballots during the primary elections to be held on June 12, 2018. We conclude that these questions, which reflect Counts 1 through 4 of the Senate's complaint, cannot be adjudicated because they are quintessentially nonjusticiable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   [\u00b6 35] Finally, the need to answer Questions 4, 5, 6, and 7, which address justiciability, is obviated by our answers to Questions 1, 2, and 3.
