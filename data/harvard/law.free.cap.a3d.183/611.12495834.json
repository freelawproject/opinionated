He consulted with his attorney, who contacted the [plaintiff's] counsel and requested that the [plaintiff] remove from the agreement the language that could operate to release the [defendant's] workers' compensation claim. The [plaintiff] refused to modify the language of the agreement. The [defendant's] counsel wrote a letter to the [plaintiff's] counsel asserting that the release language of article\n   II of the agreement 'really has no effect without the [c]ommissioner's approval' and scheduled an informal hearing before a workers' compensation commissioner\n   for January 8, 2010. The [plaintiff's] counsel did not attend the informal hearing, although a representative of Liberty Mutual Insurance Group, which administered the claim on behalf of the [plaintiff], did attend. Nothing was resolved on January 8, and, on January 27, 2010, the hearing was rescheduled for March 1, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"On January 26, 2010, the [plaintiff] sent the [defendant] a letter stating that, unless the [defendant] signed the unmodified agreement within the next ten days, it would withdraw its offer of $70,228.51 in severance pay. The [defendant] signed the agreement on February 2, 2010, and the commissioner found that the [defendant] did so because he did not wish to forfeit his severance pay. After the [plaintiff] received the signed agreement from the [defendant], it paid the [defendant] the $70,228.51. At that time, the commissioner had not approved the agreement as a 'voluntary agreement' or stipulation as defined in \u00a7 31-296.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"A formal hearing was held several months later to determine the enforceability of the language in article II of the agreement that dealt with the release of the [defendant's] workers' compensation claim. Specifically, the parties asked the commissioner to determine as follows: (1) '[w]hether a signed termination agreement between [an] employer and [an] employee can effectively waive the parties' rights and obligations set forth in the [Workers' Compensation Act (act), General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 et seq., in the absence of] approval of the agreement by a [commissioner]'; and (2) '[i]f the ... agreement does not waive the parties' rights and obligations set forth in the [act]-whether the [c]ommissioner would issue an order that the ... agreement be entered as a full and final stipulation of the [defendant's] workers' compensation claim against the [plaintiff].'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"The commissioner first found that, without approval by a commissioner, the agreement did not effectively\n   waive the parties' rights and obligations under the act. Next, the commissioner found that the agreement should not be approved as a full and final stipulation of the [defendant's] workers' compensation claim. In making this determination, the commissioner credited the [defendant's] testimony that 'the [agreement] and payment of $70,228.51 was based on the number of years [the defendant] worked for the [plaintiff] and there was no money paid in this agreement for [the defendant's] workers' compensation claim.' As a result, the commissioner found that the [plaintiff] had paid no consideration to the [defendant] for his accepted workers' compensation claim. In light of these findings, the commissioner found that the Workers' Compensation Commission (commission) retained jurisdiction over the [defendant's] 2004 injury and scheduled a further hearing on the [defendant's] assertion that the injury has rendered a 10 percent permanent partial disability rating to the [defendant's] lumbar spine.\"\n   <em>\n    Leonetti\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    MacDermid, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=310%20Conn.%20195\">\n    310 Conn. at 201-203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=76%20A.3d%20168\">\n    76 A.3d 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We\n   then upheld the board's decision affirming the commissioner's refusal to approve the release as a full and final settlement of the defendant's workers' compensation claim in light of its finding that the defendant had not intended to release his compensation claim by signing the agreement.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=76%20A.3d%20168\">\n    Id., at 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=76%20A.3d%20168\">\n    76 A.3d 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The defendant denied the plaintiff's allegations and asserted certain special defenses, including res judicata or collateral estoppel, on the basis of the proceedings underlying this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Leonetti\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    MacDermid, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=310%20Conn.%20195\">\n    310 Conn. at 195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=76%20A.3d%20168\">\n    76 A.3d 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The trial court reserved decision on that motion. Both parties filed preliminary requests to charge the jury, which were later supplemented. See part III of this opinion. Thereafter, the defendant took exception to the trial court's jury charge, claiming various errors in the charge given as well as the trial court's failure to instruct the jury in accordance with the defendant's request to charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On February 26, 2016, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff on the\n   claim of unjust enrichment, awarding $70,228.51 in damages, and in favor of the defendant on the remaining counts of the complaint. Thereafter, on March 7, 2016, the defendant filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and a motion to set aside the verdict as to unjust enrichment. The trial court denied the defendant's motions in a memorandum of decision dated April 22, 2016, and rendered judgment in accordance with the jury's verdict. The trial court also awarded the plaintiff interest in accordance with a previous offer of compromise in the amount of $24,689.65 and attorney's fees of $350. This appeal followed. See footnote 1 of this opinion. Additional relevant facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On appeal, the defendant contends that (1) the plaintiff's unjust enrichment claim is barred by collateral estoppel on the basis of the proceedings underlying this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Leonetti\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    MacDermid, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=310%20Conn.%20195\">\n    310 Conn. at 195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=76%20A.3d%20168\">\n    76 A.3d 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , (2) the plaintiff's recovery is precluded by \u00a7\u00a7 31-290 and 31-296, the terms of the agreement, and public policy, (3) the trial court's jury instructions were improper, and (4) the trial court improperly excluded certain evidence. We address each of these claims in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We first address the question of whether the plaintiff's unjust enrichment claim is barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant argues that the material facts underlying\n   <em>\n    Leonetti\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    MacDermid, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=310%20Conn.%20195\">\n    310 Conn. at 195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=76%20A.3d%20168\">\n    76 A.3d 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , are the same as those at issue in the present case. Specifically, the defendant contends that it has already been finally determined that the agreement's workers' compensation release, upon which, the defendant argues, the plaintiff's claim is based, is unenforceable, and, therefore, his agreement to release his claim was not binding on him and cannot legally constitute a pretense or a promise. As such, the defendant further contends that\n   <em>\n    Leonetti\n   </em>\n   served as a final judicial determination that the agreement was neither enforceable nor effective with respect to the release of the defendant's workers' compensation claim. The defendant argues, therefore, that the principles\n   of collateral estoppel barred the plaintiff from relitigating that same issue in the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In response, the plaintiff argues, inter alia, that the defendant's collateral estoppel claim is meritless because he fails to identify any element of the plaintiff's unjust enrichment claim that was actually litigated and previously decided.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   plaintiff also argues that the defendant's claim \"stem[s] from the false premise that [the plaintiff's] unjust enrichment claim is an attempt to enforce the unenforceable workers' compensation release.\" We agree with the plaintiff and conclude that the doctrine of collateral estoppel does not bar the plaintiff's recovery for unjust enrichment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We begin by setting forth the applicable standard of review. The defendant's claim requires us to determine whether the doctrine of collateral estoppel precludes\n   the plaintiff's unjust enrichment claim. This presents a question of law over which our review is plenary.\n   <em>\n    Lighthouse Landings, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6775388\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/300/325/#p345\">\n    300 Conn. 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 345,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20A.3d%20601\">\n    15 A.3d 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The fundamental principles underlying the doctrine of collateral estoppel are well established. \"The common-law doctrine of collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, embodies a judicial policy in favor of judicial economy, the stability of former judgments and finality.... Collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, is that aspect of res judicata which prohibits the relitigation of an issue when that issue was actually litigated and necessarily determined in a prior action between the same parties upon a different claim.... For an issue to be subject to collateral estoppel, it must have been fully and fairly litigated in the first action.

Rather, the plaintiff's unjust enrichment claim is based on the parties' actions as they relate to the remainder of the\n   agreement. Specifically, the plaintiff points to several instances of the defendant's conduct, apart from the unenforceable release, that form the basis of its claim. For example, the plaintiff notes that the defendant acted contrary to the purpose of the agreement, which was \"to make the proposed transition as amiable and trouble-free as possible ....\" The plaintiff also notes that the defendant breached article IV (d) of the agreement, which provided that he had received a \"reasonable period of time\" to review the agreement prior to signing it, by arguing to the contrary before the commission. Most importantly, the plaintiff contends that the defendant breached article III of the agreement that provided that the defendant understood that \"the payments ... are all that [the defendant] is entitled to receive from [the plaintiff].... [The defendant] agrees that the payments ... are\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   than [the plaintiff] is required to pay under its normal policies, procedures and plans.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Emphasis altered.) Accordingly, the prior proceedings in\n   <em>\n    Leonetti\n   </em>\n   did not resolve identical issues, and, as such, the plaintiff's recovery under its unjust enrichment claim is not barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   We next turn to the defendant's claims that the plaintiff's recovery is barred by \u00a7\u00a7 31-290 and 31-296, by the terms of the agreement, and by public policy and that, as such, the plaintiff cannot prevail on its unjust enrichment claim as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The record reveals the following additional facts and procedural history that are relevant to our resolution of these claims. On February 18, 2016, after the close\n   of the plaintiff's evidence, the defendant filed a motion seeking a directed verdict. With respect to the plaintiff's unjust enrichment claim, this motion centered on the fact that the defendant had \"received no consideration in exchange for the workers' compensation release.\" The defendant referenced his supplemental request to charge number forty-two, which stated that, \"[b]ecause [the plaintiff] did not pay [the defendant] any consideration ... in exchange for releasing his workers' compensation claim, the workers' compensation release ... failed to comply with the requirements of Connecticut law ....\" The trial court reserved decision on that motion. Thereafter, on March 7, 2016, the defendant filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and a motion to set aside the verdict as to the claim of unjust enrichment. Both of those motions asserted that the plaintiff's recovery for unjust enrichment \"would violate the public policy embodied in [the act], including but not limited to the provisions of [ \u00a7\u00a7 31-290 and 31-296 ].\" The trial court denied the defendant's motions on April 22, 2016.\n   On appeal, the defendant claims that \u00a7 31-296 provides that a voluntary agreement between an employer and an injured employee must be reviewed by the commissioner to ascertain whether it conforms with the provisions of the act. Accordingly, the defendant claims that, because \u00a7 31-290 prohibits contracts from relieving employers of \"any obligation created by [the act],\" the plaintiff is improperly attempting to circumvent the approval requirement of \u00a7 31-296 by \"couching its claim as one based upon unjust enrichment/implied contract ....\" The defendant also argues that article V (b) of the agreement provides that, if the defendant's release of his workers' compensation claim was found to be invalid, the remainder of the agreement would still be enforced. According to the defendant, this, in turn, would bar the plaintiff from recovering under a theory\n   of unjust enrichment, or a contract implied in law, because an express contract between the parties fore-closes the possibility of recovery under an implied-in-law contract. Finally, the defendant claims that the agreement violates public policy and is, therefore, unenforceable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response, the plaintiff argues, inter alia, that the defendant did not adequately preserve these claims. We agree with the plaintiff and conclude that the defendant failed to adequately preserve these claims in his motion for a directed verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Whether the evidence presented by the plaintiff is sufficient to withstand a motion for a directed verdict is a question of law, over which our review is plenary.\n   <em>\n    Curran\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kroll\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174703\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/303/845/#p855\">\n    303 Conn. 845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 855,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=37%20A.3d%20700\">\n    37 A.3d 700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012). \"Directed verdicts are not favored....

The record reveals the following additional relevant facts and procedural history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The defendant filed a preliminary request to charge on November 6, 2015. Request thirty-six in that document sought an instruction\n   relating to the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 31-290 and 31-296. Thereafter, on February 16, 2016, the defendant filed a supplemental request to charge. Request forty-four in that document pertained to this court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Leonetti\n   </em>\n   . Specifically, it sought the following instruction: \"In considering the claims raised by [the plaintiff] concerning its severance agreement, [the plaintiff] is free to seek recourse with respect to the provisions contained in its agreement, other than the workers' compensation release. In other words, you may consider [the plaintiff's] claims of fraud, theft, conversion and unjust enrichment only as they pertain to the remainder of the severance agreement.\" The trial court declined to provide the jury with those specific instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On appeal, the defendant contends that the trial court improperly failed to instruct the jury in accordance with requests forty-four and thirty-six and that the court's unjust enrichment charge was not proper. Specifically, the defendant claims that, in refusing to charge the jury in accordance with request forty-four, the plaintiff was able to \"pursue its claim of unjust enrichment based on the very clause that had previously been judged unenforceable under the act.\" With respect to request thirty-six, the defendant claims that, in failing to charge the jury on the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 31-290 and 31-296, the trial court \"permitted the jury to rely upon the unenforceable promise contained in the [a]greement in order to find the defendant liable in derogation of the public policy\" of the act. The defendant also contends that the trial court's instructions on unjust enrichment improperly permitted the jury to find in favor of the plaintiff in the absence of proof that any of the defendant's actions or omissions caused the plaintiff injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In response, the plaintiff argues, inter alia, that the defendant failed to adequately brief the harmfulness of the alleged instructional errors. The plaintiff further argues that the trial court adequately instructed the jury on the legal principles of\n   <em>\n    Leonetti\n   </em>\n   and the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 31-290 and 31-296, and, as such, was under no obligation to charge the jury in the specific manner requested by the defendant. With respect to the trial court's instruction on unjust enrichment, the plaintiff argues, inter alia, that the defendant's claim is barred by the general verdict rule. We agree with the plaintiff and conclude that, with respect to requests forty-four and thirty-six, the defendant failed to adequately brief the harmfulness of the alleged instructional errors.

The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of these claims. In accordance with the court's trial management orders, the plaintiff moved to exclude, inter alia, all evidence and argument showing that the commissioner had imposed a $500 fine on the plaintiff as a result of its general counsel's refusal to attend a workers' compensation hearing, including exhibit I, which is the January 8, 2010 order from the commission imposing that fine. The defendant objected\n   to that motion and also opposed the plaintiff's objections to the introduction of defendant's exhibits C, D, and F through L, which were based on similar legal arguments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff also sought to exclude exhibit Z, which was an April 5, 2010 letter from the defendant's attorney. The defendant opposed that motion. After oral argument, the trial court issued a ruling excluding exhibit I and ruling that it would consider other evidentiary issues briefed in the motion during trial. The trial court ultimately excluded defendant's exhibits G, H, I, J, Z, and JJJ\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   on the basis of hearsay, the danger of unfair prejudice substantially outweighing probative value, and confusion of the issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly excluded his exhibits G, H, I, J, Z, and JJJ. The defendant contends that these exhibits revealed relevant communications between the parties and the state of mind of the defendant. Moreover, the defendant contends that, contrary to the plaintiff's objection at trial, exhibits G, H, I, J, Z, and JJJ did not constitute hearsay. Specifically, the defendant contends that exhibits G, J, Z, and JJJ did not constitute hearsay because they were not offered for the truth of the matters\n   asserted. In response, the plaintiff argues, inter alia, that the defendant's arguments with respect to exhibits G, H, I, J, and JJJ, are unreviewable because the defendant does not address all of the trial court's bases for excluding these exhibits. The plaintiff also argues that the defendant failed to adequately brief the harmfulness of the trial court's evidentiary rulings, and, as such, the defendant's claim with respect to exhibit Z may not be considered. We agree with the plaintiff, and conclude that, because the defendant did not challenge all of the bases under which the trial court excluded exhibits G, H, I, J, and JJJ, his claims on appeal related to those exhibits are moot.\n   With respect to exhibit Z, we further conclude that the defendant failed to adequately brief the harmfulness of the evidentiary ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Exhibits G, H, I, J, and JJJ\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   We begin our analysis of the defendant's claims with respect to exhibits G, H, I, J, and JJJ by noting that \"[m]ootness is a question of justiciability that must be determined as a threshold matter because it implicates [this] court's subject matter jurisdiction ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Lyon\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5764311\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/291/384/#p406\">\n    291 Conn. at 392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=968%20A.2d%20416\">\n    968 A.2d 416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"The fundamental principles underpinning the mootness doctrine are well settled....

Although the defendant claims that the plaintiff's recovery for unjust enrichment is \"precluded pursuant to the doctrines of collateral estoppel and/or res judicata,\" the defendant provides no analysis of res judicata, instead analyzing only the issue of collateral estoppel.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    The plaintiff also argues that an interlocutory appeal previously taken by the defendant bars this appeal on the issue of collateral estoppel. On April 21, 2014, the defendant filed an interlocutory appeal from the trial court's denial of his motion for summary judgment, which was based on a collateral estoppel argument. The plaintiff moved to dismiss the appeal asserting, inter alia, that the Appellate Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because no final judgment had been rendered. The Appellate Court granted the plaintiff's motion to dismiss the defendant's appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Accordingly, the dismissal of that interlocutory appeal cannot serve as a bar to the present appeal because the Appellate Court did not render a final judgment on the merits of the defendant's collateral estoppel argument.

Thus, the defendant provided the trial court and the plaintiff with the basis of his collateral estoppel defense with sufficient clarity to put them on reasonable notice of this defense. Given that the \"sine qua non of preservation is fair notice to the trial court,\" we conclude that the defendant adequately preserved this defense.\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Jorge P.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=308%20Conn.%20740\">\n     308 Conn. 740\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 753,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=66%20A.3d%20869\">\n     66 A.3d 869\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2013).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    We also note that no preclusive effect can attach when the prior tribunal lacked jurisdiction to consider the relevant issues.

As such, given that\n    <em>\n     Leonetti\n    </em>\n    expressly states that the commission's subject matter jurisdiction was limited to determining the enforceability of the workers' compensation release, that claim cannot have collateral estoppel effect on the plaintiff's recovery for unjust enrichment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    As the trial court noted, \"[t]he jury reasonably could have concluded that [the defendant] was unjustly enriched [because, in the absence of] the agreement, [the plaintiff] had no obligation to pay any severance benefits, and [the defendant] had no right to receive them.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    Specifically, the defendant contends that, in \"Connecticut, there are strong public policy reasons for the oversight of releases by employees of workers' compensation claims.\" Thus, the defendant claims that, because the plaintiff failed to obtain approval of his workers' compensation claim release, the plaintiff cannot recover under a theory of unjust enrichment as a matter of law. Accordingly, the defendant asserts that the \"appropriate remedy is the rendering of judgment for the defendant, notwithstanding the verdict for the plaintiff.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    To the extent that the defendant raises additional challenges to the trial court's denial of his postverdict motions, we conclude that any such argument is inadequately briefed.

As discussed previously in this opinion, it is undisputed that the $70,228.51 payment was not a workers' compensation benefit; rather, it was a voluntary severance payment. Moreover, the defendant received full workers' compensation benefits. Thus, the plaintiff's recovery of the $70,228.51 severance payment does not affect the defendant's workers' compensation benefits and did not relieve the plaintiff of its obligations under the act.
