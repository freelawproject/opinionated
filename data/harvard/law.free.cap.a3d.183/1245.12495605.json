We hold that an available alternative forum should be considered as part of the\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   analysis, but is not a threshold requirement. Because the Superior Court considered the availability of an alternative forum as a factor in its\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   analysis, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   According to the allegations of the complaint, the plaintiffs are adult and minor Argentinean citizens.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendants, Philip Morris USA Inc. (\"PM USA\") and Philip Morris Global Brands, Inc. (\"PM Global\"), own Massalin Particulares, S.A., a tobacco production company. In 1984, Massalin created a brokerage company, Tabacos Nortes, to purchase tobacco from small, family-owned farms in Misiones, Argentina. The plaintiffs own and live on these farms, raising livestock and growing produce for their own consumption adjacent to the tobacco plants. Tabacos Nortes requires the farmers to purchase and use herbicides and pesticides, which it sells to the farmers on credit. Monsanto Company developed, marketed, and supplied a herbicide, called \"Roundup,\" which, according to the complaint, contains chemical ingredients and toxins capable of causing \"genetic, teratogenic, and/or developmental injury to humans.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiffs mixed chemicals like Roundup and sprayed the tobacco crops by hand with chemicals from containers on their backs. As alleged in the complaint, the defendants knew that the plaintiffs' personal crops, livestock, and water would be contaminated with the herbicides and pesticides. The plaintiffs further allege that the defendants never recommended protective measures, but knew the plaintiffs lacked protective equipment and the knowledge required for safe use of the chemicals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The plaintiffs claim the defendants \"willfully and recklessly ignored knowledge ... of the health hazards\" of the herbicides and pesticides and \"exhibited reckless disregard for the health and well-being\" of the plaintiffs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiffs also alleged that PM USA and PM Global, in particular, \"controlled and managed the tobacco production enterprise of Massalin Particulares and Tabacos Nortes to ensure that the tobacco produced in Argentina was sufficient for its American products.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Superior Court granted PM USA's and PM Global's motion to dismiss the complaint for\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   , finding that those defendants would face overwhelming hardship if forced to litigate in Delaware.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following the dismissal, the plaintiffs filed a motion under Rule 59 for clarification or, alternatively, reargument. In the motion, the plaintiffs did not challenge the Superior Court's conclusion that PM USA and PM Global would face overwhelming hardship if they were forced to litigate in Delaware. Instead, the plaintiffs argued that \"[a]s a matter of logic and precedent, a threshold requirement is that the moving defendant be amenable to suit in the suggested foreign forum\"-in this case, Argentina.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   To ensure the availability of Argentina as an alternative forum, the plaintiffs asked the court, as part of its dismissal, to: (1) order the defendants to waive any defense regarding subject matter jurisdiction, personal jurisdiction, service of process, laches, and the statute of limitations; (2) order the defendants to satisfy any judgment rendered against them in Argentina; (3) grant the plaintiffs a reasonable time to conduct discovery; and (4) allow the plaintiffs to reinstate their claims in Delaware if the courts in Argentina declined to hear the case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Superior Court denied the reargument motion. First, the court held that an available alternative forum is not required because Delaware's\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   analysis focuses on the hardship a defendant faces in this jurisdiction-not whether the defendant is amenable to suit somewhere else.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, the court noted within its analysis that it considered Argentina an available alternative forum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As for the plaintiffs' requested conditions to dismissal, the court found the requests untimely because they should have been raised in their original motion and not in a Rule 59 motion for reargument.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court also held that, even if plaintiffs had properly raised their request, those conditions were \"not logically implicated in an analysis focusing on a moving defendant's overwhelming hardship.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The plaintiffs appeal the Superior Court's ruling on reargument that the availability of an alternative forum is not a threshold requirement before dismissing a complaint for\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   . The\n   plaintiffs also appeal the Superior Court's refusal to condition dismissal on the defendants' agreement to waive their jurisdictional defenses and submit to jurisdiction in Argentina. \"Generally, a trial court's decision to dismiss a complaint on the ground of\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   is reviewed by this Court for an abuse of discretion.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Whether the trial court applied the appropriate legal standard in considering a motion to dismiss, however, presents this Court with a question of law that is reviewed\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    A.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   First, some context. The Latin words \"\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   \" mean \"forum not agreeing.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Over time, the expression became associated with \"convenience,\" meaning the defendant's inconvenience of litigating the dispute in the plaintiff's chosen forum.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   was the solution to a practical problem recognized early on by U.S. and foreign courts. With the liberalization of jurisdiction and venue requirements, plaintiffs began to file suits in courts that had little or no connection to the filing forum. Instead, they had a close connection to other jurisdictions whose courts were better suited to resolve the disputes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lacking a mechanism to transfer a dispute to another jurisdiction, the United States Supreme Court recognized\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   , which allowed\n   courts to exercise their discretion to stay or dismiss a case in favor of a more convenient forum for resolving the dispute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Congress displaced the federal courts' application of\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   domestically by enacting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Federal courts could now transfer cases between districts \"for the convenience of the parties and witnesses\" and \"in the interests of justice.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   But, transnational cases in the federal courts involving foreign plaintiffs and foreign disputes remain subject to\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   analysis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   And state courts were free for the most part to adopt their own procedures for addressing cross-jurisdictional domestic and foreign disputes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    B.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In Delaware,\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   has become associated with the names of the Supreme Court cases recognizing the doctrine in various contexts-\n   <em>\n    General Foods Corp. v.

Allied Irish Banks, P.L.C.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Gramercy\n   </em>\n   , we summarized the different procedural postures of\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   disputes-a first-filed Delaware case with no case pending elsewhere (the\n   <em>\n    Cryo-Maid\n   </em>\n   test); a second-filed Delaware case with another first-filed case pending elsewhere (the\n   <em>\n    McWane\n   </em>\n   test); and a hybrid recently addressed by our Court in\n   <em>\n    Gramercy\n   </em>\n   -a later-filed Delaware case after another jurisdiction had dismissed a first-filed case for\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   . All these scenarios call upon the courts to apply, in one form or another, the same\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   factors. What\n   changes is the strength of the presumptions applied. As explained in\n   <em>\n    Gramercy\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    McWane\n   </em>\n   draws on\n   <em>\n    Cryo-Maid\n   </em>\n   's factors because both tests are rooted in\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   doctrine. \"[W]hat distinguishes the application of [the\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   ] factors in the\n   <em>\n    McWane\n   </em>\n   [and\n   <em>\n    Cryo-Maid\n   </em>\n   ] contexts is 'the background presumption against which the elements are applied.' \" Under\n   <em>\n    Cryo-Maid\n   </em>\n   , defendants must establish overwhelming hardship for Delaware courts to grant dismissal. Under\n   <em>\n    McWane\n   </em>\n   , Delaware courts have greater discretion in determining whether a stay or dismissal is proper.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   This appeal presents the first variation, where the case is filed in Delaware with no competing case in another jurisdiction. We noted in\n   <em>\n    Gramercy\n   </em>\n   the factors to be applied under\n   <em>\n    Cryo-Maid\n   </em>\n   to evaluate a\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   motion: (1) the relative ease of access to proof; (2) the availability of a compulsory process for witnesses; (3) the possibility to view the premises, if appropriate; (4) all other practical problems that would make the trial easy, expeditious, and inexpensive; (5) whether the controversy is dependent upon Delaware law, which the courts of this State should decide rather than those of another jurisdiction; and (6) the pendency or non-pendency of a similar action in another jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Superior Court applied these factors and the background presumptions, and decided that the defendants demonstrated that they would face overwhelming hardship if the litigation proceeded in Delaware. On appeal, the plaintiffs do not challenge the Superior Court's application of the\n   <em>\n    Cryo-Maid\n   </em>\n   factors, or its conclusion. The plaintiffs do challenge the court's treatment of an available alternative forum as one of the factors to be considered before dismissal on\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   grounds. They urge us to follow other courts and make an available alternative forum a threshold requirement before dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Although the federal courts and most state courts require an available alternative forum before dismissing for\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   our Court never adopted this requirement. Admittedly, our cases have not directly addressed the question.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   But, several factors point to an\n   implicit rejection of the requirement. First, as our Court has decided\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   appeals, it has been well aware of United States Supreme Court precedent requiring an available alternative forum, but has not included it as a requirement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, as pointed out by the Superior Court, the Court's decisions, such as\n   <em>\n    Mar-Land Industrial Contractors, Inc. v. Caribbean Petroleum Refining, L.P.\n   </em>\n   , focused on the Delaware forum's convenience to the defendant, not the availability of an alternative forum:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-34\">\n   In determining whether to grant or deny a motion to dismiss on\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   grounds, the trial court is not permitted to compare Delaware, the plaintiff's chosen forum, with an alternate forum and decide which is the more appropriate location for the dispute to proceed. Rather, the trial court must focus on whether the defendant has demonstrated with particularity, through the\n   <em>\n    Cryo-Maid\n   </em>\n   factors, that litigating in Delaware would result in an overwhelming hardship to it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The foregoing language, and similar language in other cases, might be addressing the\n   <em>\n    adequacy\n   </em>\n   of the alternative forum, having assumed the\n   <em>\n    availability\n   </em>\n   of one. But, in\n   <em>\n    Ison v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   , the Court addressed the availability of an alternative forum within its\n   <em>\n    Cryo-Maid\n   </em>\n   analysis of \"all other practical problems\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   The second important practical problem is one that has been avoided through DuPont's willingness to waive any jurisdictional or statutes of limitation defenses that it might possess in the alternate fora.\n   <em>\n    This removes any doubt that the plaintiffs would be able to assert their claims in their home countries.\n   </em>\n   Of course, this factor relates to the convenience of the plaintiffs, not to the inconvenience of the defendant. Thus, it balances in favor of DuPont, but is not probative of the overwhelming hardship issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Rather than rely on inferences, the Court now has the opportunity to directly address the issue. We think that treating the issue as a factor to be considered, rather than as a requirement, gives the issue the weight it deserves in the\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   analysis. Much has changed in the\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   landscape since the United States Supreme Court's recognition of the doctrine in 1947. At the federal level, although\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   was intended to be a limited doctrine that would \"rarely\" be successful in dismissing a plaintiff's choice of forum, in practice, the federal courts have often used the doctrine to dismiss actions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   With the doors to the federal\n   courthouses closing, state courts now shoulder more of the transnational litigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   These cases are complex and strain judicial resources. This case is a perfect example. A number of Argentinean plaintiffs claim injuries from conduct occurring in Argentina. Argentine law will apply, and the witnesses and records are all in Argentina. Delaware has no real connection to the dispute except for the defendants' place of incorporation. It is not unfair to suggest that, rather than\n   <em>\n    requiring\n   </em>\n   cases to proceed in Delaware in the absence of an alternative forum, the Superior Court should consider, on a case-by-case basis, whether the court's resources should be deployed to resolve cases with little connection to Delaware-as the court did here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Although we are in the minority on the issue, we are not alone in our concern over the court's use of limited judicial resources by litigants who, along with their disputes, have no meaningful contact with the forum state. In\n   <em>\n    Islamic Republic of Iran v. Pahlavi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   the New York Court of Appeals held that an available alternative forum was \"a pertinent factor\" that the court is required to consider, but it was not a precondition to dismissal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   Requiring an alternative forum, the court explained, \"would place an undue burden on New York courts forcing them to accept foreign-based actions unrelated to this State merely because a more appropriate forum is unwilling or unable to accept jurisdiction.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court noted that any \"infirmity\n   in plaintiff's legal system\" should not be used to \"impose disadvantage on the defendant or judicial system of this state.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   It therefore affirmed the dismissal for\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   , concluding that taxpayers \"should not be compelled to assume the heavy financial burden attributable to the cost of administering the litigation contemplated when their interest in the suit and the connection of its subject matter to the State of New York is so ephemeral.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In addition to our concerns about devoting judicial resources to cases with little connection to Delaware, an available alternative forum requirement raises concerns of international comity.\n   <em>\n    Forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   is rooted in notions of comity,\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   but comity should be a two-way street. Through preemptive jurisdiction, or blocking statutes, some countries have erected barriers preventing plaintiffs from pursuing litigation in their home country once a case has been filed in the United States. Under these statutes or rules, the foreign jurisdiction must dismiss a second-filed case, even if a U.S. court dismissed the first-filed case on\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   grounds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   Also, plaintiffs can take steps to render the foreign jurisdiction unavailable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   The approach we adopt here might encourage foreign jurisdictions to rethink laws and rules shifting to the U.S. courts disputes that are more closely connected to their own countries and citizens.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The plaintiffs do raise an important concern-foreign plaintiffs who have been injured by Delaware corporations might not be able to bring cases in Delaware against those defendants. The concern, however, has not been ignored. The availability of an alternative forum in transnational cases is treated as a factor in the\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   analysis. The degree of the Delaware corporate defendant's connection to the alleged wrong will still be considered. The trial court will, however, have the discretion to dismiss a transnational dispute\n   when the defendant has demonstrated overwhelming hardship if the case is litigated in the Delaware courts, even if an alternative forum is not available.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In its Rule 59 Motion, the plaintiffs asked the Superior Court to: (1) require the defendants to waive any defense regarding subject matter jurisdiction, personal jurisdiction, service of process, laches, and the statute of limitations; (2) require the defendants to satisfy any judgment rendered against them in Argentina; (3) grant the plaintiffs a reasonable time to conduct discovery; and (4) allow the plaintiffs to reinstate their claims in Delaware if Argentina declined to hear the case. The court declined to impose the conditions, and the plaintiffs raise only one of the conditions on appeal: the court's refusal to require the defendants to submit to jurisdiction in Argentina by relinquishing their statutes of limitations defenses. The Superior Court held the plaintiffs could not raise the requests for conditions for the first time in a Rule 59 motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   We agree with the Superior Court. \"Motions for reargument or alteration of judgment are not the appropriate method for a party to raise new arguments that it failed to present in a timely way.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, even if we were to reach the issue, under Superior Court Civil Rule 41(a)(2), the Superior Court has the discretion to dismiss a case \"upon such terms and conditions as the Court deems proper.\" Because we have held that an available alternative forum is not a requirement before dismissal, the Superior Court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to impose conditions on the dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   An available alternative forum is not a threshold requirement before dismissing a case for\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   . The Superior Court properly addressed it as a factor to be considered as part of the\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   analysis.

My own view of why this is so is that under the overwhelming hardship test motions to dismiss for\n    <em>\n     forum non conveniens\n    </em>\n    have seldom been granted. In\n    <em>\n     Kolber v. Holyoke Shares, Inc.\n    </em>\n    , then Justice Herrmann wrote that dismissal would occur only in \"the rare case\" where the factors \"balance overwhelmingly in favor of the defendant.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     43\n    </footnotemark>\n    <em>\n     Ison v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co.\n    </em>\n    , in my opinion, sent a strong message to the trial judges that\n    <em>\n     forum non conveniens\n    </em>\n    motions were not favored and should generally be denied.\n    <footnotemark>\n     44\n    </footnotemark>\n    It was not until\n    <em>\n     Martinez v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Co.\n    </em>\n    that this Court clarified the overwhelming hardship test by stating that it was \"not intended to be preclusive.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     45\n    </footnotemark>\n    When a motion to dismiss for\n    <em>\n     forum non conveniens\n    </em>\n    is denied because of failure to show overwhelming hardship, there is little or no reason to determine whether an alternative forum is available. I do not think that cases where the motion was denied for failure to show overwhelming hardship provide any helpful\n    guidance on the question of a need for an alternative, available forum.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    I would join the great weight of authority that holds that in order to grant a motion to dismiss for\n    <em>\n     forum non conveniens\n    </em>\n    , a threshold step is to determine whether an adequate, alternative forum exists.\n    <footnotemark>\n     46\n    </footnotemark>\n    I do not think that the availability of an alternative forum should simply be a factor to be considered among other factors. In this case, however, I concur in the Court's judgment. I agree with the Majority's discussion of international comity and preemptive jurisdiction. Where factors such as preemptive jurisdiction may affect consideration of an alternative available\n    forum, as may be the case here, a different rule may be appropriate. In addition, I am not sympathetic to a request that a defendant be required to waive objection to jurisdiction in another forum.
