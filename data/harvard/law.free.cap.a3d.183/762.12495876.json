We are called upon to determine what findings a court must make in order to require attorney's fees to be paid to an adverse party. Also we are tasked with determining the appropriate means for calculating attorney's fees, pursuant to Maryland Rule 1-341(a), when a court determines that a party's complaint includes claims that have substantial justification and claims that lack substantial justification. Petitioner, Heather Stanley-Christian, M.D. (\"Petitioner\" or \"Dr. Christian\") sued Respondents, Maternal-Fetal Medicine Associates of Maryland, LLC (\"Maternal-Fetal\"), and its principal, Sheri L. Hamersley, M.D. (\"Dr. Hamersley\") (collectively \"Respondents\"), after a disagreement that ultimately resulted in Petitioner ending her employment with Respondents. Dr. Christian brought multiple causes of action against Respondents, and Respondents prevailed in having the trial judge dispose of Petitioner's claims after the close of all the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Respondents then requested an award of attorney's fees under Maryland Rule 1-341. During the hearing for attorney's fees, the hearing judge found no substantial justification, pursuant to Rule 1-341(a), for each of the claims brought by Petitioner against Respondents. The hearing judge awarded $300,000 in attorney's fees to Respondents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Petitioner appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, and that court vacated the judgment entered in the Circuit Court.\n   <em>\n    Maternal-Fetal Medicine Assocs. v. Christian\n   </em>\n   , No. 0967, 2009,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%203941970\">\n    2013 WL 3941970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Md. Ct. Spec. App., July 24, 2013).

We hold that the hearing judge did not commit clear error in finding no substantial justification for the claims brought by Petitioner, namely, fraudulent inducement, negligent misrepresentation, and wrongful termination. We determine, however, that the hearing judge abused his discretion in assessing $300,000 in attorney's fees against Petitioner without articulating how he calculated the fees. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals vacating the award of attorney's fees and we remand the case to the Circuit Court for further fact finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This case has meandered through the judicial system for over a decade, and, unfortunately for the parties, its odyssey does not end with us. Dr. Christian entered into an employment agreement with Maternal-Fetal on November 14, 2005.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After a deterioration in relations between Drs. Christian and Hamersley, Dr. Christian left her employment with Maternal-Fetal on July 17, 2006. In March 2007, Petitioner began employment at Greater Washington Maternal-Fetal Medicine and Genetics (\"Greater Washington\"), located in the Washington area. Soon after, Dr. Hamersley informed Greater Washington of a non-compete agreement between Dr. Christian and Maternal-Fetal. Greater Washington terminated Petitioner's employment shortly thereafter. Petitioner, in turn, filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County on April 19, 2007, alleging fraudulent inducement, breach of contract, tortious interference with contract, wrongful termination, and sought declaratory judgment, damages, attorney's fees, injunctive relief, and equitable relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After dismissal of the original complaint without prejudice, Petitioner filed an amended complaint on August 27, 2007. The amended complaint included all five of the original claims and added a claim for negligent misrepresentation. Respondents filed a counterclaim for breach of contract, asserting that Petitioner had breached the terms of the non-compete clause. Respondents filed and the trial judge granted a motion for summary judgment in favor of Respondents on all of Petitioner's claims, except the wrongful termination claim. After the close of plaintiff's case in chief, Respondents moved for judgment as a matter of law, which the trial court denied. The trial judge, however, granted Respondents' renewed motion for judgment at the close of all the evidence. When granting judgment on the wrongful termination claim, the trial judge explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [Petitioner] has demonstrated that it wasn't intolerable to the point that she was required to leave. She only made that decision to leave when [Respondents] wouldn't accede to her financial request to up the ante in what she was getting paid\n   and to shorten the time and increase the amount of business that she could buy from the [Respondents].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Additionally, the trial judge found that \"[Petitioner] made allegations and assertions of changed billing records for which there's no proof that Dr. Hamersley changed them. [Also] [t]here was not evidence that [Dr. Christian] was threatened ever of being fired.\" The jury returned a verdict in favor of Respondents on the breach of contract counterclaim and awarded damages in the amount of $22,902.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After the jury returned its verdict on Respondents' counterclaim, Respondents filed a motion for attorney's fees and expenses pursuant to Maryland Rule 1-341. On December 29, 2009, the hearing judge indicated he would assess attorney's fees in an amount to be determined upon submission of the legal bills to the court. The hearing judge awarded $300,000 in attorney's fees and costs on July 25, 2011. Both parties noted timely appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    The First Appeal\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On the first appeal, the Court of Special Appeals addressed four questions.\n   <em>\n    Maternal-Fetal Medicine Assocs. v.

On February 3, 2015, the hearing judge entered a Memorandum Opinion &amp; Order in which he explained, in part, the basis for his award of attorney's fees. The hearing judge cited\n   <em>\n    Inlet Assocs. v. Harrison Inn Inlet, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1989682\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/324/254/\">\n    324 Md. 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1989682\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/324/254/\">\n    596 A.2d 1049\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991), and then determined whether there was a lack of substantial justification for each party's litigation position. In his discussion, the hearing judge found that each claim brought by Petitioner lacked substantial justification. The judge explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   1. Medical Billing and Prescription of Lovenox:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   The basis for most of Dr. Christian's claims was [Respondents'] medical billing and prescription of the drug Lovenox. Dr. Christian's allegations of misconduct regarding these issues lack merit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Dr. Christian alleged [Respondents] overbilled patients and Dr. Hamersley improperly signed billing forms when Dr. Christian was the physician who provided the service. Dr. Hamersley denied this allegation and presented exhibits at trial that showed billing forms alleged to be signed by Dr. Hamersley were actually signed by Dr. Christian. [Respondents] also presented evidence showing Dr. Hamersley was not even in town when the bills at issue were signed. [Respondents'] medical billing expert, Robin Roach, testified at trial that it is appropriate for a supervising physician to sign billing forms on behalf of a practice, and the supervising physician obtained no benefit from signing the forms. Dr. Christian did not retain a medical billing expert for trial\n   or even cross-examine Robin Roach. While Dr. Christian claims that others (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Wayne Kramer and Megan Sterner) have witnessed improper billing, none of these individuals were called as witnesses at trial. Dr. Christian failed to present any evidence to the jury that [Respondents'] billing practices were illegal or unethical.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   After trial, Dr. Christian has argued an advisory letter to Dr. Hamersley from the Board of Physicians indicates fault. These letters are issued to inform, educate or admonish a health care provider. Dr. Christian has not read the letter nor does she have any information about its contents; however, she admits that the letter resulted from [ ] allegations she made against Dr. Hamersley. The Court will not speculate as to the contents of\n   that letter nor will it require Dr. Hamersley to produce it. This case has been fully litigated and Dr. Christian had plenty of opportunity to present evidence to support her claims, but failed to do so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Dr. Christian also claimed Dr. Hamersley had a financial arrangement with the manufacturers of the blood thinner, Lovenox, and Dr. Hamersley over-prescribed Lovenox because of the financial relationship. As a result of this allegation, [Respondents] were required to hire Adam Duhl, a medical expert on the prescription of Lovenox during pregnancy, to justify Dr. Hamersley's prescription of Lovenox to patients. No evidence was brought forth by Dr. Christian to support this claim, so this claim is without justification.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   2. Fraud in the Inducement:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \"[F]raudulent inducement means that a party has been led to enter into an agreement to his or her disadvantage as a result of deceit.\"\n   <em>\n    Sass v.

In Dr. Christian's deposition she said that she consulted with her mentors about the opportunity and decided to take the position. Dr. Christian did not mention any representations by [Respondents] that caused her to enter [into] the employment contract. Because Dr. Christian failed to bring forth a fraudulent misrepresentation, this claim was also without substantial justification.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   3. Negligent Misrepresentation:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Similar to the issue of Fraud in the Inducement, Dr. Christian failed to plead or prove any facts to support a claim of Negligent Misrepresentation. There is no evidence that Dr. Hamersley intended Dr. Christian to act on any omission or negligent misrepresentation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   * * *\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   6. Constructive Discharge/Wrongful Termination:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   The standard for constructive discharge is whether the employer has deliberately caused or allowed the employee's working conditions to become so intolerable that a reasonable person in the employee's place would have felt compelled to resign.\n   <em>\n    Beye v. Bureau of Nat'l Affairs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2255653\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/59/642/#p653\">\n    59 Md.

Dr. Christian alleged ethical issues with [Respondents'] billing practices and allegations that Dr. Hamersley yelled at Dr. Christian and denied her access to the records rooms as the underlying facts for this claim. Dr. Christian complained her medical license would be jeopardized if she did not leave MFMA because [of Respondents'] billing practices and patient treatment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   These claims are inconsistent with Dr. Christian's actions. Prior to her departure from MFMA, Dr. Christian made handwritten changes to her employment contract. In order\n   for Dr. Christian to stay, the conditions she added had to be met. They were mostly financial conditions,\n   including the opportunity to purchase a 49% ownership interest in MFMA instead of the 20-30% membership interest agreed upon in the initial contract. Dr. Christian also added a more favorable calculation of her bonuses and MFMA to pay all [ ] her malpractice insurance coverage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Dr. Christian claimed that the conditions at MFMA were so intolerable that she had to leave; however, she was willing to remain and purchase half of the practice if her financial conditions were met. Clearly the conditions were not so intolerable that a reasonable person in her position would leave because she was negotiating to stay if her demands were met. Consequently, the evidence presented by Dr. Christian was not even close to the standard required for a constructive discharge claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The hearing judge found that \"[t]he total amount of attorney's fees accumulated by [Respondents] was $555,995.81.\" He awarded Respondents \"$300,000 in attorney's fees as the amount [he] f[ound] to be reasonable and necessary to defend the claims brought by Dr. Christian without substantial justification.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    The Second Appeal\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On March 2, 2015, Petitioner noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals.

The hearing judge properly determined that Petitioner's claims of fraudulent inducement, negligent misrepresentation, and wrongful termination lacked substantial justification under Md. Rule 1-341. Although the wrongful termination claim survived summary judgment as well as a motion for judgment raised at the end of the plaintiff's case, the hearing judge disposed of the wrongful termination claim after Respondents' renewed their motion for judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Notwithstanding our observation that the hearing judge was not clearly erroneous in finding no substantial justification for these claims, we determine that the hearing judge abused his discretion under Rule 1-341(a) when he awarded $300,000 in attorney's fees without explaining the basis for that award. Thus, we remand for further factual findings regarding the amount of attorney's fees to be paid, if any, by Petitioner, and for an explanation as to how the court calculates the specific amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Our task is to determine whether the trial court erred in its application of Rule 1-341. Petitioner references various pieces of evidence that the hearing judge considered and argues that the hearing judge did not afford appropriate weight to that evidence. Petitioner contends that the evidence, by itself or by inference, amounts to factual disputes with regard to substantial justification for the causes of action she brought against Respondents. Petitioner generally refers to alleged incorrect legal determinations made by the hearing judge, and specifically refers to the hearing judge's alleged reliance on the grant of summary judgment and then a renewed motion for\n   judgment as the basis for finding no substantial justification in the claims she brought against Respondents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Petitioner contends that simply because the hearing judge dismissed two of her claims does not necessarily mean that those claims lacked substantial justification. Lastly, Petitioner urges that because she believed that unethical billing practices were occurring, regardless of their legality or ethicality, the evidence was sufficient to create substantial justification for her claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   To the contrary, Respondents contend that the hearing judge was not clearly erroneous in finding no substantial justification for the claims brought by Petitioner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Additionally, Respondents posit that we do not need to reach the second question because there is no gap in Maryland law relating to how to calculate attorney's fees. We essentially agree and will discuss our reasons in detail later in the opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Rule 1-341 dictates the remedial authority of the court in any civil action to require a party to pay an opposing party's attorney's fees for unjustified proceedings. Rule 1-341(a) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   In any civil action, if the court finds that the conduct of any party in maintaining or defending any proceeding was in bad faith or without substantial justification, the court, on motion by an adverse party, may require the offending party of the attorney advising the conduct or both of them to pay to the adverse party the costs of the proceeding and the reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by the adverse party in opposing it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Rule 1-341 constitutes a limited exception to the American Rule, which is that, generally, \"litigants pay their own attorney's fees regardless of the lawsuit's outcome.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

First, we address the claims of fraudulent inducement and negligent\n   misrepresentation together because neither claim survived Respondents' motion for summary judgment. With regard to the claim for fraudulent inducement, the hearing judge explained: \"At summary judgment, this Court found that Dr. Christian failed to establish any material misrepresentation made by [Respondents] and failed to show that [Respondents] had any intent to defraud Dr. Christian.\" The hearing judge then explained the basis of this finding as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   In Dr. Christian's deposition she said that she consulted with her mentors about the opportunity and decided to take the position. Dr. Christian did not mention any representations by [Respondents] that caused her to enter [into] the employment contract. Because Dr. Christian failed to bring forth a fraudulent misrepresentation, this claim was also without substantial justification.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Then, in finding that \"Dr. Christian failed to plead or prove any facts to support a claim of [n]egligent [m]isrepresentation,\" the hearing judge explained: \"There is no evidence that Dr. Hamersley intended Dr. Christian to act on any omission or negligent misrepresentation,\" and he compared this to being \"[s]imilar to the issue of [f]raud in the [i]nducement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The hearing judge was not clearly erroneous in concluding that the fraudulent inducement and negligent misrepresentation claims brought by Petitioner had no substantial justification. Petitioner contends that the hearing judge should have been persuaded that there was substantial justification for the two claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given the\n   deference owed to a court when\n   reviewing for clear error, we disagree with Petitioner's contention.

The claim was eventually disposed of after Respondents' renewed motion for judgment. The hearing\n   judge summarized the allegations asserted by Petitioner as a claim for constructive discharge based upon these assertions: unethical billing practices, Respondents' mistreatment of Petitioner, and Respondents' denial of access to rooms containing patient records. The hearing judge then found that Petitioner attempted to negotiate her employment agreement to increase her \"opportunity to purchase\" a greater interest in the practice as well as \"a more favorable calculation of her bonuses\" in addition to receiving higher \"malpractice insurance coverage\" as a financial benefit to Dr. Christian prior to her departure from the practice. The hearing judge concluded that \"the evidence presented by Dr. Christian was not even close\" because Petitioner brought the claim for wrongful termination only when compensation negotiations, which she initiated, broke down.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Based upon our review of the record, we hold that the hearing judge did not commit clear error in concluding that Petitioner had no substantial justification for her wrongful termination claim. The hearing\n   judge found that \"[t]hese claims [surrounding wrongful discharge] are inconsistent with Dr. Christian's actions,\" which is tantamount in every way to stating that the claim was \"not within the realm of legitimate advocacy.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    URS Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489344,12314659\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/452/48/\">\n    452 Md. at 72-73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489344,12489345,12314659,12314654\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/156/753/\">\n    156 A.3d at 768\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Petitioner, in the present case, has not rebutted this presumption based upon the facts presented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Petitioner sought greater involvement in Dr. Hamersley's medical practice and claimed that the practice and its principal were involved in unethical billing procedures. The contradiction inherent in Petitioner's actions undercuts the notion that she \"had a reasonable basis for believing [her wrongful termination claim] would generate an issue of fact for the fact finder.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Inlet Assocs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1989682\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/324/254/\">\n    324 Md. at 268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1989682\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/324/254/\">\n    596 A.2d at 1056\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That Petitioner wanted a greater financial stake in the practice than what had been negotiated in her employment agreement is entirely inconsistent with a claim of constructive discharge. Nevertheless, Petitioner contends that because she\n   <em>\n    believed\n   </em>\n   the billing practices to be unethical, she had generated a question of fact that would overcome any alleged lack of substantial justification. Petitioner fails to cite any legal support for this proposition. Moreover, the hearing judge specifically addressed this argument in his findings. He pointed out that even if she\n   <em>\n    believed\n   </em>\n   Respondents were engaging in unethical practices, Petitioner still attempted to\n   <em>\n    negotiate\n   </em>\n   an employment agreement with greater financial gains with knowledge of those practices. In our view, Petitioner's argument begs the question: if the billing practices were so bad, why would she bargain to increase her financial benefit knowing that changes in the billing practices were not part of the agreement? Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prevailing party, Respondents, we see no reason to reverse the trial court's finding of no substantial justification. Because the wrongful termination claim fails the objective standard set forth in\n   <em>\n    Inlet Assocs.\n   </em>\n   and falls outside the zone of what is considered legitimate advocacy, the hearing judge did not commit clear error in holding that the claim lacked substantial justification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   A court need not decide at the outset of a trial whether a claim has substantial justification in order to avoid falling into the pitfall of utilizing hindsight and committing legal error. Here, the hearing judge was unable to make a final determination about the merit of the wrongful termination claim brought by Petitioner until the close of all the evidence. The hearing judge did state, on the record in response to the motion for summary judgment on the wrongful termination claim, that he believed there was \"a factual dispute that need[ed] to be litigated.\" Although the fact that a claim has survived summary judgment or a motion for judgment and therefore generates a presumption that there is substantial justification for the position, the presumption can be rebutted and was rebutted here. Specifically, one aspect of the basis for granting the renewed motion for judgment arose after Respondents called a billing expert to testify that Respondents' billing procedures complied with customary billing practices. That testimony was not challenged by Petitioner, who called no opposing expert or\n   even cross-examined Respondents' witness on the subject. The fact that it was not clear to the trial judge until the close of all the evidence that there was no \"reasonable basis\" for the litigation position taken by Petitioner regarding her wrongful termination claim is not dispositive in this case. It is significant that the hearing judge\n   carefully weighed all of the evidence presented prior to ruling on the renewed motion for judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maryland Rule 2-519(a)-(b) (\"[T]he court may proceed, as the trier of fact, to determine the facts and to render judgment against the plaintiff or may decline to render judgment until the close of all the evidence.... [T]he court shall consider all evidence and inferences ....\"). The hearing judge's ruling on the renewed motion for judgment rebuts the notion that Petitioner had substantial justification for her claim of wrongful termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In light of the severity of the imposition and the rarity with which a court ought to impose such fees under Rule 1-341, the second step in determining an award of attorney's fees under Rule 1-341 is a determination of how much, if any, in fees should be awarded.
