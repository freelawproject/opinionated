In the early 1930s, the estate of Wilbur N. Waterbury included a thirty acre farm on the eastern side of Hoyt Street. Beginning with a 1934 partition action that was followed years later by certain land transactions, the character of the Waterbury land transformed from a farm to a suburban subdivision. A 1941 committee deed conveying 1.544 acres of the Waterbury land contains the restriction at the heart of the present matter. The resolution of this appeal turns on our construction of that restriction given the\n   circumstances surrounding its creation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The restriction or a variation of it is contained in the deeds to lots owned by the plaintiffs and the Martins, but it is not contained in the deeds to the lots owned by the Briar Brae defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Prior to the events giving rise to this appeal, three of Waterbury's nieces were the beneficiaries of a life estate in the Waterbury land.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 1934, due to changing economic and societal circumstances, the Waterbury nieces initiated a partition action seeking permission to sell the Waterbury land in whole or in part. In 1937, Mary Alice Vaughan acquired 2.11 acres of the Waterbury land, which included the Waterbury homestead, consisting of a single-family home and outbuildings. See appendix to this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 1941, the Superior Court ordered Arthur I. Crandall, committee,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   to convey 1.544 acres of the Waterbury land to Clyde E. Vaughan (Vaughan). Crandall's deed to Vaughan contains the subject restriction. See footnote 6 of this opinion. Vaughan's land was adjacent to the land owned by Mary Alice Vaughan on the south and\n   on the east; the area of land on the east was triangular in shape. See appendix to this opinion. Together the Vaughans\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   owned 3.654 acres of adjoining land that fronted on Hoyt Street. The Waterbury nieces retained the remainder of the Waterbury land that surrounded the Vaughans' properties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 1953, Mary Alice Vaughan and Vaughan, individually, conveyed their respective properties to Robert G. Shepherd and Helen D. Shepherd (Shepherds). The deed from Mary Alice Vaughan conveying her property did not contain the restriction, but the deed conveying Vaughan's property to the Shepherds contained the restriction. Specifically the deed from Vaughan stated, \"[s]aid premises are subject to ... restrictive covenants and agreements of record ....\" In 1954, the Shepherds conveyed a portion of the land they acquired from Vaughan, specifically 1.38 acres, to Robert W. E. Anderson and Ingeborg Smith Anderson (Andersons). The Shepherds' deed of conveyance contained the restriction and stated, \"[b]eing a portion of the premises conveyed to the said grantors by\" Vaughan in 1953. The Shepherds did not convey to the Andersons the triangularly shaped area of land that lay to the east of the 2.11 acres once owned by Mary Alice Vaughan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 1956, the Shepherds conveyed the remainder of their land, including the triangularly shaped area, to Richard L. Webb and Nina H. Webb (Webbs). The deed to the Webbs subjected their property to the restriction \"insofar as they affect the above described premises ....\" In 1971, the Webbs created a three lot subdivision by dividing the land they had acquired from the Shepherds, i.e., lot 1, lot 2,\n   and lot 3 (Webb subdivision).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lot 2 contained the Waterbury homestead. The\n   Martins now own lot 3, which includes a portion of the triangularly shaped area of land that Crandall deeded to Vaughan in 1941. The Martins' deed states that the premises are subject to \"[t]he effect, if any, of restrictive covenants and agreements contained in\" the deed to Vaughan. (Emphasis added.) Lot 3 is adjacent to the plaintiffs' lot on the north.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2008, the plaintiffs acquired 1.38 acres of land from the Andersons. The land was once part of the 1.544 acres deeded to Vaughan in 1941, less the triangularly shaped piece of land. The plaintiffs' deed contains the restriction. See footnote 6 of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 1954, the remaining thirty acres of Waterbury land, land that had not been owned by either of the Vaughans, was acquired by Arthur Olsen Associates, Inc. The deed conveying the remaining Waterbury land does not contain the restriction. The Darien Planning and Zoning Commission thereafter approved a thirty-one lot subdivision of single-family homes to be built on the land acquired by Arthur Olsen Associates, Inc. The subdivision is known as Briar Brae, and none of the deeds to the lots in the subdivision contains the restriction. The lots owned by the Briar Brae defendants are adjacent to the land once owned by Mary Alice Vaughan and Vaughan on the east and south.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The plaintiffs commenced the present action in September, 2013.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pursuant to their substitute complaint,\n   the plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that the restriction in their deed is void and unenforceable. Such a declaration would enable them to subdivide their land into two lots: one for their own home and one for development. The plaintiffs alleged several reasons why the restriction should be declared void and unenforceable: (1) the 1941 deed violated the Superior Court's order to the committee,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) the circumstances of the neighborhood surrounding the Waterbury land have changed significantly, (3) the restriction has been abandoned, (4) the restriction benefits no one, (4) the restriction is unfair to the plaintiffs as they cannot reach an agreement with the beneficiaries of the restriction, (5) the restriction is barred by laches, and (6) the restriction has been extinguished by the Marketable\n   Title Act, General Statutes \u00a7 47-33b et seq.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The court tried the matter in the fall of 2015. Numerous maps and deeds were placed into evidence, and the court viewed the thirty acres of Waterbury land in the company of the parties' counsel. The court issued its memorandum of decision on January 20, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   We now examine the court's adjudication of the plaintiffs' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The court first considered the beneficiary of the restriction. It found that the restriction first appeared in the deeds of the Martins' predecessors in title in 1956\n   when the Shepherds conveyed the land formerly owned by Mary Alice Vaughan and the triangularly shaped area of land formerly owned by Vaughan to the Webbs. The deed from the Shepherds to the Webbs stated in part: \"Said premises are conveyed subject to restrictive covenants and agreements as set forth in a deed given by ... Crandall ... to ... Vaughan ...\n   <em>\n    insofar as they affect\n   </em>\n   the above described premises ....\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The court also found that in 1971, when the Webbs subdivided the land into three building lots, they acted in disregard of the restriction. If the restriction had been applied before the Webb subdivision was created, dwellings would have been limited to the Waterbury homestead on lot 2. Moreover, when lot 2 was created, its southerly boundary rendered the Waterbury homestead in violation of the twenty-five foot setback requirement because the setback created by the subdivision was only fifteen feet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   When the Martins took title to lot 3 in 2006, schedule A attached to their deed stated in part: \"Said premises are subject to ... [t]he\n   <em>\n    effect, if any,\n   </em>\n   of restrictive covenants and agreements contained in a deed from ... Crandall ... to Vaughan ....\" (Emphasis added.) The court found it \"apparent that the uncertainty concerning the applicability of the restriction ... manifest[ed] itself by the use of the words 'effect, if any.' \" None of the deeds to the lots owned by the Briar Brae defendants contains the restriction. The plaintiffs' lot, therefore, is the only one of thirty-five lots created from the thirty acres of the Waterbury land that is expressly made subject to the restriction without the qualifying words, \"effect, if any.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The court's memorandum of decision demonstrates its familiarity with the applicable law. Generally, \"restrictive covenants fall into three classes: (1) mutual\n   covenants in deeds exchanged by adjoining landowners; (2) uniform covenants contained in deeds executed by the owner of property who is dividing his property into building lots under a general development scheme; and (3) covenants exacted by a grantor from his grantee presumptively or actually for the benefit and protection of his adjoining land which he retains.\n   <em>\n    Stamford\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Vuono\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1535372\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/108/359/#p364\">\n    108 Conn. 359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 364,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=143%20A.%20245\">\n    143 A. 245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1928). With respect to the third class of covenants, the original grantor, who is the owner of the property benefited, and his assigns may enforce [the covenant] against subsequent purchasers of the property burdened. If the restrictive covenant is for the benefit of the remaining land of the grantor, it is an easement running with the land and may be enforced by a subsequent purchaser of the remaining land against the prior grantee and his successors in title ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Grady\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Schmitz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1964255\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/16/292/#p296\">\n    16 Conn.

Given the circumstances under which the Waterbury land was developed, the court inferred that the grantor intended the restriction to benefit only that portion of his remaining land containing the Waterbury homestead and its service buildings. The court buttressed its conclusion with the fact that the restriction is not contained in the deeds to any of the lots in Briar Brae and that lot 3 was conveyed subject only to the \"effect, if any\" of the restriction. The court concluded, therefore, that the Waterbury estate manifested an intent not to restrict the remainder of the Waterbury land, stating that the indicia of the grantor's intent not to burden all of the Waterbury land out-weighed any other evidence, including the ambivalent deed references. The court reasoned that the language \"effect, if any\" and similar words was consistent with the grantor's intent. Relying on\n   <em>\n    Marion Road Assn.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Harlow\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"772796\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/1/329/#p335\">\n    1 Conn.

Where a restrictive covenant contains words of succession, i.e., heirs and assigns, a presumption is created that the parties intended the restrictive covenant to run with\n   the land.

The court found that the plaintiffs successfully had proved that seven years before the restriction was created, the land Crandall conveyed to Vaughan was part of a thirty acre farm on undeveloped land. In 1934, the Waterbury nieces commenced a partition action that resulted in Crandall's appointment to sell the Waterbury\n   land.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   From those facts, the court inferred that in 1934, the character of the neighborhood in the vicinity of the Waterbury land was changing from agricultural to suburban. Suburban housing had begun to appear in the section of Darien where the Waterbury land was located, but the Waterbury land was not yet part of the suburban transition. In 1937, only one residential structure with outbuildings existed on the Waterbury land. None of the remaining land was developed until 1954 when Arthur Olson Associates, Inc., received approval from the Darien Planning and Zoning Commission to create the thirty-one lot Briar Brae subdivision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The court also found that lot 3 is approximately 0.75 acres in size, which is approximately the size of the lot the plaintiffs would like to \"spin off\" from their land. Briar Brae is fully developed in predominantly one-half acre lots, each of which contains a single-family home that has existed for many years. By their very nature and purpose, the homes are intended to remain permanently in their present locations. The lots owned by the plaintiffs, the Martins and the Cronins front on Hoyt Street, also known as Route 106, which is an access road to the Merritt Parkway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The court further reasoned that\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   the restriction runs with the land,\n   <em>\n    and, if arguendo\n   </em>\n   , it was intended to benefit Briar Brae, it falls within the class of covenants known as the retained land theory. See\n   <em>\n    Shippan Point Assn., Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    McManus\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"726353\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/34/209/#p215\">\n    34 Conn.

The court assumed for purposes of its analysis that the restriction runs with the land. The court applied the\n   <em>\n    Fidelity Title &amp; Trust Co.\n   </em>\n   change of circumstances test to its factual findings and concluded that the plaintiffs had \"amply satisfied\" the change of circumstances test. The court\n   found manifest that the purpose of the restriction has been frustrated permanently as the very land that it was intended to benefit, Briar Brae, had itself been subdivided into numerous building lots each of which is free of any such restriction and approximately the size of the lot that the plaintiffs seek to create.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Moreover, the court found that lot 3, which is nominally similarly restricted as the plaintiffs' land, has been in flagrant violation of the restriction for many years. The court noted that repeated violations of a restriction without effective action to enforce it constitute grounds for nullification of the restriction. See\n   <em>\n    Cappo v.

In finding that the restriction had been abandoned by failure to enforce it, the court compared the facts of the present case with\n   <em>\n    Shippan Point Assn., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , in which twelve of twenty-five lots comprising the dominant estate in a development contravened a restrictive covenant. In the present case, thirty-four of thirty-five lots contravene the restriction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The court found that lot 3 is the southern portion of the land that the Shepherds conveyed to the Webbs and that the deed conveyed the entire parcel subject to the restriction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the parcel was subject to the restriction, development of the parcel was limited to the Waterbury homestead. Sometime after 1956, when houses were constructed on lots 1 and 3 of the Webb subdivision, that portion of the restriction that limited the number of dwelling houses to one was violated. When a house was built on lot 3, that portion of the restriction that prohibits the erection of a building within twenty-five feet of the southern boundary applied not to the property as a three lot subdivision, but to the land as a single parcel. The court concluded that when more than one dwelling was constructed on the Webbs' land, the purpose of the twenty-five foot setback became meaningless not only as to the Webb subdivision, but also as to the only property that could possibly benefit from it, i.e., the plaintiffs' property, because it adjoins the Webb subdivision on the south and the plaintiffs seek to avoid the restriction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The court further found that the plaintiffs' property itself is in violation of the restriction. In 1959, a two vehicle garage\n   was constructed on the land without the grantor having approved the plan. In 2004, the main house was expanded by more than 2500 square feet and a shed was constructed eighteen feet from the southern border. Neither improvement was approved by the grantor. A perimeter fence also was added to the premises without approval.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On the basis of the foregoing, the court declared so much of the restriction that limits the plaintiffs' lot to one dwelling house, prohibits the erection of any building within twenty-five feet of the southern border of the plaintiffs' lot, or requires grantor approval of structures on the plaintiffs' lot unenforceable by the defendants. The defendants filed a motion for reargument, which the court denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendants appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On appeal, the defendants claim that in declaring certain portions of the restriction unenforceable, the court found three facts that are not supported by the evidence and also committed legal error by going beyond the four corners of the deeds and misapplying the tests enunciated in\n   <em>\n    Fidelity Title &amp; Trust Co.\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Shippan Point Assn., Inc\n   </em>\n   . In response, the plaintiffs repeatedly noted that the trial court correctly declared portions of the restriction void and unenforceable due to a significant and permanent change of circumstances that frustrate the purpose of the restriction and that the defendants are not benefited by the servitude created by the restriction. We agree with the plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In the final analysis, the resolution of this appeal turns on the construction of the restriction in the 1941 committee deed to Vaughan and subsequent deeds to the land formerly owned by Vaughan and the circumstances surrounding its creation. \"The principles governing the construction of instruments of conveyance are well established. In construing a deed, a court must consider the language and terms of the instrument as a whole. ... Our basic rule of construction is that recognition will be given to the expressed intention of the parties to a deed or other conveyance, and that it shall, if possible, be so construed as to effectuate the intent of the parties....

Moreover, even if we were to assume that the three findings are clearly erroneous, the defendants have not demonstrated how those findings affected the court's ultimate, and dispositive, conclusion that the restriction is unenforceable due to a permanent and substantial change in circumstances. For these reasons, the defendants cannot prevail on their claim that the court's findings are not supported by the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The defendants claim that the court's finding that lot 3 violates the restriction is not supported by the evidence. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The court found that the restriction in the deeds to the Martins' predecessors in title first appeared in 1956 when the Shepherds conveyed their property to the Webbs. The deed from the Shepherds to the Webbs states in part: \"All that certain piece ... of land, together with the buildings and improvements thereon ... containing in area 2.274 acres ... and bounded ... as follows: Northerly 293.48 feet ... Easterly 317.17 feet ... Southerly 251.56 feet ... Westerly 385.27 feet .... The major portion of said premises is shown and delineated on a certain map entitled Map Showing Property to be conveyed to Mary Alice Vaughan ... 1937 ... and the Easterly portion of said premises is ... shown ... on a certain map entitled, Map of Parcel No. 5 ....\n   <em>\n    Said premises are conveyed subject to restrictive covenants and agreements as set forth in a deed given by ... Crandall ...\n   </em>\n   to ...\n   <em>\n    Vaughan ...\n   </em>\n   insofar as they affect the above described premises ....\" (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) The plain language of the deeds makes clear that all of the land being conveyed, i.e., \"said premises,\" is subject to the restriction\n   <em>\n    insofar as it may be affected.\n   </em>\n   When the Martins took title to lot 3 in 2006, their deed contained the following language: \"Said premises are subject to ... [t]he\n   <em>\n    effect, if any\n   </em>\n   , of restrictive covenants and agreements contained in a deed from ... Crandall ... to ... Vaughan ....\" (Emphasis added.) The applicable restrictions are that \"said premises shall be used for private residential purposes only, and shall be limited to the erection thereon of one dwelling house and accessory buildings ... and no building shall be erected ... within twenty-five ... feet of the Southerly line thereof ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The court found that when the Webbs subdivided the land into three lots, they did so in disregard of the one dwelling house and setback restrictions. The court explained that the restriction limited the number of dwellings on the premises to one. At the time the Webbs purchased the land, one dwelling, the Waterbury homestead, existed on the premises. The construction of houses on lot 1 and lot 3\n   violated the restriction that limited the number of dwellings to one. When a dwelling was erected on lot 3 of the Webb subdivision, it violated the restriction that no building shall be erected within twenty-five feet of the southerly boundary of the premises. The restriction appears in the chain of title to lot 3 in the deed from Vaughan to the Shepherds and in the deed from the Shepherds to the Webbs and in the deed to the Martins. The court found that the Webbs violated the restriction when they constructed houses on each lot of their subdivision, including lot 3. We conclude, therefore, that the court's finding that lot 3 violates the restriction is not clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Moreover, the defendants have failed to persuade us that they have been harmed by the finding. An appellant bears the burden of demonstrating that a court's erroneous finding was harmful because it likely affected the result. See\n   <em>\n    Sander\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sander\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3684672\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/96/102/#p118\">\n    96 Conn.

Even if we assume that the court's finding that lot 3 violates the restriction is not supported by the evidence, that error, if any, is harmless as it is not the basis of the court's ultimate conclusion that the restriction was unenforceable due to a permanent, substantial change in circumstances. The finding that lot 3 violates the restriction is but one part of the court's analysis of whether the restriction should be declared void and unenforceable.

In their posttrial brief, the defendants asserted that they may enforce the restriction, \"as owners of the benefitted remaining land, against the [p]laintiffs upon the equitable principle that prevents one having knowledge of the just rights of others from defeating those rights.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Despite their assertion, the court found that the defendants failed to analyze how the equitable principle supports their position.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendants have\n   not offered us an explanation on appeal, and we find the principle inapplicable. See footnote 19 of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The court found on the basis of the evidence that at the time the restriction was created in 1941, the remainder of the land was undeveloped farmland. Mary Alice Vaughan's land was adjacent to the plaintiffs' property to the north and also fronted on Hoyt Street. The court inspected the entire thirty acre parcel in the company of the parties' counsel and found that with the exception of the lots owned by the Martins and the Cronins, the remaining thirty acres of the Waterbury land is topographically distinct from the plaintiffs' property in that it is situated at a high elevation and is physically isolated from the plaintiffs' property. The court therefore inferred that when viewed in the context of the development of the Waterbury land, including Briar Brae and the Webb subdivision, the restriction was intended to benefit only that portion of the grantor's remaining land depicted on the plaintiffs' exhibit 23, which is the Waterbury homestead. The court found that its inference was buttressed by the fact that the restriction is not contained in any of the deeds to the thirty-one lots comprising Briar Brae. Lot 3 was conveyed to the Martins only subject to the \"effect, if any\" of the restriction. The court, therefore, concluded that the Waterbury estate manifested an intent not to restrict the remainder of the thirty acres, which is now Briar Brae.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The court found that the language \"effect, if any\" and similar words was consistent with the grantor's intent. In coming to its conclusion, the court relied on\n   <em>\n    Marion Road Assn.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Harlow\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"772796\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/1/329/#p335\">\n    1 Conn.

In reaching that conclusion, it stated: \"If the restriction runs with the land and if, arguendo, it was intended to benefit Briar Brae, it falls within the ... class [of restrictions] which is known as the retained land theory.\" As we concluded in part I B of this opinion, the court properly found that the restriction was for the benefit of the Waterbury homestead. Most significantly, the restriction is not contained in any of the deeds to the lots in Briar Brae. If the grantor had intended to benefit the lots in Briar Brae by restricting development, it can fairly be assumed that the grantor would have similarly restricted development there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Finally, the defendants claim that the court's three alleged erroneous findings are interconnected and have caused them prejudice. Despite this assertion, the defendants have offered no explanation as to how they have been prejudiced or harmed by the court's findings. The defendants reside in single-family homes on lots of approximately one-half acre in size. They have not explained how permitting the plaintiffs to subdivide their lot into two lots of approximately 0.75 acres in size will cause them harm.

The defendants' claim therefore fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The defendants' second legal claim is that the court erred by concluding that the restriction that encumbered the\n   triangular area of land acquired by Vaughan expanded to encumber the entire Webb subdivision when it was conveyed by the Shepherds to the Webbs. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   As we have stated throughout this opinion, the intent of the parties is to be determined by the language of the deed. In their appellate brief, the defendants have not looked to the language of the relevant deed but rely instead on testimony and the stated beliefs of the parties. Their claim and argument ignores the plain language of the deed from the Shepherds to the Webbs: \"All that certain piece ... of land, together with the buildings and improvements thereon ... containing in area 2.274 acres ... and bounded ... as follows: Northerly 293.48 feet ... Easterly 317.17 feet ... Southerly 251.56 feet ... Westerly 385.27 feet .... The major portion of said premises is shown and delineated on a certain map entitled Map Showing Property to be conveyed to Mary Alice Vaughan ... 1937 ... and the Easterly portion of said premises is ... shown ... on a certain map entitled, Map of Parcel No. 5 ....\n   <em>\n    Said premises are conveyed subject to restrictive covenants and agreements as set forth in a deed given by ... Crandall ...\n   </em>\n   to ...\n   <em>\n    Vaughan ...\n   </em>\n   insofar as they affect the above described premises ....\" (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) The entire parcel acquired by the Webbs was made subject to the restriction \"insofar as they affect the above described premises ....\" The premises described in the deed is roughly rectangular in shape. No portion of the deed sets off and describes a triangularly shaped area of land that by itself is subject to the restriction. On the basis of our construction of the Webbs' deed, we conclude that the court did not err by concluding that the entire premises purchased by the Webbs is subject to the restriction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The defendants third legal claim is that the court improperly applied the facts of the present case to the tests enunciated in\n   <em>\n    Shippan Point Assn., Inc.,\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Fidelity Title &amp; Trust Co.\n   </em>\n   We do not agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The defendants acknowledge that the basis of the plaintiffs' action is the legal theory that there has been a permanent change of circumstances that frustrates the purpose of the restriction in the deed to Vaughan, that the restriction has been abandoned, and that the restriction does not benefit anyone. After hearing the evidence and reviewing the briefs and arguments of the parties, the court agreed with the plaintiffs' arguments. In coming to its conclusions, the court found that the restriction was violated by the Webbs and the plaintiffs, and that no one sought to enforce the restriction at the time the violations were committed. Moreover, the restriction was established when there was but one residential building on thirty acres of farm land. Those thirty acres have now been subdivided into thirty-five lots with one permanent dwelling on each of them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \"[W]hen presented with a violation of a restrictive covenant, the court is obligated to enforce the covenant unless the defendant can show that enforcement would be inequitable.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Grady\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Schmitz\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1964255\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/16/292/#p296\">\n    16 Conn.

Although we agree with the court that the Waterbury homestead was the intended beneficiary of the restriction, in the final analysis, whether Briar Brae or the Waterbury homestead was the intended beneficiary, has no effect on the outcome. The purpose of the restriction has been frustrated given a permanent, substantial change in circumstances of the Waterbury land since Crandall deeded the land to Vaughan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Shippan Point Assn., Inc. v.

The nieces alleged that the character of Darien was changing from rural farmland to suburban subdivisions. The first piece of land they partitioned-2.11 acres-contained the Waterbury homestead. The next piece of land partitioned was 1.544 acres adjacent to the Waterbury homestead. The committee's deed stated that no more than one dwelling was to be constructed on the 1.544 acres. The partition was predicated on an assumption that change was coming to the Waterbury land, and the restriction was intended to limit density and to protect the Waterbury homestead. The benefit of the restriction, therefore, inured to the Waterbury homestead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Almost fifteen years later, the remainder of the Waterbury land was sold without restriction, save for the Darien Zoning Regulations. Since that time, that land then conveyed has been subdivided into thirty-one one-half acre lots, more or less, i.e., Briar Brae. If Briar Brae was to benefit from the restriction on the plaintiffs' land, the beneficial purpose is not obvious. Briar Brae is the embodiment of what the restriction was intended to avoid. The restriction, therefore, has been frustrated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Assuming that the restriction was to benefit the Waterbury homestead from increased suburban density, the benefit was further eroded when the Webbs created their own three lot subdivision on what was the Waterbury homestead. Although the Webbs' deed contains the \"effect, if any\" restriction to the entire parcel, no one in Briar Brae, if it was the intended beneficiary of the restriction, sought to enforce it when the Webbs subdivided their land or when more than one structure and a fence were erected on the plaintiffs' land. The restriction, therefore, was abandoned when none of the owners of lots\n   in either Briar Brae or the Webb subdivision sought to enforce it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Finally, even assuming that the purpose of the restriction was to protect the Waterbury homestead or Briar Brae, neither of the properties is benefiting from it today. Although the defendants claim that they are prejudiced by the trial court's having declared the restriction null and unenforceable, none of the owners of what was the original Waterbury land is served by preventing the plaintiffs from dividing their land roughly in half so that it conforms in approximate size to every other lot that surrounds it on three sides.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the trial court properly determined that the restriction in the plaintiffs' deed is not enforceable because its purpose has been frustrated by a substantial and permanent change in circumstances, it has been abandoned by lack of enforcement, and it benefits no land.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Attachment\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   APPENDIX\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   APPENDIX\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   --------\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    \"Because servitudes create property interests that are generally valuable, courts apply the changed-conditions doctrine with caution....
