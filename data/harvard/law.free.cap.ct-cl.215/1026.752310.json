Plaintiffs say that these claimants (charities) were not entitled to any of the award but that all of it should have gone to plaintiffs on behalf of the Foller and Rohleder interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-13\">\"Since the case must be litigated further and all we have now before us is the petition (plus exhibits) and the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, it is both unnecessary and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>inappropriate to set out the presumed facts in any detail. Suffice it to say that, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 71A(d)(3)(ii), the Government, which purported not to have the identities and addresses of the Foller and Rohleder interests made general service by publication on 'Unknown Owners\u2019, as well as specific service on the two charities. The charities appeared and claimed half of the award (which they received), but neither the plaintiffs nor the Foller or Rohleder interests appeared. However, about two years after the final condemnation judgment, plaintiffs twice moved the District Court (in the condemnation suit) to set aside the prior distribution order and to direct the two charities to pay back their shares of the award previously granted by the District Court. The District Court denied the motions to reopen and the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed by memorandum order. The Supreme Court denied certiorari.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1053-5\">\"In the present case plaintiffs sue the United States under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491 for the half of the award paid to the charities on the ground that the Government did not make 'a reasonably diligent search of the records\u2019 under Fed. R. Civ. P. 71A(c)(2), so as to discover and ascertain that the Rohleder and Foller interests owned all of the condemned property and were entitled to the entire award (to the exclusion of the charities).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1053-6\">\"Defendant moves to dismiss the petition primarily on the ground that the decisions within the D.C. Circuit refusing to reopen the condemnation suit bar, by res judicata or collateral estoppel, maintenance of the present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number>action. In support of its motion the Government points out that the District Court, in its decision on the first motion to reopen, said that 'prior to the just compensation proceeding full and adequate notice to all \"unknown owners\u201d was given by p\u00fcblication. Fed. R. Civ. P. 71A(d)(3) (ii). There was also actual notice to many of the Foller and Rohleder heirs. None responded. * * * No basis exists for reopening a final judgment where movants had ample notice, slept on their rights for more than a year and failed to present any evidence of extrinsic fraud.\u2019 This is said to be a square determination that plaintiffs (and the Foller and Rohleder interests) had full notice of the condemnation proceedings and therefore that the Government must be held to have made 'a reasonably diligent search of the records.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-5\">\"The difficulty with this position (as defendant candidly recognizes in its motion to dismiss) is that that District Court went immediately on to add: 'Assuming the Government failed to make a \"reasonably diligent search of the records\u201d as required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 71A(c)(2) a separate independent action for just compensation may lie against the United States in the Court of Claims [citing some of the authorities referred to in note 2, <em>supra], </em>but that issue is not before this Court.\u2019 The Court of Appeals affirmed because it found no abuse of discretion by the District Court, but it specifically added: 'We express no opinion on whether appellants [plaintiffs here] may press their claim in a suit under the Tucker Act * * *.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-6\">\"On the basis of their memoranda, we cannot conclude that the District of Columbia federal courts determined anything at all with respect to 'a reasonably diligent search of the records\u2019 by the Government under Fed. R. Civ. P. 71A(c)(2). We are not convinced that the District Court decided anything more than that due notice was given by publication to 'Unknown Owners\u2019 under Fed.R. Civ.P. 71A(d)(3)(ii). It may be, however, that though due notice is given to 'Unknown Owners\u2019 by publication under the latter requirements, the'United States could still be liable under the Tucker Act for failing to make the diligent record search which would have specifically revealed the Foller and Rohleder interests as having or claiming a definite interest in the condemned property and therefore as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>entitled to personal service (not merely service by publication) under Fed. R. Civ. P. 71A (d)(3)(i). Rule 71A makes a sharp distinction between persons whose names are learned through a reasonably diligent record search, and 'Unknown Owners\u2019 who may be served by general publication. That distinction may conceivably ground a claim under the Tucker Act. Although the District of Columbia courts decided that proper notice by publication was given to 'Unknown Owners\u2019, they did not determine \u2014 as best as we can make out \u2014 that a reasonably diligent record search was actually made by the Government in this instance. Accordingly, we reject the defense of res judicata/collateral estoppel based on the holdings of the District of Columbia federal courts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1055-5\">\"There remains the legal issue of whether an inverse condemnation claim may be maintained here on the theory that the Government failed to make 'a reasonably diligent search of the records\u2019 so as to discover the Foller and Rohleder interests. See the materials cited in note 2, <em>supra. </em>Neither party has adequately briefed that question and we refuse to decide it without a more thorough, detailed and careful presentation. Nor can we decide on the present motion (which is based on the defense of former adjudication) the issue of whether the Government in fact made a reasonably diligent search of the records (or whether all the Rohleder and Foller interests had adequate advance actual notice). Our denial of defendant\u2019s current motion to dismiss will be without prejudice to the filing by either or both parties, if they so desire, of motions for summary judgment raising the questions of whether (i) an inverse condemnation claim in this court can be grounded on a failure by the Government to make a reasonably diligent search of the records under Rule 71A (c)(2), and/or (2) in this particular case the Government did or did not in fact make such a search (or whether the plaintiffs\u2019 interests nevertheless had proper actual notice).</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>\"it is therefore ordered and concluded, without oral argument,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss is denied without prejudice to motions for summary judgment, as stated above, and the case is returned to the Trial Division.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1053-7\"> The District Court did allow the Foller and Rohleder interests to receive the one-half of the award which had not been distributed to the charities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-8\">Suit has also been brought, thus far unsuccessfully, in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia against the charities to compel them to repay the portion of the award they received. That adverse ruling is now on appeal to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1053-9\"> For some discussion bearing on the possibility of such a claim under the Tucker Act for inverse condemnation, see 12 Wright and Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>(1973) \u00a7 3045 at 103; <em>United States v. 22,680 Acres of Land in Kleberg </em>Co., Tex., 438 F.2d 75, 77-78 (5th Cir. 1971); Philips <em>v.
