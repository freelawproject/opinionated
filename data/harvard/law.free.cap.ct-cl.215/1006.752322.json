App. \u00a7 1218 (Supp. V, 1975) of two 'Determinations of Excessive Profits\u2019 by the Renegotiation Board, are now before the court on defendant\u2019s uncontested Motion for Judgment in Aid of Execution of the Renegotiation Board orders of September 19, 1973. These orders concerned the fiscal year ending June 30, 1968, and were issued for two now defunct companies, to which plaintiff became successor in interest by a corporate merger on July 1, 1968. The profits which were determined to be excessive totaled $125,000.00 in case number 468-73 and $150,000.00 in case number 469-73. After deductions were made for various state and federal tax credits these sums were reduced to $60,801.37 and $64,378.48, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-5\">\"Although plaintiff initiated the action in this court, it neither paid the amount in question to the Government nor posted bond as required by Rule 26. Defendant, noting these facts, has counterclaimed for the entire amount<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503, \u00a7 2508 (1970) and 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1215(b)(3)(1970). Because we believe plaintiffs failure to comply with proper procedures to be without justification, we grant defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-6\">\"Plaintiff sought to excuse its failure to comply with these statutory requirements by alleging that it had consistently sustained net losses, that it was employing all of its capital in an attempt to 'sustain a financially competent enterprise,\u2019 and that any 'attempt to post a bond in the amount generally called for in Rule 26 will be detrimental to the financial efficacy of the plaintiff and may well severely thwart its ability to exercise its statutory right to litigate its claim in this case. <em>See Sandnes\u2019 Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>199 Ct.Cl. 107, 462 F.2d 1388 (1972).\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-7\">\"These allegations were contained in an answer filed on March 18, 1974. On July 15, 1977, more than three years later, the defendant filed its Motion for Judgment in Aid of Execution which is currently before us. During this extended period of time, plaintiff has done nothing to prosecute its claim and has still neither paid the assessments nor posted bond. Plaintiff has, however, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>interim, 'sold <em>(i.e., </em>contracted to sell) its property, assets and business. for $1,150,000.\u2019 Defendant has submitted exhibits indicating that plaintiff is no longer in business and that plaintiff received, in December 1976, 'a bank check for $610,000, a promissory note for $200,000, and an additional bank check of $340,002 (less the aggregate sum of accounts payable and accrued liabilities, but plus the sum of any prepaid expenses). Defendant asserts that this clear availability of liquid assets, sufficient either to pay the assessment or post bond, renders the <em>Sandnes\u2019 Sons </em>pre-judgment hearing doctrine inapplicable in the present case. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-5\">\"Although <em>Sandnes\u2019 </em>Sons, <em>supra, </em>remains a strong statement of this court\u2019s unwillingness to grant a judgment in aid of execution where such a judgment may deny due process by threatening such harm to a contractor that he would be effectively 'chilled\u2019 in his pursuit of a fair redetermination, we are not now faced with such a situation. The removal of cash from the pocket of the complaining contractor,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> when such cash is as available as it has been demonstrated to be in the case at hand, does not represent injury sufficient to 'chill\u2019 the contractor\u2019s further appeal to this court. Indeed, it was just such a detriment to the contractor which Congress envisioned to be necessary to prevent frivolous redetermination suits and to protect the pecuniary interests of the Government while such redetermination was underway. <em>See, e.g., Manufacturers Service Company, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>207 Ct.Cl. 185, 193, 518 F.2d 1202, 1206 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-6\">\"In any event, from the uncontradicted facts now before us, it appears that plaintiff initiated these suits, was \u25a0 subject to a compulsory, see <em>Solitron Devices, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>210 Ct.Cl. 352, 357, 537 F.2d 417, 420 (1976) counterclaim by defendant, and thereafter acquired cash sufficient to satisfy either the excessive profits assessment or the Rule 26 bond.
