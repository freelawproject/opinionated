Carr Ferguson, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1093-11\">Before Davis, <em>Judge, </em>Presiding, Nichols and Kashiwa, <em>Judges.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b1093-12\">\"Taxpayer\u2019s petition asks for an income tax refund in the sum of $2,415.44 for its taxable year 1974, and for taxable year 1973 asks, without claiming any refund for that year, that it be held entitled to additional deductions in the amouht of $5,483.20. Defendant has moved to dismiss the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1068\">*1068</page-number>claim for 1973 because, with respect to that year, taxpayer seeks no monetary relief at all but only a declaratory judgment or advisory opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Taxpayer has failed to respond to this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-5\">\"Defendant is correct. With a few exceptions not relevant here, this court has no power to give declaratory relief; and, as an Article III tribunal, it has no constitutional authority to grant an advisory opinion. <em>United States v. Testan, </em>424 U.S. 392 (1976); <em>United States v. King, </em>395 U.S. 1 (1969). The petition apparently seeks to increase taxpayer\u2019s net operating loss for 1973 through increasing the deductions for that year, but no refund demand for 1973, or for a taxable year (if any) to which such an increased loss could and would be carried, is stated in the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-6\">\"it is therefore ordered and concluded, without oral argument, that defendant\u2019s partial motion to dismiss is granted and the petition is dismissed with respect to the taxable year 1973.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1094-12\"> Defendant has not moved with respect to the claim for 1974.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
