Sharp, et al.</parties>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AALj\">-On September 29, 1977 the court entered the following order:</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b909-8\"><em>Charles Emmet Lucey, </em>attorney of record for plaintiff. <em>Harrison, Lucey &amp; Sagle, </em>of counsel.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b909-9\"><em>Peter A. T. Sartin, </em>with whom was <em>Assistant Attorney General Barbara Allen Babcock, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b909-10\">Before Davis, <em>Judge, </em>Presiding, Kunzig, and Bennett, <em>Judges.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b909-11\">\"This action, a claim for compensation brought pursuant to the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491 (1973),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>court on defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and plaintiffs\u2019 opposition thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">\"Plaintiffs allege that 'over-regulation\u2019 by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) resulted in an unconstitutional taking of their interest in a successfully operating bank (Bank). Defendant counters with the assertion, <em>inter alia, </em>that, to the extent plaintiffs state a claim upon which relief can be granted, it is a claim sounding in tort which is not within the jurisdiction of this court. For the reasons stated below, we agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">\"Viewing the pleadings in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, we see a situation in which the local agents of the FDIC, through a variety of activities and actions, forced the closing of the Bank, in which plaintiffs were major shareholders, which was at that time solvent and operating smoothly.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">\"Plaintiffs primarily complain of four major actions by the FDIC which, they allege, constituted 'over-regulation\u2019 to such an extent as to rise to the level of unconstitutional taking. These were (1) 'directing\u2019 the Bank\u2019s board of directors to hire a new chairman and chief executive officer and designating the individual to be named; (2) 'directing\u2019 certain of the shareholders to pledge to the Bank free and clear title to certain improved real property, threatening to 'close and terminate the Bank\u2019s existence\u2019 if the pledge were not made; (3) 'causing] the transfer and exchange\u2019 of substantial Bank assets, substituting in their place 'questionable assets ... in the form of bad loans and credits\u2019 which 'lessened the value of the Bank\u2019s assets\u2019; and (4) 'demanding] that the Directors adopt a resolution closing the Bank on grounds of insolvency,\u2019 even though the Bank was solvent at the time, reinforcing this demand by threatening unilaterally to close the Bank and by making various misrepresentations concerning the future intentions of the FDIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>\"While we certainly concur in plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that regulation by a Government agency can become so overbearingly burdensome that it constitutes a taking of property compensable under the Fifth Amendment, <em>see, e.g., Benenson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>212 Ct. Cl. 375, 548 F.2d 939 (1977), we do not believe that plaintiffs\u2019 petition properly alleges such 'over-regulation.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">\"Initially, we note that the FDIC is nowhere given the authority unilaterally to take any of the actions it is alleged to have taken or compelled. <em>See </em>12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1811-1831 (1969). The precise limits of FDIC corrective authority are well defined and action may be taken by the FDIC only with appropriate procedural safeguards and judicial supervision. <em>See, e.g., </em>12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1818(a)-(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">\"Since the FDIC did not have the power to take any of the actions complained of, the most literal reading of plaintiffs\u2019 petition would yield allegations that the FDIC or its agents had acted beyond the scope of their authority. This may state a claim upon which relief can be granted, but not in this court. The Court of Claims has no jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491 (1973) to hear claims sounding in tort. <em>See, e.g., Eastport Steamship Corp. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>178 Ct.Cl. 599, 607, 372 F.2d 1002, 1008-09 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">\"Alternatively, plaintiffs\u2019 petition could also be read to allege that, since the Bank was solvent and operating successfully, the FDIC or its agents acted wrongfully in influencing those who had the power \u2014 the board of directors, the Bank management, or the state banking authorities \u2014 to take the actions complained of. This claim also sounds in tort and is also beyond the jurisdiction of this court. <em>De-Tom Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>213 Ct.Cl. 362, 552 F.2d 337 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">\"The underlying difficulty in plaintiffs\u2019 petition is that the actions of the FDIC must have been either within or outside its scope of authority and must have been either justified or not justified by the financial condition of the Bank. If they were within the proper scope and justified by the diminished financial stability of the Bank \u2014 which plaintiffs cannot admit for fear of conceding that circumstances other than FDIC intervention diminished the value <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>of their property \u2014 then they were proper acts of regulation within the language of <em>Pennsylvania Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Mahon, </em>260 U.S. 393,413 (1922), and its progeny. <em>Trone </em>v. <em>United States, </em>213 Ct. Cl. 671 (1977). If the actions were beyond the authority of the FDIC or totally unjustified by the circumstances of the Bank \u2014 as plaintiffs allege \u2014 then the plaintiffs\u2019 claim must necessarily sound in tort and be beyond the jurisdiction of this court. Either way, plaintiffs\u2019 position cannot be logically maintained and we must find for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">\"it is therefore ordered, upon consideration of the pleadings, defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and plaintiffs\u2019 opposition thereto, without oral argument, that defendant\u2019s motion be and hereby is granted and that plaintiffs\u2019 petition be and hereby is dismissed for failing to state a claim within the jurisdiction of this Court.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b909-12\"> Plaintiffs have initiated two suits in United States District Court for the District of Columbia which were based essentially on the same nucleus of operative facts. The first, C.A. No. 75-0230, was brought pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 500, 701-04. It was dismissed because plaintiffs had stated a cause of action in tort for which the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) provided the exclusive remedy, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679, but had failed t\u00f3 comply with procedural requirements of the FTCA. This dismissal was affirmed by the Court of Appeals. <em>Sharp </em>v. <em>FDIC, </em>535 F.2d 1325 (D.C. Cir. 1976). The second suit, C.A. No. 76-0176, filed after the dismissal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>of the first, was brought pursuant to the FTCA. It was dismissed, however, because plaintiffs had exceeded the two-year statute of limitations of the FTCA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(b). Plaintiffs appealed, No. 76-1700, and the case was briefed and argued, but the appeal was withdrawn by stipulation prior to decision on January 21, 1977. This suit was filed on January 24, 1977.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
