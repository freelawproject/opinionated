Trial Judge Browne denied the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>motions on November 9, 1977, and set all the cases for trial commencing February 13, 1978, and continuing, <em>seriatim, </em>through March 13, 1978. Defendant is now seeking prompt review of Trial Judge Browne\u2019s November 9, 1977, order pursuant to Rule 53(c)(2)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">\"A complicating factor is that there are three other cases presently pending before other trial judges. <em>Donna Jean, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>No. 105-77, is pending before Trial Judge White. In that case Trial Judge White denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suspend without prejudice should the parties subsequently agree that the decision in <em>Bill Wells </em>be binding. <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>United States, </em>No. 121-77, and <em>Litrico </em>v. <em>United States, </em>No. 517-77, are pending before Trial Judge Yock. Trial Judge Yock suspended proceedings in <em>Leonard. </em>No such action has been taken in <em>Litrico; </em>however, <em>Litrico </em>was just recently filed (October 17, 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\">\"All the above cases involve withholding tax, unemployment tax, and social security tax questions and the duty of the employer to collect and pay the taxes over to the Internal Revenue Service. I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3101, 3111, 3301, and 3402. The controlling issue in all is whether the fishermen in each case are employees or independent contractors.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The factual setting of all these cases also is quite similar, although not identical.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-7\">\"The defendant has selected another case, <em>Bill Wells, Jr., T/A Wells Shrimp Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>No. 504-76, involving the same questions, issue, and factual pattern, for a test motion for summary judgment. The motion for summary judgment in that case and the plaintiffs objection thereto have been filed with the clerk\u2019s office as of December 6, 1977. Fifteen days from December 6, 1977, the defendant\u2019s reply brief is due. Rule 52(b)(2). After that, assuming no extension of time is requested or granted, the summary judgment motion in <em>Bill Wells </em>will be ready for our consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-8\">\"We note that none of the plaintiffs in the captioned cases nor the plaintiff in <em>Donna Jean, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>have agreed to be bound by the decision in <em>Bill </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>Wells. Despite this and the factual nature of the employee/independent contractor issue generally, we feel judicial economy requires the granting of the motion to suspend and motion for enlargement of time pending our resolution of the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment in the <em>Bill Wells case. We </em>hold this to be especially true in the captioned cases for the plaintiffs did not oppose such action before Trial Judge Browne. However, we feel that defendant\u2019s request for 60 days beyond our resolution of the summary judgment motion in <em>Bill Wells </em>is needlessly dilatory, as the plaintiffs contended before Trial Judge Browne. Therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\">\"it is ordered that defendant\u2019s request for prompt review be and hereby is granted. Further, it is ordered that defendant\u2019s motion for enlargement of time in Nos. 362-76, 371-76, 372-76, 456-76, 502-76, and 516-76 pending our resolution of the summary judgment motion in <em>Bill Wells, supra, </em>be and hereby is granted. It is further ordered that defendant\u2019s motion to suspend proceedings in Nos. 344-76, 345-76, and 503-76 pending our resolution of the summary judgment motion in <em>Bill Wells </em>be and hereby is granted. The defendant\u2019s request in both motions for 60 days beyond our resolution of the summary judgment motion in <em>Bill Wells is </em>hereby denied.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1025-9\"> The discrimination and estoppel issues raised by some of the plaintiffs were severed from the employee/independent contractor issue pursuant to our order of November 18, 1977.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
