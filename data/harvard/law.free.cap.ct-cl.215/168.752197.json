Throughout this period plaintiffs were assigned to the Immigration suboffices at Port Everglades and West Palm Beach, Florida. Prior to May 12, 1965, their duties consisted primarily of conducting inspections of aliens seeking admission to the United States at these ports of entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-15\">On May 12, 1965, the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the United States Bureau of Customs adopted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>a joint inspections procedure modifying plaintiffs\u2019 duties. The object was to conserve person power (we presume manpower is a taboo word) by mutual assumption of one another\u2019s inspectional duties. In addition to their usual tasks as immigrations inspectors, under the new procedure plaintiffs were also required to conduct customs inspections for all commercial vessels and yachts entering the United States between 5:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m., and on weekends and holidays. It is stated that private yachts, particularly, were \u2014ften \u2014uilty of arriving with short advance radio notification or none at all. Inspectors were scheduled to perform these dual inspections on a rotating basis. In conjunction with overtime inspections, they were also required to serve standby duty at their homes prepared to receive telephone notice of a need for their services, and to depart, at once or nearly, to the port of entry for the purpose of inspecting arriving vessels and aliens. Only four individuals were available for this duty at each port, and, consequently, each plaintiff was on standby duty at least 25 percent of each year. Plaintiffs state that standby duty was obligatory and interfered substantially with their family and social lives. Without disputing about semantics, \u2014e call this duty of awaiting telephone calls standby duty because plaintiffs do. In view of the result we reach, we state the facts according to plaintiffs\u2019 version.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Defendant has offered evidence to the effect that because of the lucrative nature of the overtime income, inspectors were far from reluctant to be available for overtime inspections. A Deputy District Director for the Immigration and Naturalization Service stated that in many ports the inspection officers were free to work out overtime arrangements among themselves, and were not subject to a directive that particular individuals be available at specific times. Plaintiffs assert, and we assume, that the scheduling and posting of names and hours for awaiting calls was a function performed by management.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Although there is some controversy as to whether standby and overtime duties were truly mandatory, we will accept plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that these duties were not assigned on a voluntary basis. Even so, under existing law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>we cannot order further premium compensation for plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Plaintiffs have been amply compensated for their overtime duty under the terms of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1353a, which pertains specifically to employees of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-7\">The Attorney General shall fix a reasonable rate of extra compensation for overtime services of immigration officers and employees of the Immigration and Naturalization Service who may be required to remain on duty between the hours of five o\u2019clock postmeridian and eight o\u2019clock antemeridian, or on Sundays or holidays, to perform duties in connection with the examination and landing of passengers and crews of steamships, trains, airplanes or other vehicles, arriving in the United States from a foreign port by water, land, or air, such rates to be fixed on a basis of one-half day\u2019s additional pay for each two hours or fraction thereof of at least one hour that the overtime extends beyond five o\u2019clock postmeridian (but not to exceed two and one-half days\u2019 pay for the full period from five o\u2019clock postmeridian to eight o\u2019clock antemeridian) and two additional days\u2019 pay for Sunday and holiday duty; * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">By guaranteeing that inspectors will be paid at least double their normal hourly wage for inspections performed outside of office hours, section 1353a effects a generous system of phantom hours for those employees called upon to conduct inspections at irregular, and perhaps inconvenient, times. An employee who works, for example, two hours or any fraction thereof during the designated hours, is paid for a half-day; if he works three hours, or up to four hours, he is paid for a full days\u2019 work. In other words, for every two hours he works, he is paid for another two hours which in reality he did not work. Hence, the term \"phantom\u201d hours. To illustrate the level of compensation of plaintiffs pursuant to section 1353a, overtime and total pay for the year 1973 was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>\n<em>Regular Salary Overtime Salary Total</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Bowser $15,155.20 $17,139.57 $32,294.77</p>\n<p id=\"AeQ\">Carter 15.504.80 17,577.03 33,081.83</p>\n<p id=\"ACm\">Cockerel 11.666.40 17,279.61 28,946.01</p>\n<p id=\"AWg\">Grimm 14.553.60 16,206.56 30,505.54</p>\n<p id=\"AlF\">Harvin 13.798.80 21,445.45 34,658.25</p>\n<p id=\"AqC\">Kile 10,164.48 13,798.91 23,963.39</p>\n<p id=\"AIX\">McHugh 18.265.60 23,013.14 41,278.74</p>\n<p id=\"Avj\">Ryals 15.097.60 22,788.98 37,886.58</p>\n<p id=\"Afg\">Smith 14.382.40 17.259.41 31,641.81</p>\n<p id=\"A-L\">Turner 15,155.20 17.564.41 32,719.61</p>\n<p id=\"b198-34\">Presumably, this liberal feature is intended in some measure to recompense for the disruption of the home lives of officers who must be available for and report to duty at unusual hours. At least, such disruption is commonly urged as justifying it. The question presented to this court is whether plaintiffs, who have already been paid under section 1353a for hours at the duty station, can recover any further amounts under other statutes pertaining to government employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-35\">The general provisions governing premium pay for federal employees are contained in subchapter V of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5541-49. Section 5542 sets forth the overall scheme for overtime pay by providing that work in excess of the basic 40 hour workweek shall be compensated at an hourly rate equal to one and one-half times the hourly rate of basic pay of the employee. Section 5545 establishes a pay differential for night, standby, Sunday, irregular, and hazardous duty. Section 5549 precludes any employee from obtaining overtime, or premium, pay, under subchapter V for services for which he has already been compensated under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1353a. Insofar as relevant, the texts of these provisions are contained in the Appendix following this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-36\">Plaintiffs fix their sights primarily on the \u00a7 5545 differential for standby and irregular time. When this is made applicable, no attempt is made to record or calculate the actual hours worked and instead an addition is made to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>the basic annual salary at an arbitrary rate, not in excess of 25 percent. They say that management abused its discretion in not fixing such a rate for them. They focus less on the time and a half rate under \u00a7 5542(a). What we say hereinafter will apply to both so far as the context permits. We may assume that on any day, besides the alleged standby, they will have performed at least eight regularly scheduled hours at the office or duty station.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">In light of the prohibition against concurrent premium pay, to the extent that the phantom hours feature of section 1353a is construed to compensate plaintiffs both for being expected to be available at their homes when needed as well as for actual inspections performed at irregular hours, section 5549 would clearly bar any additional payment for standby time under section 5545.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">The court need not base its decision concerning the claim for standby time on these grounds, however. Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that section 1353a\u2019s phantom pay does not compensate plaintiffs for the time they are required to expend remaining at home in readiness to make an immediate departure for the port to inspect an arriving vessel, it still does not follow that plaintiffs are entitled to a pay differential under section 5545. The principle that federal employees cannot receive extra compensation for standby time of this nature is firmly established. <em>See, </em>e.g., <em>Aldridge </em>v. <em>United States, </em>202 Ct. Cl. 365, 479 F.2d 1365 (1973); <em>Moss </em>v. <em>United States, </em>173 Ct. Cl. 1169, 353 F.2d 746 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">In Moss v. <em>United States, supra, </em>this court held that an attorney for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, who on occasion was ordered to perform telephone standby duty at home after regular daytime working hours and on weekends, could not recover overtime compensation for that standby duty. Except for being required to remain within hearing distance of the telephone, plaintiff was otherwise free to enjoy his normal pursuits. 173 Ct. Cl. at 1172, 353 F.2d at 747. Consequently, the court reasoned that the standby duty, which unarguably restricted Moss\u2019 activities to a degree, nevertheless did not amount to compensable hours of work. Although plaintiffs attempt to distinguish Moss on the ground that the claimant therein <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>was not expected to do anything other than receive telephone calls, while plaintiffs, once called were required to leave their homes and report for duty, this distinction ignores the overriding fact that the standby time was accumulated at plaintiffs\u2019 residences, rather than in their offices. It is now settled that standby time is not compensable unless performed at the claimant\u2019s office or station. See <em>Aldridge </em>v. <em>United States, supra; Detling </em>v. <em>United States, </em>193 Ct. Cl. 125, 432 F.2d 462 (1970); <em>Moss </em>v. <em>United States, supra; Rapp </em>v. <em>United States, </em>167 Ct. Cl. 852, 340 F.2d 635 (1964). Moreover, even standby time which is spent exclusively at the place of employment is not entirely compensable. Generally, even when the employee remains on government premises, any time set aside for sleeping or eating, during which the employee in fact does not perform any substantial labor, is excluded from the computation for compensable hours. <em>See Rapp </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>167 Ct. Cl. at 866, 340 F.2d at 642-43. Thus, plaintiffs are barred from recovering for standby status under section 5545.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Although plaintiffs argue that an unreported case decided by a district court in Ohio, <em>Rothgeb </em>v. Statts, Civil Action No. 4082 (S.D. Ohio, Feb. 23, 1973), supports their contentions and should be regarded as controlling, this case in fact seems to follow settled law in regard to the compensability of standby time. In <em>Rothgeb, </em>plaintiffs were federal employees assigned to international air flights as sky marshalls, to protect passengers and crews from skyjackings. In this capacity, plaintiffs were required to remain at a motel located near the airport, essentially in standby status. The hotel accommodations were obtained by and paid for by the government. For purposes of evaluating compensability of standby duty, it appears that the motel rooms could reasonably be regarded as the employer\u2019s premises, or, in' effect, the sky marshall\u2019s offices. This case, thus, is factually distinct from the instant matter, where plaintiffs waited in their own residences to be called to duty. <em>Rothgeb </em>simply does not support awarding compensation for standby time to plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>Finally, it should be noted that the statutory provision relied upon by plaintiffs does not apply to them by its own terms. See text of section 5545, set forth in the Appendix following this opinion. Plaintiffs have not shown that the head of the Immigration and Naturalization Service has authorized any premium pay pursuant to section 5545. This cannot be argued to be abuse of discretion because the statute does not apply to plaintiffs. Section 5545 limits compensable standby status to those times when an employee remains \"at, or within the confines of, his station.\u201d This, then, creates an inference that standby duty performed at an employee\u2019s residence is not intended to be compensable under section 5545. It might also be noted that in interpreting this premium pay provision in <em>Rapp </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>this court concluded that the provision was primarily aimed at the situation of firefighters, whose basic workweek and overtime was composed principally of standing by to respond to any emergencies which might arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">In view of the express terms of section 5545, and precedent consistently holding that standby duty performed at an employee\u2019s residence is not to be compensated, we cannot find that these plaintiffs are entitled to recover any premium pay based on standby duty. Furthermore, there is no basis for granting a trial on any disputed facts, because the most material fact, <em>i.e., </em>where the standby duty was performed, is agreed upon by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">In addition to their claim for standby pay, plaintiffs seek additional overtime pay for dual inspections which they performed but allege they were not fully compensated for. More specifically, plaintiffs state that there were a number of instances when they performed inspections for which they were paid only a flat rate of $25.00, rather than the amount required by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1353a. Plaintiffs request an accounting, and a trial to determine whether they are entitled to additional compensation, and if so, to how much.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">Other than an affidavit of a union officer representing immigration employees, there is no evidence before us to substantiate the claims that plaintiffs have not been fully paid for all inspections performed in the period for which suit is brought. This affidavit, as defendant points out, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>subject to a number of infirmities, but its principal deficiency is that it is not based on the personal knowledge of the affiant, who is not a plaintiff, and who does not, and has not ever performed dual inspections. See Rule 101(f), of the Rules of the Court of Claims. Plaintiffs have not supplied us with any affidavits or statements of their own, nor have they submitted any payroll data in support of their contentions. Plaintiffs nevertheless argue that there is a genuine issue, and that a trial is required so that discovery may proceed. It might be noted, however, that although the government states discovery was available to plaintiffs all along, no attempt has been made since the date of filing, two years ago, to seek discovery, nor has this failure to request discovery been explained.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Finally, these claims were submitted administratively, and, \"after a diligent search of the records\u201d denied because nothing was found to substantiate the claims. <em>Bowser </em>v. <em>United States, </em>Administrative Claim to the Immigration and Naturalization Service, letter of George Taempalez, Acting Associate Regional Commissioner, April 16, 1976. In the absence of a showing that the administrative determination is incorrect, or subject to challenge as, for example, being against the substantial weight of the evidence, such a finding should be upheld. <em>See, e.g., Wilmot </em>v. <em>United States, </em>205 Ct. Cl. 666, 682 (1974); <em>Grover </em>v. <em>United States, </em>200 Ct. Cl. 337, 353-54 (1973); <em>Morelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>177 Ct. Cl. 848, 858 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">In short, in the absence of any supporting documentation for their assertions concerning the inadequacy of compensation for actual inspections, plaintiffs\u2019 request for a trial cannot be granted over an opposing motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">Accordingly, defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is granted, plaintiffs\u2019 cross-motion for summary judgment is denied, and plaintiffs\u2019 petition is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">\n<em>APPENDIX</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5542 (1970), <em>as amended, </em>(Supp. V, 1975), provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b202-11\">\u00a7 5542.
