His claim is that he 'is a minister in the Libertarian Religious Order\u2019 and that 'it is contrary to plaintiffs religion to contribute to a mandatory government pension plan.\u2019 The defendant has moved for summary judgment on the grounds (among others) that (a) taxpayer failed to file timely refund claims for 1965 through 1970, and (b) as to 1971-1973, limitations has expired since more than two years have elapsed in each instance after the refund claims for those years were rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-10\">\"We grant the Government\u2019s motion to which plaintiff has not responded. A timely refund claim to the Internal Revenue Service is a necessary prerequisite to a refund suit. Int. Rev. Code, \u00a7 7422(a). The Service has been unable to locate any refund claim for 1965-1970 or any indication that any such claims were filed, and taxpayer has been unable to produce any copies of such claims or any proof whatever that he filed any timely claims for that period. The petition must therefore be dismissed as to those years. <em>Bondanza v. United States, </em>207 Ct. Cl. 945 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-11\">\"Taxpayer did file timely refund claims for 1971-1973, but the Service disallowed all of those claims by March 11, 1975. Suit was not brought here until March 21, 1977. This is beyond the two-year period allowed by \u00a7 6532(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, and accordingly the court lacks jurisdiction of the claims for 1971-1973. <em>Loew\u2019s Theatres, Inc. v.
