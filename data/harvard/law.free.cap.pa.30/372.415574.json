The deed was recorded in the proper office, May 31st 1854, in Deed Book T. H. No. 150, page 204, &amp;c. There was no reservation of the party-wall, nor was the same otherwise expressed in the said deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-6\">\u201c In January 1856, the defendants became the owners of the adjoining lot on the south side, and design using the whole of the party-wall (in the erection of a three story brick dwelling), valued at $206.39.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-7\">\u201c Messrs. Dilks &amp; Collins are the holders of a bill of sale from Sebastian Root to them, made the 1st of May 1854, by virtue of which they claim to be the owners of the party-wall, and they have since, to wit, May 1856, agreed to convey to the defendants the right to use the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-8\"><em>\u201c </em>This bill of sale was not recorded in the office of the recorder of deeds, nor had the plaintiff any notice of the transfer until some time after the execution of the deeds to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-9\"><em>\u201c </em>If the court shall be of opinion that the plaintiff, upon the facts above stated, is the owner of the said party-wall under the Act of Assembly, passed the 10th day of April 1849, and not the said Dilks &amp; Collins, then jadgment to be entered in favour of the plaintiff for $206.39 and costs; but if the court be of a contrary opinion, then judgment to be entered in favour of the defendants, wfith leave to either party to take a writ of error to the judgment that may be entered.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-10\">The bill of sale, or receipt, referred to in the above case stated, is as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-11\"><em>\u201c </em>Received, May 2d 1854, from Dilks &amp; Collins, two hundred and four T3S% dollars, in full for party-wall, as measured by Josiah Evans, April 25th 1854; the wall situated on the east side of Franklin street, at the distance of three hundred and twenty-two feet five and one-quarter inches north from the north side of Poplar street. Sebastian Root.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-12\">The court below gave judgment for the plaintiff, on the case stated, which was here assigned for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b373-13\">Thorn, for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACT\">\u2014 The Act of 1849 has been decided not to be retroactive: Dannaker <em>v. </em>Riley, 2 <em>Harris </em>435; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>Bell <em>v. </em>Bronson, 5 <em>Harris </em>364. This case presents for the first time the question as to its effect on subsequent conveyances. It is' submitted that the act has no operation, where the owner of a building, before the sale of it, transfers, for a fair consideration, his right to reimbursement for the cost of the wall used by the next builder. That act has in no manner altered or changed the nature of the right of the first builder; it was a chose in action before the Act of 1849, and remains so still.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b374-6\"><em>Kreider, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATj\">\u2014 The best rule by which to arrive at the meaning and intention of a law, is to abide by the words which the law maker has used: Olmsted\u2019s Case, <em>Brightly's R. </em>9; 1 <em>Harris </em>166. The Act of 1849 gives the ownership of the party-wall to \u201cthe owner of the house for the time <em>being.\u2019r </em>One who purchases without notice of a previous transfer of the wall, is entitled to the compensation for its use: Bye <em>v. </em>Roberts, 14 <em>Leg. Int. </em>212.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b374-7\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b374-8\">Woodward, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AuJ\">\u2014 That the first builder of a party-wall had but a right of action against the second builder \u2014 that it was a mere chose in action, and. did not pass by the first builder\u2019s conveyance of his house and lot; and that a payment by the second builder to the grantee of the first, would not protect him, were conclusions of law ruled and settled in a variety of cases, which are referred to in 10 <em>Barr </em>155 and 219.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">But to alter and change the rule, and to make the first builder\u2019s interest in the party-wall pass by his conveyance, unless expressly excepted, the Act of 10th April 1849 was passed, and its terms are full and ample for the purpose. It provides \u201c that in all conveyances of houses and buildings the right to and compensation for the party-wall built therewith, shall be taken to have passed to the purchaser, unless otherwise expressed;\u201d and \u201c the owner of the house for the time being shall have all the remedies in respect to such party-wall as he might have in relation to the house to which this attached.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">This is making the interest to be in law what it always was in fact, an interest in the realty, and not a mere personal right. Root\u2019s conveyance was under this Act of Assembly, for it was made the 25th May 1854, and it passed to his vendee his interest in the party-wall. His previous bill of sale to Dilks &amp; Collins of 2d May 1854, was of no consequence, for it was unrecorded; Beenken had no notice of it; and it was not in form a conveyance of any interest in the realty. Any other judgment than that which the court rendered would have been a fiat nullification of the Act of Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
