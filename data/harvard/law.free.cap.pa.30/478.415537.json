Bomberger, his executors; to whom letters testamentary were granted by the register of Northampton county, on the 4th March 1847, and they thereupon entered upon the performance of their duties. At the same time that Samuel Wilhelm took upon himself the office of executor, he also assumed the management of the real estate under the power in the will: he executed leases, made improvements and repairs, collected the rents and income, and paid the expenses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-8\">Shortly after the death of the testator, Samuel Wilhelm placed himself in communication with Peter Miller, of Ohio, the testator\u2019s nephew and heir at law, he himself being the next in succession; and on the 18th February 1848, the following agreement for a division of the estate was executed between these parties:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-9\">\u201c Whereas, Peter Miller, deceased, lately died in Easton, Pennsylvania, having made a last will and testament, which has since been proved ; and whereas, it is supposed, that the disposition of the residue of the estate of the said Peter Miller, made by his said last will and testament, is not such as will be sustained in law, in consequence of which the said residue will pass and descend to the heir at law -of the said Peter Miller, deceased; and whereas,, Peter Miller, of Brookfield township, Morgan county, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>Ohio, claiming to be the son of John Miller, the brother of the said Peter Miller, deceased, claims to be such heir at law; and whereas, Samuel Wilhelm, of the borough of Easton, in the county of Northampton, Pennsylvania, devisee of Catharine Wilhelm, deceased, who died since the said Peter Miller, claims to be entitled to the said residue in right of the said Catharine Wilhelm, who claimed to be the first cousin of the said Peter Miller, deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-6\">\u201c And whereas, the said Peter Miller and the said Samuel Wilhelm have agreed that, if the said residuary disposition made by the said will shall be declared invalid, the residuary estate aforesaid shall be equally divided to and between the said Peter Miller and the said Samuel Wilhelm and their respective heirs and assigns, in equal shares.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-7\">\u201cNow, it is hereby agreed, for and in consideration of the premises, and of the doubts existing as to which of the parties to this agreement will be able to make out their title to the same, and to prevent litigation in relation to the same, that in the contingency of the testamentary disposition of the estate of the said Peter Miller, deceased, being decided to be invalid in whole or in part, that all the estate, real, personal, and mixed, which shall not pass under the said will, but which would descend to the heirs and legal representatives of the said Peter Miller, deceased, as his next of kin, shall be equally divided between the said Peter Miller and Samuel Wilhelm and their respective heirs and assigns for ever; and the said parties respectively covenant and agree with each other that they will respectively execute and deliver, each to the other, his heirs and assigns, the necessary conveyances, assurances, assignments, and transfers for the said estate, real, personal, and mixed, so as to vest in each of them and their respective heirs and assigns for ever an equal moiety or half part of the said estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-8\">\u201c And it is further agreed between the parties, that legal proceedings be forthwith instituted in the name of the said Peter Miller, for the speedy determination of the rights of the said parties to the said estate, and that each of them shall contribute an equal proportion of the costs and expenses of conducting said proceedings at law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-9\">\u201c In witness whereof the said parties to these presents have hereunto set their hands and seals, this eighteenth day of February, A.

This case of Hillyard <em>v. </em>Miller is reported in 10 <em>Barr </em>326.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-9\">The title of the heir at law being thus established, on the 1st September 1849, he presented his petition to the Orphans\u2019 Court for a citation to the executors to account. On the 24th October 1849, J. II. A. Bomberger filed his separate account, which was confirmed nisi. And on the 15th November 1849, John Hoff, another of the executors, filed his separate account, which was likewise confirmed nisi.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-10\">On the 28th February 1850, Samuel Wilhelm filed his separate account, in which he charged himself with items amounting to $87,154.37, and claimed credit for disbursements to the extent of $80,086.63, and exhibiting a balance of $7067.74 in his hands. In this account he charged no commissions for his services. Annexed thereto he returned a schedule -of bonds, stocks, notes, &amp;c., considered good for $55,280.41, and lost and doubtful claims amounting to $5880.77. Also a memorandum of two judgment bonds, in the hands of Philip H. Mattes, another of the executors, for $1779.47. This account was confirmed nisi, and on the 26th April 1850, Isaac G. Wikoff, B. F.

Yates, were appointed auditors, to examine and, if occasion, resettle the account, and make distribution of the balance, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-11\">In the course of the examination, it was discovered, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>account contained items of credit relating to the real estate, and other matters, which were to be settled by Wilhelm, not as executor, but as trustee under the will. It was therefore agreed, that he should file an account, as trustee, in the Court of Common Pleas, and that it should be referred to the same auditors, so that both accounts might be examined, resettled, and adjusted, and distribution of the balances thereof made, at the same time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-6\">Accordingly, on the 29th July 1850, Samuel Wilhelm filed his account as trustee under the will, in the Court of Common Pleas, in which he charged himself with the sum of $20,665.98 received, and claimed credit for $21,468.28, paid out and retained; leaving a balance in his favour of $802.30. In this account he' charged commissions at the rate of 2-\u00a3 per cent., amounting to $1026.29. The court referred this account to the same auditors, as agreed upon by the parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-7\">After various meetings and adjournments, and considerable progress having been made in the adjustment of the accounts, the parties executed the following agreement, which was laid before the auditors, and returned and filed with their report:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-8\">\u201c Whereas, Samuel Wilhelm, acting executor, &amp;c., of Peter Miller, late of the borough of Easton, merchant, deceased, has filed and settled his account, as such executor, before the register of the county of Northampton; and has also filed and settled in the Court of Common Pleas of said county his account as trustee and receiver of the rents, issues, and profits of the real estate late of said deceased; and Isaac C. Wikoff, Benjamin E. Arndt, and George W.

This was resisted by Alexander Miller, the administrator of Peter Miller of Ohio, who had died during the pendency of the audit, on the ground, that it had been obtained by fraud, and was otherwise void as against the policy of the law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-7\">Much evidence was taken by the auditors in reference to the manner in which this agreement was obtained by Wilhelm; and the following deeds, &amp;c., were given in evidence by him, which it was contended amounted to a ratification and confirmation of that agreement. 1. A deed, dated the 5th September 1849, whereby Peter Miller of Ohio, and wife, conveyed to Samuel Wilhelm two-fifths of this estate. 2. A letter of attorney, dated the 12th December 1849, from Peter Miller and wife, to John Miller; which did not appear to have any material bearing on the case. 3. A deed of partition, dated the 27th December 1849, between Peter Miller and wife and Samuel Wilhelm. 4. Two deeds, dated the 21st November 1849, between Messrs. Porter and Jones of the one part, and Miller and Wilhelm of the other, in which, among other things, Miller and Wilhelm conveyed to Porter and Jones one-fifth of the estate. 5. A refunding-bond of Peter Miller of Ohio, to Samuel Wilhelm, dated the 12th December 1849, which acknowledged that Peter Miller had received, <em>as his share, </em>two-fifths of 500 shares of Easton Bank stock. 6. A receipt, dated the 25th April 1850, from Alexander Miller, administrator of Peter Miller of Ohio, to Samuel Wilhelm, for two-fifths of the proceeds of a certain tract of land, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-8\">The auditors reported that the agreement of the 18th February 1848 was obtained by fraud, imposition, and undue advantage taken of the heir at law, by Wilhelm; and that it was in plain violation of his duties as trustee under the will of the testator. They, therefore, distributed the balances in both accounts, four-fifths to Alexander Miller, administrator of Peter Miller of Ohio, .and the remaining one-fifth to be divided between Messrs. Porter and Jones.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-9\">The court below, being of opinion that the agreement of the 18th November 1850 had made the reports of the auditors in reference to the adjustment of the accounts, conclusive between the parties, confirmed the same so far as it resettled the accounts of Wilhelm, as executor and trustee; but set aside so much of the same as rejected his claim-'to share in the distribution. And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>decreed two-fifths of the balance to Alexander Miller, administrator of Peter Miller of Ohio, two-fifths to Samuel Wilhelm, and the remainder to Messrs. Porter and Jones.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-5\">From these decrees both parties appealed to this court. Alexander Miller, from so much of the decrees as admitted Wilhelm to share in the distribution; and Wilhelm, from so much of them as confirmed the report of the auditors resettling his accounts.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b485-6\">Reeder, for Alexander Miller, appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2j\">\u2014 W\u00e9 resist the decree which adjudges a share of the balance in hand to Wilhelm, under the agreement of the 18th February 1848, on the following grounds:\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-7\">1. That there was mistake of law and fact, in the very matters mentioned in the agreement, as the only inducements to make it, to wit, that there were doubts as to Peter Miller being the heir at law and able to prove it; and that, if Miller failed in his suit, Wilhelm could sue and recover, and share the proceeds with Miller. If either of the parties believed either of these allegations, as stated in the agreement, they were at least mistaken in law and fact.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-8\">2. Concealment and misrepresentation, by Wilhelm, in the material inducements of the contract, accompanied with other evidence of fraud in fact, and undue advantage taken of Peter Miller, such as threats of litigation for life unless he would give Wilhelm a share of the estate, secreting him from his son, intoxication, and taking advantage of his necessities by giving him $100 apparently as a donation, which he subsequently converted into a charge on account of his share; all of which were aggravated in their unfairness in view of Peter Miller\u2019s age and poverty: <em>Story\u2019s Eq., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 251, 222, 239, 204-7; 1 <em>Ev.

That the contract was illegal and contrary to the policy of. the law, as tending to produce unfaithfulness in a trustee, and actually creating in him a private interest hostile to the trust; and resulting in the scandalous spectacle of an executor publicly appearing as defendant and paying for the defence from the funds of the estate, whilst he was under written obligation to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number><em>\u201c </em>an equal proportion of the costs and expenses\u201d on the part of the plaintiff, and to share in the fruits of the recovery: <em>Story\u2019s Eq., </em>\u00a7 295; 2 <em>Kent\u2019s Com. </em>466; Bowers <em>v. </em>Bowers, 2 <em>Casey </em>74; Wiley\u2019s Appeal, 8 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>244; <em>Chit. on Contr. </em>673.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b486-6\">5.

But there is no question made as to the will itself. The question arises upon the validity of the trusts, and whether they were such as the law will allow to be executed; and this authority could be pursued with perfect propriety by either the heir at law, the executor, or trustee, or whoever had charge of the funds, and was interested in the execution of the trust: <em>Adam\u2019s Eq. </em>59; Wood <em>v. </em>Vandenburg, 6 <em>Paige </em>277; Attorney-General <em>v. </em>Vivian, 1 <em>Russ. </em>226; Re Masters of Bedford Charity, 2 <em>Swanst. </em>525; Attorney-General <em>v. </em>Oglander, 1 <em>Ves. </em>246.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b487-10\">Samuel Wilhelm had only a naked custody of the residue of the estate; the two congregations were to hold the property and administer the fund: Wheatly <em>v. </em>Badger, 7 <em>Barr </em>459; Brown\u2019s Appeal, 2 <em>Jones </em>333; Ross <em>v. </em>Barclay, 6 <em>Harris </em>179.

We deny, also, that a trustee is prohibited from buying from <em>cestui que trust. </em>Such purchases are not void, either in law or in equity. They will be scrutinized more closely than if they were between strangers; but they may be effected, and will be good, if not assailed successfully on the ground of undue advantage: <em>Hill on Trustees </em>537-539 ; Fisk <em>v. </em>Sarber, 6 <em>W. </em>&amp; <em>S. </em>21.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b487-14\">But it is said, we are asking for a decree.

The opinion of the court, however, renders unnecessary a reference to them in this report.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b488-8\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b488-9\">Woodward, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AMS\">\u2014 When Samuel Wilhelm settled his accounts, one of them in the Orphans\u2019 Court, as one of the executors of the last will of Peter Miller, and the other in the Common Pleas, as trustee under the same will, it was according to the usual course to refer them to auditors, to examine, and, if necessary, to resettle them and make distribution. And as both accounts arose out of the same estate, under the same will, and differed no otherwise than as one related to the personal estate of the testator, and the other to the proceeds of his realty, it was convenient to refer both to the same auditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">As originally constituted, then, it was simply an ordinary audit. What the auditors would do, was to be reported to the respective courts, to be reviewed,set aside, modified, or confirmed; and the effective and binding character of the proceeding would depend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>on the final decree of the court, rather than on the action of the auditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The auditors first assembled on the 24th June 1850, and after various meetings and adjournments without making much progress in their work, they met on the 28th July 1851, when the agreement of 18th November 1850, signed by the appellant and appellee, and by Messrs. Porter and Jones, was laid before them, and under which, thereafter, they acted.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">As various questions, more or less important, arise out of this paper, it is proper to consider its meaning and effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">It begins by reciting the filing of Wilhelm\u2019s accounts and the reference of them to this board of auditors for examination, resettlement, and distribution, and then the parties go on to agree\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">1. That the auditors shall proceed to resettle the account, and make distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">2. That the accountant shall be charged with certain bonds and mortgages therein specified, and that Alexander Miller shall be permitted to select from the securities brought into distribution, to the amount of two-thirds of the distributive share that shall be coming to the estate of his deceased father.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">8. That distribution should be made \u201c after deducting the payments made to all or either of the parties hereto, by the said Samuel, on account of their distributive shares respectively.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">4. That all receipts and payments by the said Samuel since his accounts were filed, should be brought into the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-12\">5. That the report of resettlement and distribution to be made by said auditors, when filed in the Orphans\u2019 Court and Court of Common Pleas of Northampton county, should be final and conclusive upon them, and each and all of them, and that no exception or appeal should be taken thereto by any or either of the parties interested, but the same should be held firm and stable for ever.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-13\">6. And, finally, that the said Samuel should, on the report of. the auditors, forthwith, and without objection or delay, satisfy and settle, pay and discharge to the parties hereto respectively, the balance of his or their distributive shares, according to the report to be made by the auditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-14\">Under their appointment by the court, and this agreement of the parties, the auditors resettled Wilhelm\u2019s accounts, making many essential changes in them, and excluded him altogether from any share as a distributee of the estate. On exceptions filed to their report, the court confirmed their resettlement, on the ground that it was final and conclusive between the parties, by virtue of the aforesaid agreement, but they reversed so much of the report as excluded Wilhelm from the distribution; and from this decree Miller appeals to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-15\">It is insisted upon with great earnestness, that these parties were incompetent to take away, by their agreement, the supervisory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>power of the court, and to make the report of the auditors conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Unquestionably, the parties to the agreement could not abridge the powers of the court, nor bind creditors or others in interest; but why could they not bind themselves to waive their right of exception to the report, and to abide by and perform the awards of the auditors ?</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">If they were the only parties interested in Peter Miller\u2019s estate, and there is no evidence of the interest of others, they were as competent to agree upon this mode of settlement and distribution, as heirs and devisees are, to agree on partition, or on men to make partition, or as parties litigant are, to submit their disputes to arbitrators mutually chosen. And such agreements are not in derogation of the jurisdiction and authority of the courts. On the contrary, the courts encourage parties to settle their differences in their own way, only so they do not confuse the judicial records.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">Accordingly, we enforce the agreements of parties when they provide such domestic tribunals for themselves, or even enlarge the jurisdiction of arbitrators constituted under our compulsory arbitration laws: 7 <em>Harris </em>418.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">Nor is there anything in the nature of the office of auditors to make them an exception to the general rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">Auditors are called in by the court, to hear.matters of detail which the court has not time to hear, and to inform the conscience of the court as to facts which are essential to be known, before a particular decree or judgment can be pronounced. Distribution of a decedent\u2019s estate is a judicial duty, and yet, under our Acts of Assembly, it may be performed by the -executor at his own risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-11\">He has a right, however, to bring the assets into court for distribution, and then, instead of going into a minute settlement of his accounts, and into all those questions which may affect the distribution, the court refers the whole matter to auditors, in strict analogy to the references of a chancellor to a master. An appeal lies from the report of the auditors; but this is a mere personal right, not a legal necessity in the proceedings, and therefore it may be waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-12\">Mr. Wilhelm was free to make settlement and distribution in this manner. He was competent to bind himself, and he is bound. The consideration for his agreement was in the agreement of the others in interest. The agreement did not unsex the auditors. They were auditors still, the courts\u2019 auditors, bound to report to the courts, and the records of the courts were to be the depository and memorial of the auditors\u2019 labours. Nor did it take away the courts\u2019 right to revise the report, it only destroyed the parties\u2019 right to except to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-13\">But how far ? That the agreement made the <em>settlement </em>final cannot be doubted. If it is to have any operation, it must operate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>to this extent at least. And I think it equally clear, that the terms and manner of distribution, as between these distributees, were to be finally adjusted by the auditors; but it is not so clear that they were to inquire and determine finally who the distributees were. True, distribution could not be made without ascertaining the distributees, and there are expressions in those parts of the agreement, which I have numbered 3 and 6, where the parties speak of payments to be made by the said Samuel, that would seem to imply that he was before the auditors only as accounting executor and trustee, and that it was among the others distribution was to be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Notwithstanding this, however, we are to remember that Wilhelm claimed to be equally interested with Peter Miller by virtue of the agreement of 18th February 1848, and that Porter and Jones came in for twenty per cent, of the estate by virtue of their agreement of the same date with Miller and Wilhelm. Peter Miller was the heir at law of his uncle, and if the large devises in trust contained in his uncle\u2019s will could be set aside, he would succeed to the bulk of the estate. He first agreed to divide his contingent interest with Wilhelm, and then they jointly agreed to compensate the professional services of the other two gentlemen, by giving them, in the event of success, one-fifth of the estate\u2014 leaving two-fifths of it for each of themselves. This was the posture of affairs when the agreement of 18th November 1850 was executed. As between themselves, each was considered entitled to a share, and they, no doubt, executed the agreement of November 1850 with that understanding. The distribution spoken of in the agreement was to be made among them. Of course it was <em>that </em>distribution only \u2014 a distribution in which each of themselves was to participate \u2014 that they agreed to be bound by.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">I think we should give this agreement more effect than it was intended it should have, if we should hold it to conclude Wilhelm\u2019s rights as a distributee. His title, as such, was properly passed on by the auditors, but not conclusively, because the law would assign no such effect to their action, and the agreement of the parties did not reach so far.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">The question that arose then, upon his exceptions to the report, was, whether the auditors decided rightly, in excluding him from the distribution. The court below thought they did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">Wilhelm\u2019s right to share in the distribution originated, as already stated, in the above-named agreement with Peter Miller, of 18th February 1848. He claimed that it had been ratified and confirmed by various writings subsequently, particularly by the letters of Peter Miller to him of 1848 and 1849 \u2014 by the deed of 5th September 1849 \u2014 by the letter of attorney, of December 1849, '\u2022\u00bfid the deeds of partition made thereunder, and by the receipt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>of Alexander Miller, administrator of Peter Miller, of 15th April 1850, for his father\u2019s share of the Petersville mill property.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">All these papers, and many more, were in evidence, and the parties were very patiently and fully heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">The auditors put their decision on two principal grounds\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">1st. That the agreement of 18th February 1848 was obtained through actual fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">And 2d. That as Wilhelm was acting as executor and trustee under the will, it was against the policy of the law to permit him to acquire an interest adverse to, and inconsistent with the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">The first of these grounds involved a question of fact, on which the report is, according to law, and independently of all agreements of the parties, final and conclusive, unless there was flagrant mistake: 7 <em>Harris </em>222.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">After the full hearing which the parties had on this question, at the very spot where the agreement was made, and all the evidence bearing on it was at hand, we would scarcely reverse the finding of a tribunal of their own choosing, or justify the court below in doing so, except upon the most manifest evidence of flagrant mistake. So far from having such evidence, we have, in the report of the' auditors, proofs strongly persuasive of the alleged fraud, and we cannot say that the auditors misjudged these proofs.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-12\">It followed then, as a necessary sequence, from the finding of actual fraud in the concoction of the agreement of 18th February 1848, that all the subsequent agreements, conveyances, and receipts, referring to it, and bottomed on the same consideration, could not amount to confirmation. The doctrine that, where there has been actual and positive fraud, there can be no such thing as a confirmation \u2014 that what was once a fraud will always be so\u2014 that a contract infected with this kind of fraud is not merely voidable but void \u2014 and that confirmation without a new consideration is mere <em>nudum pactum </em>\u2014 was very distinctly asserted in Duncan <em>v. </em>McCulloch, 4 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>487.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-13\">And see Butler <em>v. </em>Haskell, 4 <em>Dessaussure's R. </em>707 (South Carolina), for a very learned and comprehensive discussion of this subject and the authorities relating to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-14\">These confirmatory acts and documents might avail to validate a contract merely voidable, and there is a class of cases, where the parties to a fraudulent or even an illegal contract have fully executed it themselves, in which courts of justice will not interfere to unravel their doings, but, considering them in <em>pari delicto, </em>will leave them bound as they find them: 5 <em>Barr </em>81; 12 <em>Harris </em>62; 1 <em>Jones </em>212; 3 <em>Casey </em>90. A contract, however, which remains to be executed, which stands in need, of the decree of a court of justice to enable the parties to reap its fruits, and which is successfully impeached as covinous and fraudulent in fact, is easily distinguished from all such cases, and rests on a foundation of sand.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>It was said, in the argument, that Wilhelm was asking for no decree, but the position cannot be maintained. The auditors cut him off, and without a decree of the court below in his favour he had no lot or part in the distribution. He sought and obtained the decree of the court below, and that is the very thing under consideration here. The question on this appeal is, whether the decree that Wilhelm obtained, restoring him to the place he claimed in the distribution, shall be confirmed or reversed, so that, although Miller took the appeal, it is Wilhelm\u2019s title and nothing else that is in controversy. True, it relates only to the personalty, and the rents, issues, and profits of the realty of the decedent, but Wilhelm\u2019s right to share in these depends on no executed act of the parties, but on the decree to be pronounced by this court. He is subject, therefore, to the rule of law that forbids the court to carry into effect a fraudulent contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">But if this ease were not to be put on the ground of actual fraud in the procurement of the contract under which Wilhelm claims \u2014 if we should even go so far as to reverse the verdict of the auditors on this mere matter of fact \u2014 the other ground of decision assumed by the auditors, that the policy of the law forbids an executor and trustee to deal with the estate intrusted to his charge in the manner exhibited in this case, would remain, and would be fatal to the pretensions of Wilhelm.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">He was not compelled to assume the offices of executor and trustee; but, having assumed and retained them, he was bound, by the best defined principles of law and equity, to execute them with an eye single to the will of the testator and the interest of those for whom the testator provided. That a trustee is not at liberty to act or contract for himself, or for his own benefit, in regard to the subject of the trust; that the advantage of all' he does about the trust property shall accrue to the <em>cestui que trust, </em>if the latter desire' it; [that an interest hostile to the <em>cestui que trust </em>is repugnant to the relation which the trustee has assumed; \u00a1that the <em>cestui que trust </em>has a claim to his entire services about the subject which has been confided to him, including all the knowledge, influence, and power which the trustee obtains from his situation; in a word, that a man who is intrusted to manage for others, undertakes, when he becomes a trustee, not to manage for himself ; these rudimental principles of equity have been discussed, illustrated, and applied in so many cases, that, instead of citing them, I refer to the cases of Keech <em>v. </em>Sanford and Pitt <em>v. </em>Mackreth, and the notes thereto, in 1 <em>Leading Oases in Equity, </em>by <em>White \u00a7 Tudor, </em>Am. Ed. by <em>Hare cf Wallace, </em>pp. 70 and 148, where the cases, both English and American, will be found collected and arranged.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">Nor can executors or administrators be permitted, under any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>circumstances, to derive a personal benefit from the manner in which they transact the business or manage the assets of the estate. See the notes above referred to, and <em>Story\u2019s </em>Equity, \u00a7 822-323.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The very title of executor implies that he is to do his utmost to carry out the purposes of the will. \u201c He is termed <em>executor testamentarias,\u201d </em>says <em>Swinhurn, </em>part vi. p. 362, \u201cbecause he hath his authority immediately from the testator, representing the person of the dead man. And he doth not much differ from him, in nature, whose name in the civil law is <em>Hceres, </em>saving that <em>Hceres </em>by the civil law is to have the residue of the testator\u2019s goods, and may convert the same to his own use, albeit the testator do not expressly will that he should have the same; whereas an executor <em>may not convert the residue to his own private use, nor any part of the testator\u2019s goods, more than that which is left unto him by the testator, </em>or which the ordinary shall allow him for his travel and charges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">This is a somewhat antiquated but still very accurate description of the duties of one of the offices assumed by Wilhelm.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">\u201c The ground on which these disabilities and disqualifications rest, is no other than that principle which dictates that a person cannot be both judge and party. No man can serve two masters. He that is intrusted with the interest of others cannot be allowed to make the business an object of interest to himself, because, from the frailty of nature, one who has the power will be too readily seized with the inclination to use it for serving his own interest at the expense of those for whom he is intrusted. The danger of temptation does, out of the more necessity of the case, work the disqualification. The wise policy of the law puts the sting of disability into the temptation, as a defensive weapon against the strength of the danger that lies in the situation1 <em>Leading Oases in Equity </em>161.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">A trustee, it is said, may bargain with his <em>cestui que trust. </em>So he may, if it be, in all respects, a fair and conscionable contract, and especially if it stipulate that he shall no longer act as trustee. But even then, said Lord Eldon] in Ex parte Lacey, <em>6 Vesey </em>629, the transaction by which the trustee is dismissed \u201c must be watched with infinite and most guarded jealousy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">But this principle has no application to this case, for/here there \u201cWras no dismissal of the trustee, and no attempt on his part to withdraw from the trust. Nor did he bargain with the <em>cestuis que trust, </em>who were the devisees in the will, but with the heir at law, who was their antagonist. He bargained <em>against </em>his <em>cestuis que trust, </em>instead of treating with them. If a treaty with them for his own advantage would have been regarded with jealousy, how much more the traffic in which he engaged to their prejudice, whilst he continued their professed representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>The report of the auditors exhibits a melancholy picture of disloyalty on the part of Wilhelm to the trust he was appointed to guard.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">From a very early day after the death of the testator, we find him plotting to overthrow the main provisions of the will, and placing himself in combination with the heir at law to divert the bulk of the estate from its appointed destination, and to appropriate it to the private use of themselves and their counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">The heir at law had a perfect right to question the will. The counsel had a right to serve him. And Wilhelm, if he wanted to take part with them, might have done so by retiring from the trust, and leaving the defence of the estate to his colleagues in the administration, or to successors whom the court would have appointed. But to continue in the trust, apparently that he might the better betray it, was to deprive himself of all chance of reward. If he had obtained the share of the estate he grasped at, perhaps the law would not interpose to restore it to a party who was with him in the unlawful league. That question will arise fairly upon the deed made for the real estate; but, in respect to the personalty, which is all that is now in contest, Wilhelm has no title to more than the will gave him, and can have none, for we will not enforce the contract under which he claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">And now, to wit, 15th July 1858, these causes having been argued by counsel, and considered by the court, it is adjudged and decreed, that the decree, in each case, be reversed and set .aside, so far as the same admits Samuel Wilhelm to a distributive share of the personal estate of Peter Miller, deceased, but affirmed as to all else therein contained; and that the costs be paid by the parties in equal parts; and that the record be remanded that distribution may proceed according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">In Wilhelm\u2019s Appeals, the opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">Woodward, J. \u2014 The opinion expressed in Miller\u2019s Appeals, herewith decided, on the effect of the agreement made by the appellant and others to abide by the report of the auditors, concludes the appellant\u2019s right to except or appeal, and the decrees of the court dismissing his exceptions are accordingly affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
