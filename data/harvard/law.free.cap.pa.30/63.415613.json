Gault against John Delaney, for a lot of ground on the west side of Tyler street, north of Poplar street, in the city of Philadelphia, containing 16 feet in front, on Tyler street, by 37 feet in depth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-22\">The plaintiff below claimed as purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale under a <em>levari faeias. </em>He gave in evidence a record of the Court of Common Pleas, showing a claim for $14.20 for paving, filed 3d January 1849, by the district of Spring Garden, against Edward and William Beeves, describing a lot containing 32 feet in front, and running from Tyler street to Hutchinson street, a depth of 82 feet; which included the lot in controversy, and three other lots owned by different persons, of which four lots, two fronted on each of said streets; a <em>seire faeias </em>thereon issued December 6th, 1853, and a return thereto as follows, \u201c Made known by posting a true and attested copy of the within writ upon the premises within described, December 30th, 1853, and by advertising twice a week for two weeks, in the North American, a daily paper published in the city of Philadelphia, agreeably to the Act of Assembly.\u201d This was the only evidence on the record of notice to any body.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-23\">The 30th day of December, mentioned in this return, was the Friday before the return day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-24\">This record further showed a judgment for want of an affidavit of defence, a <em>levari faeias </em>thereon issued December 6 th, 1854, and a return of a sale to the plaintiff for $50. The sheriff\u2019s deed to him, and the summons in ejectment, were also given in evidence. '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>The defendant below deduced his title regularly under one Robert Pollard, who owned the premises when the claim was filed; and proved that Edward and William Reeves owned no part of said premises at that or any other time, but were then the owners of adjoining premises. He also showed by a receipt that the claim had been actually paid to Joseph Allison, Esq., then solicitor of the said district, on the 30th of May 1850, by one Robert Walker, an owner of the adjoining premises under the Messrs. Reeves, who supposed the claim to be against his lot.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-6\">To rebut this evidence, the plaintiff below had a receipt as follows, viz.:\u2014 \u2018</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-7\">\u201cReceived, November 1, 1856, of Joseph Allison, the above sum of fifty-two dollars, the amount originally paid having been paid in mistake as upon the wrong property, and is hereby returned. Robert Walker.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-8\">At the time this receipt was given, Mr. Allison was no longer solicitor of the district, and this money was refunded to Mr. Walker out of his own pocket.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-9\">The defendant below objected to the admission in evidence of the record of the Common Pleas, and argued that it was a nullity. 1. Because the claim was in fact paid before the <em>scire facias </em>issued thereon. 2. Because the claim was not filed against the owner or reputed owner. 3. Because the record did not show affirmatively a compliance with the statutes regulating paving in said district. 4. Because the record showed that notice of the claim and <em>scire facias </em>had not been given in conformity with the Acts of Assembly. But the court below overruled the objection, and admitted the record in evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-10\">The defendant also contended that, if the judgment were not a nullity, the execution under it could only convey the title of the Messrs. Reeves; or that, at least, Delaney, the defendant, must be permitted to make, in this ejectment, the same defences he might have made to the <em>scire facias </em>on the claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-11\">The learned judge, however, diregarded these points, and instructed the jury to find for the plaintiff, which they did. Judgment having been entered on the verdict, the defendant below sued out this writ of error, and assigned for error the admission in evidence of the record of the Oomman Pleas; and also the charge of the court below to the jury.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b64-12\"><em>E.

The fact that the payment was made by a stranger makes no difference; it enures to the benefit of the true owner: Orr <em>v. </em>Cunningham, 4 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>294; Laird <em>v. </em>Hiester, 12 <em>Harris </em>464.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b65-7\">If the lien was a nullity, no proceeding upon it could make it good: Caldwell <em>v. </em>Walters, 6 <em>Harris </em>83; Steel <em>v. </em>Smith, 7 W. <em>&amp; S. </em>447; Campbell <em>v. </em>Steele, 1 <em>Jones </em>396; Donley <em>v. </em>Brownlee, 7 <em>Barr </em>110. The-proceeding was a nullity, because there was no jurisdiction of the <em>parties, </em>which could only be obtained by proper service or notice. Notice of the issuing of the <em>seire facias </em>was not given in the mode prescribed by the acts of 1840, 1846, 1849, and 1851. The act of 1846 could only repeal that of 1840 by express words, or by an enactment clearly inconsistent or repugnant: Street <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, <em>6 W. &amp; S. </em>212; Bank <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 10 <em>Barr </em>448.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b65-8\">It will be argued that every intendment is to be made in favour of the regularity of the proceedings of a superior court, and that the Common Pleas is a superior court in this sense. This doctrine is a sound one, and admits of no doubt, but where a superior court is conducting a peculiar statutory proceeding it is a special tribunal, and no intendment is made in its favour: Messenger <em>v. </em>Kintner, 4 <em>Binn. </em>103; Ragan\u2019s Estate, 7 <em>Watts </em>438; McKee <em>v. </em>McKee, 2 <em>Harris </em>231; Ege <em>v. </em>Sidle, 3 <em>Barr </em>123; Steel <em>v. </em>Smith, 7 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>447; Campbell <em>v. </em>Steele, 1 <em>Jones </em>396; Denning <em>v. </em>Corwin, 11 <em>Wend. </em>647; Foot <em>v. </em>Stevens, 17 <em>Wend. </em>488; Bloom <em>v. </em>Burdick, 1 <em>Hill </em>140; Wright <em>v. </em>Douglass, 3 <em>Barb. </em>575; Boswell\u2019s Lessee <em>v. </em>Otis, 9 <em>How. </em>250; Boswell <em>v. </em>Dickerson, 4 <em>McLean </em>262; Hollingsworth <em>v. </em>Barbour, 4 <em>Pet. </em>475; Rex <em>v. </em>Cooke, <em>Cowp. </em>29; Porter <em>v. </em>Whitney, 1 <em>(Greenl. 306.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b65-9\">But, if not a nullity, the judgment does not conclusively bind the defendant, who was not a party to it. He ought to be at liberty to make the same defence to an ejectment that he might have made to the original <em>scire facias: </em>Mevey\u2019s Appeal, 4 <em>Barr </em>80; Anshutz <em>v. </em>McClelland, 5 <em>Watts </em>487.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b65-10\"><em>Marhland, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7T\">\u2014 The proceedings under which the premises were sold are <em>in rem '; </em>and the description in the claim and sheriff\u2019s deed sufficiently identifying the premises, it is a matter of no consequence who were the actual or even reputed owners. In regard to the alleged payment of the claim, the judgment is conclusive as to that, at least in favour of a purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale: Acts 3d February 1824; 18th April <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>1840; 19th April 1843; 11th March 1846; <em>Brightly\u2019s Purd. </em>601, 604, 605; Northern Liberties <em>v. </em>Coates\u2019s Heirs, 3 <em>Harris </em>245; Salter <em>v. </em>Reed, <em>Id. </em>264; Claypole <em>v. </em>Dorsey, 2 <em>Wh.

D. 1849. The plaintiff in error, defendant below, deduces his title regularly from Robert Pollard, by conveyance subsequent to the date above mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">The title of the plaintiff below is founded upon a municipal claim for paving in front of the property, filed by the district of Spring Garden, in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia, on the third of January, A. D. <em>1849. </em>The claim was filed against \u201cEdward and William Reeves, owners or reputed owners.\u201d In fact, however, the Messrs. Reeves were not the owners of the lot against which the claim was filed; but owned a neighbouring property of which one Joseph Walker was in possession. Walker, supposing the lien to be upon the lot which he occupied, paid its amount on the 30th of May 1850, to the solicitor of the district, authorized to receive it; and thus the claim of the municipality was discharged, though not cancelled of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">To January Term, 1854, a <em>seire faeias </em>was sued out upon this claim, notwithstanding its previous payment. The writ was issued against Edward and William Reeves, and was served, according to the return of the sheriff, by posting a true and attested copy thereof upon the premises three days before the return day, and by advertising twice a week for two weeks in a daily paper published in the city of Philadelphia, agreeably to the Act of Assembly. No personal service was made either upon the Messrs. Reeves, or upon the true owner of the property. On the 28th of .January 1854, judgment was entered for default of an affidavit \u2022of defence, and under a <em>levari faeias </em>issued thereon, the lot was sold to the plaintiff below, who received the sheriff\u2019s deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">It is objected that this proceeding has vested no title in Gault, the purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale; because the claim as originally filed was not against Robert Pollard, the true owner. The objection loses sight of the great design of the legislature in the whole series of Acts of Assembly relative to the collection of taxes and municipal claims in the city of Philadelphia. That design was to enforce payment. This was sought to be accomplished first by making the land debtor for the tax, or for the claim for the public improvement which was supposed to have enhanced its value. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>Thus by the Act of February 3d, 1824, <em>P. L. </em>18, all taxes, rates, and levies, were declared to be liens upon the real estate on which they are imposed or assessed. The Act of 16th April 1840, P. <em>L. </em>412-13, \u00a7 9, provided a more efficient mode in which the lien of municipal claims might be enforced. It gave authority to file of record in the office of the prothonotary of the Court of Common Pleas, or of the District Court, all claims and demands for pitching and paving streets, &amp;c., and for taxes, rates, and levies. The tenth section required that the claim filed should \u201c set forth the name of the owner, or reputed owner, of the premises against which it is filed,\u201d with a description of the real estate, and its situation. This section also authorized the enforcement of the claim by a writ of <em>scire facias, </em>as in cases of mechanics\u2019 liens. The Act of March 11th, 1846, P. <em>L. </em>114, gives additional facilities for the collection of the claim; and, in section four, enacts that on the trial of the <em>scire facias </em>no plea touching the question of ownership shall be allowed. It is obvious from these acts of Assembly, not only that the land is made debtor for the tax, or municipal assessment; but that the proceeding to collect, is a proceeding entirely <em>in rem. </em>The claim is not required to be filed against the time owner. It may be filed against the reputed owner; and this because the mention of the owner at all is required only as descriptive of the lands which are debtor to the tax or assessment. The requisition that the claim shall state the name of the owner, or reputed owner, is the same as that made by the Act of 1836, relative to the claims of mechanics and material men, under which it has been held that it is not necessary to set forth the name of the real owner: 4 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>257. The same principle has been declared applicable to municipal claims, in Northern Liberties <em>v. </em>Coates, 3 <em>Harris </em>245; and in Claypole <em>v. </em>Dorsey, a case decided in this court in 1849, but not reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">It is next objected that the claim filed did not show upon its face, that it was for paving done under the provisions of the acts authorizing a lien. This was entirely unnecessary. The act which provided for its being filed, while it stated the requisites of such a claim, did not include among them a reference to itself. It has never been supposed necessary that a judgment entered without writ, upon a bond with warrant of attorney to confess judgment, was invalid, unless it referred to the Act of Assembly authorizing such entries, or that a mechanic\u2019s claim should aver that the work done was performed under the provisions of the mechanics\u2019 lien laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">It is further contended that the return of service of the writ of <em>scire facias, </em>is insufficient, inasmuch as it shows that the service was irregular, and it is supposed that advantage may be taken of this in a collateral proceeding, after judgment upon the <em>scire </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number><em>facias. </em>The Court of Common Pleas, however, is a superior court. Though the proceedings to enforce payment of municipal claims be of statutory creation, yet when the jurisdiction of the Common Pleas has once attached, every intendment is in favour of its having been rightfully exercised. After judgment upon the <em>scire facias </em>it is too late to inquire in <em>my </em>collateral proceeding, into the sufficiency of the sheriff\u2019s return of service of the writ, or whether service has been properly made, if it be returned. This was ruled by the late Judge Coulter, at <em>Nisi </em>Prius, in 1849, in the case of Wharton <em>v. </em>Hughes. A purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale under a judgment obtained in a <em>scire facias </em>on a municipal claim, is not bound to show that the Acts of Assembly have been strictly complied with. In regard to all that, he is protected by the judgment. There is no similarity between his case, and that of a purchaser at a commissioners\u2019 sale of unseated lands for taxes, prior to the Act of 1815. He .buys -under the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, a judgment .which includes within itself an adjudication that all formal prerequisites have been .complied with.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">There is however an objection which is fatal to the title of the plaintiff below. As already remarked, the sole design of the numerous Acts of Assembly relative' to the collection of taxes and -municipal \u00a1claims in the city of Philadelphia, is to enforce payment. When that has.been made, all that the legislature intended \u25a0has been accomplished. The judgment upon the <em>scire facias </em>is a decree that the land be sold for the payment of the unpaid tax, or claim, precisely as a judgment rendered in a <em>scire facias </em>upon a mortgage, or a mechanic\u2019s claim is a decree that the property <em>be </em>sold to satisfy the debt due the mortgagee, or the mechanic and material man. In each case the judgment is <em>in rem, </em>not in <em>personam. </em>In each case a sheriff\u2019s sale passes to the purchaser a title, notwithstanding irregularities antecedent <em>to the judgment, </em>unless the real owner has some defence to the payment of the debt which he has had no day in court to assert. But if the owner have such defence and. was not a party to the writ of <em>scire facias, </em>he is not precluded from making it. Thus in Nace <em>v. </em>Hollenback, 1 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>540, which was an action of ejectment brought <em>by </em>a purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale under a judgment in a <em>scire facias </em>on a mortgage, Tilghman, C. J., declared, that if the .ierre tenant had not been a party to the writ, he might have made any defence which would have been open to him.on the <em>scire facias. </em>The same doctrine .has been asserted in very numerous cases since decided, down to the case of Walt <em>v. </em>Swinehart, 8 <em>Barr </em>97, and I am not aware that it has. ever been seriously questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">A similar doctrine prevails in regard to mechanics\u2019 liens.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">In Anshutz <em>v. </em>McClelland, 5 <em>Watts </em>487, Judge Kennedy re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>marks as follows : <em>\u201c </em>It may be that when the owner of the house is not made a party to the <em>scire facias, </em>he may not thereafter be precluded from setting up any defence in an action of ejectment brought against him by the purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale, which he might have made in the <em>scire facias </em>had he been warned by it.\u201d In Christine <em>v. </em>Manderson, 2 <em>Barr </em>363, it was held that the owner has the same defence in an ejectment which he might have taken had he been party to the <em>scire facias </em>on a mechanics\u2019 lien. It must be held to be equally true in case of a procedure upon a municipal claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">It follows that the court erred in instructing the jury that the plaintiff below was entitled to recover, notwithstanding the owner was not a party to the <em>scire facias, </em>and notwithstanding the municipal claim had been paid before the writ issued. That it was paid by another instead of Robert Pollard, the owner, that it was paid in mistake by Walker, and that the amount thereof was refunded to Walker by Mr. Allison after the sale to the plaintiff below, can make no difference. The district of Spring Garden had received the money before the <em>scire facias </em>was issued in satisfaction of the debt due from the lot, and had a right to retain it. The purpose of the Acts of Assembly was therefore accomplished. It is immaterial by whom the payment was made. It enured to the benefit of the owner: Orr <em>v. </em>Cunningham, <em>4 W. &amp; S. </em>294; Laird <em>v. </em>Hiester, 12 <em>Harris </em>453.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
