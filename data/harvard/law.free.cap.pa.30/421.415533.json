The indictment in this case is without a precedent, either in English or American jurisprudence, and is defective both in form and in substance; as it sets forth no offence punishable by indictment, either at common law, or under any statute in force in Pennsylvania. The injury described, if any, being a simple trespass, and only to be redressed by civil remedies.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-10\">2. The indictment is fatally defective in not distinctly averring who were the owners and proprietors of the building alleged to have been closed up, &amp;c., by the defendants. Whether used for public or private purposes, the ownership resided somewhere, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>should have been stated. For aught that appears by the indictment, the defendants themselves were the sole and exclusive owners of the house, and no other individuals, nor the public, had any right to use the house for religious meetings, or any other purpose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-6\">The court below overruled the motion in arrest of judgment, and sentenced the defendants, Davis and Stevens, to pay a fine of $5 each, and the costs of prosecution. They thereupon obtained this writ of error, and here assigned for error: 1. That the indictment was defective. 2. That the court below erred in overruling their motion in arrest of judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b423-7\"><em>Little </em>and <em>Post, </em>for the plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8cN\">\u2014 This indictment is deficient in certainty: 2 <em>Hale P.

To constitute the offence of malicious mischief, there must be an owner, and his name should be set forth: <em>Whart. Prec. </em>10, 212, 213; <em>Arch. C. Pl. </em>32-3; Reg. <em>v. </em>Stroud, <em>C. &amp; K. </em>187. A motion in arrest of judgment is never too late, before final sentence: 1 <em>Chit. C.

The gist of the offence is, not that the proprietors were injured in their property, but that it was a public evil example, and against good morals. There is a great variety of such cases: Respublica <em>v. </em>Teischer, 1 <em>Dall. </em>335.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b423-9\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b423-10\">Woodward, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AI6\">\u2014 It would be impossible to construct a common law definition of malicious mischief which would include such dismantling of a building as is laid in this indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">Generally, malicious mischief is an injury to the rights of property, and the ownership of the property injured must be laid in the indictment. The precedents, both English and American, are so, and precedents are evidence of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>But cruelty to animals is in itself of evil example and a public offence. It is not only an assault on life, which, though that of a dumb beast, is nevertheless not beneath the protection of law, but it is also plainly indicative of a heart regardless of social duty, and fatally bent on mischief, and may therefore be punished by indictment, without regard to the ownership: Respublica <em>v. </em>Teischer, 1 <em>Dall. </em>335.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Inanimate property, however, can be injured only in the title, and hence, when this is the subject of indictment for malicious mischief, the right of possession or of property must be laid in somebody. This indictment does not so lay the property, nor 'even negative the ownership of the defendants. For aught that is charged, the defendants themselves may have been the proprietors and owners of the building, and if they were, it will scarcely be pretended that the removal of the stove and windows subjected them to the pains and penalties of malicious mischief. The allegation that the building had been used as a school-house and a place of public worship is not inconsistent with the defendants\u2019 ownership, nor with their right to unfit it for further uses of that sort. If they improperly disturbed religious meetings, they were punishable under our Act of 16th March 1847. If they tumultuously dismantled even their own house to the breach of the public peace, they might have been indicted for a riot. But if they merely exercised the dominion of proprietorship over their own property, the laying it to have been done \u201c with force and arms, unlawfully, wilfully, wantonly, and maliciously,\u201d does not make it a public offence. The <em>corpus delicti </em>is wanting in this indictment, and formal phrases and qualifying adverbs cannot supply it. It should have appeared with convenient certainty, that what was charged, had been done to the injury of some rights of property, other than their own. For the want of this, the indictment was radically defective and the conviction and sentence erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
