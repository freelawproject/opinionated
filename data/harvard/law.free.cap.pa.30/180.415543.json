Lehman, one of the said three sons, died on the 25th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>June 1854, unmarried and. without issue, leaving his two brothers and three sisters surviving; and the question presented to the court below was, whether his share of the residuary estate of the testatrix went to his two surviving brothers, or to the brothers and sisters jointly-.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-6\">The auditor awarded this share of the residuary estate to the surviving brothers; and the Orphans\u2019 Court dismissed the exceptions filed by the sisters, and decreed distribution accordingly. From this decree the present appeal Was taken.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b183-7\"><em>Hirst, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATp\">\u2014 The general intention of the testatrix was to devise <em>all her estate in trust for her children, </em>and she has made three classes, viz.: one of daughters, for whose benefit certain specific devises are made; a second, of sons, for whose benefit also certain specific devises are made; the third, of all her six children, for whose benefit the residuary estate is devised\u2014 with survivorship among the members of each class.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b183-8\">No stronger example can be given of the support which the law gives to the intention of a testator in providing for survivorship among classes, than is afforded by the opinion of Ld. J. Turner, in Edwards <em>v. </em>Tuck, 21 <em>Eng. L. &amp; Eq. </em>138, cited by the appellees. There was a gift of an estate in distinct moieties to the children of E. and the children of 0., the share of every such child dying, &amp;c., to go to the survivor or survivors of the said children. Ld. J. Turner decided that when a child, belonging to either class, died, his share should go to the survivors of the same class, against the natural construction of the words.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b183-9\">Now here, the testatrix, after creating for certain purposes two distinct classes in the previous devises, makes a third class in the residuary devise, and therefore the survivorship among this class should be <em>co-extensive </em>with the class itself, as is the case in both the previous devises.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b183-10\"><em>H. Wharton </em>and <em>E. K. Price, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYf\">\u2014 It is an established rule for the construction of wills and deeds, that words of reference of relation in a devise or gift, to a previous devise or gift, operate to transplant the limitations or conditions attached to the latter, into the former, just as though they had been expressly repeated. <em>Verba relata hoc m\u00e1xime operantur per referentiam ut in eis inesse videntur: Co. Litt. </em>359 a; Llewellen <em>v. </em>Earl of Jersey, 11 <em>M. &amp; W. </em>183, 188. Thus \u201cIf a man give lands to A., <em>et heredibus de eorpore suo, </em>the remainder to B., <em>informa prsedicta, </em>this is a good estate tail in B.; for that <em>in forma ptrsedicta </em>do include the <em>other:\" Co.

Jr. </em>279; Crowder <em>v. </em>Clowes, 2 <em>Ves.

Eq. </em>304.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-7\">The next principle of construction to which the appellees would call attention, is that general words or limitations in a devise, applied to a variety of subjects, are to be read distributively, <em>reddendo singula singulis: </em>Justice Wyndham\u2019s Case, 5 <em>Co. </em>7 b; Weale <em>v. </em>Lower, <em>Pollexfen </em>65, 67; Roe <em>v. </em>Aistrop, 2 <em>Wm.

An illustration of this rule may be found in Edwards <em>v. </em>Tuck, 21 <em>Eng. L. &amp; Eq. </em>138.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b184-8\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b184-9\">Lowrie, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1\">\u2014 Mrs. Lehman\u2019s will gives certain specified property to a trustee for the benefit of her three sons during their lives, with remainder in trust for their children, if they should have any, and, if not, for each other. It gives other specified property to the trustee for the benefit of her three daughters, using the same words of remainder, and adding a separate use clause. Then it gives to the same trustee the residue of her estate for the use of all her six children, \u201c in the same way and manner, and under the same and like uses and trusts, as are hereinbefore set forth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">One of the sons died without issue; does his share of the residue go to the surviving brothers, or to the surviving brothers and sisters ?</p>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">The very uncertainty of the meaning, as derived from the will, decides this question in favour of the brothers and sisters, and against the brothers by themselves: for whoever claims against the laws of descent, must show a written title, which we can, with satisfaction, decide to be sufficient. The rule of equality of descent to relatives of the same degree, is so just that the law adopts it when the law is to govern, and prefers it when the law is called upon to interpret.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-12\">Besides this, we rather incline to regard the will as declaring this rule. In the first devises the sons and daughters are classed apart for enjoyment and descent. But in the one under consideration, they are all classed together to take one undivided residue together, with cross remainders or <em>quasi </em>cross remainders among them all, and we should need to insert words in order to divide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>them here into two classes. The trusts in the previous clauses can easily be applied to the interests which are here given, and in a very plain way, <em>reddendo singula singulis. </em>The word \u201c respectively\u201d may mean this. It certainly would seem very natural to say that the sons and daughters should take by classes, if such were +v,c intention to be expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Decree. \u2014 This cause came on for hearing at the present term, on the appeal of Mary A. Lipman, Hyman L. Lipman, Jas. Maull, Jr., and Louisa] E. his wife, and Anna A. Lehman, from the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Philadelphia county, and was argued by counsel, and in consideration thereof it is ordered and decreed that the said decree be reversed, and that the balance in the said court for distribution, $505.40, shall, after deducting costs, be equally distributed to the surviving sons and daughters of the testatrix, Mary C. Lehman; and the cause is remitted to the same Orphans\u2019 Court, that this decree may be carried into effect.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
