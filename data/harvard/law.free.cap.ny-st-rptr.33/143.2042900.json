The action proceeded to judgment, under which a sale was had, at which the plaintiff became the purchaser. He received the referee\u2019s deed, and demanded possession of the premises, which the defendant refused to surrender. The present application is for a writ of \u25a0assistance. \u201e</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b197-16\"><em>Morrison &amp; Kennedy, </em>for motion; <em>George W.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAO\">The writ of assistance, so far as foreclosures .are concerned, is an old chancery writ, which exists independent of the statute. 4 Wait\u2019s Pr., 196. It may be had to enforce any judgment or order awarding the possession of real property, other than the common judgment, in a direct action for land. 2 Tilling-hast &amp; Shearman Pr., 849, and see, also, <em>Lynde </em>v. <em>O'Donnell, </em>12 Abb.Pr., 286 ; 21 IIow. Pr., 34; N.Y. <em>Life Ins., etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Rand, </em>8 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>How. Pr., 35, 352. A writ of assistance is, in ordinary cases, the process for giving possession of land under an adjudication, and will be granted upon the sale being confirmed, and proof that the purchaser has received a deed of conveyance from the master, which has been shown to the party in possession accompanied by a demand of possession which has been refused. 1 Barb. Ch. Pr., 531. These requirements were fulfilled here.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Section 8 of chap. 342 of the Laws of 1885, under which the lien was foreclosed, provides <em>inter alla </em>that the manner and form of conducting a mechanic\u2019s lien proceeding shall be the same as the foreclosure of a mortgage. The power to foreclose was expressly conferred upon this court, and everything necessary to a complete execution of the jurisdiction goes with it. This court has the same power to issue the writ applied for as that possessed by any other court acting under the same statute. The enforcement of mechanic\u2019s liens is a sort of equity jurisdiction, governed by equitable rules and principles, and the old chancery writ of assistance is the process by which the purchaser gains the possession to which the proceedings entitle him. The writ has not been abolished by any express provision of the Code, nor has a substitute been provided for it by that or any other act, and except, where the judgment can be enforced by execution, the writ is still an appropriate remedy. The judgment herein cannot be enforced in respect to possession by execution, and the relief required must be obtained by this writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">It follows that the application for the writ must be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
