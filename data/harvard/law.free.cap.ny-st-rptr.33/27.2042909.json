Woodford, and all proceedings thereupon, for certain irregularities and jurisdictional defects in the affidavit upon which the order was made; also to vacate the order of Mr. Justice Van Wyck, appointing a receiver of the property of said judgment debtor on the ground that the affidavit upon which the said order of Mr. Justice Ehrlich was made is fatally defective, and to modify said last mentioned order of Mr. Justice Van Wyck by striking out the provisions for the payment of thirty dollars costs by said judgment debtor, and the provisions requiring said judgment debtor to execute an assignment to said receiver.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b81-12\"><em>Joseph A. Thompson, </em>for judgment debtor and motion; JEvarts, <em>Choate &amp; Beaman (Henry W. Harden, </em>of counsel), for judgment creditors, opposed.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b81-13\">Giegerich, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQ2\">It appears from the order appointing a receiver herein, as resettled, that the judgment debtor appeared in person before Mr. Justice Yan Wyck, who made the order in question, and objected to motion for the appointment of a receiver, on the grounds, \u201c that the affidavit of Mr. Cleveland, on which th(e third person order against Mr. Woodford is based is upon information and belief, without stating any sources or grounds therefor;, that the Code requires proof (\u00a7 2441); that the affidavit is not evidence or proof of anything; \u201d and said judgment debtor was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>heard in opposition to the motion in question, and who filed his affidavit, verified August 1, 1890, in opposition thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-3\">The judgment debtor now moves the court at special term under \u00a7 2433 of the Code of Civil Procedure, to vacate the said order made by Mr. Justice Yan Wyck appointing a receiver, and to vacate the order upon which the proceeding was begun, for certain alleged irregularities and defects of jurisdiction in the affidavit upon which the same was made; also in the alternative that said order of Mr. Justice Yan Wyck be modified by striking out the provisions for the payment of costs and the motion for an assignment by the judgment debtor to the receiver, which will be considered in the order in which they were raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">It is urged by the judgment debtor that the affidavit upon which the order for the examination of Mr. Woodford was granted is fatally defective, because \u201c it was made upon information and belief by the attorney for said judgment creditors, without any statement of the sources of such information or the grounds of such belief; and- that no proof by affidavit or other competent written evidence appears to have been made for the granting of said order; also for the reason that it does not appear from any such evidence that the judgment upon which the same purports to be based was docketed, or that a transcript thereof was filed in the county clerk\u2019s office of any county in this state prior to the issue of any execution thereupon; also that it does not appear that said order required the examination of said Stewart L. Wood-ford in the county in which the judgment debtor resided at the time said order was made or wherein he then had an office for the regular transaction of business in person; also that it did not then appear to said justice, by affidavit or other competent written evidence, that an execution had theretofore been issued upon said judgment to the county where said judgment debtor resided or where he then had a place for the regular transaction of business in person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Substantially the same objections were presented to Mr. Justice Yan Wyck, who overruled the same, and I see no reason why his ruling should be disturbed. The gravamen of the objection is, that the affidavit was made upon information and belief, as will be perceived upon perusal thereof, and which sets forth all the facts required by \u00a7 2441 of the Code of Civ. Pro.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The precise question involved in this branch of the motion was passed upon by my lamented predecessor, Mr. Justice Nehrbas, in <em>Tefft </em>v. <em>Epstein, </em>17 Civ. Pro., 168, who held, citing <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>52 N. Y., 409, that an affidavit on information and belief merely was sufficient, and I regard these authorities as controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">The judgment debtor also contends that the provisions for the payment of thirty dollars costs, by the said judgment debtor, should be stricken out from the said order of Mr. Justice Yan Wyck, \u201c on the ground that said proceeding was instituted against a third person and that such person, if any one, should pay the costs of such proceedings to the judgment creditors.\u201d There is no merit in the contention, and the costs were properly allowed under \u00a7 2455 of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>The judgment herein has been affirmed by the general term of the court of common pleas, and until it is reversed or set aside by a court of competent jurisdiction it is binding upon the parties thereto, and it would be idle to pass upon the question presented by the judgment debtor in his brief, whether this court has power to grant judgment awarding moneys of the United States by \u201c estoppel \u201d or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-3\">That branch of the motion to strike out from the order appointing the receiver the provision requiring said judgment debtor to execute an assignment to said receiver has been obviated by the said order as resettled, which entirely omits therefrom all reference to the matters objected to.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">For the reasons above stated the motion must be denied, with ten dollars costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
