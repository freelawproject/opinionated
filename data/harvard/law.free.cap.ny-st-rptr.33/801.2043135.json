The court set aside the sale and appointed a referee, and directed him to state an account between the parties, with the privilege to either party to prefer any claims and have the same passed upon by the referee, and the order provided that either party could move for judgment on the report. The referee found a balance due to defendants, and ordered judgment in their favor. <em>Held, </em>no error; that the account directed by the court was a general one, and plaintiff by not appealing from the order acquiesced in such direction, and that if he had not acquiesced, the court had power on appeal to amend the answers by inserting a prayer for affirmative relief if necessary.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b855-6\">Appeal from a judgment entered on the report of a referee, and from an order confirming the report of said referee, and from an order denying plaintiff\u2019s motion to send the case \"back to the referee. The decision on a former appeal is reported in 55 Super. Ct., 417 ; 14 1ST. Y. State Eep., 788.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b855-7\"><em>Holmes &amp; </em>Adams, for app\u2019lt; <em>B. F.

The defendants denied the fraud and demanded that the complaint be dismissed, but asked for no affirmative judgment. The court before whom the case was tried set aside the sale, and ordered an accounting between the copartners as of the time of the sale. The judgment entered on the report of the referee who had taken the accounting was set aside and a new reference ordered. On this last reference the referee found that plaintiff was indebted to defendants, and ordered judgment in favor of the defendants, and against plaintiff, for the sum so found, and judgment was entered accordingly. The plaintiff contends that this was error because defendants had not demanded affirmative relief in their answers.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-10\">The trial court appointed a referee, and directed that referee to state an account between the parties to the action in respect of said partnership assets, and also partnership liabilities, and of such amounts, if any, in which each may be liable or interested by reason of the premises, and that said referee ascertain and report * * * whether either of the parties is indebted to the other by reason of property appropriated or cash withdrawn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>or received, and what is the amount of such indebtedness, * * * that on the coming in and confirmation of said report either party may * * * move for judgment thereon;\u201d the judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b856-2\">further provided that nothing in it contained should \u201cprevent either party from preferring before the referee, nor prevent the referee from passing upon when preferred, any claim by either party to credit in his own favor, or to debit against any other party in addition to the specific sums hereinbefore particularly directed to be charged or credited.\u201d From this judgment plaintiff has not appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-3\">. I am of the opinion that it was the intention of the trial court to direct, and that it did direct a general accounting as between the copartners of all of the copartnership affairs, to the end that the party or parties who should be found on such accounting to be entitled to judgment should have judgment against the other party, and that plaintiff, by not appealing, has acquiesced in such direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">But even if plaintiff had not acquiesced, this court, in the interest of justice, and to sustain a judgment, would order the anwers to be amended by inserting a prayer for affirmative relief, or by making the answers conform to the facts proved, if such amendment were necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">The judgment and orders appealed from are affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">O'Gorman, J. concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
