Y, February 5, 1889. The defendant is an independent corporation known as \u201c The Union Loan &amp; Trust Company, of Cleveland, Ohio,\u201d organized September 25,1889, seven months after the sale. The officers and stockholders of the two companies are different, except that one person connected with the defendant company was, at the time of the sale, an officer of the former corporation. Jekyll-Hyde tactics have been traced to individuals, and may to an ..extent enter into corporate transformations. In the case of individuals, but one exists in point of fact, but here two independent entities exist, each having a charter, a mission and separate corporate rights. We cannot hold that the second corporation is the first, for such is not the truth. Upon the proofs and the law applicable, the complaint ought to have been dismissed. It follows that it was error to send the case to the jury, and that the judgment entered on their verdict in favor of the plaintiff must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>be reversed and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
