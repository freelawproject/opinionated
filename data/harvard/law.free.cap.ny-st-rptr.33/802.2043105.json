The taxes of 1882 amounted to $25.31, ana those of 1883 to $69.95.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b856-15\"><em>William If.

The tax has never been paid by defendant. It does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>appear that any warrant to collect it has ever been issued to any marshal or returned, or that there has ever been any attempt to levy it by distress and sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-3\">The plaintiff, as receiver of taxes in the city of New York, now brings this action against the defendant and demands a money judgment for the amount of the tax and interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-4\">With the assent of counsel, the court directed a verdict for the plaintiff, subject to the opinion of the court at general term.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">The receiver of taxes is an officer of the law and has no powers other than such as are expressly or by necessary implication conferred on him by the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">As a condition precedent to the right of the receiver of taxes to maintain any action for the collection of personal taxes under the provisions of \u00a7 863 of the consolidation act of 1882, it must appear that the case is one which by statute the receiver is authorized to send to the attorney for the collection of personal taxes for prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">These cases are:</p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">1. \u201cAll cases of personal taxes embraced in the assessment rolls when the assessment is $1,000 or more, and upon which a warrant to any of the marshals of said city and county has been issued and unsatisfied for a period of sixty days, or returned unsatisfied in whole or in part; \u201d and</p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">2. \u201cAll other cases of personal taxes when application to any court may be made for the collection of the tax.\u201d Consolidation Act, \u00a7 859.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">The cases where application to any court may be made for collection of a tax are those mentioned in \u00a7 857 of that act, and there is no evidence that any of the events have occurred in this case justifying the receiver of taxes in bringing this action against the defendant. Id., \u00a7 857.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-11\">Section 863 of the consolidation act provides for the collection by action of any tax imposed for personal property upon any person in the city and county of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-12\">It is contended by th^e plaintiff here that the true meaning of this clause is to be arrived at by construing it as if it had been written thus: \u201cFor the collection of any tax imposed in the city and county of New York upon any person,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-13\">I do not think that we are justified in taking this liberty with the text of the law, especially as there is no necessity to resort to such a process.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-14\">The law has made ample provision for the collection of taxes on bank stock, no matter where the owner may reside.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-15\">By chapter 761, Laws of 1866, the stock was made taxable at the place where the bank was located, and special remedies were provided for the collection of that tax where the stockholder was a non-resident.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-16\"><em>First. </em>In case of non-residence, the collector and county treasurer may proceed against the person taxed in the same manner as where a personal tax has been assessed upon a person who has subsequently removed from the town or ward where the assessment is laid, namely, by issuing a warrant to any sheriff or con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>stable of the county to which the person has removed. Laws of 1836, chap. 461.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-2\"><em>Second. </em>And, this also in case of non-residence, the county treasurer or receiver of . taxes may have an action to collect the tax \u201c from the avails of the sale of the stock.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b858-3\"><em>Third. </em>The tax is made a lien upon the stock from the day it is assessed, until payment is made, and all transfers are subject to such lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\"><em>Fourth. </em>It is made the duty of the bank and of its officers to retain so much of any dividends declared upon the stock' as will suffice to pay the tax, until the tax is paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">These provisions were re-enacted in 1880, in 1881, chap. 477, and in the act to revise the banking laws, chap. 409 of 1882, and are now the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">By \u00a7 314 of chap. 409 of the Laws of 1882, the receiver of taxes may have an action to \u201c collect the tax from the avails of the sale of his (the owner\u2019s) stock,\u201d in cases where he does not reside in the place where the bank is located.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">This act, I think, is broad enough in its language to cover such transactions in the city of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-8\">The action now under consideration is not brought under or in compliance with this act.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">It is not an action <em>in rem, </em>for the purpose of procuring a sale of the stock, but an ordinary action, <em>in </em>personam, for a money judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-10\">It is not even alleged here that the bank stock is now in the possession of the defendant, and, as to the taxes of 1883, it would appear that the defendant was, in fact, not a stockholder when these taxes were imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-11\">In my opinion, this action on the part of the plaintiff cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-12\">The verdict for the plaintiff should be set aside, and the defendant should have judgment, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-13\">Truax, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
