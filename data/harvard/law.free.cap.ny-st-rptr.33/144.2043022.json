In other words, whether the defendants were partners. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel requested the court to charge that if Mr. Conner was carrying on business himself, and not as partner of the co-defendant, he was liable on the cause of action established. The trial judge declined so to charge, because the action was not brought against Conner individually. This was error. The Code has. modified the common law rule, that, in an action upon an alleged joint contract, the plaintiff must, recover against all the defendants, or be defeated in the action, so that now a verdict may go against one in favor of the other. <em>Code, </em>\u00a7 1204; <em>Brumskill </em>v. James, 11 N. Y, 294; and see notes, to Bliss\u2019 Code under \u00a7 1204, <em>supra, </em>tinder the rule established by the Code, the plaintiff was entitled to a verdict against Conner whether the liability established against him was a joint or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>individual obligation, and the only question to be determined was whether there was a liability against him in either form. It follows-that the judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-3\">McAdam, Cli.
