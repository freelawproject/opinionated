Plaintiffs demanded the usual statement and sent a blank form to the wife\u2019s place of business; it was received by defendant and, by his procurement, filled out by his wife, upon information given by him, and. under his direction signed by her, delivered to him, and by him forwarded to plaintiffs. Upon the strength of this contrivance the goods were sold and delivered by the plaintiffs, who relied upon the statement thus procured. Representations contained in it were false to defendant\u2019s knowledge, and plaintiffs have lost their claim.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b982-11\"><em>J.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AmZ\">The complaint is sufficient in alleging a false representation made by the defendant with knowledge of its falsity, and the injury to the plaintiffs resulting from the insolvency at the time of the party concerning whom the representation was made, it having been made by the defendant to induce the plaintiff to give that party credit. The defendant .is not an agent, but a principal, because he directly sent to the plaintiffs the written false representation to induce them to make the sale which they afterwards did. He made the false statement with full knowledge of the actual condition of his wife\u2019s business. So, if she were insolvent at the time, he must have known the fact, because it is charged in the complaint that he was managing her business. \u00b0</p>\n<p id=\"b982-13\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-14\">Bischoff and Pryor, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
