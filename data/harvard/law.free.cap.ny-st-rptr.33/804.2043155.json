These statutes have been incorporated into the consolidation act as \u00a7\u00a7 897 to 914, inclusive. Proof was taken in that proceeding, and a hearing had before the court. The result was that on the 21st day of July, 1881, an order was granted and signed by Mi\u2019. Justice Cullen, vacating the assessment in question on the plaintiff\u2019s lots.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b859-2\">This order was not entered, however\u2019, until January 25, 1889, but was retained in the possession of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney. On September 8, 1882, the petitioner instituted proceedings before the assessment commission, a tribunal established under chapter 550, of the Laws of 1880, for the granting of such relief as might be just to the property owners who had been aggrieved by assessments for local improvements. The commission heard the case on the merits, and made a certificate on or about the 19th day of October, 1882, reducing the assessment in question sixty-five per cent., and from $1,784.69 to $624.66. Subsequently, and on the 9th day of March, 1883, the plaintiff paid the reduced amount with interest, being forced to do so to procure a loan on the property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b859-3\">The present suit is to recover the amount thus paid, with interest and costs, on the theory that the order made in 1881 adjudged the assessment illegal and void, and that the defendants have in their possession money which <em>ex aequo et bona </em>belongs to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b859-4\"><em>George L. </em>Sterling, for def\u2019t; <em>James A. </em>Peering, for pl\u2019ff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b859-5\">Ingraham, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALA\">We think the payment of the assessment in this case was clearly a voluntary payment. Prior to ihe time of the payment proceedings had been commenced to have the assessment declared void and an order had been signed by one of the justices of the supreme court dated on the 21st of July, 1881, vacating the assessment and directing the municipal officers to cancel and discharge the same and the lien or liens upon the records of their respective offices so far as the same affected plaintiff\u2019s lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">This order does not appear to have been filed until some time in 1889. The court, however, had decided that the assessment was void and that it should be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">In order to remove the lien of the assessment from the plaintiff\u2019s property, she had to file the order, take a certified copy of it to the proper officers and the lien was discharged. Instead of that she went and paid the assessment. There was no threat on behalf of the city to sell the property and the assessment was paid not on account of any proceedings of any kind taken by the city but for her own purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">The case comes directly within the case of <em>Phelps </em>v. <em>The May</em>or, <em>etc., </em>112 N. Y, 216; 20 N. Y. State Rep., 238. It was there stated: \u201cWe do not understand that the rule goes further in its authority to permit a recovery back of the moneys paid by a person under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>a tax or assessment than in a case where, its payment being compelled by the actual or threatened seizure of his person or divestiture of his goods, he asserts by action and successfully maintains its illegality.\u201d Here the assessment had been declared by the court to have been illegal on plaintiff\u2019s petition and an order signed so adjudging. A payment made under such circumstances was not compelled by an action or threatened seizure of his person or divestiture of his goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-3\">We think, therefore, the defendants are entitled to judgment on the verdict, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">Freedman, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
