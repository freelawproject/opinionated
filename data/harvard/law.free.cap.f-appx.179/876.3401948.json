Clay appeals his sentence, asserting that it violated the Fifth and Sixth Amendments under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-18\">Clay does not dispute that his predicate convictions were \u201cserious drug offenses\u201d as defined in \u00a7 924(e)(2), but he contends that a jury should determine whether the offenses were \u201ccommitted on occasions different from one another,\u201d as required by \u00a7 924(e)(1). Clay concedes that, in <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>421 F.3d 278 (4th Cir.2005), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1463, 164 L.Ed.2d 250 (2006), this court held that the Armed Career Criminal Act\u2019s \u201cuse of the term \u2018occasion\u2019 requires recourse only to data normally found in conclusive judicial records, such as the date and location of an offense, upon which <em>Taylor [v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) ] and <em>Shepard [v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) ] say we may rely.\u201d 421 F.3d at 286. Thus, <em>Thompson </em>holds that a jury need not find that the prior offenses occurred on different occasions because \u201cthis fact is inherent in the convictions themselves, and thus is not among the kinds of facts extraneous to a conviction that <em>Blakely </em>or <em>Shepard </em>requires a jury to find.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the facts necessary to support Clay\u2019s sentence to the statutory minimum fifteen-year sentence under \u00a7 924(e) were evident from the \u201cconclusive significance of a prior judicial record,\u201d <em>Shepard, </em>125 S.Ct. at 1262-63, no due process or Sixth Amendment error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-21\">Clay urges us to revisit our decision in <em>Thompson. </em>However, \u201ca panel of this court cannot overrule, explicitly or implicitly, the precedent set by a prior panel of this court. Only the Supreme Court or this court sitting <em>en banc </em>can do that.\u201d <em>Scotts Co. v. United Indus. Corp., </em>315 F.3d 264, 271-72 n. 2 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-22\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
