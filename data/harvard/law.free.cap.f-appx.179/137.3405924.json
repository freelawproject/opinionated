Petitioner filed his asylum application more than three years after he arrived in the United States. Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B), an alien must file his application for asylum within one year of his arrival in the United States. Only upon a showing of changed circumstances which materially affect the alien\u2019s eligibility for asylum or of extraordinary circumstances explaining the delay will this limitations period be extended. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). Because Petitioner filed his application more than three years after his arrival in this country, and there existed no reason for extending the one year limitations period, the Immigration Judge denied his application as untimely. The Board adopted and affirmed this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">This Court lacks jurisdiction to review the Board\u2019s denial of Petitioner\u2019s asylum application as untimely. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3); <em>Tarrawally v. Ashcroft, </em>338 F.3d 180, 185 (3d Cir.2003). We will therefore dismiss the petition for review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
