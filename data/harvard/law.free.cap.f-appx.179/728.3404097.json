Morace denying his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-17\">When the BIA agrees with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that a petitioner is not credible and, without rejecting any of the IJ\u2019s grounds for decision, emphasizes particular aspects of that decision, this Court reviews both the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s opinions\u2014 or more precisely, the Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision including the portions not explicitly discussed by the BIA. <em>Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 <em>&amp; </em>n. 7 (2d Cir.2004). Nevertheless, \u201cthe fact that the [agency] has relied primarily on credibility grounds in dismissing an asylum application cannot insulate the decision from review.\u201d <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir.2004). An adverse credibility determination must be based on \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d that \u201cbear a legitimate nexus\u201d to the finding. <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-18\">The agency\u2019s determination that Lin was not credible based on conflicting testimony regarding the issuance of his national identity card in relation to the birth of his second child and the time his family spent in hiding is substantially supported by the record. There was substantial evidence to support the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s finding that Lin\u2019s explanation that the interpreter did not allow him to testify fully did not rectify the discrepancies in his testimony. Because Lin\u2019s account of his family\u2019s hiding in relation to the birth of his daughter is a central element of his claim of persecution by Chinese family planning officials, the IJ and BIA properly relied on his inconsistent testimony as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>factor in their determination that he was not credible. The IJ\u2019s reliance on Lin\u2019s difficulty in recalling the dates of his wife\u2019s gynecological checkups in relation to the removal of her IUD was also permissible, because such events are closely linked to the family\u2019s alleged persecution by birth control officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">We think that the IJ\u2019s finding as to Lin\u2019s nonspecific testimony relating to his wife\u2019s sterilization was not supported by substantial evidence, <em>Jin Shui Qiu v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 140, 152 (2d Cir.2003), but the other two factors used by the IJ to support his adverse credibility 'finding were supported by substantial evidence. We conclude that it can be \u201cconfident[ly] predicted\u201d that the IJ would have reached the same conclusion absent the single erroneous determination. <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>434 F.3d 144, 161 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Because the agency properly determined that Lin failed to present the requisite credible objective evidence establishing his eligibility for asylum, the denial of withholding of removal, which carries a higher of proof, was also appropriate. Lin has waived any challenge to the IJ\u2019s denial of CAT relief by failing to address this issue in his brief before this Court. <em>Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 542 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
