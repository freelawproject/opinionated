SEYMOUR, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b474-12\">Terry Lee Dooley pled guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g) and 924(e)(1). He now seeks to challenge his conviction and sentence. Counsel for Mr. Dooley filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), contending there are no non-frivolous issues for appeal and seeking to withdraw. We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-15\">Mr. Dooley pled guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm pursuant to a plea agreement with the government. The parties agreed to a sentence of 188 months pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1)(C), and the government agreed to recommend a sentence at the low end of that range. Mr. Dooley also agreed to waive \u201cany right he may have for a grand jury indictment and a jury determination of any and all facts relevant to the application of any Sentencing Guideline factor that may exist under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) and <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and any other case interpreting these two Supreme Court decisions.\u201d Rec., vol. I, doc. 73 at 2; <em>id., </em>vol. III at 3, 15, 24. Mr. Dooley was sentenced to a term of 188 months. He timely filed <em>pro se </em>a notice of appeal, stating he sought to appeal his \u201cjudgment and conviction, including the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>Id., </em>vol. I, doc. 87.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-16\">In the <em>Anders </em>brief, Mr. Dooley\u2019s counsel notes that because Mr. Dooley pled guilty, \u201cthe only possible avenues for appeal would be irregularities in the guilty plea, or sentencing errors.\u201d Aplt. br. at 5. Counsel reasoned that because there were no irregularities attending Mr. Dooley\u2019s guilty plea, and because Mr. Dooley waived his right to a grand jury indictment and a jury determination of any fact relevant to any sentencing guideline factor, there were no non-frivolous grounds upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>which Mr. Dooley could appeal. Notwithstanding the opportunity to do so, Mr. Dooley has not responded to his attorney\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief, and the government has declined to file a brief. Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>we must conduct \u201ca full examination of all the proceedings\u201d to determine if Mr. Dooley\u2019s appeal is wholly frivolous. 386 U.S. at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Defense counsel is correct to note that Mr. Dooley\u2019s guilty plea was valid. The record indicates the trial court followed the procedures required by the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure regarding guilty pleas. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(1) (detailing procedures required to ensure defendant\u2019s understanding prior to accepting plea), 11(b)(2) (ensuring plea is voluntary), and 11(b)(3) (establishing factual basis for plea); <em>see also United States v. Rhodes, </em>913 F.2d 839, 843 (10th Cir.1990) (guilty plea must be knowing and voluntary in order to be valid). In the course of Mr. Dooley\u2019s plea proceedings, the trial court also established that Mr. Dooley understood he was waiving any right to a jury determination of any sentencing factors used to calculate his sentence. Rec., vol. III at 7, 17, 20-21, 25-26. We see no infirmities in Mr. Dooley\u2019s guilty plea, and he therefore lacks any non-frivolous grounds to challenge his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Mr. Dooley\u2019s sentence pursuant to Rule 11(c)(1)(C) further undermines any sentencing challenge he might wish to raise. Rule 11(c)(1)(C) provides the parties may \u201cagree that a specific sentence or sentencing range is the appropriate disposition of the case, ... (such a recommendation or request binds the court once the court accepts the plea agreement).\u201d Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1)(C).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-7\">Where a defendant agrees to and receives a specific sentence, that defendant may only appeal the sentence if it was (1) imposed in violation of law, (2) imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the guidelines, or (3) is greater than the sentence set forth in the plea agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-9\"><em>United States v. Silva, </em>413 F.3d 1283, 1284 (10th Cir.2005) (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) and (c); <em>United States v. Denogean, </em>79 F.3d 1010, 1013-14 (10th Cir.1996)). Here, the only conceivable ground upon which Mr. Dooley might appeal his sentence is an argument that his sentence was imposed in violation of law, i.e., that he was sentenced under a mandatory sentencing scheme in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We foreclosed that argument in <em>Silva, </em>where we held that nothing in the <em>Blakely/Apprendi/Booker </em>line of cases \u201cundermines the validity of sentences imposed under Rule 11(c)(1)(C).\u201d <em>Silva, </em>413 F.3d at 1284. There was nothing unlawful about Mr. Dooley\u2019s sentence warranting appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">Accordingly, we DISMISS the appeal and grant counsel\u2019s request to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b474-13\"> After examining appellant's brief and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, or collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
