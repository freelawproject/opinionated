Although his notice of appeal states he is also appealing the denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, the district court did <em>not </em>rule on that petition. Therefore, only the TRO-denial is at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-16\">We lack jurisdiction over a TRO-denial because the ruling does not qualify as an \u201cinjunction\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1). <em>Faultier v. Johnson, </em>178 F.3d 741, 742 (5th Cir.) (\u201c[I]t is well settled that this court has no appellate jurisdiction over the denial of an application for a temporary restraining order\u201d.) (citing <em>In re Lieb, </em>915 F.2d 180, 183 (5th Cir.1990)), <em>cert, denied, </em>527 U.S. 1018, 119 S.Ct. 2363, 144 L.Ed.2d 768 (1999). On the other hand, the denial of a preliminary injunction is ordinarily appealable immediately. <em>See Lakedreams v. Taylor, </em>932 F.2d 1103, 1107 (5th Cir.1991). Construing the district court\u2019s order as the denial of a preliminary injunction, appealable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a), the motion was properly denied. <em>See United States v. Wood, </em>295 F.2d 772, 778 (5th Cir.1961) (construing the denial of a TRO as a final order for appealability purposes in order to preserve determination of the parties\u2019 substantial rights), <em>cert, denied, </em>369 U.S. 850, 82 S.Ct. 933, 8 L.Ed.2d 9 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-17\">An injunction-denial will be reversed only on showing the district court abused its discretion. <em>Lakedreams, </em>932 F.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>1107. As the district court reasoned in denying relief, Ramos did not show a substantial threat that failure to enjoin his detention would result in irreparable injury. Nor did he show a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of his claim, brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, challenging his detention and removal as unlawful. <em>Cf. Cardoso v. Reno, </em>216 F.3d 512, 516-17 (5th Cir.2000) (affirming dismissal of action for lack of jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(g) by plaintiff subject to removal order and seeking adjustment of status to avoid removal order).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b266-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
