Jones (Buck) appeals the district court\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> dismissal of an action he and his wife Robbie R. Jones, now deceased, brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985. Having conducted de novo review of the record, <em>see Gisslen v. City of Crystal, Minn., </em>345 F.3d 624, 626-27 (8th Cir.2003) (determination as to subject matter jurisdiction is reviewed de novo), <em>cert, denied, </em>541 U.S. 960, 124 S.Ct. 1722, 158 L.Ed.2d 401 (2004), we conclude that the Joneses\u2019 illegal-exaction claim\u2014the only claim Buck addresses in his brief, and thus the only one before us\u2014was barred under the Rooker-Feldman<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> doctrine, <em>see Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 1521-22, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005) <em>(Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine applies to cases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before federal proceedings were commenced, and inviting federal district courts to review and reject those judgments). Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B. We deny both the University of Arkansas at Fort Smith\u2019s motion for sanctions and Buck\u2019s request to disqualify the University\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b428-11\">.
