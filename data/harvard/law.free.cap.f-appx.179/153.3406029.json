The Board bases its Order on its findings that the Company committed multiple violations of \u00a7\u00a7 8(a)(1) and (3) of the Act. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158 (1998). Because we conclude that, viewing the record as a whole, substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s findings, we grant the application for enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">In January 2000, the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship Builders, Blacksmiths, Forgers and Helpers (the \u201cUnion\u201d), seeking to represent a bargaining unit of all full-time and regular part-time production and maintenance employees at the Company\u2019s kaolin clay mining and processing facility in Langley, South Carolina, petitioned the Board for a representation election. Although the Union won, the Company challenged the result, and this court invalidated the election in 2002. <em>See NLRB v. Kentucky Tenn. Clay Co., </em>295 F.3d 436, 439 (4th Cir.2002).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Independent of the Company\u2019s challenge to the representation election, the General Counsel to the Board issued a consolidated complaint in May 2001, alleging that the Company had violated \u00a7\u00a7 8(a)(1), (3) and (5) of the Act. The case was heard before an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d), who found that the Company had committed the alleged violations. Both the Company and the General Counsel filed exceptions to the ALJ\u2019s decision. In light of this court\u2019s decision invalidating the representation election, the Board reversed the ALJ\u2019s findings that the Company had violated \u00a7 8(a)(5) by refusing to recognize and bargain with the union, and by unilaterally changing certain terms and conditions of employment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Board affirmed, however, the ALJ\u2019s findings that the Company had violated \u00a7 8(a)(1) by threatening employees with discharge if they went on strike, creating the impression of surveillance among employees, threatening an employee with futility in selecting union representation and threatening an employee with discipline for engaging in protected concerted activity, and that it had violated \u00a7 8(a)(3) by reducing an employee\u2019s hours and, later, discharging him.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">The following findings of fact made by the ALJ and adopted by the Board form the bases of the \u00a7 8(a)(1) and (3) violations found by the Board. Coley Lamar Wilson and Scott worked in the maintenance shop at the Langley facility. Although they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>generally worked on separate projects, they worked together when a particular project required two men. Wilson, who had been a supervisor in the maintenance shop at one time, trained Scott. Wilson described Scott as a \u201cproficient welder\u201d and a \u201cgood worker\u201d and requested Scott\u2019s assistance on jobs that required two workers. Murray Penner supervised both Scott and Wilson.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">During the month leading up to the March 15, 2000 representation election, Scott and Wilson wore pro-Union buttons displaying the phrase \u201cVote Yes\u201d every day. Scott wore his button on an outer garment, pinning it either on his jacket or shirt pocket. During that same time period, Penner met with Scott and Wilson on a daily basis. Myron Renew, an employee and the subsequent Union president, observed Scott wearing the button on one occasion when Penner approached. Penner came within three feet of Scott and had a clear view of the button. Scott also discussed the Union with other employees and solicited authorization cards for the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">The day after the representation election, Penner approached Renew and claimed that \u201cthere would be no union.\u201d J.A. 427. Penner further stated \u201c[t]hat he would do everything possible to decertify the union, and that there would be an appeal for an election [the following] March.\u201d Id. Shortly thereafter, Penner asked Wilson how Wilson thought a union could help him.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">In April 2000, Penner interviewed Adelbert Quackenbush for a position with the Company. During the interview, Penner informed Quackenbush that the Union had been voted in. After Quackenbush stated that he might not join the Union, Penner replied that he \u201choped [Quackenbush] wouldn\u2019t join the Union.\u201d J.A. 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">In August 2000, Penner informed Scott that he intended to reduce Scott\u2019s work hours to forty hours per week from fifty to fifty-five hours per week.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As justification for implementing the reduction, Penner cited Scott\u2019s slow work pace. Specifically, Penner mentioned Scott\u2019s failure timely to complete work on an earth-moving machine known as a scraper. Penner also told Scott \u201cthat he was going to ruin [Scott\u2019s] lifestyle. And if [Scott] didn\u2019t like what he was doing, [Scott] could find someplace else to go.\u201d J.A. 427. Scott testified that Penner had prolonged the work on the scraper by requesting additional modifications, and that Scott had rebuilt a dump truck and assisted Wilson during that same time period. Furthermore, Scott testified that he had performed his work in the same manner prior to the Union campaign, and that Penner had never criticized him for helping Wilson.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">In December 2000, Penner held a meeting with Quackenbush, who had become a Union member by that time, and three truck drivers who opposed the Union. Penner related a story to Quackenbush about a facility in Georgia where the employees had voted for the Union and had netted only an eight cent increase in pay from the subsequent negotiations. Penner further stated that if the employees went on strike, he \u201cwould fire all the strikers and just rehire.\u201d J.A. 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-12\">Also in December 2000, a truck driver, believed by Quackenbush to oppose the Union, overheard Quackenbush and Wilson discussing changes that they thought the Union would bring to the facility. Shortly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>thereafter, Penner told Quackenbush that he had heard that Quackenbush was trying to change the way Penner was doing things in the facility, and that he did not like Quackenbush\u2019s interference. Quackenbush admitted to discussing the Union with Wilson but denied trying to change the way things were being done. He told Penner that he knew the source of Penner\u2019s information, referring to the truck driver who had overheard his conversation. Penner did not confirm the source of the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">In January 2001, Renew sent the Company a document listing the officers of the Union. That document listed Scott as a trustee of the Union\u2019s board. Renew also caused a copy of the document to be posted on a bulletin board at the facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">On Thursday, January 11, 2001, Penner assigned Scott to assist an outside contractor working at the facility to service some of the Company\u2019s fire extinguishers. Penner told Scott to complete the project and then report back to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">When the contractor failed to finish the project on Thursday, Scott reported to work at 7:00 a.m. on Friday and continued to assist even though he was not scheduled to work that day. At 8:00 a.m., Wilson informed Scott that Penner was looking for him, and Scott reported to Penner\u2019s office. Penner questioned Scott\u2019s presence on a day that he was not scheduled to work. Scott explained that he was working on the fire extinguishers and offered to go home. Penner instructed him to do so after finishing what he was doing. Scott understood this instruction to mean that he should complete those fire extinguishers that he had started but not to start any others. Scott also informed Renew that Penner was sending him home and did not want him to finish the fire extinguisher project.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Scott reported to work at his normal time the following Monday, January 15, 2001, and worked until Penner approached him at approximately 4:45 p.m. Penner inquired as to why Scott had not told the contractor that he intended to leave before completing the fire extinguisher project the previous Friday. Scott replied that informing the contractor was Penner\u2019s responsibility. This discussion led to an exchange about the Union. Scott told Penner that there was a union, and that Penner had to do as the Union said. Penner replied, \u201cyou do not have a Union. You don\u2019t have a contract and you have no rights.\u201d J.A. 428. Both Quackenbush and Wilson overheard Penner\u2019s comment. Penner told Scott to come to his office. Wilson came along at Scott\u2019s request. Once inside the office, Penner instructed Scott to clock out and go home. Upon arriving at his home, Scott telephoned Renew to say that something was happening and asked Renew to meet him in the shop the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">Renew met Scott at the shop the morning of Tuesday, January 16, 2001. When David Forrester, the plant manager arrived, he informed Renew that Renew could be in trouble for having spent work time waiting. Renew told Forrester that he was present in his capacity as a grievance representative on behalf of Scott.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">Scott was called to meet with Penner and Forrester, and he was permitted to bring one witness; he chose Renew. After a brief exchange, Scott was instructed to go home and to return at 1:00 p.m. Scott returned at 1:00 p.m. and, with Renew present on his behalf, met with Penner and Forrester in Penner\u2019s office. Forrester informed Scott that he was terminated. The Company\u2019s human resources director had prepared a list of Scott\u2019s alleged offenses, which Forrester read aloud. For<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>rester refused Renew\u2019s request for a copy of the list.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The Union subsequently filed charges against the Company that resulted in the complaint being issued by the Board General Counsel. Adjudication of that complaint led to the Decision and Order that the Board now seeks to enforce, and that the Company opposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">We note at the outset the level of deference due the Board\u2019s Decision. We must affirm rational Board interpretations of the Act if they are consistent with the Act. <em>Consolidated Diesel Co. v. NLRB, </em>263 F.3d 345, 352 (4th Cir.2001). Likewise, we must affirm the Board\u2019s findings of fact if, considering the record as a whole, substantial evidence supports them. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e) (1998); <em>NLRB v. Air Contact Transp. Inc., </em>403 F.3d 206, 210 (4th Cir. 2005). For mixed questions of law and fact, this same substantial evidence standard applies so long as the Board\u2019s legal interpretations are valid. <em>Id. </em>\u201cSubstantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. If such evidence exists, we must uphold the Board\u2019s decision even though we might have reached a different result had we heard the evidence in the first instance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted) (citations omitted). When the Board\u2019s findings of fact rest upon the ALJ\u2019s determinations of witness credibility, this court will defer to those determinations absent exceptional circumstances. <em>WXGI, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>243 F.3d 833, 842 (4th Cir.2001). \u201cExceptional circumstances include those instances when a credibility determination is unreasonable, contradicts other findings of fact, or is based on an inadequate reason or no reason at all.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-12\">With these principles in mind, we turn to the specific \u00a7 8(a) violations found by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-13\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-14\">The Board found that the Company violated \u00a7 8(a)(1), which makes it \u201can unfair labor practice for an employer ... to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section 7.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1) (1998). Specifically, the Board found the following \u00a7 8(a)(1) violations: (1) Penner\u2019s statement to Quackenbush and the three truck drivers threatened them with discharge if they went on strike; (2) Penner\u2019s statement to Quackenbush that he had heard that Quackenbush was trying to change the way things were done at the facility created the impression of surveillance among the employees; (3) Penner\u2019s statement to Scott to the effect that Scott had no union, no contract and no rights threatened futility in selecting union representation; and (4) Forrester\u2019s statement to Renew that he could be in trouble for having spent work time waiting for Forrester on January 16, 2001, threatened discipline for engaging in protected concerted activity.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>In assessing whether a \u00a7 8(a)(1) violation has occurred, we focus not on whether the employer\u2019s conduct was actually coercive but on whether, under the totality of the circumstances, that conduct reasonably may have tended to coerce or intimidate employees. <em>Medeco Sec. Locks v. NLRB, </em>142 F.3d 733, 745 (4th Cir.1998). Because of the Board\u2019s specialized experience in this area, we grant its assessment of whether conduct reasonably tends to coerce or intimidate employees considerable deference. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">We consider the Company\u2019s arguments regarding each of the violations found by the Board in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">With respect to Penner\u2019s statements to Quackenbush regarding firing strikers, the Company disputes Quackenbush\u2019s version of the events. Quackenbush stated that Penner informed him and others during a meeting that if employees went on strike, he \u201cwould fire all the strikers and just rehire.\u201d J.A. 428. According to Penner\u2019s testimony, during a safety meeting held on the shop floor, he responded to a specific question regarding what would happen in the event of a strike as follows: \u201c[W]e as a Company have an obligation to our customers to meet their needs, and if it actually came down to that, that we would be obligated to replace workers if needed.\u201d J.A. 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">In finding that Penner threatened to fire the employees if they went on strike, the ALJ credited the testimony of Quackenbush over that of Penner. This he was permitted to do, and because the record reveals no \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d that would lead us to disturb that credibility determination, we must defer to his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">The Company argues that such \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d do exist because the ALJ credited Quackenbush\u2019s testimony over that of Penner without explanation. This is incorrect. The ALJ had already stated that it did not find Penner to be a credible witness. J.A. 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">The Company complains that the ALJ based his credibility determination on a single incident, Penner\u2019s testimony that he could not specifically recall seeing Scott wearing a \u201cVote Yes\u201d button prior to the representation election, and argues that the ALJ should have \u201cengage[d] in individualized determinations regarding credibility as to each distinct issue.\u201d Respondent\u2019s Br. at 16. The Company misstates Penner\u2019s testimony, misrepresents the ALJ\u2019s findings and misapprehends the concept of credibility. Penner did not testify that he \u201ccould not specifically recall\u201d seeing Scott wear a \u201cVote Yes\u201d button, as suggested by the Company\u2019s brief. Rather, Penner testified that although he saw some employees wearing \u201cVote Yes\u201d buttons, Scott <em>never </em>wore such a button. J.A. 185, 224. Moreover, in finding that Penner lacked credibility as a witness, the ALJ cited more than his belief that Penner was not truthful with respect to that issue; he also noted that Penner appeared to be \u201creaching\u201d in an attempt to portray Scott as a poor employee. J.A. 427. Credibility is a witness-specific, not an issue-specific, characteristic. We can discern no reason why the ALJ should be required to ignore his perception that Penner had been untruthful at other points in his testimony in assessing Penner\u2019s veracity with respect to the events involving Quackenbush.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">Finally, the Company contends that the statement made by Penner was not unlawful. Citing <em>Grinnell Fire Prot. Sys. Co. v. NLRB, </em>236 F.3d 187, 201 (4th Cir.2000), the Company argues that it is legal to inform employees of an intention to hire permanent replacements in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>event of a strike. Thus, according to the Company, Penner\u2019s statement could not be considered coercive.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Although the Company\u2019s characterization is correct as far as it goes, the extent to which it is incomplete is made manifest by the very case on which it purports to rely. In <em>Grinnell, </em>the employer sent a letter to its employees informing them that it was implementing its final contract offer, and that in the event of a strike it would hire permanent replacement workers. <em>Id. </em>at 201 n. 16. The ALJ found, and this court agreed, that, because the strike was for unfair labor practices, Grinnell\u2019s letter was coercive because it implied that the employees could be replaced for engaging in protected activity. <em>Id. </em>at 201. Specifically, \u201cGrinnell\u2019s letter was threatening because it did not specify that Grinnell could hire permanent replacements <em>only in the event of an 'economic\u2019 strike.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Similarly here, we must affirm the Board\u2019s finding that Penner\u2019s statement was unlawful because, like the letter in <em>Grinnell, </em>it implied that the strikers could lose their jobs on a permanent basis without qualification. The statement failed to distinguish, as it must, between an \u201ceconomic\u201d strike, in which an employer can hire permanent replacements, and an \u201cunfair labor practice\u201d strike, in which the employees retain the right to reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">The Company next argues that, even accepting Quackenbush\u2019s version of the incident wherein Penner stated that he had heard Quackenbush was trying to change the way Penner was doing things in the facility as true, Penner\u2019s statement did not create an impression of surveillance. It contends that the ALJ\u2019s findings establish that Penner\u2019s information was not acquired through a campaign of union surveillance but from a truck driver who overheard Quackenbush\u2019s conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-11\">It is well established that a single conversation can violate \u00a7 8(a)(1) as long as that conversation gives an employee the impression that the employer has conducted surveillance of protected activities. <em>NLRB v. Grand Canyon Mining CVo., </em>116 F.3d 1039, 1045 (4th Cir.1997). \u201cThe employer\u2019s statements] need only contain sufficiently specific information to convey the impression that the employer or its agents has conducted union surveillance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1046. Here, Quackenbush and Wilson engaged in a private conversation about potential changes associated with the Union\u2019s presence. Penner\u2019s comments suggested that he was aware of the specific details of that conversation. The fact that the source of Penner\u2019s knowledge may have been another employee does not eliminate the impression of Company surveillance carried out indirectly through other employees acting on the Company\u2019s behalf. Given the considerable deference due the Board\u2019s assessment of whether conduct reasonably tends to coerce or intimidate employees, we affirm its finding on these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>3.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">The Company further disputes the sequence of events in the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact with respect to the conversation during which Penner told Scott \u201cyou do not have a Union. You don\u2019t have a contract and you have no rights.\u201d' As the Company would have it, when Scott told Penner that Penner had to do as the Union said, Penner\u2019s reply was to the effect that the presence of the Union would not alter Penner\u2019s position or responsibilities. At that point, Scott, claiming that he had a right to a witness, demanded that Quackenbush witness the conversation. Only then, according to the Company, did Penner tell Scott that Scott had no union, no contract and no rights. The Company argues, in other words, that Penner\u2019s statement was merely intended to inform Scott that, given the invalidity of the Union\u2019s election, Scott had no right to a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Even if we were to accept the Company\u2019s post-hoc version of the events, there is nothing in the record to suggest that Scott should have understood the meaning the Company now attributes to Penner\u2019s statements. The relevant question for the Board was not whether Penner was technically correct in asserting that Scott had no union, but whether, under the totality of the circumstances the statement reasonably may have tended to coerce or intimidate Scott. <em>See Medeco Sec. Locks, </em>142 F.3d at 745. The Board found that it did, and the Company proffers no compelling reason for us not to defer to this finding.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">4.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">The Company argues that Forrester\u2019s statement that Renew could be in trouble for having spent work time waiting for Forrester was lawful because there was no validly elected union at the facility. Again, the Company contends that the ALJ\u2019s finding of a \u00a7 8(a)(1) violation was based on the erroneous assumption that the Union had won the election. According to the Company, Renew was not threatened for engaging in a protected activity because the lack of a validly elected Union necessarily meant the lack of a grievance procedure or the right to grievance representatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">Substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s conclusion that Forrester\u2019s statement violated \u00a7 8(a)(1). As explained in Part II.A.3., the Board\u2019s finding of a \u00a7 8(a)(1) violation was not based on the assumption that the Union had won the election. In any event, the status of the Union at the time of Forrester\u2019s statement was irrelevant because the Act protects an employee\u2019s right to engage in \u201cconcerted activities,\u201d not \u201cunion activities.\u201d \u201c[T]he \u2018concerted activities\u2019 protected by the [A]ct are not limited to cases where the employees are acting through unions or are other<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>wise formally organized. It is sufficient that they are acting together for mutual aid or protection.\u201d <em>Joanna Cotton Mills Co. v. NLRB, </em>176 F.2d 749, 752 (4th Cir. 1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Although the Company characterizes Forrester\u2019s statement as a \u201creminder,\u201d it does not dispute the ALJ\u2019s finding that Forrester told Renew that Renew could be in trouble for having spent work time waiting for Forrester to arrive. Moreover, based on the testimony of both Forrester and Renew, Forrester made the statement in response to Renew's assertion that he was there to represent Scott. J.A. 133, 286. Under those circumstances, the evidence is adequate to support the Board\u2019s conclusion that the statement was a threat of discipline for engaging in a concerted activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">In addition to the \u00a7 8(a)(1) violations, the Board found that, by reducing Scott\u2019s work hours and discharging him, the Company had violated \u00a7 8(a)(3), which makes it \u201can unfair labor practice for an employer ... by discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization....\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(3) (1998). In doing so, the Board employed the following two-step, burden-shifting analysis proposed in <em>NLRB v. Wright Line, Inc., </em>662 F.2d 899 (1st Cir.1981), and approved by the Supreme Court in <em>NLRB v. Transportation Mgmt. Corp., </em>462 U.S. 393, 394, 103 S.Ct. 2469, 76 L.Ed.2d 667 (1983): First, the General Counsel bears the burden of making a prima facie case that antiunion animus motivated the employer\u2019s adverse employment action by showing \u201c(1) that the employee was engaged in protected activity, (2) that the employer was aware of the activity, and (3) that the activity was a substantial or motivating reason for the employer\u2019s action.\u201d <em>FPC Holdings, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>64 F.3d 935, 942 (4th Cir.1995). Then, if the General Counsel successfully makes a prima facie case, the employer may present the affirmative defense that it would have taken the same action even in the absence of the employee\u2019s engagement in the protected activity. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">The Company does not dispute that Scott engaged in protected activity but argues that the General Counsel failed to show the second and third prongs of the prima facie case, namely, that the Company was aware of Scott\u2019s activity, and that Scott\u2019s activity was a substantial or motivating reason for its actions. It also argues that, even assuming that the General Counsel had made a prima facie case, it proved that its actions were for legitimate business reasons. We consider each of these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">With respect to the Company\u2019s awareness of Scott\u2019s activities, it claims that there was no evidence that Penner saw Scott wearing a \u201cVote Yes\u201d button or knew what the button meant, and that Renew\u2019s allegation that he sent the Company a document naming Scott as a trustee of the Union was unsupported.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-12\">Again, the question of whether Penner saw the \u2018Vote Yes\u201d button is one of credibility. As we have set forth in detail, given the contradictions between the testimony of Penner, on the one hand, and that of Scott, Wilson and Renew, on the other, the ALJ made a facially legitimate credibility determination. On this record, we find no \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d that would compel us to reject the ALJ\u2019s decision to credit the testimony of Scott, Wilson and Renew over that of Penner.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>The Company\u2019s suggestion that Penner did not know what the \u201cVote Yes\u201d button meant is also without merit. The buttons were worn in the weeks leading up to a closely contested union election in a facility that had no union at that time. Penner conceded that he saw some employees wearing the buttons and specifically noted that \u201cMyron Renew wore his proudly.\u201d J.A. 224. Substantial relevant evidence exists in the record to support the conclusion that Penner saw Scott wearing the \u2018Vote Yes\u201d button and knew that the button was intended to support selection of the Union as the representative of the employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">Whether Renew sent the Company a document naming Scott as a trustee of the Union and caused that document to be posted on a Company bulletin board is also a question of witness credibility. The Board General Counsel introduced into evidence a document dated January 5, 2001 that identified the Union officers, including Scott. Renew testified that he had sent a copy of the document to Forrester on that date, and that another member of the Union had posted the document on the Company bulletin board. Forrester denied ever having seen the document. The ALJ credited Renew\u2019s testimony. Again, we find no \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d that compel us to reject that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Finally, the documented events leading up to Scott\u2019s discharge, including the exchange between Penner and Scott regarding the Union, Scott\u2019s request to have Renew represent him at the meeting with Penner, and Renew\u2019s interaction with Forrester, all belie the Company\u2019s assertion regarding Penner\u2019s lack of awareness of Scott\u2019s union involvement. To the contrary, this evidence supports the Board\u2019s finding that the Company was aware of Scott\u2019s engagement in a protected activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Substantial evidence also supports the Board\u2019s finding that Scott\u2019s engagement in a protected activity was a motivating reason for the reduction in Scott\u2019s work hours and his discharge in violation of \u00a7 8(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">\u201cMotive may be demonstrated by circumstantial as well as direct evidence and is a factual issue which the expertise of the Board is peculiarly suited to determine.\u201d <em>FPC </em>Holdings, 64 F.3d at 942 (internal quotation marks omitted) (citations omitted). Here, the ALJ cited the \u00a7 8(a)(1) violations as evidence of the Company\u2019s antiunion animus. Such violations may indeed be evidence of antiunion animus, even where the subject of the \u00a7 8(a)(3) violation is not the same individual as the subject of the \u00a7 8(a)(1) violation. <em>NLRB v. Grand Canyon Mining Co., </em>116 F.3d 1039, 1048 (4th Cir.1997). The timing of an adverse employee action can also support a finding of antiunion animus. <em>Id. </em>The Company discharged Scott the day after he and Penner had a heated discussion about the Union. And finally, Penner\u2019s statements and actions involving Renew, Wilson and Quackenbush, set forth above, also evince an antiunion animus supporting the Board\u2019s finding that Scott\u2019s engagement in a protected activity was a motivating reason for his reduction in hours and ultimate discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">Once the General Counsel makes a prima facie case that antiunion animus motivated the employer\u2019s decision to take the adverse employment action, the employer may present the affirmative defense that it would have taken the same employment action even absent antiunion animus. <em>Medeco Sec. Locks, </em>142 F.3d at 742. If the Board finds, however, that the employer\u2019s stated reason for taking the employment action is pretextual, \u201cwe must affirm the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Board if substantial evidence supports this factual determination.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Here, the Company alleges a litany of performance problems as the basis for the reduction in Scott\u2019s hours and his eventual discharge. Specifically, it alleges that Penner reduced Scott\u2019s hours because Scott failed to complete his work, including the work on the scraper, in a timely manner. The company also identifies four documented performance problems and testimony regarding other performance and disciplinary issues as support for its position that Scott\u2019s discharge was for legitimate reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s finding that the Company\u2019s stated reasons for reducing Scott\u2019s hours and discharging him were pretextual. The ALJ credited Scott\u2019s testimony that he had performed his work in the same manner both before and after the Union campaign, but was only penalized for his performance after the campaign. In doing so, the ALJ noted the lack of documentation to substantiate Penner\u2019s testimony concerning the deficiencies in Scott\u2019s performance on the scraper job. The ALJ also credited the testimony of Wilson, a former supervisor at the facility, that Scott was a good worker. Finally, the ALJ noted that Penner\u2019s threat that he was going to ruin Scott\u2019s lifestyle by reducing his hours was \u201cconsistent with a broader agenda than merely correcting an employee for working too slow.\u201d J.A. 429. This evidence is sufficient to support the Board\u2019s conclusion that antiunion animus motivated Penner\u2019s decision to reduce Scott\u2019s hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">The same evidence also supports the Board\u2019s finding of a violation with respect to Scott\u2019s discharge. Moreover, that discharge occurred in the wake of both a heated discussion about the Union between Penner and Scott, during which Penner told Scott that he had no union, no contract and no rights, and Forrester\u2019s threatening statement to Renew concerning potentially being in trouble for waiting to represent Scott. According to even Forrester\u2019s testimony, Scott was subsequently discharged without being asked for an explanation of his side of the incident that led to the discharge, in apparent violation of Company policy. Finally, the four documented performance problems referred to by the Company occurred over a twenty-month period, with the last documented incident occurring approximately six months before Scott\u2019s discharge. On this record, we are constrained to uphold the Board\u2019s Decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we grant the Board\u2019s application for enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">\n<em>APPLICATION FOR ENFORCEMENT GRANTED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b182-6\">. The Company filed objections to the election with the Board. <em>Kentucky Tenn. Clay Co., 295 </em>F.3d at 439. The Board overruled the objections and certified the Union as the collective bargaining representative. <em>Id. </em>at 440. In response, the Company refused to recognize and bargain with the Union, prompting the Board to order the Company to do so and to apply for enforcement of that Order with this court. <em>Id. </em>Finding that the Company\u2019s objections were meritorious, this court set aside the Board\u2019s Order and denied enforcement of it. <em>Id. </em>at 446.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b182-7\">. When the ALJ issued his decision, this court had not yet invalidated the election.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b182-8\">. The ALJ based his findings that the Company had violated \u00a7\u00a7 8(a)(1) and (3), in part, on the Company's antiunion animus as demonstrated by a \u00a7 8(a)(5) violation, namely, its refusal to recognize and bargain with the Union. The Company argues that the ALJ\u2019s finding of antiunion animus is too interwoven with that reversed finding of a \u00a7 8(a)(5) violation to be severable. Therefore, according to the Company, the \u00a7 8(a)(1) and (3) violations must be reversed as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-12\">We are unpersuaded by this argument. In making its findings, the Board acknowledged this court's decision to set aside certification of the Union. Based on that decision, the Board reversed the ALJ\u2019s finding that the Company had violated the Act by refusing to recognize or bargain with the Union. The Board neither adopted nor relied on that finding as evidence of antiunion animus for the purpose of establishing violations of \u00a7\u00a7 8(a)(1) and (3). Nor do we. In reviewing the Board\u2019s determination, we do not consider the Company's refusal to recognize or bargain with the Union at all. As discussed below, based on the record before us and the Company\u2019s virtually exclusive reliance for its arguments on the testimony of a single, discredited witness, we conclude that substantial evidence exists to support the Board\u2019s findings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b183-8\">. By this time, the Company\u2019s objections to the representation election were pending before the NLRB.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b185-8\">. Section 7 guarantees employees \"the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection....\" 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b185-15\">. The Company argues that none of these statements violated \u00a7 8(a)(1) because, it contends, none of them were motivated by anti-union animus. This averment does not support its denial of the violations because \"[u]nlike violations of \u00a7 8(a)(3), an employer\u2019s antiunion motivation is not a required element of \u00a7 8(a)(1).\u201d <em>Medeco Sec.

Strike activity not initiated in response to an unfair labor practice constitutes an economic strike. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b188-6\">. The Company also seems to argue that Penner did not make the statement attributed to him. It complains that the ALJ failed to explain why he disregarded Penner\u2019s denial that he threatened futility, relying instead on the testimony of Scott, Quackenbush and Wilson. It further points out that both Quackenbush and Wilson admitted that they did not hear the entire conversation, and that Quackenbush\u2019s testimony conflicted with that of Wilson.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">This argument as well founders on the shoals of Penner's credibility. The ALJ could and did reasonably rely on the testimony of Scott, as corroborated by Quackenbush and Wilson. It does not matter that the two did not hear the entire conversation; they generally consistently corroborated Scott\u2019s account of the relevant portion. Moreover, the Company points to nothing in the record to suggest that Penner denied making the statement in question. In fact, Penner was never asked about the statement. He merely denied that he threatened futility. The Company posits no exceptional circumstances that would justify disregarding the ALJ\u2019s credibility determination in this regard.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
