Pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 43(c)(2), Attorney General Alberto R.

DeFonzo\u2019s opinion denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-20\">Where, as here, the BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ without issuing an opinion, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 n. 7 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-21\">Here, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. The IJ reasonably found that Jusic was inconsistent in his statements concerning how many times Serbian police came to his home to coerce him into serving in the military because he stated (1) in his asylum application that the police searched for him once, (2) in his testimony on direct examination that the police searched for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>him twice, and (3) in his asylum interview and cross-examination testimony that they searched for him three times. Additionally, we find that the IJ reasonably relied on inconsistencies between Jusic\u2019s testimony and a letter of support from one of his relatives, a discrepancy conc\u00e9rning Jusic\u2019s military service, contradictions between Jusic\u2019s testimony and the State Department report concerning treatment of Muslims in Serbia and Montenegro, and Jusic\u2019s lack of credible corroborating evidence. The reasons identified by the IJ to support the adverse credibility determination are cogent and specific, and a reasonable adjudicator would not be compelled to overturn them.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">We further find that the IJ properly and expressly prevented the government\u2019s attorney from impeaching Jusic\u2019s testimony with the transcript of his asylum interview because it was not admitted into evidence. The IJ nevertheless reasonably relied on Jusic\u2019s admission that he made inconsistent statements at his asylum interview. The IJ also did not err in rejecting Jusic\u2019s explanation that he purposefully omitted relevant information from his testimony because he had no physical proof of it and because he could not remember the exact details of the events.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">Finally, while Jusic claims the IJ erred in referring exclusively to the adverse credibility determination in denying his CAT claim, Jusic \u201chas presented insufficient evidence independent of [his] own testimony to satisfy his burden under the CAT. Accordingly, as [Jusic\u2019s] testimony was not credible, and that testimony was crucial to [his] CAT claim, [he] is not entitled to CAT relief.\u201d <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>434 F.3d 144, 163 n. 18 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. The pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
