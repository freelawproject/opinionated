Campbell also submitted an application to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>but failed to disclose that he previously had accumulated \u201cthree strikes\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). The omission was not overlooked by the district court, which denied pauper status and dismissed Campbell\u2019s complaint on the ground that he perpetrated a fraud upon the court by failing to reveal the strikes. Campbell appeals, and although he concedes prior knowledge of his strikes, he argues that the failure to disclose them was not in bad faith because, he says, he always \u201cintended to pay the filing fee\u201d and \u201conly filed the application to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>to have the case docketed\u201d before the statute of limitations ran on his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">A prisoner cannot \u201cbring a civil action\u201d <em>in forma pauperis </em>if he has \u201con 3 or more prior occasions, while incarcerated or detained in any facility, brought an action ... that was dismissed on the grounds that it is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, unless the prisoner is under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g); <em>see Kalinowski v. Bond, </em>358 F.3d 978, 979 (7th Cir.2004); <em>Ciarpaglini v. Saini </em>352 F.3d 328, 329 (7th Cir.2003). Twice before district courts had told Campbell he had accumulated three strikes and would have to pay the filing fee in full before bringing future actions unless he was threatened with imminent physical danger. <em>Campbell v. O\u2019Brien, </em>No. 04 C 7545 (N.D.ILL. Feb.1, 2005) (unpublished order); <em>Jones-el v. Berge, </em>No. 00-C-421-C, 2002 WL 32362655, at *2, 5 (WD.Wis. Sept.18, 2002) (unpublished order). And where a prisoner seeks to obtain pauper status after a federal judge has warned that \u00a7 1915(g) applies to him, his suit will be terminated immediately; it does not matter that the prisoner intends to pay the filing fee at a later date, that he filed solely to prevent the statute of limitations from running on his claim, or that he is proceeding <em>pro se. See Sloan v. Lesza, </em>181 F.3d 857, 858-59 (7th Cir.1999). The very fact that Campbell admits consciously failing to inform the district court of his three strikes in order \u201cto have the case docketed\u201d demonstrates that he intended to pull the wool over the court\u2019s eyes regarding the applicability of \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
