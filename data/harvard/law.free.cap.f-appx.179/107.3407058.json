We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The agency reasonably concluded that Wang \u2014 who was detained for four days\u2014 did not suffer persecution. <em>See, e.g., Yuan v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Just, </em>416 F.3d 192, 195 (2d Cir.2005). Likewise, the agency reasonably concluded that Wang lacked a well-grounded fear of future persecution. Wang grounds her fear of future persecution entirely on the idea that the authorities are still interested in pursuing Wang\u2019s .brother. The IJ found that there was \u201cno indication whatsoever that any family member [of Wang\u2019s] has been harmed in any way since her departure from China,\u201d and that the lack of any such evidence indicated that the authorities had lost interest in pursuing Wang\u2019s brother. Wang has provided no evidence of that continued interest in her brother or her family, either to the BIA or to this Court. Absent any evidence objectively establishing a well-grounded fear of future persecution, Wang\u2019s applications were correctly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, the pending stay of removal is VACATED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
