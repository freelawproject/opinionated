We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in these consolidated cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-12\">When the BIA adopts and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271-72 (2d Cir.2005). This Court reviews the IJ\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Jin Hui Gao v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>400 F.3d 963, 964 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-14\">The adverse credibility finding in this case was not supported by substantial evidence. First, the record does not support the IJ\u2019s finding that it was not clear how Liu knew that the village cadres had visited his home because his parents practiced Falun Gong or \u201cwhether there was a conversation between him and the officials\u201d before he asked them \u201cwhat was wrong with [his] parents practicing Falun Gong.\u201d In his written application, Liu stated that he angrily asked the cadres \u201cwhat had happened,\u201d and the leader told him that \u201csomebody reported that [his] parents continued practicing Falungong [sic] at home.\u201d Moreover, while the IJ did not express any difficulties in hearing or understanding Liu\u2019s testimony, the transcript reveals that Liu\u2019s testimony was \u201cindiscernible\u201d during key moments throughout the hearing, including with respect to Liu\u2019s confrontation with the village cadres. Because of this, we cannot adequately complete our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-15\">Second, the IJ\u2019s finding that Liu \u201cdid not provide much detail\u201d about the events that transpired in China is similarly problematic. The IJ identified only one example of this deficiency \u2014 that Liu provided \u201cno details whatsoever\u201d about how he escaped the cadres. The transcript indicates that Liu testified \u201c(indiscernible) then a friend of mine came over trying to block the (indiscernible) and I was able to run away.\u201d However, even if Liu\u2019s testimony here was \u201csparse,\u201d thus leading the IJ to wonder whether it had been fabricated, the IJ and Government counsel could have \u201cprobe[d] for incidental details, seeking to draw out inconsistencies that would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>support a finding of lack of credibility.\u201d <em>Jin Shui Qiu v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 140, 152 (2d Cir.2003). Here, neither the IJ nor the Government questioned Liu further on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">Third, the IJ erred in other respects. The IJ improperly faulted Liu for failing to provide medical evidence that he had been beaten, when Liu never stated that he had sought such medical attention. The IJ unreasonably faulted Liu for failing to provide an answer for why his summons did not mention the \u201cassault\u201d on the official when it was not logical to expect Liu to explain why a legal notice directing him to appear at a police station would omit certain information. The IJ also failed to discuss how the finding that Liu\u2019s parents have remained in China without having been persecuted by the Chinese government impacted Liu\u2019s credibility, inasmuch as the parents indicated that they avoided persecution only by continually relocating.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Further, while the IJ accurately observed that Liu did not mention the struggle with the village cadres in his airport statement, this omission, when measured against the entire record, <em>see Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 308, (2d Cir.2003), is not fatal because the crux of Liu\u2019s claim is that his parents had been sought by the Chinese government due to their practice of Falun Gong; the Chinese authorities imputed the political opinion of Liu\u2019s parents to him; and he resisted the authorities\u2019 efforts to locate his parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Because Lin failed to raise the issue of CAT relief on appeal to the BIA, this Court lacks jurisdiction to review this claim. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d); <em>Theodoropoulos v. INS, </em>358 F.3d 162 (2d Cir.2004) (holding that where exhaustion is required, a court must dismiss any unexhausted claim for lack of jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is GRANTED, the decision of the BIA is VACATED with respect to the asylum and withholding of removal claims, and the decision REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this decision. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2) and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
