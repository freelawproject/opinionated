He is a member of a prominent and wealthy family in his home village of Mahaniya. He testified that in January 2004, Maoist rebels arrived at his home and demanded 200,000 rupees. Yadav refused and the rebels threatened him with death. Two days after this incident, the Maoist rebels returned to his home to look for Yadav, but Yadav was not there. The rebels again threatened to kill Yadav and left. Yadav fled the town and ultimately arrived in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-16\">The IJ denied Yadav\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT protection. The IJ found that Yadav had not met his burden of proof to show that he had been persecuted on account of one of the five grounds enumerated in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). Rather, the IJ found that the Maoist rebels had targeted Yadav for extortion because of Yadav\u2019s wealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-17\">The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion and Yadav filed a petition for review in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-18\">When the BIA issues an affirmance without opinion, as it did here, we review the IJ\u2019s opinion as the decision of the agency. <em>Smriko v. Ashcroft, </em>387 F.3d 279, 282 (3d Cir.2004). We review its legal determinations <em>de novo, </em>subject to established principles of deference. <em>Id. </em>We review the agency\u2019s findings of fact for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>substantial evidence and ask whether a reasonable fact finder could make the finding on the basis of the administrative record. <em>Dia v. Ashcroft, </em>353 F.3d 228, 249 (3d Cir.2003). We may only overturn factual findings if \u201cany reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">\u201c[T]o be eligible for asylum in the United States as a refugee, an alien must demonstrate \u2018persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u2019\u201d <em>Abdille v. Ashcroft, </em>242 F.3d 477, 492 (3d Cir.2001) (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A)). \u201cThe well-founded fear standard has a subjective and an objective component. The alien must show that \u2018he has a subjective fear of persecution that is supported by objective evidence that persecution is a reasonable possibility.\u2019 \u201d <em>Balasubramanrim v. I.N.S., </em>143 F.3d 157, 165 (3d Cir.1998) (citation omitted). Similarly, to be eligible for \u201cwithholding of removal\u201d an alien must demonstrate that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he will be persecuted upon returning to his home country. <em>I.N.S. v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 423, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). The \u201cmore likely than not\u201d standard for withholding of removal is more stringent than the \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d standard required for asylum. <em>Janusiak v. INS, </em>947 F.2d 46, 47 (3d Cir. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Yadav argues that, contrary to the IJ\u2019s finding, he was targeted for extortion and threats by Maoist rebels on account of imputed political opinion and/or imputed social group. In particular, Yadav argues that the Maoist rebels targeted him because they imputed to Yadav, based on Yadav\u2019s wealth and standing in the community, an anti-Maoist capitalist political opinion, as well as membership in a social group consisting of \u201cwealthy landowner[s] with social influence in the community.\u201d Petr.\u2019s Br. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">The IJ\u2019s determination that the rebels targeted Yadav merely because of his wealth is supported by substantial evidence. Indeed, very little in the record suggests otherwise. While it is perhaps plausible that the rebels believed Yadav to hold anti-Maoist capitalist views in light of Yadav\u2019s wealth, it was eminently reasonable for the IJ to conclude, based on Yadav\u2019s testimony, that the rebels demanded money from Yadav merely because they believed him to have money. Moreover, the \u201cparticular social group\u201d Yadav identifies, wealthy landowners with social influence, is not a \u201csocial group\u201d under our prior caselaw. <em>See Lukwago v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 157,171 (3d Cir.2003) (accepting\u2019s BIA\u2019s construction of \u201cparticular social group\u201d to refer to \u201ca group of persons all of whom share a common, immutable characteristic\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">Accordingly, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Yadav was not subject to past persecution on account of a protected ground and did not have a well-founded fear of future persecution. It follows that Yadav is ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">The petition for review will be denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b160-13\">.

No. 105-277, \u00a7 2242, 112 Stat. 2681-761 (codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231). Yadav has not addressed his entitlement to relief under the CAT in his briefing. Accordingly, that claim is waived.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
