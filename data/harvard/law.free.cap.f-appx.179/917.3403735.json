The Government asserts that Ramirez does not have standing to bring a facial challenge to the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b) because Ramirez\u2019s prior aggravated-felony conviction was, in fact, alleged in his indictment and admitted by him at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>the rearraignment, and thus Ramirez suffered no violation of his Sixth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">\u201cThe primary component of standing is that the litigant seeking action by the court have an injury in fact resulting from the action which they seek to have the court adjudicate.\u201d <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>920 F.2d 1225, 1229 (5th Cir.1991) (internal quotations and citations omitted). The standing requirement ordinarily is satisfied when the person challenging a criminal statute\u2019s constitutionality has been prosecuted under the statute. <em>Cf. Johnson v. City of Dallas, </em>61 F.3d 442, 444 (5th Cir.1995) (plaintiffs not convicted under ordinance lacked standing to challenge the ordinance).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">Ramirez was prosecuted and sentenced under \u00a7 1326(b). Accordingly, we reject the Government\u2019s assertion that Ramirez lacks standing to raise a facial challenge to \u00a7 1326(b). Because Ramirez concedes that he is not asserting an as-applied challenge to \u00a7 1326(b), we do not address the Government\u2019s assertion that any such challenge is barred by Ramirez\u2019s unconditional guilty plea and by the appeal-waiver provision of Ramirez\u2019s plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-7\">Ramirez\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Ramirez contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014\u2014 U.S. \u2014\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Ramirez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b943-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
