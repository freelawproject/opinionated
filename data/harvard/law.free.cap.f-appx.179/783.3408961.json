Lynch, of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b809-23\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b809-24\">Franz St. Michael Osbourne petitions for review of a December 11, 2002, BIA order affirming the December 11, 2000, oral decision of an IJ, finding, <em>inter alia, </em>that Osbourne had not \u201cresided in the United States continuously for 7 years after having been admitted in any status\u201d and was therefore ineligible for cancellation of removal under INA \u00a7 240A, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-25\">Osbourne argues that he should have been able to tack on his time from 1989 to 1991 as an \u201calien crewman\u201d to reach a total of seven years continuous residence. As the BIA noted, however, INA \u00a7 101(a)(13)(B) specifically directs that \u201can alien ... permitted to land temporarily as an alien crewman, shall not be considered to have been admitted.\u201d Osbourne\u2019s residence after having landed as an alien crewman cannot therefore qualify as a period of residence \u201cafter having been <em>admitted in any status\u201d </em>for purposes of relief under section 240A. (emphasis added). <em>See also </em>INA \u00a7 240A(c) (providing that \u201c[t]he provisions of subsections (a) and (b)(1) [providing for cancellation of removal] shall not apply to ... an alien who entered the United States as a crewman subsequent to June 30,1964.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-26\">Osbourne also argues that the \u201cclock stopping\u201d provisions of the Illegal Immi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>gration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, <em>see </em>INA \u00a7 240A(d)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(1), were given an impermissible retroactive application in his case. Even if it were impermissible to apply the clock stopping provisions retroactively in some cases, <em>compare Henry v. Ashcroft, </em>175 F.Supp.2d 688 (S.D.N.Y.2001) <em>with Arenas-Yepes v. Gonzales, </em>421 F.3d 111, 117 (2d Cir.2005), there was no retroactive application in Osbourne\u2019s case because he pleaded guilty on April 30, 1997, after the Act had gone into effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">Osbourne also challenges the BIA\u2019s resolution of his case by a one-person summary order. Assuming that we have jurisdiction to review such a claim, we cannot conclude that the streamlined procedures were inappropriate in Osbourne\u2019s case. <em>See Yu Sheng Zhang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>362 F.3d 155, 156-59 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is hereby DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
