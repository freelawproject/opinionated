Li asserts he is eligible for asylum and withholding of removal under the INA because he has presented credible testimony about his fear of being sterilized if returned to China. Li also asserts the IJ erred in finding him ineligible for CAT relief because he would be tortured if returned to China by being forced to undergo sterilization. We deny Li\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">I. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">\u2018We review only the [BIA\u2019s] decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir. 2001). \u201cInsofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, because the BIA expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the IJ\u2019s decision and the BIA\u2019s. <em>See id. </em>To the extent the decisions were based on a legal determination, review is de novo. <em>Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247-48 (11th Cir.2001). Factual determinations, however, are reviewed under the \u201chighly deferential substantial evidence test,\u201d which requires us to \u201cview the record in the light most favorable to the [IJ]\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1026-27 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en banc), cert, denied, </em>544 U.S. 1035, 125 S.Ct. 2245, 161 L.Ed.2d 1063 (2005). We \u201cmust affirm the [IJ\u2019s] decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284 (quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">B. <em>Asylum and Withholding of Removal</em></p>\n<p id=\"An2\">An alien who arrives in, or is present in, the United States may apply for asylum. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General both have the discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A) (as amended by the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231, 302). A \u201crefugee\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-10\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-11\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). Under the coercive population provision of the INA, an applicant may establish \u201cpast persecution\u201d on account of political opinion if the applicant (1) has been forced to undergo involuntary sterilization, (2) has been persecuted for failure or refusal to undergo forced sterilization, or (3) has been persecuted for \u201cother resistance\u201d to a coercive population control program. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-12\">The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. 8 C. F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a). To establish asylum eligibility, the alien must, with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that the statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1), (2). To show he has a well-founded fear of future persecution, an alien must demonstrate (1) he fears persecution based a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>protected ground, (2) there is a reasonable possibility he will suffer persecution if removed to his native country, and (3) he is unable or unwilling to return to that country because of such fear. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">An IJ may grant withholding of removal if the IJ decides that if returned to his country the alien\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). Because this standard is more stringent than the \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d standard for asylum, if an applicant is unable to meet the \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d standard for asylum, he is generally precluded from qualifying for either asylum or withholding of removal. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Here, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Li failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution based on his political opinion. As the IJ pointed out generally, Li\u2019s testimony is not supported by the U.S. State Department\u2019s 1998 Profile of Asylum Claims and Country Conditions for China, included in the record. Furthermore, as the IJ and the BIA explained, Li has not established that any persecution he may have suffered in China was on account of his political opinion and not because of an inter-family dispute or vendetta. Finally, with respect to Li\u2019s claim he has a well-founded fear of future persecution, as the IJ noted, Li has not demonstrated he would be harmed or sterilized if he returned to China. Therefore, we deny Li\u2019s petition as to asylum and withholding of removal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">C. <em>CAT Relief</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">In order to obtain relief under the CAT, the burden is on the applicant to establish it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d he will be tortured in the country of removal. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2). \u201cTo demonstrate eligibility for CAT protection, an applicant must show that it is more likely than not that [he] will be tortured in [his] home country at the hands of [his] government or that [his] government will acquiesce in the torture.\u201d <em>Sanchez v. U.S. Attorney General, </em>392 F.3d 434, 438 (2004). CAT relief carries a higher legal standard than asylum, and thus is very difficult to meet. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1303.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">Li has not shown it is more likely than not he would be tortured by officials working with the consent or acquiescence of the Chinese government. Li stated family planning officials pursued him during the months immediately following his wedding, but he has not demonstrated the government would torture him upon his return to China, or that officials would continue to pursue him in any way. Accordingly, Li did not demonstrate his eligibility for relief under the CAT, and we deny the petition as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b637-12\">Substantial evidence supports the denial of asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-13\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b637-7\">. Although Li asserts the IJ erred in making an adverse credibility finding against him, we do not need to address this argument because the Government acknowledges the BIA essentially conceded the credibility issue to Li. Furthermore, even if we assume the IJ erred in adversely assessing Li's credibility, Li\u2019s claim for relief nonetheless fails because he did not meet his burden of proof regarding his eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal, as discussed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
