The Flowers also challenge various discovery and other procedural rulings made by the district court. We affirm the challenged rulings and deny the Flowers\u2019 two pending motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-20\">1. The Flowers argue that the district court erred in dismissing their claims brought pursuant to the Right to Financial Privacy Act (\u201cRFPA\u201d), 12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3401 <em>et seq., </em>against the federal defendants. The district court based its dismissal on the doctrine enunciated in <em>Feres v. United States, </em>340 U.S. 135, 146, 71 S.Ct. 153, 95 L.Ed. 152 (1950), which held that service members cannot sue the government for injuries that \u201carise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service.\u201d We must determine whether the district court had subject-matter jurisdiction over the Flowers\u2019 RFPA claims against the federal defendants. <em>See Dreier v. United States, </em>106 F.3d 844, 847 (9th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>Cir.1996) (\u201cA motion to dismiss pursuant to the <em>Feres </em>doctrine is properly treated as a Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction[.]\u201d). We review de novo whether the <em>Feres </em>doctrine applies to the facts in the record. <em>Wilkins v. United States, </em>279 F.3d 782, 785 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">The district court concluded that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Feres </em>bars the Flowers\u2019 claims against the federal defendants because those claims would require a civilian court to examine decisions regarding management, discipline, supervision, and control of members of the armed forces of the United States. This conclusion is in accord with our case law, which \u201cbroadly construe[s]\u201d <em>Feres </em>\u201cto immunize the United States and members of the military from <em>any </em>suit which may intrude in military affairs, second-guess[ ] military decisions, or impair[] military discipline.\u201d <em>Zaputil v. Cowgill, </em>335 F.3d 885, 887 (9th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis and alterations in original). Accordingly, the district court properly dismissed the Flowers\u2019 RFPA claims against the federal defendants because those claims implicate the concerns that lie at the heart of the <em>Feres </em>doctrine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Feres, </em>340 U.S. at 146, 71 S.Ct. 153; <em>see also United States v. Johnson, </em>481 U.S. 681, 691, 107 S.Ct. 2063, 95 L.Ed.2d 648 (1987) (\u201c[A] suit based upon service-related activity necessarily implicates the military judgments and decisions that are inextricably intertwined with the conduct of the military mission.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">2. The Flowers also argue that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the bank and credit union. We review a grant of summary judgment de novo and may affirm on any basis presented in the record, construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Lopez v. Smith, </em>203 F.3d 1122, 1131 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc). A grant of summary judgment is appropriate only where the moving party has demonstrated that there is no genuine issue of material fact. <em>Id.; </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). Once the moving party demonstrates the absence of a genuine issue of material fact, the nonmoving party that bears the ultimate burden at trial must show that there is evidence creating a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 323-25, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-9\">The record shows that the Flowers failed to produce or cite any evidence to establish a genuine issue of material fact sufficient to overcome summary judgment. The record establishes that the credit union is not hable under the RFPA because the subpoena issued to the credit union satisfies an exception to liability under 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 3413(e).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There is also no indication that the Flowers are entitled to compensatory or punitive damages as the record evidence provides no connection between the conduct of the bank or the credit union and the Flowers\u2019 claimed damages, and nothing suggests that the bank or the credit union acted willfully or intentionally to violate the Flowers\u2019 rights under the RFPA. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 3417(a)(3). Furthermore, the Flowers\u2019 tort claims against the credit union lack any evidentia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>ry support in the record. We must therefore conclude that the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to the bank and the credit union.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">3. The Flowers next contend that the district court abused its discretion in denying their Rule 59(e) motion for reconsideration and in making various discovery and procedural rulings. The district court did not abuse its discretion because the motion failed to set forth any of the allowable grounds for reconsideration. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e). As to the Flowers\u2019 argument that the district court should have permitted them to amend their complaint a third time in order to add a claim challenging the military\u2019s search of their residence under the Fourth Amendment, we agree with the district court that such an amendment would have been futile because the proposed claim appears to be barred by the <em>Feres </em>doctrine based on the same rationale precluding subject-matter jurisdiction over the Flowers\u2019 other claims against the federal defendants. <em>See Newland v. Dalton, </em>81 F.3d 904, 907 (9th Cir. 1996) (holding that \u201cdistrict courts need not accommodate futile amendments\u201d). Further, the Flowers\u2019 objection to the withdrawal of their counsel, attorney Brown, is in vain because the record reveals that the Flowers fired Brown. We have considered the Flowers\u2019 remaining miscellaneous contentions \u2014 including the Flowers\u2019 assertion that the district court improperly considered exhibits that the bank submitted in support of its summary-judgment motion and the Flowers\u2019 challenge to a number of the district court\u2019s discovery rulings \u2014 and we conclude that they are also without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">4. Finally, we deny the Flowers\u2019 motions to strike the federal defendants\u2019 answering brief and to compel government counsel\u2019s compliance with the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. The first motion is founded on the false premise that the Department of Justice is not permitted to represent the federal defendants on appeal. While the second motion notes an apparent failure by government counsel to comply with certain procedural rules for serving documents on opposing parties, the Flowers have not demonstrated any injury or prejudice resulting therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-9\">$ 5j{ \u00edj\u00ed # &amp;</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-10\">For all of the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s decisions are AFFIRMED and the pending motions are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b1013-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1014-6\">. Our determination that <em>Feres </em>forecloses subject-matter jurisdiction over the RFPA claims directed at the federal defendants renders moot the Flowers\u2019 challenge to the district court\u2019s denial of their request for additional discovery from Army officials.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1014-10\">. The protections of the RFPA do not \"apply when financial records are sought by a Government authority under the Federal Rules of Civil or Criminal Procedure or comparable rules of other courts in connection with litigation to which the Government authority and the customer are parties.\u201d 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 3413(e).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
