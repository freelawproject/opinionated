He argues that (1) the Government violated the plea agreement, (2) the district court clearly erred in imposing a four-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(1)(B) (2003), and (3) the district court\u2019s non-Guideline sentence was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>We review de novo whether the Government\u2019s conduct violated the terms of the plea agreement, <em>United States v. Saling, </em>205 F.3d 764, 766 (5th Cir.2000), and hold that the Government\u2019s conduct was consistent with the parties\u2019 reasonable understanding of the agreement\u2019s upward-departure notice provision. <em>See United States v. Wilder, </em>15 F.3d 1292, 1295 (5th Cir.1994). Satti\u2019s breach argument therefore fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">Reviewing the district court's \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(1)(B) enhancement for clear error, <em>United States v. Creech, </em>408 F.3d 264, 270 n. 2 (5th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 777, 163 L.Ed.2d 602 (2005), we hold that the district court\u2019s finding that Satti unlawfully sought to obtain between eight and twenty-four firearms was plausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(1)(B), comment. (n.9); <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>274 F.3d 230, 238 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Finally, the district court followed the proper procedure for imposing a non-Guideline sentence, and its fact-specific reasons were consistent with the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707 (5th Cir.2006). The length of time that Satti had been illegally residing in this country at the time of the offense, his desire to obtain numerous silencers \u201cin the near future,\u201d and his desire to obtain C-4 explosives were not facts taken into account under the Guidelines. Therefore, his sentence did not produce an unwarranted disparity and was not unreasonable. <em>See id. </em>at 709.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b261-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
