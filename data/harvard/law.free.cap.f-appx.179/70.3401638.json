Daniels, United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b97-19\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b97-20\">Defendant Joseph Rovetto (\u201cRovetto\u201d) pled guilty pursuant to a plea agreement to a two-count information charging him with violating the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951, in connection with a conspiracy to extort the principal owner of Hotline Delivery Service and harboring a fugitive in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1071 and 2. The district court sentenced Rovetto principally to a term of imprisonment of twelve months and one day. It further imposed restitution in the amount of $750,000. Rovetto now appeals his sentence and the imposition of restitution. We assume the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts of the case and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Rovetto contends that the district court erred in imposing his sentence by not making clear whether it was a guidelines or non-guidelines sentence, failing to specify the applicable guidelines range or enumerate the factors a sentencing court must consider under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8553(a). Rovetto did not object at sentencing and therefore we review his claim for plain error under Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b). <em>United States v. Vaval, </em>404 F.3d 144, 151 (2d Cir.2005). The district court considered the pre-sentence report, which set forth a guideline range of 41-51 months, asked whether the defendant had any objection to it, and, finding none, made it part of the record. The court noted further that the \u201cguidelines would provide a sentence of several years,\u201d considered the government\u2019s letter pursuant to Section 5K1.1 of the guidelines, \u201call the factors that are appropriate i[n] a sentencing proceeding,\u201d as well as the \u201cdefendant\u2019s personal background, the facts of the crime, the extent of his cooperation and his present circumstances.\u201d The court then stated that it was departing on the basis of Rovetto\u2019s substantial assistance. We have never required a formulaic recitation of the applicable factors to be considered in sentencing, <em>United States v. Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103, 113 (2d Cir.2005), and, given the district court\u2019s explanation of what it considered, there was no error here, much less plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">We reject also Rovetto\u2019s contention that the imposition of restitution pursuant to the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A, violates his rights under the Sixth Amendment. <em>See United States v. Reifler, </em>\u2014 F.3d-, 2006 WL 999937, at *53-54 (2d Cir. Apr.18, 2006) (holding that an order of restitution for a loss amount not admitted in a plea allocution does not violate a defendant\u2019s rights under the Sixth Amendment as enunciated in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005)).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
