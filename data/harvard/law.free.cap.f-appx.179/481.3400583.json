ANDERSON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b507-23\">After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-24\">Defendant-Appellant Gerardo Ruben Salgado-Hernandez, a native and citizen of Honduras, pled guilty to one count of illegal reentry by an alien who had been previously deported subsequent to a conviction for an aggravated felony, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2). He was sentenced to forty-six months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by a three-year term of supervised release. Salgado-Hernandez <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>appealed that sentence to this court, and we remanded for resentencing in accordance with the Supreme Court\u2019s recently-issued decision in <em>United, States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). On October 31, 2005, the district court held a resentencing hearing and imposed the same sentence of forty-six months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by three years of supervised release. Salgado-Hernandez appeals again, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Salgado-Hernandez initially illegally entered the United States in 1992. He pled guilty in Texas in early 2000 to aggravated sexual assault on a child. He was deported on May 31, 2001. On July 26, 2004, Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201cBICE\u201d) agents took SalgadoHernandez into custody in Kansas City, Kansas, and determined he lacked authorization to reenter and remain in the United States after his prior deportation. He was accordingly indicted for illegal reentry following deportation for conviction of an aggravated felony, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2). Salgado-Hernandez thereafter pled guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">In preparation for sentencing, the probation office prepared a presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d). The PSR calculated a base offense level of eight, as required in the United States Sentencing Commission, <em>Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d), \u00a7 2L1.2(a) (Nov. 2004), for a violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2). It then increased that level by sixteen, pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii), because Salgado-Hernandez\u2019s prior felony conviction for aggravated sexual assault on a child was a conviction for a crime of violence. After a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, Salgado-Hernandez\u2019s total adjusted offense level was twenty-one. With a criminal history category of III, the PSR recommended a Guideline sentencing range of forty-six to fifty-seven months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">At his initial sentencing hearing, Salgado-Hernandez objected to the Guideline range calculated in the PSR, particularly the sixteen-level enhancement based upon the characterization of his aggravated sexual assault on a child as a crime of violence. The district court nonetheless sentenced Salgado-Hernandez to the low end of that Guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">On resentencing following our remand, Salgado-Hernandez argued that the application of the sixteen-level enhancement was <em>per se </em>unreasonable. He also argued that his sentence was unreasonable compared to the lesser sentences available to other illegal aliens sentenced in districts with \u201cfast-track\u201d programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">The court on resentencing acknowledged that there had been no addenda to the initial PSR, which the court then incorporated into the record. The court then addressed the arguments raised by Salgado-Hernandez and rejected his argument that the disparities caused by the existence of \u201cfast-track\u201d districts warranted a lower sentence in this case. Regarding the reasonableness of the forty-six month sentence originally imposed, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnE\">I do believe the original sentence I gave in this case of 46 months is a reasonable sentence. I think it\u2019s so for these reasons, not simply because the guideline application would suggest that it\u2019s a reasonable sentence, but rather because of the aspects of the sentencing statute when analyzed in connection with the facts of this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-11\">Tr. of Resentencing at 19, R. Vol. IV. The court then carefully and thoroughly examined each of the sentencing factors contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). While noting that the crime of illegal reentry \u201cis in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>and of itself not as serious as some other crimes that [the court] find[s] people in front of [it] for,\u201d nonetheless the court found Salgado-Hernandez\u2019s conduct more serious because he reentered the United States shortly after being deported.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 20. The court also stated that, given Salgado-Hernandez\u2019s repeated illegal reentries, a more severe sentence was more likely to serve the sentencing goal of promoting respect for the law. The court further noted the \u201cvery, very, very serious crime\u201d which Salgado-Hernandez committed while in the United States, and concluded that a severe sentence was warranted to provide adequate deterrence and to protect the public. <em>Id. </em>at 21-22. The court accordingly concluded that a forty-six month sentence was appropriate and reasonable, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-5\">So while I said before that I thought 46 months was a rather severe sentence and therefore it need not be any higher, nor did I mean it should be any lower because I think a severe sentence in the case of this defendant under all of the facts and circumstances is reasonable when one applies the sentencing factors that are set out in 3553(a)(2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-6\">So considering the totality of the circumstances, including what the guidelines recommend, but tying my analysis particularly to the sentencing factors, I find 46 months to be a reasonable sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Salgado-Hernandez appeals his sentence, arguing that the sixteen-level enhancement in his advisory Guideline sentence for his prior felony conviction is \u201cinherently unreasonable so that his sentence, derived from an advisory Guideline range applying that enhancement, is likewise unreasonable.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b509-12\">Following the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker, </em>the Guidelines are advisory rather than mandatory. However, \u201cthe now-advisory Guidelines are ... a factor to be considered in imposing a sentence, which means that district courts \u2018must consult those Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Kristl, </em>437 F.3d 1050, 1053 (10th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (quoting <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 264, 125 S.Ct. 738). Accordingly, we continue to review the sentencing court\u2019s factual findings under the Guidelines for clear error and its legal determinations de novo. <em>United States v. Serrata, </em>425 F.3d 886, 906 (10th Cir.2005). We review for reasonableness the ultimate sentence imposed, <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 261-62, 125 S.Ct. 738 (Breyer, J.), \u201cguided by the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Kristl, </em>437 F.3d at 1053. In conducting such a review, we bear in mind that \u201ca sentence that is properly calculated under the Guidelines is entitled to a rebut-table presumption of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1054. If the court sentenced the defendant within the properly calculated Guideline range, the defendant may \"rebut that presumptively reasonable sentence \u201cby demonstrating that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the other sentencing factors laid out in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1055. Our review is necessarily \u201cdeferential.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1054.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>Salgado-Hernandez argues that the sixteen-level enhancement contained in USSG \u00a7 2L1.2 for a prior felony conviction which already is used to calculate a defendant\u2019s criminal history is \u201cunreasonably excessive and overinclusive.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 9. This amounts to a simple facial challenge to the validity of the sixteen-level enhancement of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A). We have upheld and applied this enhancement on numerous occasions. We decline to declare it categorically invalid or unreasonable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">Moreover, we find the particular sentence imposed on Salgado-Hernandez a reasonable one under <em>Booker. </em>SalgadoHernandez cites <em>United States v. Trujillo-Terrazas, </em>405 F.3d 814 (10th Cir.2005), in support of his argument that the sixteen-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A) is unreasonable as applied to him. <em>Trujillo-Terrazas </em>does not help Salgado-Hernandez. In <em>Trujillo-Terrazas, </em>we remanded for resentencing where the district court, acting <em>pre-Booker </em>and therefore applying the Guidelines in a mandatory way, reluctantly imposed a sixteen-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A) to an illegal reentrant whose prior felony conviction was \u201ccomparatively innocuous.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 817. We found that the \u201crelatively trivial nature of [the defendant]'s criminal history is at odds with the substantial 16-level enhancement recommended by <em>the </em>Guidelines for this conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 819. There is nothing trivial or innocuous about Salgado-Hernandez\u2019s prior conviction for aggravated sexual assault on a child. Further, the district court\u2019s statements on resentencing make it very clear that the court carefully considered Salgado-Hernandez\u2019s criminal history as well as all the facts and circumstances concerning him and his crime to fashion an appropriate sentence, knowing full well that the Guideline sentence was only advisory. The court fully explained why the sentence it imposed was reasonable. Salgado-Hernandez has not rebutted that presumptively reasonable sentence by pointing to other sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). We therefore conclude that the forty-six month sentence is reasonable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the sentence imposed on Salgado-Hernandez.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b507-16\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b509-9\">.
