Ogbeide was sentenced to 70 months of imprisonment and five years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-14\">Ogbeide argues that the district court erred by denying her a minor role adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. This court reviews the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo and reviews factual findings for clear error. <em>See United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 <em>&amp; </em>n. 9 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 268, 163 L.Ed.2d 241 (2005). The men who arranged Ogbeide\u2019s travel to the United States also arranged at least one prior trip, and they told her that next time she would be carrying \u201csomething\u201d for them. Ogbeide was transporting almost one kilogram of heroin, and her role as courier was indispensable to the overall smuggling operation. Therefore, the district court did not clearly err in denying a mitigating role adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-17\">Ogbeide argues that the district court erred in ordering her to cooperate in the collection of a DNA sample as a condition of supervised release. This claim is not ripe for review. <em>See United States v. Riascos-Cuenu, </em>428 F.3d 1100, 1102 (5th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>2005), <em>petition for cert, filed </em>(Jan. 9, 2006) (No. 05-8662). This portion of her appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Ogbeide also argues for the first time on appeal that her sentence is unconstitutional under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because it was imposed pursuant to a mandatory application of the Sentencing Guidelines. This court reviews forfeited <em>Booker </em>errors for plain error. <em>United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732 (5th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 267, 163 L.Ed.2d 240 (2005). Ogbeide has established obvious error because she was sentenced under a mandatory guidelines regime. <em>See id. </em>To establish the third prong of plain error, she must \u201cpoint to statements in the record by the sentencing judge demonstrating a likelihood that the judge sentencing under an advisory scheme rather than a mandatory one would have reached a significantly different result.\u201d <em>United States v. Pennell, </em>409 F.3d 240, 245 (5th Cir.2005). Ogbeide\u2019s argument that the error is structural or presumptively prejudicial has been rejected by this court. <em>See United States v. Malveaux, </em>411 F.3d 558, 560-61 n. 9 (5th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 194, 163 L.Ed.2d 209 (2005). Ogbeide has not pointed to any statement by the district court that suggests it would have imposed a different sentence. The fact that Ogbeide was sentenced at the lowest end of the applicable guidelines range does not indicate that her sentence likely would have been different under advisory guidelines. <em>See United States v. Bringier, </em>405 F.3d 310, 317-18 &amp; n. 4 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 264,163 L.Ed.2d 238 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-12\">Ogbeide\u2019s final argument, raised for the first time on appeal, that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952 and 960 are unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), is foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent. <em>See United States v. Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d 580, 582 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-14\">AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b264-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
