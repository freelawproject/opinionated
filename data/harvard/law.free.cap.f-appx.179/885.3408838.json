INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324 n. 13 (4th Cir.2002) (citing <em>INS v. Stevie, </em>467 U.S. 407, 430,104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984)). Based on our review of the record, we find that Chen failed to make the requisite showing before the immigration court. We therefore uphold the denial of his request for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-15\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-16\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b912-10\"> Chen does not challenge the Board's finding that his asylum claim was statutorily barred as untimely. Further, as he raised no specific claim regarding the Convention Against Torture either here or before the Board, any such claim fails for lack of exhaustion, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (2000) (\"A court may review a final order of removal only if the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right\u201d); <em>Asika v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 264, 267 n. 3 (4th Cir.2004) (holding that we lack jurisdiction to consider an argument that was not raised before the Board), and as abandoned in this court, <em>see Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir.1999) (holding failure to raise specific issue in opening brief constitutes abandonment of that issue under Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
