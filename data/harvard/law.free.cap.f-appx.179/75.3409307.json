We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">This Court reviews the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam). An abuse of discretion may be found where the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cprovides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 233-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Prifti\u2019s motion to reopen. The BIA reasonably found that Prifti\u2019s motion was untimely filed under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c) \u2014 the motion, which challenged the BIA\u2019s March 31, 2004, decision was filed on December 8, 2004, well beyond the 90-day filing deadline. Additionally, we are \u201cwithout jurisdiction to review petitioner\u2019s claims to the extent that she asserts that the [BIA] abused [its] discretion when making factual determinations that she had failed to demonstrate either \u2018changed\u2019 or \u2018extraordinary\u2019 circumstances.\u201d <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>434 F.3d 144, 154 (2d Cir.2006). Moreover, Prifti\u2019s challenge to the BIA\u2019s order denying her appeal fails, as she did not file a timely petition for review from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1). Any other motions that may be outstanding are also DENIED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
