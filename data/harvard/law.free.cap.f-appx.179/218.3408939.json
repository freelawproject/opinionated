After Appellants allegedly spent over $2 million in defense, they sued St. Paul in Texas court for breach of contract. St. Paul removed to federal district court, and both parties moved for summary judgment. The district court granted summary judgment to St. Paul, concluding the insurance policy did not require St. Paul to defend Appellants against Kanafani\u2019s claims. We review <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">First, Appellants argue that the policy covers Kanafani\u2019s libel and slander claims against Dr. Gonzaba. This interpretation of the policy, specifically the Fiduciary Liability Endorsement, is unreasonable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As the district court held, the provision excluding protection for \u201cany business pursuits not directly related to or arising from fiduciary property\u201d applied to a \u201cCo-fiduciary,\u201d \u201cCo-owner,\u201d \u201cReceiver of Assets,\u201d or \u201cBeneficiary,\u201d like Dr. Gonzaba, not just a Receiver of Assets, as Appellants contend. Not only is the prefatory phrase to that provision (\u201cnone of the persons or organizations described above\u201d) plural,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but the prefatory phrase to the entire section states that the section \u201cadds certain protected persons and limits their protection.\u201d Appellants\u2019 interpretation would not limit the protection of natural person beneficiaries at all; to the contrary, it would insure every natural person beneficiary for all their business pursuits, regardless of the pursuits\u2019 relation to the Gonzaba Trust.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Furthermore, it seems clear that another exclusion in the provision, that excluding claims for \u201cbodily injury to any <em>fellow </em>employee or executive officer,\u201d applies to all four categories of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>protected persons, not just Receivers of Assets.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Consequently, the only reasonable interpretation is that the policy covers only claims \u201crelated to or arising from fiduciary property.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because the libel and slander claims do not relate to or arise from any fiduciary property, as Gonzaba implicitly concedes by not arguing to the contrary, the district court was correct in concluding that St. Paul did not have to defend those claims.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Second, Appellants argue the policy covers Kanafani\u2019s \u201closs of use\u201d claim against them. This interpretation is unreasonable because the policy only covers loss of use resulting from an \u201caccident,\u201d and the alleged cause of loss of use here, Appellants\u2019 deliberate acts, is not an \u201caccident.\u201d Indeed, Kanafani\u2019s petition alleged that Dr. Gonzaba\u2019s improper sale of the property, and Appellants\u2019 consequent <em>de facto </em>exclusion of Kanafani from his use and share of the property, was done \u201cintentionally, knowingly, maliciously, and fraudulently.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> There is no hint of an \u201caccident.\u201d For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b245-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b245-9\">. <em>See Am. Home Assurance Co. v. United Space Alliance, L.L.C., </em>378 F.3d 482, 486 (5th Cir. 2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b245-10\">. <em>See Barnett v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., </em>723 S.W.2d 663, 667 (Tex. 1987) (holding that if multiple interpretations are reasonable, courts favor the insured's); <em>Puckett </em>v. <em>U.S. Fire Ins. Co., </em>678 S.W.2d 936, 938 (Tex.1984) (holding that if only one interpretation is reasonable, it controls). Under Texas\u2019s \"eight corners\u201d doctrine, we compare the words of the policy with the claims in the complaint; if any claim is potentially covered, the insurer must defend. <em>See Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh v. Merchants Fast Motor Lines, Inc., </em>939 S.W.2d 139, 141 (Tex. 1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b245-12\">. Dr. Gonzaba's argument noting that the phrase \"persons or organizations\u201d in the exclusion mirrors that in the \"Receiver of Assets\" section is simply unconvincing, partially because that same phrase also exists in the \"Co-owner\u201d section.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b245-15\">. Appellants argue that the protection of beneficiaries is limited because non-natural beneficiaries are covered only for \"injury or damage in connection with fiduciary property.\u201d But that limitation \u2014 limiting only non-natural beneficiaries \u2014 is not much of one, and still results in one group \u2014 natural person beneficiaries \u2014 having coverage without limitation, contradicting the prefatory phrase. Appellants also argue that our interpretation would render the distinction between natural and non-natural beneficiaries meaningless. Not so, for while both are insured only for <em>business pursuits </em>\"related to or arising from fiduciary property,\u201d the latter is insured only for <em>injury or damage </em>\"in connection with fiduciary properly,\u201d while the former\u2019s coverage is not so limited. The two limitations are not necessarily identical. We note also that the primary policyholder here, as trustee of the Gonzaba Trust and many others, is Chase Bank; consequently, Appellants\u2019 interpretation would mean that all natural person beneficiaries for all Chase's trusts are covered for all their business pursuits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b246-5\">. Emphasis added.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b246-6\">. <em>See Puckett, </em>678 S.W.2d at 938.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b246-7\">. Appellants also argue briefly that the exclusion is inapplicable because Kanafani's libel and slander allegations do not relate to any \"business pursuit.\u201d We are unpersuaded\u2014 the allegations, though seemingly personal, relate to the heart of Klafani\u2019s case, one centered on a business dispute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b246-8\">. Appellants argue in their reply brief that Kanafani did not specifically allege Appellants\u2019 state of mind until his Tenth Amended Petition, which also removed the Gonzaba Trust as a defendant, hence St. Paul cannot rest its refusal to represent the Trust on that basis. However, what Kanafani was alleging was clear from his earliest petition: that Appellants\u2019 deliberate, improper transfer of the property from Dr. Gonzaba to the Trust harmed him. Indeed, Appellants themselves urge us to look past another supposed anachronism \u2014 that Kanafani did not allege loss of use until his Thirteenth Amended Petition, after the Trust had been dropped as a defendant \u2014 for the same reason. They cannot have it both ways. Appellants also argue in their reply brief that St. Paul had to defend the Trust (even if not Dr. Gonzaba) because none of Kanafani\u2019s petitions allege that the Trust acted intentionally, only Dr. Gonzaba. But the Trust acted almost exclusively through Dr. Gonzaba, of course, evident from a correct reading of the petitions. The Fourth Amended Petition, for instance, stated that Dr. Gonzaba acted through the Gonzaba Trust in breaching a fiduciary duty. Appellants' own conflation of Dr. Gonzaba and the Trust underscores the point: in their blue brief they argued that St. Paul had to defend Dr. Gonzaba against the loss of use claim, waiting until their reply brief to argue that St. Paul owed a special, separate duty to the Trust based on its supposed lack of intent. The key point is simple: Kanafani never alleged an \"accident.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
