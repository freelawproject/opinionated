We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-20\">This Court reviews the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen or reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam); <em>Jin Ming Liu v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 109, 111 (2d Cir.2006). An alien is limited to one motion to reopen exclusion or deportation proceedings, and this motion must be filed within ninety days of the final administrative decision. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) (2005). Because the BIA issued Zhao\u2019s final order of exclusion on February 15, 2000, Zhao\u2019s second motion, filed on May 12, 2004, was out of time. An untimely motion may be maintained if the alien can establish one of four limited exceptions. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3) (2005). None apply here. Zhao seeks to reopen on the ground that she has had a second child. However, a change in an individual\u2019s personal circumstances does not qualify under the applicable exceptions. <em>Li Yong Zheng v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>416 F.3d 129, 130-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>31 (2d Cir.2005) (holding that an alien failed to qualify for the changed circumstances exception by asserting only that his personal circumstances had changed by the birth of a child). Accordingly, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Lin\u2019s motion to reopen as failing to comply with the time and numerical limitations imposed on such motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, the stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
