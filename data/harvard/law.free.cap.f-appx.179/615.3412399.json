On appeal, Lawes argues that the district court erred by (1) sentencing him under a mandatory Guidelines scheme, in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); and (2) relying on prior convictions, which were neither charged in the indictment nor found by a jury, to enhance his sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-12\">The relevant facts are straightforward. On August 31, 2000, Lawes was indicted for possession with intent to distribute more than 50 grams of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (Count 1). At his arraignment before a magistrate judge, Lawes pled not guilty. He subsequently changed his plea to guilty, pursuant to a written plea agreement with the government, and proceeded to sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-13\">According to the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), Lawes sold 55.3 grams of cocaine base to a confidential source working with Drug Enforcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d). Based on this amount of cocaine base, the PSI calculated a base offense level, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(a)(3), of 32. The PSI then recommended a career-offender enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, because the instant offense was a controlled-substance felony offense and Lawes had at least two prior controlled-substance felony convictions. After a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1(a) and (b), Lawes\u2019s adjusted offense level was 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-14\">In calculating Lawes\u2019s criminal history category, the PSI included a description of the two prior controlled-substance felony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>convictions that qualified Lawes for the career-offender enhancement under \u00a7 4B1.1. The PSI further noted that Lawes had a total of two criminal history points, which normally would accord him a criminal history category of II. But the PSI recommended, based on Lawes\u2019s career-offender status, a criminal history category VI. Lawes faced a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years\u2019 imprisonment and a maximum of life imprisonment under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). The Guidelines range was 262-327 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Lawes objected to the enhanced criminal history category of VI, arguing that it significantly over-represented the seriousness of his criminal history or the likelihood that he would commit further crimes. He also objected to the PSI\u2019s failure to recommend a downward departure because the enhanced sentence was not in furtherance of an allowable purpose under 18 U.S.C. 3553(a). At the subsequent sentencing hearing, he also asserted he was entitled to an additional downward departure based on his limited education and minimal criminal record. The government agreed with Lawes\u2019s argument that a category VI overstated his criminal history, but objected to Lawes\u2019s suggestion that he was entitled to a criminal history category I. In response to these arguments, the district court observed that there were \u201cstrong arguments to be made that no horizontal departure [was] appropriate\u201d and that the government was being \u201cbenevolent\u201d in not opposing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Regarding Lawes\u2019s request for a \u00a7 5K2 departure, the court denied it, finding that the instant case was not outside the heartland and stating that \u201cit\u2019s a fairly typical case. Unfortunately, by operation of law and the guidelines, the sentence is very harsh, which is causing all of us to pause to some extent.\u201d The court also addressed Lawes\u2019s objection that a category VI overrepresented his criminal history. The district court first noted that it had discretion to depart horizontally across the criminal history category. Based on its determination that a category VI was not appropriate, and considering the pattern and timing of Lawes\u2019s previous convictions, the district court departed to a category II criminal history. In deciding against departing to a category I criminal history, the court commented that, \u201c[c]ategory one, where someone has no previous criminal offenses, is sort of inconsistent with the whole career criminal concept.\u201d The court further explained that \u201cthough still harsh, a category two would adequately represent the Defendant\u2019s criminal history over a lengthy period of time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">After the foregoing adjustments to Lawes\u2019s criminal history category, the district court calculated a new Guidelines range of 168 to 210 months. The district court stated that \u201c[b]ased on the lengthy sentence afforded by the guideline range, the Court will impose a sentence at the bottom of the range.\u201d The court then sentenced Lawes to a 168-month term of imprisonment followed by a 5-year term of supervised release. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">Because Lawes raises his <em>Booker </em>claim for the first time on appeal, our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.), <em>cert, </em>denied,-U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005). In order for us to correct plain error: (1) there must be error, (2) the error must be plain, and (3) the error must affect substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIf all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Under the third prong, the appellant bears the burden to show that the error \u201caffect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>ed substantial rights, which almost always requires that the error must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings. The standard for showing that is the familiar reasonable probability of a different result formulation, which means a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1299 (alteration and quotations omitted). \u201c[W]here the effect of an error on the result in the district court is uncertain or indeterminate \u2014 where we would have to speculate\u2014 the appellant has not met his burden of showing a reasonable probability that the result would have been different but for the error.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">In <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>we recognized that there are two types of <em>Booker </em>error: (1) the Sixth Amendment \u201cconstitutional\u201d error of using judge-found facts to increase a defendant\u2019s sentence under a mandatory guideline system; and (2) the \u201cstatutory\u201d error of applying the Guidelines as mandatory, as opposed to advisory. 400 F.3d 1325, 1329-31 (11th Cir. 2005). Lawes asserts that both types of <em>Booker </em>error occurred here.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">First, after calculating the new Guidelines range, the district court committed statutory <em>Booker </em>error by applying the Guidelines in a mandatory fashion. But in order to prove that the error affected his substantial rights under the third prong of plain-error review, a defendant must demonstrate \u201ca reasonable probability of a different result if the guidelines had been applied in an advisory instead of binding fashion by the sentencing judge in this case.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1301 (11th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005). Where \u201c[t]he record provides no reason to believe any result is more likely than the other,\u201d a defendant cannot prevail under plain-error review. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">Here, Lawes does not point to anything in the record that would satisfy his burden of showing a reasonable probability that he would have received a lesser sentence had he been sentenced under an advisory scheme. While the district court stated that Lawes\u2019s criminal history resulted in a \u201clengthy\u201d sentence under the Guidelines, the court did not say, or in any way imply, that it was inclined to impose a lower sentence if not bound by the Guidelines. Moreover, at no point during the proceedings did the court mention that the lengthy sentence was tied in any way to the mandatory nature of the Guidelines. Simply put, Lawes has not demonstrated a reasonable probability of a lesser sentence under an advisory system. Accordingly, the district court did not commit reversible plain error under the statutory component of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">We also reject Lawes\u2019s argument that the district court erred when it imposed sentence pursuant to the career-offender provisions by relying on prior convictions that were neither charged in the indictment nor found by a jury. As Lawes acknowledges, we have held that a district court does not commit <em>Booker </em>constitutional error when it applies a career-offender enhancement based on previous convictions, pursuant to <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), which remains binding on this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">In <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201c[a]n indictment must set forth each element of the crime that it charges [,b]ut it need not set forth factors relevant only to the sentencing of an offender found guilty of the charged crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 228 (citation omitted). Before <em>Booker, </em>we held that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remained good law. <em>United States v. Marseille, </em>377 F.3d 1249, 1257-58, n. 14 (11th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>543 U.S. 1013, 125 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>637, 160 L.Ed.2d 480 (2004). And after <em>Booker, </em>we observed that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cwas left undisturbed by <em>Apprendi, Blakely, </em>and <em>Booker, </em>\u201d and that \u201ca district court does not err by relying on prior convictions to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence.\u201d <em>Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1329. Because the Supreme Court has not overruled <em>Almendarez-Totres, </em>the district court did not err when it applied the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 career-offender enhancement, relying on two prior qualifying convictions that were neither alleged in the indictment nor proven to a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b642-10\">. We reject Lawes's additional argument that the district court erred by granting only a horizontal downward departure and denying his request for an additional vertical downward departure based on alleged over-representation of the seriousness of his prior crimes. Our review of the record reveals no indication that the district court thought it lacked authority to grant the departure. Accordingly, we will not review the denial of Lawes\u2019s requested vertical departure. <em>See United States v. Anderson, </em>326 F.3d 1319, 1333 (11th Cir.2003) (\"A defendant may not ordinarily appeal a district court\u2019s refusal to grant a downward departure. Where the court erroneously believed that it lacked the <em>authority </em>to grant the downward departure, however, the defendant may appeal the court\u2019s failure to downward depart\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>289 F.3d 696, 710-11 (11th Cir.2002) (holding that departure based upon the over-representation of a defendant's criminal history must proceed under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 and not U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0; \u201cdownward departures under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 must be on the horizontal axis, reflecting the offender's criminal history category, and not on the vertical axis, reflecting his offense level\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
