BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">CCL\u2019s \u2019085 patent discloses a calculator which generally contains a housing and a \u201clid mechanism which pivots a flat cover of the calculator in a predetermined controlled manner between a first position[,]\u201d in which the cover forms a lid overlying the display, and a second position in which the cover is \u201cpivoted towards the rear of the calculator so as to form a stand for tilting the calculator into an upwardly inclined ergonomic position .... \u201d \u2019085 patent, Abstract. The \u2019085 patent specification discloses that one object of the invention is to provide a novel calculator lid mechanism that has been adapted \u201cfor controlled pivoting actuation to alternatively form a cover for a display panel and a stand for the calculator.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at col. 2, 11. 61-65. Figures 4 and 5 show both positions of the lid mechanism, as a cover and alternatively, a stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">After being accused by CCL of infringing the \u2019085 patent, Sun Coast filed a declaratory judgment action that the \u2019085 patent was invalid and/or not infringed by its accused calculators. In response, CCL filed a counterclaim for infringement of claims 1, 2, 7, 8, and 9 of the \u2019085 patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">Claim 1, the only independent claim asserted, is representative of the claims at issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-10\">1. A portable hand-held calculator, comprising:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-11\">(a) a generally flat rectangular housing containing operating electronics and an array of calculator actuating buttons; a display panel being located on a front surface of said housing proximate said array of actuator buttons; said housing including a pair of flanges extending from opposite side edges of said housing in parallel spaced relationship; and <em>hinge-forming trunnions being formed on inwardly facing surfaces of said flanges;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-12\">(b) a lid structure connected to said trunnions for pivotal motion relative to said housing, said lid structure including a flat cover portion and a tubular portion formed along one edge of said flat cover portion extending between said trunnions, said tubular portion including cylindrical bores extending along the longitudinal axis thereof; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>(c) a lid operating mechanism including <em>damping means arranged within at least one said cylindrical bore, </em>biasing said lid toward a rearwardly pivoted position, and effectuating a controlled pivotal motion of said lid structure between <em>the closed position thereof covering said display panel and the rearwardly pivoted position exposing said display panel </em>and forming a stand for supporting said calculator in a tilted position on a horizontal surface.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-5\"><em>Id. </em>at col. 7,11. 2-27 (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">In its <em>Markman </em>opinion, the district court construed the term \u201ctrunnions\u201d as \u201cpin[s] or pivot[s] usually mounted on bearings for rotating or tilting something.\u201d <em>Sun Coast Merch. Corp. v. CCL Prods. Enters., Inc., </em>No. CV 01-0772, slip op. at 12-13 (C.D.Cal. May 1, 2003) <em>(\u201cMarkman Opinion\u201d). </em>Based on the context of the claim language and the disclosures in the specification, however, the court limited \u201ctrunnions\u201d to those \u201cthat project from the inwardly facing surface of the flanges.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">Sun Coast markets several different models of accused calculators. The district court separated the accused calculators according to their design into three general categories. We continue the district court\u2019s practice of referring to the accused devices in the following manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-8\">(1) \u201coriginal design:\u201d including models RC2500 and original RC3000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-9\">(2) \u201cmodified design:\u201d including models RC2600, RC2500M, RC2700, and modified RC3000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-10\">(3) \u201cdouble flipper\u201d or the CALC-0050 model</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-11\"><em>See, e.g., Sun Coast Merch. Corp. v. CCL Prods. Enters., Inc., </em>No. SA CV 03-0991, slip op. at 2 n. 2 (C.D.Cal. Oct. 28, 2004) <em>(\u201cSummary Judgment Order\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b35-12\">In its opinion granting Sun Coast\u2019s motion for summary judgment of non-infringement, the district court found that CCL did not provide any admissible evidence of infringement in response to Sun Coast\u2019s motion. The \u201cevidence\u201d proffered consisted of: \u201c(1) unauthenticated photographs that purport to compare the Sun Coast products to the CCL products; and (2) unauthenticated computer generated drawings of Sun Coast\u2019s products.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7. Thus, the district court concluded that \u201c[h]aving submitted only these questionable exhibits with mere conclusory argument, CCL has provided no <em>evidence </em>to support its position of infringement.... CCL\u2019s unsupported statements are wholly insufficient to raise a genuine evidentiary dispute requiring the case to go before a jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court found that CCL failed to go beyond the pleadings and provide the court with evidence of either literal infringement or \u201cevidence of the equivalency of Sun Coast\u2019s products and the limitations in claim 1.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8, n. 5. That failure was sufficient for the district court to find that CCL\u2019s lack of proof entitled Sun Coast to summary judgment of non-infringement on both literal infringement and infringement under the doctrine of equivalents. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b35-13\">The district court, however, subsequently made clear that its grant of summary judgment was not based solely on CCL\u2019s failure to present evidence of infringement, but also on its own observations of the accused devices which the court apparently disassembled on its own accord: \u201cthe Court\u2019s examination of the products at issue, coupled with CCL\u2019s failure to provide evidence to the contrary, leads to the conclusion that all elements contained in claim 1 of the \u2019085 Patent are not present in the Sun Coast products.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9. The district court then proceeded to examine the disassembled accused products and make findings of fact regarding whether each of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>three categories of accused products literally infringe.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">Specifically, the district court\u2019s analysis of infringement consisted of a single paragraph for each design type, as reproduced here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-5\">The original design does not embody every limitation of claim 1. The calculators do not have projections on the inner surface of both sides of the housing about which the lid rotates. In other words, the RC2500 and RC3000 do not have flanges with hinge forming trunnions (pins or pivots) that are distinct components. Rather, the lid is attached and rotational movement about the housing is permitted by an outwardly extended attachment means on the lid structure. The support portion in the RC2500 and RC3000 rotate about an integral bore and include extensions that are fitted into the housing. Also, the RC2500 and RC3000 only appear to have a single flange with an inwardly facing structural element.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-6\">The modified design does not have flanges with hinge-forming trunnions as required by claim 1(a); instead there are protruding extensions on each end of the covering portion\u2019s cylindrical barrel that insert into recesses in the housing body. In addition to differences in composition, the Court notes differences between the lid operating mechanism of the \u2019085 Patent and the modified design. The modified design does not have the damping means arranged within one of the cylindrical bores of the lid structure. Rather, the damping means is primarily located within the housing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-7\">Claim 1 requires the lid structure to cover the display panel in the closed position. Because there are two closing layers in the double flipper, the lid structure does not cover the display panel in the closed position, nor does it expose the display panel when opened. Instead, when the lid structure covering the display is opened, the second portion of the housing covers the display panel (this second portion of the housing then opens). Overall, the double flipper opens in a different configuration than that described by the \u2019085 Patent. Moreover, the double flipper\u2019s components are similar to the modified calculator and non-infringing for the same reasons noted above.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 10-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-10\">In its opinion denying Sun Coast\u2019s motion for attorney fees, the district court found that the case was not \u201cexceptional\u201d because Sun Coast had not established by \u201cconvincing clarity the egregiousness of CCL\u2019s counsel\u2019s conduct or a bad faith and vexatious multiplication of proceedings.\u201d <em>Attorney Fees Order, </em>slip op. at 2. Additionally, the court denied sanctions in the form of attorney fees under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 927 for essentially the same reasons, finding that \u201cCCL\u2019s counsel did not multiply proceedings unreasonably and vexatiously.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2-3. Lastly, the court declined to utilize its inherent powers to sanction CCL or its counsel because they did not act \u201cin bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons .... [even though,] the court ... may not have appreciated the zeal or decorum with which CCL and its counsel litigated this matter....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-11\">CCL appeals the grant of summary judgment of noninfringement. Sun Coast cross-appeals the denial of attorney fees. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-12\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b36-13\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b36-14\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, reapplying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>the standard applicable at the district court. <em>Rodime PLC v. Seagate Tech., Inc., </em>174 F.3d 1294, 1301 (Fed.Cir.1999). Summary judgment is appropriate when it has been shown \u201cthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Contract Mgmt., Inc. v. Rumsfeld, </em>434 F.3d 1145, 1146 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Determining infringement generally requires two steps. \u201cFirst, the claim must be properly construed to determine its scope and meaning. Second, the claim as properly construed must be compared to the accused device or process.\u201d <em>Carroll Touch, Inc. v. Electro Mech. Sys., Inc., </em>15 F.3d 1573, 1576 (Fed.Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">Claim construction is an issue of law that we review de novo. <em>Cybor Corp. v. FAS Techs., Inc., </em>138 F.3d 1448, 1456 (Fed.Cir.1998) (en banc); <em>Markman v.

Teva Pharms., USA, Inc., </em>429 F.3d 1364, 1372-73 (Fed.Cir.2005) (citing <em>Phillips v. AWH Corp., </em>415 F.3d 1303, 1313 (Fed.Cir.2005) (en banc)). \u201cThe inquiry into how a person of ordinary skill in the art understands a claim term provides an objective baseline from which to begin claim interpretation.\u201d <em>Phillips, </em>415 F.3d at 1313. \u201cImportantly, the person of ordinary skill in the art is deemed to read the claim term not only in the context of the particular claim in which the disputed term appears, but in the context of the entire patent, including the specification.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">Infringement, whether literal or under the doctrine of equivalents, is a question of fact. <em>Bai v. L &amp; L Wings, Inc., </em>160 F.3d 1350, 1353 (Fed.Cir.1998). The proper inquiry is whether the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-movant. <em>See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 252, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). We must draw all justifiable inferences in favor of the non-movant. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">A court may award attorney fees to a party in \u201cexceptional\u201d cases pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285. A trial court undertakes a two-step inquiry to adjudicate a request for attorney fees: the court examines whether there is clear and convincing evidence that the case is exceptional; and if so, whether an award of attorney fees to the prevailing party is warranted. <em>Evident Corp. v. Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc., </em>399 F.3d 1310, 1315 (Fed.Cir.2005) (citing <em>Cybor, </em>138 F.3d at 1460; <em>J.P. Stevens Co. v. Lex Tex Ltd., </em>822 F.2d 1047, 1050 (Fed. Cir.1987)). Whether a case is exceptional depends on findings of fact by the trial court, which we review for clear error. <em>Rolls-Royce, Ltd. v. GTE Valeron Corp., </em>800 F.2d 1101, 1111 (Fed.Cir.1986). Pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285, the decision to award attorney fees is committed to the discretion of the trial court, which we review for an abuse of discretion. <em>Evident Corp., </em>399 F.3d at 1315 (citing <em>Molins PLC v. Textron, Inc., </em>48 F.3d 1172, 1178 (Fed. Cir.1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-10\">B. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"Az\">1. Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"A3\">a. \u201ctrunnions\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-11\">In construing the term \u201ctrunnions\u201d in claim 1 of the \u2019085 patent, the district court noted that the parties did not dispute the single word \u201ctrunnion,\u201d but rather the context in which the term is used in the claim. The district court, relying on a dictionary definition of trunnions, construed the term to mean \u201cpins or pivots <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>usually mounted on bearings for rotating or tilting something.\u201d <em>Markman Opinion, </em>slip op. at 13. Reading the claim term in the context of the surrounding claim language, \u201chinge-forming trunnions being formed on inwardly facing surfaces of said flanges!,]\u201d the court found that because the claim requires that the trunnions be formed \u201con\u201d the inwardly facing surfaces of the flanges, they must project from the inwardly facing surface of the flanges. The court recognized that several portions of the \u2019085 patent specification, including the \u201cSummary of the Invention\u201d and \u201cDetailed Description of a Preferred Embodiment\u201d sections, refer to the trunnions \u201cas types of projections!,]\u201d thereby reinforcing the conclusion that some type of projection is required. In reaching its construction, the court rejected CCL\u2019s argument that the term \u201ctrunnion\u201d as used in the claim could be construed to cover a pure recess or indentation in the surface of the flange because \u201c[w]hile such recess might be a trunnion, it would be one that is formed in, not on, the inwardly facing surface of the flanges.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, the court concluded that \u201cthe trunnions identified in the claim language are ones that project from the inwardly facing surface of the flanges.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">On appeal, CCL argues that the district court erred in construing \u201ctrunnions\u201d as being limited to \u201cprojecting\u201d trunnions. Specifically, CCL contends that the court grafted a limitation from the preferred embodiment onto the trunnion term; that limitation being some type of projection. CCL asserts that the claim language \u201con inwardly facing surfaces of said flanges,\u201d \u201csimply defines the location of the trunnions \u2018on the flange.\u2019 \u201d Alternatively, CCL asserts that if the trunnion term were limited to a projection, there is no reason to further limit it to a structure that does not contain a recess, especially when such a construction would exclude the preferred embodiment.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">Sun Coast, on the other hand, argues that the district court correctly construed the term \u201ctrunnion\u201d as requiring some type of projection, and thus excluding a pure recess, based on the context of the term in the claim itself and the disclosures in the specification. First, Sun Coast echoes the district court\u2019s conclusion that the claim language states that the trunnions are formed \u201con\u201d the surfaces of the flanges and not \u201cin\u201d the surfaces, and therefore the claim language itself does not support CCL\u2019s argument that a trunnion could be a pure recess. Second, Sun Coast asserts that \u201c[a] trunnion cannot be a [pure] recess because the specification describes a recess as part of the <em>projecting </em>trunnion____\u201d (Pls.-Cross Appellants\u2019 Br. 48.) Finally, Sun Coast argues that as correctly construed, the projecting \u201ctrunnions\u201d cannot contain a recess and if such a construction excludes the preferred embodiment it is because of poor claim drafting.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">\u201c[T]he words of a claim \u2018are generally given their ordinary and customary meaning.\u2019 \u201d <em>Phillips, </em>415 F.3d at 1312 (quoting <em>Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic, Inc., </em>90 F.3d 1576, 1582 (Fed.Cir.1996)). That ordinary meaning \u201cis the meaning that the term would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art in question at the time of the invention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1313. \u201c[T]he claims themselves provide substantial guidance as to the meaning of particular claim terms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1314. In particular, \u201cthe context in which a term is used in the asserted claim\u201d and the \u201c[o]ther claims of the patent in question\u201d are useful for understanding the ordinary meaning. <em>Id. </em>As we have stated on numerous occasions, the claims \u201cmust be read in view of the specification, of which they are a part.\u201d <em>Markman, </em>52 F.3d at 979. \u201c[T]he specification \u2018is always <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>highly relevant to the claim construction analysis. Usually, it is dispositive; it is the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term.\u2019 \u201d <em>Phillips, </em>415 F.3d at 1315 (quoting <em>Vitronics, </em>90 F.3d at 1582).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">We can discern no error in the district court\u2019s <em>Markman </em>construction of the term \u201ctrunnions.\u201d First, the claim language itself states \u201chinge-forming trunnions being formed <em>on </em>inwardly facing surfaces of said flanges[.]\u201d \u2019085 patent, col. 7, ll. 9-10 (emphasis added). We do not believe that the term \u201con\u201d was merely a reference to the location of the trunnions, but rather a limitation on the types of trunnions which were being claimed. Thus, we agree that the claim language itself does not support a construction of the term that would consist of a pure recess as such a trunnion would no longer be formed \u201con\u201d the surface of the flanges, but rather \u201cin\u201d the surface. The claim language, however, supports a construction that the trunnions must be some type of projection, as that projection would aptly be considered \u201con\u201d the surface of the flanges. Second, the specification consistently refers to trunnions as being some type of projection and the preferred embodiment is described as having \u201ca short inwardly extending trunnion-like projection 28, 30[.]\u201d This is not, however, a limitation which is only associated with the preferred embodiment as argued by CCL. \u2019085 patent, col. 4, II. 12-13. The \u201cSummary of Invention\u201d section states that the <em>\u201ctrunnions which project inwardly </em>from upper ends of flanges extend from the side walls of the calculator housing, ... to ... the opposite open ends of the cylindrical bores and form hinge connections for the lid structure with the calculator housing.\u201d \u2019085 patent, col. 2, ll. 45-50 (emphasis added). Therefore, based on the context of the claim language and the description of the trunnions in the specification, we agree with the district court that the term trunnions be construed as \u201cpins or pivots usually mounted on bearings for rotating or tilting something that project from the inwardly facing surface of the flanges.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">While we affirm the district court\u2019s <em>Markman </em>construction of \u201ctrunnions,\u201d we note that there is no additional limitation which prevents the trunnion from being some type of projection which contains a recess.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> First, the context of the claim language does not exclude a projection containing a recess because such a trunnion would still be \u201con\u201d the surface of the flanges. Second, such a projection is specifically disclosed as part of the preferred embodiment. Figure 9 of the \u2019085 patent illustrates that, \u201c[o]ne of the projections 28 is larger in diameter, and <em>projection 28 contains a circular recess 32 </em>including a horizontal rib 34 extending radially from the bottom of the recess 32.\u201d \u2019085 patent, col. 4,ll.13-17 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">As shown in Figure 9, projection 28 is a trunnion which contains a recess. Thus, a construction of the term \u201ctrunnion\u201d that excludes a projection containing a recess would exclude projection 28 as shown in Figure 9. Third, as Sun Coast admits, \u201cthe specification describes a recess as part of the <em>projecting </em>trunnion.... \u201d (Pls.-Cross Appellants\u2019 Br. 48.) Therefore, there is no apparent reason to limit the term in a way that would exclude the preferred embodiment. Accordingly, based on the claim language and the disclosures in the specification, the term trunnion, although required to contain a projection, is broad enough to include a projection with a recess, an example of which is shown in Figure 9 of the preferred embodiment, and to the extent that the district court may have applied a more limited construction of the term in its summary judgment order, that application was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">b. \u201cdamping means\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Because we find that the district court erred in its infringement analysis of whether the accused modified design calculator practices the \u201cdamping means arranged within at least one said cylindrical bore\u201d limitation of claim 1, <em>see infra </em>Part</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">ll.B.2.b., it becomes necessary for us to address the court\u2019s claim construction of the term \u201cdamping means.\u201d The district court correctly determined that \u201cdamping means\u201d is a means-plus-function claim limitation. The district court erred, however, in identifying the function of the \u201cdamping means,\u201d as merely \u201crestrain[ing], in a controlled manner, the force of the helical spring when it is released.\u201d <em>Markman Opinion, </em>slip op. at 15. The language of claim 1, \u201cbiasing said lid toward a rearwardly pivoted position, and effectuating a controlled pivotal motion of said lid structure ... [,]\u201d makes clear that there are two functions of the \u201cdamping means\u201d: (1) biasing the lid toward a rearwardly pivoted position and (2) effectuating a controlled pivotal motion of the lid. Having misconstrued the functions of the \u201cdamping means,\u201d the district court also erred in determining which structures are identified in the specification as performing those functions. In two places, the specification discusses the structures involved with both biasing and effectuating a controlled pivotal motion of the lid structure. In column 4, the specification states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-8\">[a]s shown in ... FIGS. 8(a) through (c), a <em>damping drum </em>70 ... <em>in conjunction with the helical coil spring </em>62 form <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>the lid mechanism 16 <em>for effectuating the pivoting movement of the lid structure </em>14 relative to the housing 12. The assembly of the components of the lid mechanism 16 into the blind bore 40 so as to effectively facilitate the controlled damped pivoting of the lid structure comprises inserting the helical coil spring 62 into the blind bore 40....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Au\">\u2019085 patent, col. 4, ll. 48-60 (emphases added). This portion of the specification makes clear that the damping drum 70 and the helical coil spring 62 bias and effectuate the pivoting movement of the lid structure and that these structures are the components of the lid mechanism which facilitate the controlled damped pivoting of the lid structure. In addition, the specification states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-5\"><em>[t]he rate of movement </em>or speed in the rearward pivoting <em>of the lid structure </em>14 upon the release thereof <em>is controlled by means of the damping drum </em>70 <em>and the damping grease 84 </em>arranged thereabout in contact with the inner surface of the blind bore 40 which, in essence, forms a damping cylinder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-6\"><em>Id. </em>at col. 5, 11. 44-49 (emphases added). This portion of the specification makes clear that the damping drum 70 and the damping grease 84 control the rate of movement or speed of the lid structure as it pivots rearward. Thus, reading these two portions of the specification together compels the conclusion that the corresponding structures identified in the specification for performing the functions of biasing the lid toward a rearwardly pivoted position and effectuating a controlled pivotal motion of the lid are the damping drum 70, the helical coil spring 62, and the damping grease 84.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">2. Literal Infringement</p>\n<p id=\"b41-10\">Because the district court\u2019s summary judgment order separately discusses each of the accused calculator designs, we have followed suit and continue to discuss each design separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-11\">a. Original Design</p>\n<p id=\"b41-12\">In its summary judgment opinion, the district court concluded that the original design calculators were missing at least two limitations of claim 1. First, the court found that \u201cthe calculators do not have projections on the inner surface of both sides of the housing about which the lid rotates.\u201d <em>Summary Judgment Order, </em>slip op. at 10. Second, in noting that the calculators do not have projections, the court also stated that they \u201cdo not have flanges with hinge-forming trunnions (pins or pivots) that are distinct components.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Third, the court concluded by observing that the calculators \u201conly appeal\u2019 to have a single flange with an inwardly facing structural element.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b42-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>Literal infringement requires that each and every limitation set forth in a claim appear in an accused product. <em>Frank\u2019s Casing Crew &amp; Rental Tools, Inc. v. Weatherford Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>389 F.3d 1370, 1378 (Fed.Cir.2004) (citing <em>Becton Dickinson &amp; Co. v. C.R. Bard. Inc., </em>922 F.2d 792, 796 (Fed.Cir.1990)). With regard to the district court\u2019s first finding, it is not entirely clear to us whether the court\u2019s conclusion that the original design calculators lacked projections on the inner surface of both sides of the housing was based on the incorrect understanding that a trunnion could not consist of a projection containing a recess. Because it appears that the district court\u2019s finding may have been based on that incorrect understanding, we are unable to discern on this record whether this issue (i.e., the factual determination of whether the original design calculators include \u201ctrunnions\u201d as that term has been construed by this panel) is amenable to summary judgment or whether genuine issues of material fact remain as to whether the original design calculators practice this claim limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">Second, the parties apparently agree that there is no prohibition on the trunnions and flanges being formed as one integral piece. <em>(See </em>Pls.-Cross Appellants\u2019 Br. 52.) It appears that the district court\u2019s comment about trunnions and flanges being \u201cdistinct components\u201d was not made in an attempt to further construe the claim terms, but rather in response to submissions by CCL which purported to label the same structure as both a flange and a trunnion. While there is no question that the trunnions and flanges must be distinctly identifiable, it is also clear that they are related. For example, the trunnions are identified in the specification as being parts of the flanges, \u201cthe housing 12 includes a pair of upwardly extending flange elements 24, 26 at opposite sides thereof, each of which includes a short inwardly extending trunnion-like projection 28, 30.\u201d \u2019085 patent, col. 4, ll, 9-13. Thus, if the district court meant this statement as a comment in response to CCL\u2019s submissions, namely that the trunnions and flanges be distinctly identifiable, then we agree. If, on the other hand, the district court meant this statement to be another limitation of the claim rather than a comment on CCL\u2019s submissions, we find that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the flanges and trunnions in the original design are distinctly identifiable so that summary judgment based on this reason alone is not appropriate. Accordingly, at least some additional clarification is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Third, the court also concluded that the original design \u201cappears\u201d to contain only a single flange with an inwardly facing structural element or projection, whereas the claims require \u201ca pair of flangesf,]\u201d each of which containing a trunnion formed on the inwardly facing surface. <em>See, e.g., </em>\u2019085 patent, col. 7, ll. 7-10. Even if we were to accept the district court\u2019s statement as a definitive finding that the original design contains only a single flange with a trunnion, we must vacate the district court\u2019s conclusion as it is unclear whether the court applied an erroneous construction of the \u201ctrunnions\u201d term because the court has failed to set forth what, if any, structure the original design calculators have on the other side of the housing. Thus, we cannot determine in the first instance if whatever structure there may be qualifies as a trunnion.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Notably, we express no opinion with respect to whether summary judgment may ultimately be appropriate in light of the clarified claim construction rulings and their subsequent effect on the summary judgment order of the district court. We leave that determination to the district court in the first instance after considering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>any subsequent summary judgment briefing or argument by the parties that the court may deem necessary. If genuine issues of material fact remain as to whether the original design calculators possess each and every limitation of the claims, then the appropriate conclusion is to deny summary judgment and let the facts be decided at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">b. Modified Design</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">In its summary judgment opinion, the district court concluded that the modified design calculators are missing two of the limitations of claim 1. First, the court found that \u201c[t]he modified design does not have flanges with hinge-forming trunnions as required by claim 1(a); instead there are protruding extensions on each end of the covering portion\u2019s cylindrical barrel that insert into recesses in the housing body.\u201d <em>Summary Judgment Order, </em>slip op. at 11. Second, the court found that the calculators do \u201cnot have the damping means arranged within one of the cylindrical bores of the lid structure. Rather, the damping means is primarily located within the housing.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">First, because the district court\u2019s conclusion with respect to the trunnion limitation may be affected by our clarified claim construction, we vacate the court\u2019s finding of summary judgment of noninfringement with respect to this term. Second, the district court found that the \u201cdamping means\u201d in the modified design calculators was not arranged within one of the cylindrical bores of the lid structure. Thus, as the parties have argued, the court was apparently focused on the term \u201cwithin.\u201d The difficulty we have in reviewing the district court\u2019s finding regarding this term is not necessarily the finding itself, but rather the court\u2019s analysis which led to its finding. This is so because the full term in context is \u201ca lid operating mechanism including <em>damping means arranged within at least one said cylindrical bore </em>.... \u201d \u2019085 patent, col. 7, ll. 19-20 (emphasis added). As previously discussed, the \u201cdamping means\u201d limitation is a 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, \u00b66 limitation, whose functions are to bias the lid toward a rearwardly pivoted position and effectuate a controlled pivotal motion of the lid. <em>See supra </em>Part II.B.1.b. Additionally, as we have clarified, the corresponding structures are the damping drum 70, the helical coil spring 62, and the damping grease 84. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">\u201cLiteral infringement of a \u00a7 112, \u00b6 6 limitation requires that the relevant structure in the accused device perform the identical function recited in the claim and be identical or equivalent to the corresponding structure in the specification.\u201d <em>Frank\u2019s Casing, </em>389 F.3d at 1378 (quoting <em>Odetics, Inc. v. Storage Tech. Corp., </em>185 F.3d 1259, 1267 (Fed.Cir.1999)). To determine whether a \u00a7 112, \u00b6 6 limitation is literally infringed, \u201cthe court must compare the <em>accused structure </em>with the disclosed structure, and must find <em>equivalent structure </em>as well as <em>identity of claimed function </em>for the structure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis altered) (citation omitted). Although we recognize that the district court was not purporting to find that the modified design calculators lacked the \u201cdamping means\u201d itself, the district court did not identify which structure(s) of the modified design calculators, if any, performs the claimed function of the \u201cdamping means.\u201d It is therefore impossible, on the record before us, to determine whether that yet identified structure is \u201carranged within at least one said cylindrical bore\u201d as required by the claim or whether the district court correctly held on summary judgment that no genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether the modified design calculators satisfy this claim limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>We further note that what appears to be relevant to this inquiry is whether the structure, yet to be identified in the modified design calculators, performs the biasing and effectuating a controlled pivotal motion functions \u201cwithin at least one said cylindrical bore.\u201d Thus, if the relevant structure in the accused calculators is partially arranged within the bore, the appropriate inquiry seems to be whether that portion arranged within the bore is involved in performing the identified functions (i.e., biasing the lid toward a rearwardly pivoted position and effectuating a controlled pivotal motion of the lid). Accordingly, the court\u2019s finding of summary judgment of noninfringement with respect to the modified design calculators must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">Again, we express no opinion with respect to whether summary judgment may ultimately be appropriate in light of the clarified claim construction rulings and the court\u2019s conclusions with respect to the \u00a7 112, \u00b6 6 issue discussed above. We leave that determination to the district court in the first instance after considering any subsequent summary judgment briefing or argument by the parties that the court may deem necessary. If genuine issues of material fact remain as to whether the modified design calculators posses each and every limitation of the claims, then the appropriate conclusion is to deny summary judgment and let the facts be decided at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">c. Double Flipper</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">In its summary judgment opinion, the district court concluded that the double flipper was noninfringing for the same reasons it found that the modified design calculators were noninfringing. Additionally, the court found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-7\">[bjecause there are two closing layers in the double flipper, the lid structure does not cover the display panel in the closed position, nor does it expose the display panel when opened. Instead, when the lid structure covering the display is opened, the second portion of the housing covers the display panel (this second portion of the housing then opens.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AR\"><em>Summary Judgment Order, </em>slip op. at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-10\">On appeal, CCL argues that the district court impermissibly construed the claim term to require that the lid \u201cdirectly\u201d cover and alternatively, \u201cdirectly\u201d expose the display panel. CCL asserts that the presence of an intervening structure does not affect the covering and exposing functions of the lid.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-11\">We disagree. The claim language requires that the lid pivot \u201cbetween <em>the closed position thereof covering said display panel and the reanvardly pivoted position exposing said display panel </em>and forming a stand for supporting said calculator in a tilted position on a horizontal surface.\u201d \u2019085 patent, col. 7, ll. 22-26 (emphasis added). Regardless of whether the lid in the double flipper covers the display panel in the closed position, the district court correctly concluded that when the lid structure opens (i.e., moves toward the rearwardly pivoted position), the display panel is not exposed because a second portion of the housing still covers the display. This finding, that the double flipper lacks a lid structure which exposes the display panel in the rearwardly pivoted position, permits an affirmance of summary judgment of non-infringement because each and every limitation of the claim (i.e., the covering and exposing limitations) does not appear in the double-flipper. <em>See Frank\u2019s Casing, </em>389 F.3d at 1378.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-12\">3. Infringement Under the Doctrine of Equivalents</p>\n<p id=\"b44-13\">While the district court\u2019s examination of the accused calculators and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>court\u2019s findings of infringement were in the context of literal infringement, the court also found that CCL failed to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-5\">produce evidence of the equivalency of Sun Coast\u2019s products and the limitations of claim 1 .... [such that] [t]here is no question of fact here as there has been no evidence presented to the Court of any infringement by an equivalent to the cited claim elements .... on which a reasonable jury could base a finding of equivalence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-6\"><em>Summary Judgment Order, </em>slip op. at 8 n. 5. The court had no reason to formulate its own possible theories of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents when CCL had failed to offer any evidence supporting such a finding. Sun Coast clearly asserted that CCL failed to offer any evidence on infringement under the doctrine of equivalents in its motion for partial summary judgment. Thus, the issue was squarely raised before CCL submitted its opposition brief. Accordingly, there was no obligation for the district court to provide CCL a further opportunity to supplement the record when it failed to present evidence of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents in its brief in opposition to Sun Coast\u2019s summary judgment motion. Further, the district court clarified that it \u201cdid not rely on either ... [the Ram or Bhavnani] declarations in making its findings[,]\u201d contrary to CCL\u2019s assertion that the court improperly relied upon statements made in declarations attached to Sun Coast\u2019s reply brief. <em>Summary Judgment Order, </em>slip op. at 9 n. 6. Therefore, there was no obligation for the court to consider evidence (e.g., Chan\u2019s declaration) that CCL only first presented in its response to the court\u2019s minute order. As such, we do not disturb the court\u2019s findings with respect to infringement under the doctrine of equivalents.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">4. Cross-Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">Sun Coast\u2019s cross-appeal challenges the district court\u2019s denial of attorney fees. Specifically, Sun Coast asserts that the district court committed clear error by not finding that this case was \u201cexceptional\u201d under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285; and abused its discretion by (1) refusing to award fees to Sun Coast under \u00a7 285, (2) alternatively not awarding fees under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927, and (3) alternatively not awarding fees under its inherent powers. CCL asserts in response that the district court\u2019s finding that this case was not exceptional is not clearly erroneous, and that Sun Coast has failed to show that the court abused its discretion in failing to award attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">We detect no clear error or abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s denial of Sun Coast\u2019s motion for attorney fees. First, under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285, the court found that Sun Coast failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence actual wrongful intent or gross negligence by CCL. Although the district court acknowledged that CCL committed numerous violations of the local rules, and an unjustified number of ex parte applications, its conduct did not rise to the level of gross negligence or bad faith and vexatious litigation. \u201cTaken in its totality, the record does not demonstrate with convincing clarity the egregiousness of CCL\u2019s counsel\u2019s conduct or a bad faith and vexatious multiplication of proceedings.\u201d <em>Attorney Fees Order, </em>slip op. at 2. Second, the court similarly rejected Sun Coast\u2019s argument for fees under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927 because the court found that CCL\u2019s counsel had not multiplied the proceedings unreasonably and vexatiously, and found that any protracted proceedings were equally attributable to Sun Coast\u2019s failure to identify all the calculators at issue in its motion for summary judgment. Lastly, the court rejected Sun Coast\u2019s argument for fees un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>der the court\u2019s inherent powers because it found that the conduct of CCL and its counsel was not sufficiently egregious to warrant sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">The district court judge is in the best position, after presiding over the preparation and trial of the case, to \u201cweigh the relevant considerations, such as the closeness of the case, the factics of counsel, the flagrant or good faith character of the parties\u2019 conduct, and any other factors contributing to imposition of punitive sanctions or to fair allocation of the burdens of litigation.\u201d <em>Frank\u2019s Casing, </em>389 F.3d at 1379 (citations omitted); <em>Perricone v. Medicis Pharm. Corp., </em>432 F.3d 1368, 1380-81 (Fed.Cir.2005). The court fully considered Sun Coast\u2019s arguments but found that CCL and its counsel\u2019s conduct was not so egregious as to warrant an award of attorney fees. We can discern no clear error in the district court\u2019s factual findings, nor any abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s ultimate denial of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">Because we have clarified the construction of \u201ctrunnions\u201d and \u201cdamping means\u201d, and several issues remain to be addressed by the district court, we remand for the district court to determine whether Sun Coast\u2019s original and modified designs literally infringe the asserted claims of the \u2019085 patent. These clarifications, however, do not affect the district court\u2019s ultimate conclusion with respect to Sun Coast\u2019s Calc-0050 model because the court\u2019s decision relied upon the lack of the \u201ccovering\u201d and \u201cexposing\u201d limitations, which we have not altered in such a way to create genuine issues of material fact with respect to whether the Calc-0050 infringes claim 1 of the \u2019085 patent. Accordingly, we vacate the summary judgment findings with respect to literal infringement of the original and modified designs, affirm both the summary judgment findings of noninfringement with respect to literal infringement of the Calc-0050 model and noninfringement under the doctrine of equivalents of all calculator models at issue, affirm the district court\u2019s denial of attorney fees, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b39-6\">. This was essentially the district court's claim construction embodied in its <em>Markman </em>opinion, although we have compressed the court\u2019s statements into a one sentence construction. <em>See Markman Opinion, </em>slip op. at 13.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b39-7\">. In the district court\u2019s summary judgment order, it appears that the court may have limited the term \"trunnions\u201d to solid projections (i.e., those that do not contain a recess). While the term as construed in the <em>Markman </em>opinion was limited to some type of projection, thereby excluding a pure recess, there is no subsequent limitation on the projection such that it could not itself include a recess.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b41-7\">. We note that the conclusion that the structure includes the helical coil spring 62 does not violate the doctrine of claim differentiation, even though the district court determined otherwise. Claim 3 explicitly claims \"[a] calculator ... wherein said damping means comprises a helical coil spring ... and a damping drum ....\u201d '085 patent, col. 7, 11. 33-36. Thus, claim 3 explicitly states that the \"damping means\u201d includes a helical coil spring and a damping drum. If including the helical coil spring as part of the structure for the \"damping means\u201d limitation in claim 1 violates the doctrine of claim differentiation, then including the damping drum as part of that structure would do so as well because it is also explicitly referenced in claim 3. Regardless, including the spring and drum as part of the \"damping means\u201d structure does not violate the doctrine of claim differentiation because claim 3 includes several limitations not present in claim 1 pertaining to the orientation and location of the spring and drum in relation to the blind bore and each other.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
