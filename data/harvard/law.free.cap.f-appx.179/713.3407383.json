We presume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the scope of the issues presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-24\">The IJ denied Chen\u2019s claim because he found that Chen\u2019s testimony was not sufficiently credible to satisfy his burden. However, we find two significant errors in the IJ\u2019s credibility analysis. First \u2014 and more seriously \u2014 the IJ appears to have ignored substantial evidence in the record supporting Chen\u2019s claim that his wife had an involuntary abortion. Athough the IJ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>emphasized that Chen\u2019s wife\u2019s check-up booklet does not list the abortion as a \u201cbirth control operation,\u201d [A48, apparently relying on A234] he ignored actual clinical records showing that on November 5, 1999 \u2014 \u201c30 days after induced abortion\u201d\u2014 Chen\u2019s wife reported to the clinic with \u201cpain in lower belly, bleeding for 8 days in vagina.\u201d [A251] The IJ erred by failing to assess this significant evidence corroborating Chen\u2019s claim. <em>See Jin Shui Qiu v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 140, 149 (2d Cir.2003) (holding that each portion of the evidence tending to support an aspect of a claim must be considered unless it is \u201ctoo insignificant to merit discussion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">Second, in finding that Chen\u2019s testimony was \u201centirely inconsistent,\u201d [A48] the IJ cited only one example, Chen\u2019s testimony concerning the intent of the officials who came to his parents\u2019 home and took his wife away for a forcible abortion [A49]. Chen did not testify inconsistently on this point. Rather, his testimony was that when the officials first came to his parents\u2019 home, they said that they were taking his wife away. [A115] He then testified that he was threatened with arrest himself after he engaged in an altercation with the officials. [A117] Although he later said: \u201cThey came just intend to take both of us because we violated birth control policy, he immediately clarified that he only \u201cknew that they planned to take [him] too\u201d after the officials threatened to take him to the station.\u201d [A119] The purported inconsistency, therefore, does not support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Having found these errors and assessed the remaining evidence supporting the IJ\u2019s credibility finding, we \u201ccan[not] \u2018confidently predict\u2019 that the IJ would reach the same decision absent [these] errors.\u201d <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. DOJ, </em>434 F.3d 144, 162 (2d Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Cao He Lin v. DOJ, </em>428 F.3d 391, 395 (2d Cir.2005)). Therefore, Chen-Ben\u2019s petition for review is GRANTED, the decision of the BIA is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED to the BIA with directions to order further proceedings relevant to Chen-Ben\u2019s credibility. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
