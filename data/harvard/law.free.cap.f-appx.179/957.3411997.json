Taylor appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his pre-trial suppression motion and his sentencing as an \u201carmed career criminal,\u201d pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">On March 8, 2004, at approximately 3:00 a.m., a 911 caller<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> reported hearing gun shots coming from a house at 415 N. Central Avenue in Rockford, Illinois. Rockford police officers Ty Eagleson and Michael Schissel were dispatched to that address, the home of Ressie Taylor, who is defendant-appellant Terry Taylor\u2019s mother. When the officers arrived, they saw Terry Taylor walking out of the front door of the house. The officers patted him down, finding nothing, and then locked him in the police squad car. During Taylor\u2019s pat-down, Officer Eagleson observed a spent shotgun casing on the ground near the front porch of the home. Officer Eagleson spoke with Taylor\u2019s mother in the living room of the home, and she told him that she had been awakened by a loud boom that she thought was a gun shot. She also told Officer Eagle-son that after waking, she saw Taylor standing in her living room. After speaking with Taylor\u2019s mother, Officer Eagle-son walked around the exterior of the home, where he found a live shotgun casing and another spent shotgun casing.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">At that point, Terry Taylor\u2019s brother, Otis Taylor, and his nephew, Stephen Neely, arrived at the home. Otis Taylor told Officer Eagleson that Terry Taylor, Neely, and he had been at a club that night and that he had just dropped his brother off at his mother\u2019s home. Shortly after leaving defendant Taylor at his mother\u2019s home, Otis Taylor said, his mother had called him and told him that defendant Taylor had shot a gun in the house. Mr. Neely confirmed to Officer Eagleson that Otis Taylor had received this call from Ressie Taylor and mentioned that defendant Taylor had pointed a shotgun at him while he was sitting in the kitchen of Ressie Taylor\u2019s home the previous evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-8\">Officer Eagleson then reentered the Taylor home and asked Taylor\u2019s mother for permission to search the home. The district court credited the testimony of the police officers that she consented to the search, finding her later testimony to the contrary not credible. In the ensuing search, an officer found an empty box of shotgun shells, but no gun. While the interior search was being conducted, Officer Schissell, using his flashlight, discovered a sawed-off shotgun on the roof of the Taylor home. Officer Schissel also found another live shotgun casing in the back of the squad car where Taylor had been sitting.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-9\">Taylor was charged with unlawfully possessing a firearm as a convicted felon and unlawfully possessing a sawed-off shotgun not registered with the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record. Taylor moved to suppress the physical evidence against him but the district court denied this motion, finding that the warrantless search of the premises was justified by exigent circumstances. The district court also found that, even absent such exigent circumstances, the warrantless search was valid because Taylor\u2019s mother had consented to the search of her home for a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-10\">At trial, a jury convicted Taylor of both charges. At the sentencing hearing, the district court determined that Taylor was an armed career criminal as defined by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). This provision mandates that a person convicted of possessing a firearm as a convicted felon who has three previous violent felony convictions shall be imprisoned for not less than fifteen years. Specifically, the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>found that Taylor qualified for sentencing as an armed career criminal because he had two armed robbery convictions and one conviction for theft from a person. The district court sentenced Taylor to concurrent terms of 300 months\u2019 imprisonment for possession of a firearm as a felon and 120 months\u2019 imprisonment for possession of an unregistered sawed-off shotgun. Taylor now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AWGB\">A. Motion to Suppress</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">Taylor argues that the district court erred in denying his suppression motion because exigent circumstances did not justify the warrantless search of his mother\u2019s home and because there was no consent to the search. This court reviews findings of historical fact and credibility determinations for clear error, <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>170 F.3d 708, 713 (7th Cir.1999), and reviews mixed questions of law and fact, including whether exigent circumstances existed, de novo. <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>208 F.3d 626, 629 (7th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-7\">The test for whether exigent circumstances existed is objective. <em>Richardson, </em>208 F.3d at 629. To justify a warrantless search, \u201cthe government must establish that the circumstances as they appeared at the moment of entry would lead a reasonable, experienced law enforcement officer to believe that someone inside the house, apartment, or hotel room required immediate assistance.\u201d <em>United States v. Arch, </em>7 F.3d 1300, 1304 (7th Cir.1993). This court has held that \u201c911 calls reporting an emergency can be enough to support warrant-less searches under the exigent circumstances exception, particularly where ... the caller identified] himself.\u201d <em>Richardson, </em>208 F.3d at 630. In <em>Richardson, </em>police received a 911 call reporting a rape and murder. Although the caller stated that the crimes were already complete, this court concluded that exigent circumstances still existed to justify a search of the crime scene identified by the caller because the police had a reasonable basis for believing there was a continuing danger. <em>See id. </em>at 631 (noting police testimony that the caller might have mistaken as dead a person who was still alive). Likewise, in <em>United States v. Jenkins, </em>329 F.3d 579, 582 (7th Cir.2003), this court held that exigent circumstances justified an officer\u2019s search when the police received a 911 call regarding an assault and the police officer heard suspicious noises from inside the search premises. The circumstances in <em>Richardson </em>and <em>Jenkins </em>gave rise to the police\u2019s reasonable fear for the safety of someone inside the premises, and thus justified warrantless searches.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-9\">In the instant case, the 911 dispatcher told police that gun shots had been reported in the Taylor home. When the officers arrived they observed Taylor leaving the home and found spent and live shotgun casings on the property. The police spoke to Taylor\u2019s brother and nephew, who provided additional information regarding defendant\u2019s possession of a firearm. Since no gun had been recovered, police did not know if someone inside the home had access to the gun, or whether there might be injured persons inside the home. A police officer confronting this situation could reasonably believe that a threat of violence existed. Therefore, it was reasonable for the officers to check the home to ensure that no one posed a threat to them or anyone else.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-10\">Taylor objects that the 911 call could not create exigent circumstances because the caller did not identify himself. While we have stated that a caller who identifies himself is particularly credible, <em>see Richardson, </em>208 F.3d at 630, unidentified 911 callers may also provide information contributing to the police\u2019s reasonable belief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>that exigent circumstances exist. Here, the information given to the 911 dispatcher was confirmed by Taylor\u2019s mother upon police\u2019s arrival at the home. The initial ambiguity of the caller\u2019s identity does not undermine the police\u2019s reasonable conclusion that a threat of danger existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">Taylor also objects that the circumstances police confronted at his home are distinguishable from the exigent circumstances existing in <em>Richardson </em>and <em>Jenkins </em>because the situation at his home was more stable than those the police encountered in those cases. Specifically, Taylor claims that because he, the suspect, was sequestered in a police squad car and police had not encountered any other violent activity, any exigency that may have existed had dissipated before the search of the home. Taylor\u2019s argument, however, benefits from too much hindsight. When the police detained Taylor in their car, they had not found the gun, and they did not know if he was the person who had fired shots. Taylor did not admit his guilt to the police, so the officers could have reasonably believed that the gunman was still inside the home. As discussed above, the police also needed to ascertain whether any victims were present inside the home. The threat of a remaining gunman and the fear of remaining victims justified the police\u2019s further searching of the Taylor home even after Taylor was in custody. The district court therefore correctly denied Richardson\u2019s suppression motion because the warrantless search fell within the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">Moreover, we note that even if the search of the Taylor home was not justified by exigent circumstances, it was justified by Ressie Taylor\u2019s consent. Voluntary consent to a search is an exception to the warrant requirement. <em>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 219, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973). It is undisputed that Taylor\u2019s mother owned the house at 415 N. Central Avenue and had authority to consent to the search of her home. At the suppression hearing, Officers Eagleson and Schissel testified that Taylor\u2019s mother consented to a search of the home for the gun. She testified that she did not consent. The district court, weighing her credibility against that of the officers, concluded that she consented to the search. While Taylor maintains that no consent was given, he does not point to any factors that would undermine the district court\u2019s finding. The district court\u2019s credibility assessment is accorded substantial deference and will only be disturbed if exceedingly improbable testimony is credited. <em>United States v. Cardona-Rivera, </em>904 F.2d 1149, 1152 (7th Cir.1990); <em>see also United States v. Thornton, </em>197 F.3d 241, 247 (7th Cir.1999) (\u201cIn a swearing contest, the trial judge\u2019s choice of whom to believe will not be rejected unless the judge credited exceedingly improbable testimony.\u201d). Such a showing of improbability has not been made here, and thus the district court\u2019s denial of the suppression motion is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-7\">B. Taylor\u2019s Sentencing as an Armed Career Criminal</p>\n<p id=\"b986-8\">The second issue presented in this appeal is whether the district court properly determined that Taylor was an armed career criminal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). The armed career criminal provision of Section 924 requires a fifteen-year minimum prison sentence for anyone convicted under Section 922(g) of unlawfully possessing a firearm as a convicted felon who has three prior \u201cviolent felony\u201d or \u201cserious drug offense\u201d convictions. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). According to Section 924(e)(2)(B), \u201cviolent felony\u201d means any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-9\">(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>against the person of another; or (ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b987-6\">It is undisputed that Taylor has three prior convictions: two for armed robbery and one for theft from a person. The two armed robberies are unquestionably \u201cviolent felonies\u201d under Section 924(e)(1), but Taylor argues that his Illinois conviction for \u201ctheft from a person\u201d does not fall within the statutory definition of a violent felony. Taylor\u2019s argument rests primarily on a document filed by the State\u2019s Attorney regarding that conviction which indicated that no violence was used in Taylor\u2019s theft. The government argues that this document is irrelevant because it was filed six days after the defendant\u2019s guilty plea and thus was not part of the trial judge\u2019s factual findings. The relevant portion of this document recounted the facts of the case and stated: \u201cThe defendant handed [the cashier] some money and when she opened the cash drawer the defendant took the cash drawer and he and the other man left the business. [The cashier] was not threatened or hurt in any way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b987-7\">In determining that the theft charge was a \u201cviolent felony\u201d as defined by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1), the district court looked to the charging document, the statutory elements of the offense, and a transcript of the plea colloquy. The district court did not consider the statement made by the State\u2019s Attorney after the defendant pled guilty to the theft charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-8\">This court has previously concluded that theft from a person constitutes a violent felony under Section 924. <em>See United States v. Howze, </em>343 F.3d 919 (7th Cir. 2003). In <em>Howze, </em>the defendant had three prior convictions, one of which was for \u201ctheft from a person\u201d under Minnesota law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>Howze, </em>we described the manner in which a court should determine whether a crime is classified as a violent felony for the purposes of the armed career criminal determination. Citing <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahk0\">first, that classification depends on the nature of the offense as defined in the criminal code rather than either the label the state applies or the specific acts the defendant committed, and second, that the best way to determine which offenses count as \u201cburglary\u201d for the purposes of federal law is to determine which offenses pose risks that force will be used.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b987-11\"><em>Howze, </em>343 F.3d at 921. Following this framework, we first examined the theft from a person statute in question. We then noted that \u201c[w]hat theft from a person has in common with generic burglary is that both entail a risk that violence will erupt between the thief and the victim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 923. We also noted that thefts from persons create \u201cthe potential not only for violence but also for injury caused by the act of taking.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 924. On the basis of this reasoning, we concluded that theft from a person is a violent felony under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924. <em>Id. </em>at 924 (overruling <em>United States v. Lee, </em>22 F.3d 736 (7th Cir. 1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b987-12\">Taylor argues only that the situation in this case can be distinguished from that in <em>Howze </em>because the document filed by the State\u2019s Attorney describes the acts underlying Taylor\u2019s theft conviction as nonviolent. However, the Supreme Court recent<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>ly cautioned that any inquiry beyond the statute and charging document in determining what constitutes a \u201cviolent felony\u201d must be narrowly restricted to implement the objective of the statute and avoid evidentiary disputes. <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 1261 n. 4, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005). This court recently discussed the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Shepard </em>and observed that sentencing courts should not look to police reports or complaint applications in assessing whether particular crimes implicate the Armed Career Criminal Act. <em>See United States v. McGee, </em>408 F.3d 966, 988 (7th Cir.2005). We held that later courts consideling whether crimes constitute violent felonies are \u201cgenerally limited to examining the statutory definition, charging document, written plea agreement, transcript of plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Shepard, </em>125 S.Ct. at 1257). The document that Taylor claims the district court should have considered is not within the scope of documents that may be considered, and was never considered by the state trial judge or the defendant when he pled guilty to theft from a person. Thus, the district court was correct not to consider it in the assessment of whether Taylor had committed three prior \u201cviolent felonies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">Taylor finally argues that the Sixth Amendment required the district court to submit the question of whether Taylor was an armed career criminal to the jury, citing <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). However, <em>Booker </em>stated that \u201c[a]ny fact <em>(other than a prior </em>conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 244, 125 S.Ct. 738 (emphasis added). Furthermore, Taylor\u2019s argument has been specifically rejected by this court. In <em>United States v. Sperberg, </em>432 F.3d 706, 707 (7th Cir.2005), we held that prior convictions are an exception to the rule that juries determine all facts that affect maximum available punishments, and specifically concluded that a defendant\u2019s status as an armed career criminal need not be submitted to a jury. The district court appropriately determined Taylor\u2019s armed career criminal status, and we reject Taylor\u2019s Sixth Amendment argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b988-8\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b984-6\">. Appellant Taylor claims that the officers did not know the identity of the caller, who he claims was actually his brother. The State claims that the caller identified herself as Ressie Taylor, Taylor\u2019s mother. For the purposes of this appeal, we assume that the identity of the caller was unknown.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b987-9\">. There is no relevant distinction between the Minnesota statute under which the defendant in <em>Howze </em>was convicted and the Illinois statute at issue here. <em>See </em>Minn.Stat. \u00a7 609.52(3)(3)(d)(1); 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/16 \u2014 1(b)(4) (2005). Taylor has not argued that there is a distinction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
