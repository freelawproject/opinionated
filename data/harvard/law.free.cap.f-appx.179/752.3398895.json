We presume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the scope of the issues presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-19\">The regulations allow an alien to seek reopening to reapply for asylum based on changed circumstances that materially affect his eligibility for asylum. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1003.2(c); 1208.4(a)(4). Here, however, the BIA reasonably rejected Zheng\u2019s claim that he feared persecution due to the birth of his U.S. citizen children. <em>See Jian Xing Huang v. INS, </em>421 F.3d 125, 129 (2d Cir.2005) (finding that, \u201c[i]n the absence of solid support in the record\u201d for petitioner\u2019s assertion that he will be subjected to persecution on account of his two U.S. born children, \u201chis fear is speculative at best\u201d). Zheng argues that the BIA\u2019s decision was contrary to law, because it ignored the evidence on the record, <em>i.e., </em>the 2002 Congressional testimony and affidavit of John Aird asserting that China\u2019s coercive family planning policies extend to those individuals who have children abroad. <em>See </em>Petitioner\u2019s Brief at 9-10. However, the testimony and affidavit were previously available to Zheng and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>thus could have been discovered or presented at the former hearing. Moreover, it is clear that the BIA implicitly considered and reasonably rejected this evidence as establishing changed country conditions. <em>See Wei Guang Wang v. BIA, </em>437 F.3d 270, 275 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">Exhaustion of administrative remedies is statutorily required for aliens challenging final orders of removal, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1), and requires exhaustion of bases for relief and issues, although not subsidiary legal arguments. <em>See Gill v. INS, </em>420 F.3d 82, 86 (2d Cir.2005). This Court has noted that the BIA does not have jurisdiction to adjudicate constitutional issues. <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Roque, </em>301 F.3d 39, 48 (2d Cir.2002). However, the BIA can decide issues underlying fairness of process, and the appeal could have provided Zheng with the possibility of relief. <em>See id. </em>at 47-48. It was therefore necessary for Zheng to argue to the BIA that he was denied due process during his immigration hearing because his interpreter did not speak his native Foo Chow dialect in order to satisfy the exhaustion requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
