Maye also appeals the October 2, 2003 dismissal by the district court of the amended complaint as to District Attorney Michael Arcuri. Familiarity is assumed as to the facts, the procedural context, and the specification of appellate issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">(1) The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require a complaint to contain \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d Rule 8(a), Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 8 also requires that \u201ceach averment of a pleading shall be simple, concise, and direct.\u201d Rule 8(e)(1), Fed.R.Civ.P. There is no error or First Amendment violation where a district court insists that a plaintiff revise his complaint to comply with the pleading requirements of the Federal Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">(2) The claims against Arcuri were dismissed by stipulation on the eve of oral argument. That stipulation is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">(3) Maye\u2019s conspiracy claim was properly dismissed by the district court. Maye failed to allege adequately that, even assuming the parties conspired against him, they conspired to violate Maye\u2019s constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-9\">(4) Maye\u2019s stigma-plus claim was also properly dismissed because he failed to adduce evidence that stigmatizing statements were made in relation to his termination. <em>See Patterson v. Julian, </em>370 F.3d 322, 330 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-11\">We have considered Maye\u2019s remaining arguments and find them all to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
