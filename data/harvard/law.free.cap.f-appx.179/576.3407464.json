Three of Mandhai\u2019s arguments are not properly before this Court. Mandhai\u2019s remaining argument \u2014 that the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence \u2014 is without merit. We dismiss in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-26\">This is Mandhai\u2019s third time before this Court, and the factual background of his conviction has been thoroughly recounted in our previous decisions. <em>United States v. Mandhai, </em>375 F.3d 1243 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(Mandhai I); see also United States v. Mandhai, </em>140 Fed.Appx. 54 (11th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>2005) (unpublished) <em>(Mandhai II). </em>In <em>Mandhai II, </em>this Court vacated Mandhai\u2019s sentence because of statutory error under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). 140 Fed.Appx. at 56. We also affirmed the decision of the district court to consider rehable hearsay at Mandhai\u2019s sentencing hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 55-56. We remanded the appeal for the limited purpose of resentencing Mandhai under the advisory guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">In this appeal Mandhai presents four arguments. Mandhai argues that the district court erroneously applied the terrorism enhancement, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.4; the district court considered hearsay evidence at the sentencing hearing in violation of <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004); the district court relied on unreliable evidence at the sentencing hearing; and the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Mandhai\u2019s first three arguments, two of which were rejected in his earlier appeals, are not properly before this Court because his arguments were not \u2014 and could not have been \u2014 before the district court. The mandate issued by this Court in Mandhai\u2019s second appeal remanded the case for the limited purpose of resentencing under the advisory guidelines. <em>Mandhai II, </em>140 Fed.Appx. at 56. \u201cOur settled circuit law obligates a district court to follow our mandates and not to assert jurisdiction over matters outside the scope of a limited mandate.\u201d <em>United States v. Tamayo, </em>80 F.3d 1514, 1520 (11th Cir.1996) (citations omitted). Our jurisdiction arises from the final decision of the district court, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, so this Court likewise lacks jurisdiction to review these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">Mandhai\u2019s only argument properly before this Court is that the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence. Mandhai argues that the sentence is unreasonable because it is greater than necessary under the statutory factors, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), but we disagree. The district court carefully and explicitly considered each of the section 3553(a) factors and found that a sentence of 168 months of imprisonment\u2014the minimum guidelines sentence\u2014was appropriate. We cannot say, in the light of the conduct to which Mandhai pleaded guilty and the sentencing factors, that Mandhai\u2019s sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">DISMISSED in part and AFFIRMED in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
