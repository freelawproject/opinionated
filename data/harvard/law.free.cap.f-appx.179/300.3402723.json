Mitchell White sued defendant UPS Autogistics, a subsid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>iary of United Parcel Service, alleging that Autogistics demoted him due to his age and retaliated against him after his demotion in violation of Michigan\u2019s Elliot-Larsen Civil Rights Act, Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 37.2101. White claims that his superior, John Wutschel, told him that he was \u201cblocking the slot\u201d of two younger employees, a statement that he alleges is indicative of age discrimination. White alleges that his later investigation and demotion were driven by this discriminatory animus.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The district court granted UPS Autogistics\u2019s motion for summary judgment, holding that White made no showing that his demotion was causally connected to Wutschel\u2019s comment and could not make out a prima facie case of discrimination because he put forth no evidence that a similarly-situated individual had been treated differently. As to retaliation, the court held that White failed to show a causal link between the alleged age discrimination and his demotion, and failed to show that he was subject to an adverse employment action after his demotion. White filed a motion for reconsideration, which the district court denied. White now appeals both the order granting summary judgment and the order denying reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">After reviewing the record, the parties\u2019 briefs and the applicable law, we determine that a panel opinion further addressing the issues raised would serve no jurisprudential purpose. Therefore, on the grounds identified by the district court, we affirm both the district court\u2019s February 24, 2005, grant of summary judgment for UPS Autogistics and its March 15, 2005, denial of reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
