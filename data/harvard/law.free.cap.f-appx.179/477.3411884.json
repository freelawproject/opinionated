ANDERSON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b503-26\">After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unani<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>mously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">Defendant-Appellant Raul Obando-Landa, a citizen of Peru, pled guilty to one count of reentry of a deported alien previously convicted of an aggravated felony, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a)(1), (a)(2) and (b)(2). He was sentenced to forty-six months\u2019 imprisonment, which was based in part upon a sixteen-level enhancement of his total offense level under the United States Sentencing Commission, <em>Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d), \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A) (Nov. 2004), which in turn was based upon the district court\u2019s characterization of Obando-Landa\u2019s prior New York state conviction for attempted robbery in the third degree as a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d He appeals his sentence on the sole ground that the district court erred in applying that enhancement in its determination of his sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">On April 5, 2004, United States Border Patrol authorities encountered Obando-Landa on a Greyhound bus at a Border Patrol checkpoint in Dona Ana County, New Mexico. When questioned about his citizenship, Obando-Landa admitted that he was a national and citizen of Peru, but claimed he was a legal permanent resident alien, although he lacked documentation of that status. He was accordingly detained, and further investigation revealed that he possessed no immigration documents authorizing his presence in the United States. Immigration authorities also discovered that Obando-Landa had previously been deported from the United States in 1996, subsequent to his conviction in New York for attempted third-degree robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-11\">Obando-Landa thereafter pled guilty to illegally reentering the country after previously being deported following conviction for an aggravated felony, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a)(1), (a)(2) and (b)(2). A presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) was prepared, which calculated a base offense level of eight and then increased that by sixteen levels pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) because of Obando-Landa\u2019s prior deportation after his conviction for a felony that is a crime of violence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After a three-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, Obando-Landa was assigned a total offense level of twenty-one. With a criminal history category of III, the advisory sentencing range under the Guidelines was forty-six to fifty-seven months.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-12\">Obando-Landa objected to the sixteen-level enhancement recommended by the PSR, arguing that the attempted robbery conviction does not qualify as a crime of violence under Tenth Circuit precedent. Obando-Landa reiterated that objection at his sentencing hearing. Obando-Landa also sought a downward departure based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>upon a history of mental illness.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The district court denied Obando-Landa\u2019s objection, finding, with respect to the sixteen-level enhancement, that \u201cthe Guidelines have been appropriately calculated in this instance.\u201d Tr. of Sentencing at 11, App. Vol. I at 31. The court then sentenced Obando-Landa to forty-six months. Obando-Landa appeals, challenging only the sixteen-level enhancement based upon the characterization of his attempted third-degree robbery conviction as a conviction for a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">Following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the federal sentencing Guidelines are advisory. Nonetheless, because sentencing courts are required to \u201cconsider\u201d the properly-calculated Guidelines sentencing range, <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Huerta, </em>403 F.3d 727, 748-49 (10th Cir.) (en banc) (internal quotation omitted), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 495, 163 L.Ed.2d 375 (2005), we continue to review the sentencing court\u2019s factual findings under the Guidelines for clear error and its legal determinations de novo. <em>United States v. Serrata, </em>425 F.3d 886, 906 (10th Cir.2005). We review for reasonableness the ultimate sentence imposed. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 261-62, 125 S.Ct. 738 (Breyer, J.). \u201c[A] sentence that is properly calculated under the Guidelines is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness.\u201d <em>United States v. Kristl, </em>437 F.3d 1050, 1054 (10th Cir .2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">USSG \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) requires a sixteen-level enhancement \u201c[i]f the defendant previously was deported ... after ... a conviction for a felony that is ... a crime of violence.\u201d The application notes specifically state that a \u201c \u2018[cjrime of violence\u2019 means any of the following: ... robbery ... or any offense under federal, state, or local law that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.1(B)(iii)). Additionally, the application notes state that \u201c[p]rior convictions of offenses counted under subsection (b)(1) include the offenses of ... attempting[ ] to commit such offenses.\u201d <em>Id., </em>comment, (n.5).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-13\">Generally speaking, we interpret the Sentencing Guidelines according to accepted rules of statutory construction. In interpreting a guideline, we look at the language in the guideline itself, as well as at the interpretative and explanatory commentary to the guideline provided by the Sentencing Commission. Commentary in the Guidelines Manual that interprets or explains a guideline is authoritative unless it violates the Constitution or a federal statute, or is inconsistent with, or a plainly erroneous reading of, that guideline.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-14\"><em>United States v. Torres-Ruiz, </em>387 F.3d 1179, 1181 (10th Cir.2004) (citations, internal quotation, and alteration marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-15\">When we consider generally whether a prior conviction was for a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under USSG \u00a7 2L1.2, we employ the \u201ccategorical approach.\u201d <em>United States v. Martinez-Hemandez, </em>422 F.3d 1084, 1086 (10th Cir.2005). This entails looking at \u201cthe elements of the [state] statute under which [the defendant] had been convicted,\u201d <em>id., </em>to determine whether those elements require \u201cthe use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d However, our inquiry in this case is even more straightforward. The commentary to USSG \u00a7 2L1.2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>specifically lists \u201crobbery\u201d as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of the Guideline. It also specifically includes \u201cattempts\u201d to commit a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d within the definition of such a crime. We have cited with approval the Sentencing Commission\u2019s explanation for its 2003 amendment of the definition of crime of violence in \u00a7 2L1.2, where the Commission expressly stated that the amended, and current, definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d \u201c \u2018makes clear that the enumerated offenses are always classified as \u201ccrimes of violence,\u201d regardless of whether the prior offense expressly has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Munguia-Sanchez, </em>365 F.3d 877, 881 (10th Cir.2004) (quoting USSG app. C (vol.II), amend. 658, at 401-02 (Supp.2003)) (emphasis omitted); <em>see also Torres-Ruiz, </em>387 F.3d at 1182 (employing the categorical approach because the particular crime \u201cis not specifically included in \u00a7 2L1.2 as a \u2018crime of violence\u2019 \u201d). Thus, \u201crobbery,\u201d as an enumerated offense, falls within the definition of a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d And, because \u201cattempts\u201d to commit such crimes also are expressly included, Obando-Landa\u2019s attempted third-degree robbery conviction subjects him to the sixteen-level enhancement contained in USSG \u00a7 2L1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">Moreover, were we to employ the categorical approach and inquire whether a conviction for attempted third-degree robbery under New York statutory law qualifies as an \u201coffense under ... state ... law that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2, we would conclude that it does. N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 160.05 defines third-degree robbery as \u201cforcibly stealing] property.\u201d Further, \u201c[a] person forcibly steals property and commits robbery when, in the course of committing a larceny, he uses or threatens the immediate use of physical force upon another person ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 160.00. Those statutory definitions clearly require \u201cthe use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We conclude that the district court properly applied the sixteen-level enhancement under USSG \u00a7 2L1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">Obando-Landa makes no other argument about the reasonableness of his sentence, and we find it reasonable as <em>Booker </em>requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM Obando-Landa\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b503-28\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b504-8\">. The PSR stated the following concerning that felony conviction:</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">On February 6, 1991, the defendant was sentenced to 1 year custody for the crime of Attempted Robbery-3 in the Queens County Superior Court, New York, Case No. 02020-90. Pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2 <em>Commentary, </em>Application Note B(iii), a \"crime of violence\u201d means ... robbery ... or any offense under federal, state, or local law that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-14\">PSR \u00b6 10, Sealed Appellee\u2019s Supp.App. Vol. II.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b505-11\">.

In interpreting an earlier version of USSG \u00a7 2L1.2, the Second Circuit held that a \u201cconviction of attempted robbery in the third degree [under New York law] constituted an \u2018aggravated felony\u2019 under [USSG] \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A).\u201d <em>United States v.

The <em>Fernandez-Antonia </em>court applied a version of the Guidelines in which \"aggravated felony\u201d for purposes of USSG \u00a7 2L1.2 included a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16, which, in turn, defined a \"crime of violence\u201d as \"an offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another.\u201d <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2L1.2 (Nov.2000); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
