Nyberg appeals the district court\u2019s order affirming the decision of the Social Security Commissioner (the \u201cCommissioner\u201d) denying her claim for disability and disability insurance benefits under the Social Security Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According to Nyberg, the administrative law judge (the \u201cALJ\u201d) committed reversible error when, in the course of determining that Nyberg was not disabled, he failed to acknowledge or address the opinion of Dr. Myrna Trow-bridge, a treating physician.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Commissioner responds that any such error was harmless, and argues that substantial evidence supports her decision. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">I. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">In a social security appeal, our review is limited to determining whether the ALJ\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence, and whether the correct legal standards were applied. <em>See Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1439 (11th Cir.1997); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). \u201cSubstantial evidence is defined as more than a scintilla, i.e., evidence that must do more than create a suspicion of the existence of the fact to be established, and such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support the conclusion.\u201d <em>Foote v. Chater, </em>67 F.3d 1553, 1560 (11th Cir.1995) (per curiam) (internal citation omitted). \u201cThis limited review precludes deciding the facts anew, making credibility determinations, or re-weighing the evidence.\u201d <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). \u2018We cannot, however, conduct a review that is both limited and meaningful if the ALJ does not state with sufficient clarity the legal rules being applied and the weight accorded the evidence considered.\u201d <em>Ryan v. Heckler, </em>762 F.2d 939, 941 (11th Cir.1985). Thus, the ALJ must develop a full and fair record, and evaluate all the relevant evidence. <em>See Cowart v. Schweiker, </em>662 F.2d 731, 735 (11th Cir.1981). \u201c[W]e evaluate the [ALJ\u2019s] findings in light of the entire record, not only that evidence which supports [his] position.\u201d <em>Owens v. Heckler, </em>748 F.2d 1511, 1515 (11th Cir.1984) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-13\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b616-14\">In describing the proper evaluation of opinion evidence on disability claims, the Social Security Administration (\u201cSSA\u201d) states the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-15\">Generally, we give more weight to opinions from your treating sources, since these sources are likely to be the medical professionals most able to provide a detailed, longitudinal picture of your medical impairments) and may bring a unique perspective to the medical evidence that cannot be obtained from the objective medical findings alone or from reports of individual examinations, such as consultative examinations or brief hospitalizations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-16\">20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Indeed, the ALJ \u201cmust specify what weight is given to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>a treating physician\u2019s opinion and any reason for giving it no weight, and failure to do so is reversible error.\u201d <em>MacGregor v. Bowen, </em>786 F.2d 1050, 1053 (11th Cir. 1986); <em>see Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1159 (11th Cir.2004) (per curiam) (ALJ must accord substantial or considerable weight to opinion of treating physician unless \u201cgood cause\u201d is shown to the contrary); <em>Broughton v. Heckler, </em>776 F.2d 960, 961-62 (11th Cir.1985) (per curiam) (same); <em>see also Wiggins v. Schweiker, </em>679 F.2d 1387, 1390 (11th Cir. 1982) (ALJ\u2019s failure to mention appellant\u2019s treating physician and the weight, if any, given to the treating physician\u2019s opinion constituted grounds for reversal). An ALJ\u2019s \u201clack of explanation\u201d for failing to address a treating physician\u2019s opinion is \u201cparticularly troublesome\u201d when that physician was the claimant\u2019s \u201clong-time treating physician.\u201d <em>Ryan, </em>762 F.2d at 942.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">In the instant case, it is uncontroverted that the reports of Dr. Trowbridge were part of the record, and that the ALJ failed to address Dr. Trowbridge\u2019s opinion regarding Nyberg\u2019s condition and limitations during the relevant time period: June 1, 2000 (the alleged date of onset of Nyberg\u2019s disability) through September 30, 2001 (the date Nyberg\u2019s disability insured status expired). Even so, the Commissioner argues, Dr. Trowbridge was not really a \u201ctreating\u201d physician, at least insofar as Nyberg\u2019s claimed disability involved Parkinson\u2019s disease. Dr. Trowbridge, the Commissioner points out, indicated on a June 2002 \u201cAttending Physician\u2019s Initial Statement of Disability\u201d form (the \u201cdisability form\u201d) that she (Trowbridge) was treating Nyberg\u2019s hypothyroidism, while Dr. Jennifer Pallone was \u201cin charge of the Parkinson\u2019s [and] the depression.\u201d As noted above, a treating physician is one who not only provides (or has provided) the claimant with medical treatment or evaluation, but also has (or has had) an \u201congoing treatment relationship\u201d with the claimant. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1502. A claimant generally has an \u201congoing treatment relationship\u201d with a physician when medical evidence establishes that the claimant sees or has seen the physician \u201cwith a frequency consistent with accepted medical practice for the type of treatment and/or evaluation required for [the claimant\u2019s] medical condition(s).\u201d <em>Id. </em>The record indicates that Dr. Trowbridge treated Nyberg on numerous occasions throughout the relevant time period, made notes as to Nyberg\u2019s tremors and \u201chemiparkmsonism,\u201d and referred her to (and received updates from) various other medical professionals, including Dr. Pallone. Thus, the Commissioner\u2019s argument fails to persuade us that Dr. Trowbridge was not a treating physician (i.e., a \u201ctreating source\u201d) within the meaning of \u00a7 404.1502.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">Even if Dr. Trowbridge was a treating physician, the Commissioner argues, the ALJ\u2019s failure to consider her opinion was harmless error, because the opinion did not contradict the ALJ\u2019s findings and was unsupported by objective medical evidence. As the Commissioner points out, Nyberg takes issue with the ALJ\u2019s statement that \u201cno treating physician has expressed the opinion that the claimant has limitations greater than those determined in this decision.\u201d One reason Nyberg does so is that Dr. Trowbridge stated on the disability form that Nyberg\u2019s limitations had been \u201cslowly progressing] since spring of 2000\u201d; i.e., gradually getting worse. This observation, the Commissioner contends, is vague, and does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>really conflict with the ALJ\u2019s determination that Nyberg\u2019s condition and limitations were not so severe at the time her insured status expired (in September of 2001) as to prevent her from working at certain jobs then existing in the national economy in significant numbers. Furthermore, the Commissioner argues, any indication to the contrary inferred from Dr. Trowbridge\u2019s reports would be unsupported by objective medical evidence. <em>See Crawford, </em>368 F.3d at 1159 (treating physician\u2019s report can be discounted when it is unaccompanied \u201cby objective medical evidence or wholly conclusory\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">In essence, the Commissioner contends (and the district court believed) that, even if the ALJ had considered Dr. Trow-bridge\u2019s opinion, the outcome of the case could not reasonably have changed. <em>See Diorio v. Heckler, </em>721 F.2d 726, 728 (11th Cir.1983) (ALJ\u2019s mischaraeterization of claimant\u2019s past work was harmless error, because such characterization of vocational factors was irrelevant where the ALJ found no severe impairment). The instant case, however, is not one where the unmentioned physician\u2019s opinion merely supported the ALJ\u2019s conclusion, and was thus unnecessary. <em>See Wilson v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>378 F.3d 541, 547 (6th Cir.2004).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On the contrary, the potential impact of Dr. Trowbridge\u2019s opinion on the ALJ\u2019s analysis is strongly and reasonably disputed by the parties.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, we cannot say that the failure to address Dr. Trow-bridge\u2019s opinion was harmless without reweighing the evidence and engaging in conjecture that invades the province of the ALJ. <em>See Moore, </em>405 F.3d at 1214 (stating that, where ALJ failed to consider certain factors and indicate their impact on his ultimate conclusion as to claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity, we \u201c[could not] even evaluate the Commissioner\u2019s contention that the ALJ\u2019s error was harmless\u201d); <em>Wiggins, </em>679 F.2d at 1390 (remanding where we were \u201cunable to determine whether the ALJ applied the proper legal standard and gave the treating physician\u2019s evidence substantial or considerable weight or found good cause not to do so\u201d); <em>Wilson, </em>378 F.3d at 546 (\u201cA court cannot excuse the denial of a mandatory procedural protection simply because, as the Commissioner urges, there is sufficient evidence in the record for the ALJ to discount the treating source\u2019s opinion and, thus, a different outcome on remand is unlikely.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">Contrary to the judgment of the district court, we cannot say that the ALJ\u2019s failure to consider Dr. Trowbridge\u2019s opinion was harmless. The judgment of the district court is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded with instructions to remand the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>matter to the ALJ for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b616-8\">. The parties consented, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c), to a magistrate judge conducting the district court proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b616-9\">. Although Nyberg also contends that the ALJ should have re-contacted Dr. Trowbridge, Nyberg did not raise this argument before the district court. Accordingly, we will not consider it here. <em>See Passopulos v. Sullivan, </em>976 F.2d 642, 645 (11th Cir.1992) (citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b616-18\">. A \"treating source\" (i.e., a treating physician) is a claimant's \"own physician, psychologist, or other acceptable medical source who provides you, or has provided you, with medi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>cal treatment or evaluation and who has, or has had, an ongoing treatment relationship with you.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1502.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b618-5\">. The Commissioner states, for example, that there is no evidence Dr. Trowbridge ever conducted a functional capacities evaluation of Nyberg to help determine the extent of her limitations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b618-6\">. Nor has it been shown that Dr. Trow-bridge\u2019s opinion was \u201cso patently deficient that the Commissioner could not possibly credit it,\u201d or that the Commissioner clearly met the goal of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(2) even though she did not comply with its terms. <em>See Wilson, </em>378 F.3d at 547.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b618-7\">. Notably, the Commissioner\u2019s position on this issue appears somewhat inconsistent. Although the Commissioner contends initially that Dr. Trowbridge\u2019s opinion did not conflict with the ALJ\u2019s determination regarding Nyberg\u2019s limitations, the Commissioner then claims that \"Dr. Trowbridge\u2019s purported opinion concerning [Nyberg's] limitations conflicts with the medical findings of Dr. Pal-lone,\u201d which the ALJ relied upon heavily. Indeed, Dr. Trowbridge\u2019s reports seem to indicate that Nyberg\u2019s tremors were only growing worse over time, while the ALJ concluded that the tremors had been significantly reduced through medication by August of 2001.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
