Williams appeals from the district court\u2019s order denying his motion to modify the terms of his supervised release. A notice of appeal in a criminal case must be filed within ten days of the entry of judgment being appealed. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1). The district court, upon a finding of excusable neglect or good cause, may extend the time period for filing a notice of appeal an additional thirty days. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4). The appeal periods established by Rule 4 are mandatory and jurisdictional. <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978); <em>United States v. Raynor, </em>939 F.2d 191, 197 (4th Cir.1991). The district court entered its judgment on July 14, 2005, and Williams filed his notice of appeal on September 9, 2005, outside the thirty-day excusable neglect period. As Williams\u2019 appeal is untimely,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we dismiss his appeal for lack of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-22\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b917-19\">. Williams cannot claim reliance on the district court's order mistakenly stating Williams had sixty days to appeal, because litigants have a duty to familiarize themselves with the Federal Rules and cannot claim to rely on rulings by the district court that are plainly in violation of those rules. <em>Panhorst v. United States, </em>241 F.3d 367, 373 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b917-24\">. Further, even if we possessed jurisdiction to review the merits of Williams' appeal, we would have no difficulty concluding the district court acted well within its legal authority and discretion in denying Williams\u2019 motion to modify the terms of his supervised release.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
