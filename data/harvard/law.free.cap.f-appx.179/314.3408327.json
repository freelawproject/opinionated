Bright, United States Circuit Judge for the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b340-18\">JULIA SMITH GIBBONS, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b340-19\">Reverend Troy D. Ogle, an international evangelist formerly affiliated with the Church of God, sued Reverend Rick Hocker, a Church of God pastor, for defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The suit\u2019s central allegation was that Hocker made false statements concerning Ogle\u2019s sexuality. Hocker invoked the ecclesiastical abstention doctrine and moved to dismiss the suit pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1). Alternatively, he argued that he was entitled to summary judgment on the merits of Ogle\u2019s defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-20\">The district court rejected Hocker\u2019s ecclesiastical abstention argument but granted him summary judgment on Ogle\u2019s defamation claim. In its order granting summary judgment, the district court explained that Hocker\u2019s alleged statements were not actionable under Michigan defamation law. The order did not dispose of Ogle\u2019s intentional infliction of emotional distress claim, and the district court did not certify an interlocutory appeal. Ogle timely appealed to this court, raising arguments in support of his defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-21\">We dismiss Ogle\u2019s appeal because \u201cwe must <em>sua sponte </em>police our own jurisdiction, regardless of whether the parties challenged jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Ohio v. Doe, </em>433 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>F.3d 502, 506 (6th Cir.2006). Our appellate jurisdiction is limited to final judgments rendered by the district courts, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, unless a district court certifies an interlocutory appeal, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b). We may review \u201ca decision by the District Court ... [only if it] ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment. <em>\"Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Risjord, </em>449 U.S. 368, 373, 101 S.Ct. 669, 66 L.Ed.2d 571 (1981) (internal quotation omitted); <em>see also Mississippi Valley Equip. Co. v. Slurry Sys., Inc., </em>948 F.2d 1289, 1289 (6th Cir.1991) (table) (indicating that this court may review an order issued by the district court only \u201cif it leaves nothing remaining for the district court to do except execute final judgment\u201d). Therefore, \u201can order disposing of fewer than all the ... claims in an action is nonappealable\u201d to this court. <em>Mississippi Valley, </em>948 F.2d at 1289. Accordingly, we dismiss Ogle\u2019s appeal for want of jurisdiction because the district court order failed to dispose of the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
