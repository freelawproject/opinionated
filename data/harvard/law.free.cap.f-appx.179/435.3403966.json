Shadur, Senior United States District Judge for the Northern District of Illinois, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b462-9\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">Villareal appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, challenging his state-court jury conviction for first degree murder. The district court rejected Villareal\u2019s assertion that the trial court erred in admitting the testimony of Mendoza, the victim\u2019s husband, because Mendoza was not subject to confrontation as required by the Sixth Amendment. We review de novo the district court\u2019s decision to deny a habeas petition, <em>Leavitt v. Arave, </em>371 F.3d 663, 668 (9th Cir.2004), and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-13\">Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we do not recite them in detail. For purposes of this disposition we assume that <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), applies retroactively to Villareal\u2019s claim, <em>see Bockting v. Bayer, </em>399 F.3d 1010 (9th Cir.2005), <em>cert, </em>granted,-U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2017, 164 L.Ed.2d 778 (2006). Moreover, we shall assume that Mendoza\u2019s statements to the police officer identifying Villareal as the shooter were testimonial in nature and their admission, without confrontation, violated Villareal\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 69, 124 S.Ct. 1354; <em>see also Hammon v. Indiana, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 552, 163 L.Ed.2d 459 (2005) (granting certiorari to determine whether an accusation made to an officer at the scene of a crime is testimonial within the meaning of Crawford); <em>Davis v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 547, 163 L.Ed.2d 458 (2005) (granting certiorari to determine whether a statement identifying the perpetrator made to a 911 operator, considered an excited utterance by the lower court, is testimonial within the meaning of Crawford). Nonetheless, Villareal is not entitled to habeas relief, because the Sixth Amendment error was harmless. <em>See Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-20\">Mendoza\u2019s identification testimony was important but was merely one part of a strong overall case presented by the prosecutor. The cumulative testimony of multiple other witnesses corroborated Mendoza\u2019s identification of Villareal as the shooter and of the sequence of events that evening. <em>See United States v. Bowman, </em>215 F.3d 951, 961 (9th Cir.2000). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>Moreover, properly admitted evidence found in Villareal\u2019s apartment substantiated Mendoza\u2019s statements. Therefore, in light of the totality of the evidence offered by the prosecutor, we cannot say that the improper admission of Mendoza\u2019s testimony had a \u201csubstantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Brecht, </em>507 U.S. at 638, 113 S.Ct. 1710.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Because Villareal does not make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2), we choose not to exercise our discretion to expand the Certificate of Appealability to include Villareal\u2019s pre-indictment delay due process claim. <em>See Hiivala v. Wood, </em>195 F.3d 1098, 1104-05 (9th Cir.1999) (per curiam); 9th Circuit Rule 22-1(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b462-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
