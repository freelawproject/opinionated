United States DOJ, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir. 2005). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, overturning them only if any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 (2d Cir. 2004). Nevertheless, \u201cthe fact that the [agency] has relied primarily on credibility grounds in dismissing an asylum application cannot insulate the decision from review.\u201d <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir.2004). An adverse credibility determination must be based on \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d that \u201cbear a legitimate nexus\u201d to the finding. <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003). Inconsistent testimony often bears a legitimate nexus to an adverse credibility finding, but it need not be fatal if it is minor and isolated, and the testimony is otherwise generally consistent, rational, and believable. <em>See Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 288 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">In this case, the IJ based his adverse credibility determination on inconsistencies, implausibilities, Wang\u2019s demeanor while testifying, and a lack of corroborating evidence in support of Wang\u2019s claims. Specifically, the IJ found several inconsistencies and implausibilities, which included: (1) Wang\u2019s fluctuating testimony relating to how many days she was hospitalized; (2) Wang\u2019s inconsistent testimony relating to when she found out she was pregnant, and when she told her boyfriend and parents about her pregnancy; (3) the implausibility that Wang\u2019s mother did not notice Wang was three or four months pregnant; and (4) the implausibility that her family could afford a smuggler to assist Wang\u2019s entry into the United States, but could not afford to pay Wang\u2019s fine. An independent review of the record indicates that Wang\u2019s testimony was inconsistent in relation to the duration of her hospitalization, when she became pregnant, and when she told others about her pregnancy. Although the IJ attempted to clarify Wang\u2019s testimony in relation to these events, Wang did not provide clear answers to the IJ\u2019s questions, and the inconsistencies were not explained or diminished. Further, the IJ noted that he found it improbable that Wang\u2019s mother would not notice her pregnancy considering Wang\u2019s build and the fact that the two lived together. Since this Court does not have the ability to observe Wang\u2019s build, this Court defers to the IJ\u2019s finding since he was in a position to view Wang and determine whether the testimony was plausible. <em>See Zhang, </em>386 F.3d at 73. With regard to the IJ\u2019s concern over the lack of corroboration, this Court has found that \u201c[t]he presence or absence of corroboration may properly be considered in determining credibility.\u201d <em>Diallo, </em>232 F.3d at 287. Here, the IJ noted that corroboration would have been helpful to Wang\u2019s claims, and specified the following examples: a statement from her boyfriend; statements from her parents; documentation in support of her hospitalization; and statements or testimony from friends or relatives in the New York City area, who were referred to in support of her motion for a change of venue. It seems that some, if not all, of these sources of corroborative evidence \u201cmay reasonably be expected,\u201d and Wang\u2019s explanation for her failure to provide such documentation \u2014 that she did not have a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>\u201csteady address\u201d despite the availability of her attorney\u2019s address \u2014 is not a \u201csufficient explanation\u201d for her lack of such evidence. <em>See Diallo, </em>232 F.3d at 287-90. Therefore, while a finding of a lack of corroboration cannot be the exclusive basis for an adverse credibility finding, in this case, it was properly considered as one factor among others. <em>See id. </em>at 287. Overall, the IJ\u2019s findings relating to the lack of corroboration and the inconsistencies and implausibilities in the record are supported by substantial evidence and, therefore, asylum and withholding of removal relief were properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">In relation to Wang\u2019s CAT claim, because she did not challenge the denial of her CAT claim before the BIA, she has failed to exhaust this claim and it cannot be considered by this Court. <em>See Gill v. INS, </em>420 F.3d 82, 86 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this proceeding is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this proceeding is DENIED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2) and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
