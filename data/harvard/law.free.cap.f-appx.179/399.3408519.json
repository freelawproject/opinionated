We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-18\">In a related case before us on appeal, <em>Jacobsen v. Dep\u2019t of Transp., et al, </em>450 F.3d 778 (8th Cir.2006) (which we affirm today), the district court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> held that the rest areas at issue are nonpublic fora, and that the present restrictions governing placement of the newsracks comply with the constitutional protection afforded nonpublic fora. In light of that holding and the constitutional restrictions with which defendants must comply in the future given the status of the rest areas as nonpublic fora, we conclude that the magistrate judge did not abuse his discretion in dissolving the preliminary injunction. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(5) (court may relieve party of order if, inter alia, it is no longer equitable that judgment should have prospective relief), (b)(6) (court may relieve party from order for any non-listed reason justifying relief).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-22\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b425-19\">. The Honorable Paul A.
