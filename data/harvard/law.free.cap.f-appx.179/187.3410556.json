Baker pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute oxycodone and cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (2000). On appeal, counsel filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating there were no meritorious grounds for appeal but addressing whether Baker\u2019s sentence was cruel and unusual punishment because of her age and poor health and whether the district court erred in not giving her credit for acceptance of responsibility. Baker was informed of her right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but did not do so. The Government did not file a brief. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-27\">We find there was no error with respect to the court\u2019s decision not to decrease Baker\u2019s offense level for acceptance of responsibility. Baker\u2019s offense level was enhanced because of obstruction of justice as a result of her not appearing for her first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>sentencing hearing and because she was charged with other offenses while on bond. \u201cConduct resulting in an enhancement under \u00a7 3C1.1 (Obstructing or Impeding the Administration of Justice) ordinarily indicates that the defendant has not accepted responsibility for his criminal conduct.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n. 4); <em>see United States v. Murray, </em>65 F.3d 1161, 1165 (4th Cir.1995) (holding that finding of obstruction supports the denial of acceptance of responsibility reduction).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">We further find there was no error in Baker\u2019s sentence. Because she was sentenced within the properly calculated guidelines range of imprisonment, it is reasonable. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456-57 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record in this case and found no error. Accordingly, we affirm Baker\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires counsel inform Baker, in writing, of her right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If she requests a petition be filed, but counsel believes such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Baker. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
