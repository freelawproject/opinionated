The district court, rejecting Miller\u2019s motion for safety-valve relief, sentenced Miller to the mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of 120 months. Miller appeals his sentence. For the reasons that follow, we VACATE the sentence and REMAND for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-10\">On April 24, 2003, Defendant William David Miller shot Michael Allen Hays in Odon, Indiana. Miller turned himself in to local law enforcement the following day. After waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights, he admitted shooting Hays, saying that \u201c[h]e had to do it, or they were going to kill [him].\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Alterations in original.) He further disclosed his and Hays\u2019 involvement in a marijuana production ring that he later admitted stretched from Wisconsin to Kentucky.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-11\">Authorities then began to investigate the marijuana operation and the disappearance of Russell Lee Marshall, a/k/a Tom Marshall, who was alleged to have been a participant in the marijuana operation. The investigation revealed that on April 18, 2003, Hays and his wife, Trena Hays, traveled to Syracuse, New York for a horse-pulling competition. When they returned two days later, Trena Hays discovered Marshall\u2019s body on their kitchen floor. Hays then contacted Keith Brummett, Clifford Slusher, and Dean Heckathorn, all of whom were also involved in the marijuana operation. Hays refused their pleas to report the death to law enforcement. Instead, Hays and Slusher retrieved a trailer from Hays\u2019 farm to transport the body, while Trena Hays, Brummett, and Heckathorn wrapped the body in plastic. Hays, Heckathorn, Slusher, and Brummett then placed the body in the trailer, and Hays and Slusher hauled the trailer to Slusher\u2019s nearby farm, where they buried Marshall\u2019s body.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-14\">Following this investigation, Miller, Hays, Trena Hays, and Brummett, among others, were indicted on various counts of a twelve-count indictment that included charges relating to the marijuana operation and death of Russell Marshall. Several other co-conspirators were charged in separate indictments. Miller was indicted under Count 2 for conspiring to manufacture, distribute, and possess with intent to distribute 1000 kilograms or more of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, and under Count 3 for conspiring and attempting to conduct financial transactions affecting interstate commerce from the proceeds of the manufacture, sale, and distribution of a controlled substance, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-15\">Miller pleaded guilty to Count 2 in exchange for the government\u2019s dismissal of Count 3. (J.A. 99.) He stipulated that the amount of marijuana at issue was between 4000 and 7000 plants, or between 400 and 700 kilograms. A violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 involving 400 kilograms or more of marijuana carries a minimum ten-year sentence. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(vi). However, both parties agreed that Miller\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>sentence would be lower should he qualify for safety-valve consideration.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">In addition, Miller agreed to \u201ccooperate fully with the United States in the investigation and prosecution of the matters in the Indictment and all related matters, including testifying in all proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">At sentencing, Miller sought a safety-valve reduction. The government objected, arguing that Miller did not qualify because he failed to provide all information and evidence he had concerning the offense and other offenses part of the same course of conduct. Following argument, the district court found that Miller did not qualify for the safety valve.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, the district court sentenced Miller to the mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of 120 months.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court also required that he pay a mandatory special assessment of $100, and that his imprisonment be followed by five years of supervised release. Miller timely appealed his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-7\">The sole issue on appeal is whether the district court erred in denying Miller the safety-valve reduction. The defendant bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he is eligible for safety-valve consideration. <em>United States v. </em>Bolka, 355 F.3d 909, 912 (6th Cir.2004). A district court\u2019s refusal to grant safety-valve relief is a factual finding that this Court reviews for clear error. <em>United States v. Adu, </em>82 F.3d 119, 124 (6th Cir.1996). A factual finding is clearly erroneous if \u201cthe reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Navarro-Camacho, </em>186 F.3d 701, 705 (6th Cir.1999). We review the evidence \u201c \u2018in a light most likely to support the district court\u2019s decision.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Braggs, </em>23 F.3d 1047, 1049 (6th Cir.1994) (quoting <em>United States v. Gomez, </em>846 F.2d 557, 560 (9th Cir.1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-13\">Miller argues that the district court erred in finding that he did not satisfy U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(5),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_4\">not later than the time of the sentencing hearing, the defendant has truthfully provided to the Government all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan, but the fact that the defendant has no relevant or useful other information to provide or that the Government is already aware of the information shall not preclude a determination by the court that the defendant has complied with this requirement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b972-14\">The district court found that Miller had failed to disclose two facts relating to Marshall\u2019s death. The first was that on the weekend of Marshall\u2019s death, Miller was scheduled to go to Syracuse, New York for the horse-pulling competition but backed out at the last minute. The second was that Miller was with Hays and Michael <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>Griffin a few days after Marshall\u2019s death. Hays and Griffin then left, and Hays directed Griffin to get rid of Marshall\u2019s truck. The truck was later found destroyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">Miller argues that the district court\u2019s factual findings were based on insufficient evidence. In the alternative, he argues that the facts found were not \u201crelevant\u201d to his offense or course of conduct. While we cannot say that the district court clearly erred in finding that Miller did not disclose his cancelled trip to Syracuse and his meeting with Hays and Griffin shortly before the other two left to destroy Marshall\u2019s truck, we nonetheless conclude that the district court clearly erred in concluding that those facts were \u201crelevant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">To qualify for safety-valve relief, a defendant must disclose all facts that are \u201crelevant\u201d to the offense of conviction. <em>See Adu, </em>82 F.3d at 124 (\u201cTo qualify under \u00a7 5C1.2, ... a defendant must truthfully provide all information he has concerning the offense of conviction <em>and all relevant </em>conduct.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">Defendants seeking the safety valve are required to disclose more than the mere elements or facts of the offense of conviction, which is the requirement for an acceptance of responsibility reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Rather, \u00a7 5C1.2 requires complete disclosure of all information the defendant has concerning all relevant conduct. <em>Id.; </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 cmt. n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-8\">As the district court implicitly held, Marshall\u2019s murder was \u201crelevant\u201d to Miller\u2019s marijuana conviction. Information relating to the conspirators\u2019 whereabouts during the time of Marshall\u2019s murder was important to the government\u2019s investigation, as was information relating to the disappearance of Marshall\u2019s truck. <em>Cf. United States v. Salgado, </em>250 F.3d 438, 459 (6th Cir.2001) (holding that \u201crelevant conduct\u201d includes \u201cinformation regarding the participation of other people in the offense\u201d); <em>United States v. Maduka, </em>104 F.3d 891, 894 (6th Cir.1997) (holding that when a defendant\u2019s criminal conduct depends upon the active participation of others, information about the others and their participation is \u201crelevant\u201d). That information was relevant not only to pursuing leads in the case, but also to assessing credibility and truthfulness. In other words, the marijuana and murder investigations were inherently interrelated.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-12\">That does not mean, however, that Miller was required to disclose all minutiae regarding personal travel plans (or changed plans) and his presence among others, no matter how attenuated, to qualify for safety-valve relief. Miller argues, and we agree, that his decision not to go to Syracuse and his mere presence with Hays and Griffin, without more, were not relevant to Marshall\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-13\">Miller\u2019s decision not to go to Syracuse the weekend of Marshall\u2019s murder was simply not relevant to the murder investigation. While Miller did change his plans \u201cat the last minute,\u201d the government does not make the connection between this and Marshall\u2019s murder. The lead suspect, Hays, actually went to Syracuse while the victim was alleged to have remained in Kentucky, and the government concedes that Miller played no role in Marshall\u2019s murder or its concealment. We simply fail to see, then, how Miller\u2019s changed plans were relevant to the murder investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-14\">Equally irrelevant to Marshall\u2019s murder is the fact that, sometime after Marshall\u2019s murder, Miller met with Hays and Griffin after which Hays and Griffin left to dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>pose of Marshall\u2019s truck. The government admits that Hays and Griffin did not discuss their plans with Miller or in his presence. In fact, the government concedes that Miller had no knowledge of their plans from any source, and even after the fact did not know what they had done. Thus, during the investigation, Miller had no reason to believe that the fact of this meeting would be relevant. From his perspective at the time, it was nothing more than a benign encounter with two men with whom he had presumably had many previous similar encounters. While the undisclosed information may have impacted the government\u2019s investigation in retrospect, Miller could not have known of its relevance because he was unaware of the surrounding circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">Had Miller been deceitful or evasive when questioned about these matters, the result would certainly be different. But at the time of the investigation, the government never asked Miller about these matters. Had the information truly been relevant, investigators likely would have made general inquiries into the matters. The government admits that Miller was otherwise forthcoming and, in fact, volunteered in the first place the possibility that Rusty Marshall had been murdered. It would seem rather odd, then, that Miller would have concealed rather innocuous information that would not have incriminated him if he had believed it at all relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">Of course, the government need not question a defendant about a fact in order to trigger his duty to disclose under \u00a7 5C1.2. <em>See Adu, </em>82 F.3d at 124. All that is required is that the information be \u201crelevant.\u201d However, implicit in requiring a defendant to disclose \u201crelevant\u201d facts is the defendant\u2019s having reason to believe them relevant. Thus, where, as here, the defendant could not reasonably have known of the relevance of certain information, the benefits of hindsight will not normally disqualify him from safety-valve relief. Otherwise defendants would be encouraged to inundate investigators with trivial details having no obvious connection with the offense of conviction or course of conduct, which would be counter-productive to governmental efforts to identify pertinent information. Under the facts of this case, we conclude that the district court clearly erred in finding that Miller failed to disclose all relevant information.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-7\">This conclusion is not in conflict with our decision in <em>Adu. </em>In that case, we said that \u201c[w]here the government challenges a defendant\u2019s claim of complete and timely disclosure and the defendant does not produce evidence that demonstrates such disclosure, a district court\u2019s denial of a motion under [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(f) and [U.S.S.G.] \u00a7 5C1.2(5) is not clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 125. <em>Adu </em>does not mean that once the government challenges a defendant\u2019s failure to disclose a certain fact, the defendant must either have proof that he disclosed that fact or lose the safety valve. Rather, his burden is to prove \u201ccomplete and timely disclosure.\u201d Whether disclosure was \u201ccomplete\u201d involves whether disclosure was necessary because the information at issue was relevant. Here, Miller has satisfied his burden that the undisclosed information was not relevant, and, thus, his disclosure was \u201ccomplete.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b974-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is VACATED and the case is REMANDED for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b971-12\">. At the time of sentencing, Miller was awaiting trial in Indiana state court for attempted murder.
