He requested a continuance (the eighth time he had done so), stating that his wife was unable to attend the hearing to testify on his behalf. The IJ denied Ali\u2019s request and subsequently found him removable; the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) affirmed. Ah now petitions this court to review the IJ\u2019s denial of his request for the continuance, but because his claim is moot we dismiss the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-10\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b978-11\">Ah, a native and citizen of India, entered the United States in 1995. Shortly thereafter he married Jaton Nance, a United States citizen. Nance filed an immediate relative visa petition (an 1-130) on Ah\u2019s behalf, which was denied. Nance then appealed this denial to the BIA, and while her appeal was pending, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) commenced removal proceedings against Ah, charging him with being removable for, among other reasons, attempting to obtain a visa through marriage fraud, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-13\">Although Ah first appeared before an IJ in April 1999 to address this charge, a merits hearing would not be held for five years because of his multiple requests for continuances. From April 1999 through December 2002, Ah requested and received five continuances. Then, in December 2002 Ah informed the IJ that the BIA had affirmed the denial of his wife\u2019s 1-130 petition, and that recently he had been indicted for food-stamp fraud. Because Ah stated that he would seek voluntary departure, he requested and received a sixth continuance to allow the food-stamp fraud prosecution to \u201cplay out\u201d because of its effect on his eligibility for voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-14\">The IJ finally held a merits hearing in March 2004 after denying Ah\u2019s seventh request for a continuance. Ah alone testified that he and Nance had a bona fide marriage. He added, however, that Nance was unable to testify that day because she was in a hospital, having fallen ill with \u201csickle-cell cancer.\u201d In response, the government introduced a report compiled during its investigation of Ah\u2019s 1-130 petition showing that Ah paid Nance to marry him and petition the INS to adjust his immigration status.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-15\">At the close of the hearing, Ah requested yet another continuance \u2014 his eighth request \u2014 to enable him to obtain an affidavit from Nance, purportedly to corroborate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>his claim that the marriage was legitimate. The IJ denied Ali\u2019s request, noting the numerous continuances he had granted over the previous five years and stating that Ali provided no evidence substantiating that Nance suffered from an illness. He then rendered his decision, denying Ali\u2019s request for voluntary departure and ordering him removed from the United States. In reaching this decision, the IJ relied on the government\u2019s investigative report presenting extensive evidence which showed that Ali\u2019s and Nance\u2019s marriage was a sham, and that Ali actually had another \u201ccommon-law wife\u201d with whom he fathered two children. Ali appealed to the BIA, which affirmed both the IJ\u2019s denial of Ali\u2019s motion for a continuance and request for voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">In his petition for review, Ah argues that the IJ\u2019s denial of a continuance deprived him of the opportunity to present evidence from Nance corroborating that they had a legitimate marriage. However, we lack jurisdiction to review this argument on grounds of both mootness and the jurisdictional bar outlined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B). Although neither party addressed these issues in their briefs, we always have the authority to examine sua sponte issues of jurisdiction, <em>see Wernsing v. Thompson, </em>423 F.3d 732, 746 (7th Cir. 2005), including mootness, see <em>Worldwide St. Preachers\u2019 Fellowship v. Peterson, </em>388 F.3d 555, 558 (7th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-7\">A. Mootness</p>\n<p id=\"b979-8\">Ali\u2019s challenge to the IJ\u2019s denial of his motion for continuance is rendered moot by the dismissal of Nance\u2019s 1-130 petition. Notwithstanding any statutory grant of jurisdiction, our authority for appellate review is limited to live cases or controversies, and under Article III \u201c \u2018federal courts do not have jurisdiction to review moot cases.\u2019 \u201d <em>Maher v. FDIC, </em>441 F.3d 522, 525 (7th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Buckley v. Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., </em>111 F.3d 524, 526 (7th Cir.1997)). The case or controversy must exist at all stages of review, including appeal. <em>See Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, </em>520 U.S. 43, 67, 117 S.Ct. 1055, 137 L.Ed.2d 170 (1997); <em>Church of Scientology of Cal. v. United States, </em>506 U.S. 9, 12, 113 S.Ct. 447, 121 L.Ed.2d 313 (1992). We recently held in <em>Qureshi v. Gonzales, </em>442 F.3d 985 (7th Cir.2006), that the portion of an alien\u2019s petition challenging the denial of his motion for continuance of removal proceedings pending the adjudication of his wife\u2019s 1-130 petition was rendered moot by the agency\u2019s dismissal of his wife\u2019s petition. We reasoned that \u201c[e]ven if [petitioner] were to prevail on his challenge to the continuance denial, the relief requested, within our power to grant, is a remand to the IJ pending adjudication of the I-130 petition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 988. But because the petition was denied, \u201c[a] remand now would effectuate no change in the case; [petitioner\u2019s] basis for a continuance no longer exists and the IJ, proceeding with his earlier analysis, would simply order [petitioner] removed from the United States.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b979-10\">As in <em>Qureshi, </em>the relief that Ali requests \u2014 a remand of his case \u201cfor further proceedings\u201d \u2014 is ineffectual. Ali does not appeal the IJ\u2019s denial of voluntary departure, so the completion of his food-stamp fraud prosecution no longer bears upon the issue of relief. Ali\u2019s counsel admitted as much when he stated at oral argument that the case \u201cis moot in the sense of continuing further in court for seeking any relief.\u201d We have no \u201cpower to decide questions that cannot affect the rights of litigants in the case before them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>North Carolina v. Rice, </em>404 U.S. 244, 246, 92 S.Ct. 402, 30 L.Ed.2d 413 (1971)). Because we are unable to grant relief affecting Ali\u2019s legal rights, his claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>is no longer a live case or controversy, <em>id., </em>and we accordingly dismiss his petition as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">B. Jurisdictional Bar Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">Alternatively, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B) strips us of jurisdiction to review Ali\u2019s request for a continuance. We, along with our sister circuits, have held on a number of occasions that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B) deprives us of jurisdiction to review an IJ\u2019s discretionary ruling, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii); <em>Vasile v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 766, 768 (7th Cir. 2005) (\u201cNotwithstanding [the REAL ID] Act ... discretionary or factual determinations continue to fall outside the jurisdiction of the court of appeals entertaining a petition for review.\u201d); <em>see also Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>427 F.3d 1218, 1222 &amp; n. 6 (9th Cir.2005), such as a decision to deny a continuance, <em>Benslimane v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 828, 832 (7th Cir.2005); <em>Subhan v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 591, 595 (7th Cir.2004); see <em>also Saloum v. United States Citizenship &amp; Immigration Servs., </em>437 F.3d 238, 242 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Grass v. Gonzales, </em>418 F.3d 876, 879 (8th Cir.2005); <em>Yerkovich v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 990, 995 (10th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">We have, however, carved out a very limited exception to the jurisdictional bar. In <em>Subhan v. Ashcroft </em>and <em>Benslimane v. Gonzales, </em>this court held that the denial of a discretionary continuance is reviewable when the decision has the effect of a substantive ruling on the alien\u2019s potentially meritorious application to adjust his status. <em>Benslimane, </em>430 F.3d at 832; <em>Subhan, </em>383 F.3d at 595-96. The IJs in those cases denied the petitioners\u2019 motions for continuance on the basis that the agency \u2014 by no fault of the petitioners \u2014 had not yet acted on their petitions for adjustment. <em>Benslimane, </em>430 F.3d at 830-31; <em>Subhan, </em>383 F.3d at 593-94. Because the petitions were pending when the IJs ordered the petitioners removed, we determined that the IJs\u2019 denials of continuance effectively constituted substantive rulings on the merits of the petitions. <em>Benslimane, </em>430 F.3d at 832; <em>Subhan, </em>383 F.3d at 595-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-8\">However, the exception in <em>Subhan </em>and <em>Benslimane </em>does not apply to this case. Here the IJ\u2019s denial of a continuance had no bearing on Ah\u2019s 1-130 petition because that petition was denied <em>before </em>the IJ found Ali removable; in contrast, in both <em>Subhan </em>and <em>Benslimane, </em>the petitioners\u2019 1-130 petitions were still pending when the IJs rejected their requests for continuances. <em>See Benslimane, </em>430 F.3d at 832; <em>Subhan, </em>383 F.3d at 595-96. The IJ\u2019s denial of Ali\u2019s request for a continuance thus did not have the effect of a substantive ruling on Ali\u2019s 1-130 petition, and we accordingly lack jurisdiction to review that denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-9\">Because we lack jurisdiction over Ali\u2019s appeal, we DISMISS his petition for review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
