We have jurisdiction pursuant to former 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a), <em>Socop-Gonzalez v. INS,. </em>272 F.3d 1176, 1183 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc), we review for abuse of discretion, <em>id. </em>at 1187, and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-24\">The IJ properly denied Munoz\u2019s motion to reopen. The record reflects that Munoz\u2019s Order to Show Cause (\u201cOSC\u201d) was sent as certified mail via the United States Postal Service (\u201cUSPS\u201d) with a request for a signed return receipt. The signed return receipt shows that the USPS article was delivered to Munoz\u2019s last known address. Notably, Munoz does not argue that the individual who signed the return receipt did not in fact receive the article or that the individual was not competent to sign the receipt. The only evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>Munoz presented that he did not receive the OSC were his own written statements in support of the motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">In light of the strong presumption that the USPS article was delivered to Munoz\u2019s last known address, and in light of the limited evidence presented by Munoz, we conclude that the IJ did not abuse his discretion by denying Munoz\u2019s motion to reopen. <em>See Arrieta v. INS, </em>117 F.3d 429, 431 (9th Cir.1997) (per curiam) (holding that notice sent to an alien\u2019s last known address creates a strong presumption of effective delivery); <em>Salta v. INS, </em>314 F.3d 1076, 1079 (9th Cir.2002) (noting that it requires \u201cfairly strong evidence\u201d to rebut the presumption that notice sent via certified mail was delivered).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b445-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
