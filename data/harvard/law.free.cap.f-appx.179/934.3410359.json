MARTIN, Jr., Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b961-8\">Dzemajlija Pepic petitions for judicial review of an order by the Board of Immigration Appeals which affirmed an immigration judge\u2019s determination that she was subject to removal despite her applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture. The parties have waived oral argument and this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-9\">In a prior order, we granted Pepic a stay of removal, but denied her motion to stay the period for voluntary departure because the time for voluntary departure had already expired. Pepic moves for reconsideration of that order. Subsequently, the Department of Homeland Security extended Pepic\u2019s period for voluntary departure to May 22, 2006. Pepic also renews her motion to stay the period for voluntary departure pending this court\u2019s disposition of her petition for review. As we today decide Pepic\u2019s petition for review, her motion for a stay and motion for reconsideration are denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-10\">Pepic is a native and citizen of Yugoslavia, now a part of Serbia and Montenegro, who entered the United States as a tourist on May 12, 2000. The government initiated removal proceedings against Pepic on May 7, 2002. Pepic filed her application for asylum on March 26, 2002, along with requesting withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-12\">After a hearing, the immigration judge denied all of Pepic\u2019s applications on May 13, 2004. The immigration judge did grant Pepic\u2019s request for voluntary departure. The Board of Immigration Appeals adopted the immigration judge\u2019s findings and dismissed Pepic\u2019s administrative appeal on September 26, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-13\">Pepic filed a timely petition for judicial review on September 26, 2005. On appeal, Pepic argues that the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019s decision that she was ineligible for asylum because her application was untimely is erroneous. She claims that extraordinary circumstances excuse her delay in filing her application for asylum. She also claims that the immigration judge\u2019s credibility determination is not supported by substantial evidence and that she established a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-14\">The resolution of an asylum request involves a two-part inquiry. <em>Mikhailevitch v. INS, </em>146 F.3d 384, 389 (6th Cir.1998). Pepic must show not only that she is a refugee, but also that her application merits a favorable exercise of administrative discretion. <em>See id. </em>The immigration judge did not reach the discretionary step here, as Pepic did not meet her burden of showing that she is a refugee. A \u201crefugee\u201d is defined as an alien who is unable or unwilling to return to her home country \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A); <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). A petition for judicial review should not be granted unless the evidence is so compelling that no reasonable fact-finder could fail to find the requi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>site fear of persecution. <em>Koliada v. INS, </em>259 F.3d 482, 486 (6th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">An asylum application is also treated as an application for the withholding of removal. <em>Mikhailevitch, </em>146 F.3d at 391. However, the burden of proving eligibility for asylum is less than the burden of proving entitlement to withholding. <em>Id. </em>Thus, the failure to show that Pepic is eligible for asylum will also show that she is not entitled to the withholding of removal. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">Pepic must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that she filed her asylum application within one year of her arrival in the United States. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a)(2). The only exceptions to this filing deadline are for \u201cchanged circumstances which materially affect the applicant\u2019s eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application within\u201d the statutorily prescribed period. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.4(a)(4) and (a)(5). Pepic bears the burden of proving that she qualifies for an exception to the one-year filing deadline. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.4(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-6\">The Board of Immigration Appeals found Pepic to be statutorily ineligible for asylum because she failed to timely file her application for asylum and failed to demonstrate any circumstances that would warrant a late filing. We lack jurisdiction to review the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019s decision. Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3), \u201c[n]o court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the Attorney General\u201d regarding the timeliness of an asylum application. We have held that the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019s factual determination that an asylum application was not filed within the one-year limitations period is precluded from judicial review. <em>See Gjyzi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 710, 714 (6th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-7\">Although Pepic argues that the Board of Immigration Appeals and immigration judge erred in denying her asylum application as untimely because she maintained legal status through September 10, 2001, and because of ineffective assistance of counsel in failing to file the application in a timely fashion, \u00a7 1158(a)(3) precludes judicial review of all factual decisions concerning the timeliness of an asylum application. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, Pepic\u2019s arguments are rebutted by the record. As the immigration judge noted, Pepic\u2019s relationship with her prior counsel began after the one-year time period had expired. In addition, Pepic\u2019s legal status expired on September 10, 2001. However, Pepic did not give her application for asylum to her prior counsel until February 6, 2002, five months after the expiration of her legal status.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-9\">Therefore, the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019s conclusion that Pepic filed her application for asylum more than one year after her arrival in the United States is barred from judicial review. <em>Id. </em>Thus, we cannot address the merits of Pepic\u2019s arguments regarding why she feels she is eligible for asylum. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b962-10\">The burden of proof for withholding of removal is more stringent than the burden of proof for asylum. <em>Mikhailevitch, </em>146 F.3d at 391. To qualify for withholding of removal, Pepic must show a \u201cclear probability\u201d of persecution in the proposed country of removal. She must establish that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that, if she was removed to a particular country, her life or freedom would be threatened on account of one of the enumerated grounds of \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). <em>Liti v. Gonzales, </em>411 F.3d 631, 640-41 (6th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-11\">Similarly, as to Pepic\u2019s petition for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019s denial of relief under the Convention Against Torture, \u201c[protection under the Convention exists in the form of withholding of removal to the country of tor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>ture.\u201d <em>Ali v. Reno, </em>237 F.3d 591, 596 (6th Cir.2001). To obtain relief, the applicant bears the burden establishing that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2); <em>see also Liti, </em>411 F.3d at 641.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">Pepic has not satisfied her burden. The immigration judge found that even though Pepic fears returning to Montenegro and that the fear may be subjectively genuine, there was insufficient evidence to compel a finding that Pepic would be subjected to future persecution. The immigration judge found that Pepic\u2019s testimony was inconsistent with her application for asylum. The immigration judge also found that Pepic failed to present corroborative evidence. The only supporting testimony which Pepic provided was that of her nephew. However, the immigration judge noted that the nephew\u2019s testimony was inconsistent with Pepic\u2019s testimony in that the nephew testified that Pepic was a member of the government whereas Pepic indicated that she had been removed from her government positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">The immigration judge noted that Pepic\u2019s testimony on direct examination, on cross-examination, and on questioning by the immigration judge was \u201cfrequently non-responsive and argumentative.\u201d The immigration judge stated that Pepic was a highly educated woman and asserted that she was a person of prominence and influence in Montenegro. She claimed to be a well-known journalist and published a newspaper. However, when she was questioned about evidence relating to her prominence and influence, Pepic was unable to produce evidence to support her claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-7\">The immigration judge also found that Pepic had not presented any affidavits concerning her allegation that she was employed in the 1980\u2019s as a radio journalist and had participated in the youth hostile movement until the mid-1990\u2019s. Pepic had not presented any affidavits from fellow journalists establishing her alleged influence in politics.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-9\">Pepic claimed that she and her mother received threats and visits from high-ranking security personnel, yet no affidavit from Pepic\u2019s mother supported this claim. Pepic alleged that her brother received a death threat at a funeral, yet no evidence to support this claim was provided by the brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-10\">Pepic stated that she was threatened with assassination by a member of the security forces. She claimed that she was directly told that she was to be killed. Yet, in her application for asylum, Pepic states that she was told to leave the country. The death threat was not mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-11\">Pepic claimed to have been harmed by the country\u2019s chief of security, but the threat was not contained in Pepic\u2019s asylum application. Pepic stated she has secret knowledge of events in Montenegro that will lead to her death. When questioned on cross-examination regarding the secrets, Pepic referred to the widely known facts that Montenegro\u2019s economy was in disarray and that it supports itself primarily through the smuggling of drugs, women, cigarettes, alcohol, and gasoline. The immigration judge noted that the European Union has prohibited Montenegro\u2019s entry into the Union because of the country\u2019s criminal history. In addition, the political leaders which Pepic fears are no longer in power. The immigration judge found that Pepic presented no basis for her fear from the current government.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-12\">The immigration judge further noted that Pepic placed great emphasis on alleged threats she received from a General Babic. The threats, accordingly to Pepic, occurred in 1991. However, she did not leave Montenegro until 2000, except for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>brief trip for two months in 1998. Further, since 1991, she has had no contact with Babic, who is still allegedly a general in Montenegro.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">Pepic has not shown a \u201cclear probability\u201d of persecution if she were to return to Montenegro. Pepic\u2019s allegations regarding why she fears returning to Montenegro are inconsistent and unsupported by independent evidence. As the immigration judge\u2019s rejection of Pepic\u2019s claims is reasonable, judicial intervention cannot be granted. <em>Koliada, </em>259 F.3d at 486. Thus, Pepic has not established entitlement to the withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">Finally, Pepic is not entitled to relief under the Convention Against Torture. Protection under the Convention Against Torture is the same as the withholding of removal. <em>Ali, </em>237 F.3d at 596. As Pepic has not met her burden of establishing relief for withholding of removal, she has failed to establish relief under the Convention Against Torture. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">The petition for judicial review is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
