The district court sentenced him to 46 months of imprisonment. Ibarra appealed, arguing that the sentence was unreasonable because the district court failed to adequately consider the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). For the reasons set forth below, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-28\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b343-29\">All of the facts in this opinion are taken from the Presentence Report, the accuracy of which Ibarra does not dispute. Ibarra is a Mexican citizen who first came to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>United States illegally in the mid-1980s. He married a United States citizen in 1988. Although immigration officials approved his \u201cPetition for Alien Relative\u201d shortly thereafter, Ibarra failed to apply for a permanent resident visa. This caused his visa registration to expire in 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Ibarra has a long record of criminal offenses. In 1989 and 1992, Ibarra was arrested and convicted of his first and second offenses for drunk driving. Both incidents escalated when Ibarra struggled and fought with police officers, the second incident resulting in an assault and battery conviction after Ibarra repeatedly struck an officer and reached for the officer\u2019s firearm. In 1993, Ibarra was convicted of \u201cattempted criminal sexual conduct \u2014 second degree\u201d involving his step-daughter, and was sentenced to 180 days in jail. He was sentenced to 30 days in jail for a domestic violence offense in 1994. Two years later, he was again convicted of drunk driving. In 1996, 1998, and 2003, Ibarra was convicted of four separate offenses for driving while his license was suspended. Another domestic violence conviction, for which Ibarra was sentenced to 30 days in jail, occurred in 1996. In 2001, Ibarra was convicted of failing to register as a sex offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Ibarra was deported in March of 2004. Shortly thereafter, in September of 2004, Ibarra illegally reentered the United States by walking across the Arizona border. In January of 2005, he was convicted of failing to register as a sex offender, an offense for which he was sentenced to 60 days in jail. Ibarra was indicted in March of 2005 on the federal charge of being found in the United States without permission after having been deported subsequent to an aggravated felony conviction\u2014 here, the 1993 conviction for attempted criminal sexual conduct \u2014 second degree. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. He pled guilty to the charge pursuant to a written plea agreement. The statutory maximum sentence for this offense is 20 years of imprisonment. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">At sentencing, Ibarra\u2019s counsel called attention to the fact that Ibarra had not been convicted of any drug or firearm offenses, and downplayed the seriousness of Ibarra\u2019s offenses other than the conviction for criminal sexual conduct. Counsel \u201cask[ed] the Court to sentence him, if not below the 46-month guideline, certainly no more than the 46.\u201d According to counsel, a 46-month sentence \u201cwould be certainly a very sufficient sentence under the factors ... for this type of offense.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-8\">The district court then stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-9\">Taking a look at his total record and the requirements of 18 United States Code, Section 3553(a) and also considering the fact that I can \u2014 and the guidelines are advisory to me \u2014 but, as I just said in the last sentencing, the guidelines cover many, if not most, of the factors set forth in 18 United States Code 3553(a), especially number 1, the nature and circumstance[s] of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant, which are set forth, of course, in the offense level and in the criminal history category. And then the guidelines also try to take into account subsection 2 of that 3553(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-10\">But considering his criminal history\u2014 and drunk driving, although not an intentional act, is a very dangerous act. Domestic violence, which creates the opportunity, and probably the most dangerous opportunity, for a lot of violence. I mean, domestic violence seems to be the cause of most murders and puts police officers in a lot of danger \u2014 a sentence within the guideline range I think would be appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>And the sentence will be 46 months incarceration, three years of supervised release, I\u2019ll waive the fine, restitution is not an issue, $100 special assessment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A26\">Ibarra\u2019s counsel did not object to the sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">On appeal, Ibarra\u2019s only claim is that the 46-month sentence imposed by the district court is unreasonable because the court failed to discuss most of the sentencing factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The government responds that the sentence is \u201cpatently reasonable\u201d and should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">We review sentences imposed under the now-advisory Sentencing Guidelines regime for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Christopher, </em>415 F.3d 590, 594 (6th Cir. 2005) (reviewing a sentence for reasonableness). In <em>United States v. Williams, </em>436 F.3d 706, 708 (6th Cir.2006), this court held that \u201csentences properly calculated under the Guidelines [are credited] with a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Williams </em>recognized that the sentencing judge still must consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, but concluded that \u201c[s]uch consideration ... need not be evidenced explicitly.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">A week after <em>Williams </em>was decided, this court held in <em>United States v. Foreman, </em>436 F.3d 638, 644 (6th Cir.2006), that the rebuttable presumption of reasonableness \u201cdoes not mean that a sentence within the Guidelines is reasonable if there is no evidence that the district court followed its statutory mandate to \u2018impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary\u2019 to comply with the purposes of sentencing in section 3553(a)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>437 F.3d 550 (6th Cir.2006), decided a week after <em>Foreman, </em>further illuminated the duties of the sentencing court. According to <em>Richardson, </em>sentencing courts have an obligation to \u201cexplain to the parties and the reviewing court its reasons for imposing a particular sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 554. This explanation need not include a recitation of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, \u201cbut must articulate [the district court\u2019s] reasoning in deciding to impose a sentence in order to allow for reasonable appellate review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">Turning to the present case, the district court sentenced Ibarra at the low end of the applicable 46 to 57 month Guidelines range. Ibarra does not challenge the calculation of the Guidelines range or the fact that his 46-month sentence fell within that range, thus triggering the rebuttable presumption of reasonableness called for by <em>Williams. See Williams, </em>436 F.3d at 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-11\">Ibarra cannot rebut the presumption of reasonableness in this case because the record demonstrates that the district court explicitly mentioned \u00a7 3553(a) and discussed several of its factors. The district court started by noting that the Guidelines incorporate the first sentencing factor\u2014 that is, the \u201cnature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). Also taken into account by the Guidelines, according to the district court, were the second set of sentencing factors contained in \u00a7 3553(a)(2). These factors include \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed ... to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, ... to provide just punishment for the offense[,] to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct[,][and] to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b345-12\">The court then went on to speak specifically about the offenses that Ibarra had committed in the past that were troubling. It stated that drunk driving \u2014 for which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Ibarra had thrice been convicted \u2014 -was \u201ca very dangerous act.\u201d Domestic violence, according to the court, \u201ccreates ... probably the most dangerous opportunity ... for a lot of violence ... [and] seems to be the cause of most murders and puts police officers in a lot of danger.\u201d This history of Ibarra engaging in dangerous criminal acts clearly weighed heavily in his sentencing, both to the extent that it was incorporated into the Guidelines sentence and to the extent that the district court explicitly commented on Ibarra\u2019s past. Because of this history, the district court held that \u201ca sentence within the guideline range I think would be appropriate,\u201d and then sentenced Ibarra to the bottom of that range.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Ibarra makes much of the fact that the district court did not explicitly consider the other factors, but \u201cthis court has never required the \u2018ritual incantation\u2019 of the factors to affirm a sentence.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>436 F.3d at 709. Further, Ibarra \u201cidentifies no factor from \u00a7 3553(a) that would render his sentence unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 708. The very fact that the district court made mention of \u201cthe requirements of 18 United States Code, Section 3553(a)\u201d during the sentencing hearing is itself a strong indication that all of the factors were taken into account, even if not specifically discussed. Under these circumstances, we hold that the sentence imposed by the district court was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">For all of the reasons set forth above, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
