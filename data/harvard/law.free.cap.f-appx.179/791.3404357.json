Once a defendant alleges that the government is acting in bad faith in withholding a substantial assistance motion and the government explains its reasons for withholding the motion, \u201c[t]he defendant must then make a showing of bad faith \u2018to trigger some form of hearing on that issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Knights, </em>968 F.2d 1483, 1487 (2d Cir. 1992) (quoting <em>United States v. Khan, </em>920 F.2d 1100, 1106 (2d Cir.1990), <em>cert, denied, </em>499 U.S. 969, 111 S.Ct. 1606, 113 L.Ed.2d 669 (1991)). Here, the government explained that it declined to file the substantial assistance motion because, after entering into the cooperation agreement with Spahiu, it discovered that fraudulent documents had been submitted on Spahiu\u2019s behalf to corroborate his explanation for giving contradictory statements during his proffer sessions. Irrespective of whether Spahiu had anything to do with the production or presentation of the fraudulent documents, or even knew that they were fraudulent at the time, because their fraudulent nature could be used to undermine Spahiu\u2019s credibility, the government chose not to call him as a witness in the trial of his co-conspirator. Spahiu\u2019s assistance became, for those purposes, valueless. In light of these facts, Spahiu has failed to make the requisite showing of bad faith \u201cto trigger some form of hearing on that issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">Second, Spahiu argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. As the Supreme Court has explained, ineffective assistance of counsel claims are best asserted by means of section 2255 motions. <em>See Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 505-06, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003). This Court resolves such claims \u201cfor the first time on direct appeal when their resolution is beyond any doubt or to do so would be in the interest of justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Khedr, </em>343 F.3d 96, 100 (2d Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Because Spahiu\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim does not meet that standard, we decline to resolve it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
