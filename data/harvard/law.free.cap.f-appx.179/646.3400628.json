On appeal, Laverde challenges (1) the merits of the IJ\u2019s denial of relief, (2) the BIA\u2019s summary affirmance of the IJ\u2019s order, and (3) the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">We must inquire sua sponte into subject-matter jurisdiction whenever it may be lacking. <em>Cadet v. Bulger, </em>377 F.3d 1173, 1179 (11th Cir.2004). A petitioner has 30 days from the date of the final order of removal to seek review in our Court. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), (b)(1). \u201cSince the statutory limit for filing a petition for review in an immigration proceeding is \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional,\u2019 it is not subject to equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (Uth Cir.2005) (per curiam). The deadline was not suspended or tolled by Laverde\u2019s filing of a motion to reconsider within 30 days of the final removal order\u2019s issuance. <em>See id. </em>Because Laverde failed to file a timely petition for review of the BIA\u2019s final order of removal, we lack jurisdiction to consider his arguments to the extent they challenge the merits of the IJ\u2019s order or the BIA\u2019s final order of removal. Therefore, we dismiss that portion of Laverde\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-11\">Regarding the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration, Laverde argues that the BIA erred by (1) concluding that he had raised no arguments on appeal which would have caused it to reverse the IJ\u2019s decision, (2) failing to use independent judgment in its decision, and (3) failing to consider all of the relevant evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-12\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider for an abuse of discretion. <em>Assa'ad v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1341 (11th Cir.2003). Motions to reconsider are disfavored, especially in a removal proceeding, \u201cwhere, as a general matter, every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien who wishes merely to remain in the United States.\u201d <em>I.N.S. v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 724-25, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992). A motion <em>to </em>reconsider must specify \u201cthe errors of fact or law in the prior [BIA] decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-13\">Laverde\u2019s arguments in his motion for reconsideration were arguments that he either made, or should have made, in his initial brief before the BIA. Laverde generally argues on appeal that the BIA failed to use \u201cits own independent judgment.\u201d However, he has failed to cite to legal authority or support in the record for this argument. <em>See Zafar v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>426 F.3d 1330, 1336 (11th Cir.2005) (rejecting constitutional challenge where petitioners neither cited to legal authority, nor support in the record, for their challenge). Laverde also argues that the IJ erred in finding that he is not a refugee. However, in his brief to this Court, he points to little in the record that establishes clearly his status as a refugee. Indeed, in his motion for reconsideration, Laverde does not cite to the record at all. Thus, Laverde did not specify any \u201cerrors of fact or law in the prior [BIA] decision [that were] supported by pertinent authority.\u201d <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). Therefore, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Laverde\u2019s motion for reconsideration. Accordingly, we deny this portion of Laverde\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
