On appeal, Townsend contended that he did not receive notice of the magistrate judge\u2019s report. We remanded for further proceedings on whether Townsend received the report. After an evidentiary hearing held by the magistrate judge, the magistrate judge\u2019s report proposed that Townsend did not receive timely notice of the original report. Neither party filed objections and the district court \u2019 adopted the report and forwarded its memorandum and order upon remand to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-24\">Because Townsend did not receive timely notice of the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, we vacate the district court\u2019s final order dismissing Townsend\u2019s complaint entered April 5, 2004. We remand the case to the district court for further proceedings to give Townsend the opportunity to file objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation entered February 27, 2004, or file an amended complaint, as outlined in the magistrate judge\u2019s report. We dispense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"Aon\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
