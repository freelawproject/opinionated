After his habeas petition was denied, section 106 of the REAL ID Act of 2005 removed jurisdiction over habeas petitions of this sort, directed the transfer of any petition pending in the district court to the courts of appeal, and directed the courts of appeal to treat them as direct petitions for review from the agency.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Martinez-Pulido\u2019s petition had already been decided by the district court but no notice of appeal had yet been filed, but we have elected to exercise jurisdiction in similar cases and treated the petitions as direct petitions for review.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We thus have jurisdiction to review Martinez-Pulido\u2019s case and treat it as a petition for review from the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-24\">Martinez-Pulido relies on the unconscionability rule set forth in <em>Singh v. INS,</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>but the government argues that the relief was a certainty in <em>Singh </em>and the hearing was only a formality.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The government argues that Martinez-Pulido\u2019s failure to appear at his hearing is thus fatal because he cannot show \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">But this is not a failure to appear case. Martinez-Pulido did appear, but was denied entry to the hearing. This case is therefore analogous to <em>Romani v. </em>I.N.S.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The statute only requires an alien to show exceptional circumstances to excuse a failure to appear. Because Martinez-Pulido did appear, he does not need them. The BIA thus abused its discretion in denying Martinez-Pulido\u2019s motion to reopen, and Martinez-Pulido is due an opportunity to appear at his hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">PETITION GRANTED. We REMAND so that Martinez-Pulido may have his petition for 212(c) relief considered on the merits.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b460-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
