We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-13\">Vente contends that we should vacate his sentence and remand to the district court on two grounds. First, he argues that because he was only a crew member of the vessel and because other defendants had greater involvement in the drug smuggling, the district court erred in denying him a reduction for mitigating role pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 3B1.2 (2004). A district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in an offense is a finding of fact that we review only for clear error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir. 1999) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-14\">U.S.S.G \u00a7 3B1.2(b) permits a court to decrease a defendant\u2019s offense level by two levels if it finds that the defendant was a \u201cminor participant\u201d in the criminal activity. U.S.S.G \u00a7 3B1.2(b). A defendant is a minor participant if he is \u201cless culpable than most other participants,\u201d but has a role that \u201ccould not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, cmt n. 5. In determining whether a mitigating-role reduction is warranted, a district court must: \u201c[f]irst, and most importantly ... measure the defendant\u2019s role against the relevant conduct for which she was held accountable at sentencing.\u201d <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 945. In some circumstances, the amount of drags will be dispositive. <em>Id. </em>at 943. Second, a district court may measure the defendant\u2019s role against that of the other participants involved in the relevant conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 944. However, \u201c[t]he fact that a defendant\u2019s role may be less than that of other partici<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>pants engaged in the relevant conduct may not be dispositive of [the] role in the offense, since it is possible that none are minor ... participants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The defendant bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he played a mitigating role in the offense. <em>Id. </em>at 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">In the context of a drug courier case, a court may look to several factors to determine what role a defendant played in the offense. <em>Rodriguez De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 945. These factors include: (1) amount of drugs; (2) fair market value of drugs; (3) amount of money to be paid to the courier; (4) equity interest the defendant has in the drugs; (5) defendant\u2019s role in planning the criminal scheme and role in the distribution. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Vente\u2019s relevant conduct involved working as a crew member aboard a vessel that he knew held 2,647 kilograms of cocaine, an extremely large amount of drugs. His actual conduct in the offense was identical to his relevant conduct. Vente\u2019s arguments that he had no equity interest in the cocaine and that he was only a \u201cpawn\u201d are unconvincing because his labor was necessary to the scheme to smuggle cocaine into the United States. Further, the large amount of cocaine involved indicates that a minor-role reduction is not appropriate. <em>See Rodriguez De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 943. The district court did not clearly err in denying Vente a two-level reduction for mitigating role pursuant to \u00a7 3B1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">Vente next argues that his sentence was unreasonable because the district court did not adequately consider all of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. In response, the government contends that we lack jurisdiction to hear a reasonableness challenge to Vente\u2019s sentence. We review subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir. 2005) . We review <em>post-Booker </em>sentences for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261, 125 S.Ct. at 738, 765, 160 L.Ed.2d 621; <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 785 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">The government\u2019s jurisdictional argument is without merit. In <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>434 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir. 2006) , we held that we have jurisdiction under \u00a7 3742(a)(1) to review sentences for reasonableness. We therefore review the merits of Vente\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-11\"><em>Booker </em>mandates that courts review sentences for reasonableness in light of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). 543 U.S. at 261, 125 S.Ct. at 765-66. A party challenging a sentence must bear the burden of establishing that a sentence is unreasonable in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the record established below. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. While a sentence within the guidelines is not <em>per se </em>reasonable, we expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>See id. </em>A district court need not mention each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). Additionally, in reviewing such sentences, \u201c[w]e do not apply the reasonableness standard to each individual decision made during the sentencing process; rather, we review the final sentence for reasonableness.\u201d <em>Winingear, </em>422 F.3d at 1245.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-12\">At sentencing, the district court specifically looked to \u00a7 3553(a) in determining Vente\u2019s sentence. The court applied the guidelines as advisory and sentenced Vente to a term at the bottom of the guidelines range. The court noted Vente\u2019s educational and vocational aspirations, showing consideration for the need of the sentence imposed to provide Vente with needed educational or vocational <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>training. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8553(a)(2)(D). Additionally, the court found that Vente\u2019s crime brought \u201cpoison\u201d into the United States, which shows consideration of the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A). The court imposed a reasonable sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
