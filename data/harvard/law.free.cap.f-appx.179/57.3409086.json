Chase asserts two grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-23\">First, Chase argues the district court erred in refusing to suppress a statement Chase made prior to receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings and in subsequently refusing to reopen the suppression hearing. The scene, briefly summarized, was as follows. On January 4, 2004, three police officers stopped the car Chase was driving and removed Chase and the other two occupants. Officer Beyer recovered a long, thin nylon bag from the back seat. Holding the bag (and its contents) Beyer asked: \u201cWhat\u2019s in the bag?\u201d Chase replied, \u201ca rifle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-24\">As the government concedes that Chase was in \u201ccustody\u201d within the meaning of <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), we are only presented with the question whether Chase was subject to \u201cinterrogation.\u201d <em>See Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 300-01, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980); <em>United States v. Bogle, </em>114 F.3d 1271, 1274-75 (D.C.Cir.1997). Therefore, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>necessary to determine whether Officer Beyer should have known that his question was \u201creasonably likely to elicit incriminating information in the specific circumstances.\u201d <em>Bogle, </em>114 F.3d at 1275. Although a court should consider only those facts an officer \u201cshould have known,\u201d whether a question is reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response is an inquiry that \u201cfocuses primarily upon the perceptions of the suspect, rather than the intent of the police.\u201d <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 301-02,100 S.Ct. 1682.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">The district court concluded that no such interrogation took place because Beyer\u2019s question was not \u201cdirected to\u201d Chase, but to Michael Hassan (Chase\u2019s companion who had been riding in the back seat). Officers Lamond and Beyer both testified that the question was directed to Chase. However, they offered conflicting testimony as to the relative positions of Beyer, Chase, and Hassan at that time. Lamond testified at the pre-trial hearing that Beyer was facing Hassan, that Beyer\u2019s back was to Chase, and that Chase and Hassan were placed on the sidewalk roughly 20 feet apart. Beyer, on the other hand, testified at trial that all three suspects were standing near the trunk of the car. The district court, in concluding that the question was directed not to Chase but to Hassan, failed to clearly resolve the inconsistent testimony of Officers Lamond and Beyer regarding Chase\u2019s location when Beyer posed the all-important question. Because this error may have infected the district court\u2019s decision not to reopen the suppression hearing, we decline to resolve <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>applicability at this time and instead remand the case to the district court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Second, Chase argues the district court erred in excluding evidence of the fingerprint examiner\u2019s unfulfilled request for the palm prints of Chase\u2019s two companions. This line of attack fails. Even assuming the evidence was relevant in the first place, the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding the risk of unfair prejudice to the government outweighed the probative value of the evidence. <em>See United States v. Whitmore, </em>359 F.3d 609, 619 (D.C.Cir.2004); Fed.R.Evid. 401, 402, 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing <em>en banc. See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. R. 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
