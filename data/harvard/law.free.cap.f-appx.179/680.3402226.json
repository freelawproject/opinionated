Then, in an order entered June 7, 2005, <em>id. </em>at Tab 74, granted AT <em>&amp; </em>T\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Count I on the ground that the parties had settled U.S. Data\u2019s breach-of-contract claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-10\">U.S. Data now appeals, challenging the district court\u2019s orders of January 7, 2003, and June 7, 2005. We find no merit in its appeal. The district court properly dismissed Counts II, III, and IV for the reasons stated in its January 7, 2003 order. As for Count I, we find no error in the court\u2019s determination, in its June 7, 2005 order, that the parties had settled U.S. Data\u2019s breach of contract claims; nor do we find an abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s decision to enforce the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
