DeFonzo\u2019s decision denying his motion to reopen his deportation proceedings. In a previous decision, the IJ denied Liu\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal by issuing a deportation order <em>in absentia. </em>We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">Where, as here, the BIA\u2019s decision affirms the IJ\u2019s holding but supplements it, this Court will review the IJ\u2019s decision as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir. 2005). We review the BIA\u2019s denial of Liu\u2019s motion under the abuse of discretion standard. <em>Zhong Guang Sun v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>421 F.3d 105, 107 (2d Cir.2005). An abuse of discretion may be found where the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cprovides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir .2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-14\">An applicant who received notice of his deportation hearing but failed to appear is entitled to rescission of the resulting <em>in absentia </em>order if he files a motion to rescind within 180 days of the order of deportation and shows that his failure to appear was the result of exceptional circumstances. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252b(c)(3)(A); 8 C.F.R 1003.23(b)(4)(iii)(1). In deportation proceedings, more than one motion seeking rescission of an <em>in absentia </em>order is permitted. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(4)(iii)(D). However, the motion to reopen that is under review with this Court does not assert that exceptional circumstances prevented Liu from appearing at his hearing; it asserts only that his deportation proceedings should be reopened because of changed personal circumstances \u2014 an approved 1-140 Immigrant Petition and marriage to a U.S. citizen. Although such motions are also permitted, <em>see Song Jin Wu v. INS, </em>436 F.3d 157 (2d Cir.2006), they are governed by 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(1), which sets a deadline of 90 days, and a limit of one motion. The BIA did not abuse its discretion in determining that Liu\u2019s motion to reopen was time and number barred under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(1). Since 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b) does not contain any exceptions to the numerical limitations that are applicable to Liu\u2019s case, his motion was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-16\">Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
