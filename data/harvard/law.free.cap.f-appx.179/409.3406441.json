Because we find that any property right that the plaintiff, Dr. Stephen Embury, might have had in his job was not clearly established, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">Dr. Embury argues that we have no jurisdiction to consider whether he has a property interest in his job for due process purposes. The district court found that there was a genuine issue of material fact and that Dr. Embury\u2019s evidence, if believed, could establish that he had a property interest in continued employment under California law. Thus, this Court would, under <em>Knox v. Southwest Airlines,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>lack jurisdiction to review that decision at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-17\">Under the <em>post-Knox </em>decision in <em>Saucier v. Katz,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we are nevertheless required to decide whether, under Dr. Em-bury\u2019s version of the facts, he had a property interest in his non-tenure position sufficient to trigger a full pre-termination hearing. He does not, for two reasons. First, he did not ask for a pre-termination hearing until just before Christmas and nine days before his position was to terminate, when anyone would expect many of the university officials who would need to participate to be gone for the holidays. Second, all of his papers, the regulations, and several years worth of communications to and from Dr. Embury made it crystal clear that the position would end on December 31 if he had not covered his expenses by obtaining outside funding. The \u201cmoral equivalent of tenure\u201d remark from 1986 cannot establish a property interest in the face of all of these clear communications and regulations. <em>Adelson v. </em>Regents<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> does not command otherwise because (1) the funding was continued in <em>Adelson </em>and only the curriculum was changed;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (2) there was a hearing in <em>Adelson, </em>yet the chancellor made his deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>sion without reading the transcript;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (3) the communications in <em>Adelson </em>(quite different from the communications to Dr. Embury regarding renewal of funding)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> allowed for the conclusion that the professor did have \u201cthe equivalent of tenure\u201d under <em>Perry v. </em>Sindermann;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and (4) the dean in <em>Adelson </em>improperly told the chancellor <em>ex parte </em>that there were no funds available.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether a right is \u201cclearly established\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and conclude that any property interest at issue was not so clearly established that the individually named defendants should have known that they were violating Dr. Embury\u2019s constitutional right to a hearing. The defendants are thus entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b436-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
