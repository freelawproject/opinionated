Sanders, </em>107 Fed.Appx. 367 (4th Cir.2004) (unpublished).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Sand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>ers contends that, when he was resentenced in November 2004, the district court erred under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), in computing his offense level and applying the guidelines as mandatory, in making fact findings by a preponderance of the evidence, and in considering testimonial hearsay evidence from law enforcement interviews and grand jury testimony summarized in the presentence report. The government does not oppose resentencing. We vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Relying on <em>Booker </em>and <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540 (4th Cir.2005), Sanders contends that the district court erred in calculating his offense level based on relevant conduct that was more than the five grams of crack he pled guilty to distributing. We conclude that Sanders\u2019 sentence was based on judicially found facts concerning the drug quantity in violation of the Sixth Amendment, as interpreted in <em>Booker </em>and <em>Hughes. </em>Resentencing is thus necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">We note that Sanders maintains that <em>Booker </em>requires a sentencing court applying the advisory guidelines to make fact findings beyond a reasonable doubt. Neither <em>Booker </em>nor this court\u2019s decisions since <em>Booker </em>support his position. <em>See Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 557, 560 (applying clearly erroneous standard of review to district court\u2019s factual findings). In addition, relying on <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), Sanders contends that the Confrontation Clause should apply to the district court\u2019s consideration of information in the presentence report that increased his guideline sentence. In <em>Crawford, </em>the Supreme Court held that the Confrontation Clause prohibits the admission of testimonial statements that are not subject to cross-examination. <em>Id. </em>at 50-51, 124 S.Ct. 1354. Several circuits have held that <em>Crawford </em>did not make the Confrontation Clause applicable at sentencing. <em>See United States v. Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318, 1323 (11th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Roche, </em>415 F.3d 614, 618 (7th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 671, 163 L.Ed.2d 541 (2005); <em>United States v. Luciano, </em>414 F.3d 174, 179 (1st Cir. 2005); <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>413 F.3d 239, 243-44 (2d Cir.2005), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1086, 163 L.Ed.2d 902 (2006). In light of these decisions, we conclude that Sanders\u2019 position is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-12\">For the reasons discussed, we vacate the sentence imposed by the district court and remand for resentencing consistent with <em>Booker </em>and <em>Hughes. We </em>dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-13\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b207-13\"> Sanders pled guilty to distribution of more than five grams of cocaine base (crack) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>was initially sentenced to a term of 262 months imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
