Kirk pled guilty to conspiracy to manufacture and distribute methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (2000). At the September 2005 sentencing hearing, the district court sentenced Kirk to fifty-one months\u2019 imprisonment, at the bottom of the range provided for by the advisory sentencing guidelines. Kirk does not appeal his conviction, but he contends the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-22\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a sentencing court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the sentencing guidelines. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 455-56 (4th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). In determining the sentence, however, courts are still required to calculate and consider the guidelines range as well as the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005). We will affirm a <em>post-Booker </em>sentence if it is within the statutorily prescribed range and it is reasonable. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546-47. Further, \u201cwhile we believe that the appropriate circumstances for imposing a sentence outside the guideline range will depend on the facts of individual cases, we have no reason to doubt that most sentences will continue to fall within the applicable guideline range.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 219 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 668, 163 L.Ed.2d 539 (2005). \u201c[A] sentence imposed within the properly calculated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>Guidelines range ... is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>Green, </em>436 F.3d at 457 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Kirk\u2019s sentence was within the guideline range and was well within the statutory maximum of twenty years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), 846 (2000). The district court appropriately treated the guidelines as advisory, properly calculated and considered the guideline range, and weighed the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Kirk has not rebutted the presumption that the sentence was reasonable. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
