Thomas subsequently filed a motion to vacate pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 and two \u00a7 2241 habeas petitions in the Western District of Texas, all of which were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-27\">In 2005, Thomas filed a \u00a7 2241 habeas petition in the Middle District of Pennsylvania, his district of confinement, challenging his sentence under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The District Court found that \u00a7 2241 was not available to Thomas and denied relief. We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-28\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-29\">A \u00a7 2255 motion filed in the sentencing court is the presumptive means for a federal prisoner to challenge to his sentence. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; <em>Okereke v. United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number><em>States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 120 (3d Cir.2002). A \u00a7 2241 petition may not be entertained unless a motion under \u00a7 2255 would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of [the] detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. A \u00a7 2255 motion is not \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d merely because the petitioner can not meet the stringent gate keeping requirements of \u00a7 2255, <em>Okereke, </em>307 F.3d at 120, or because the sentencing court does not grant relief, <em>Cradle v. United States ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 539 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">Thomas\u2019 claims fall within the purview of \u00a7 2255, and as found by the District Court, Thomas has not demonstrated that \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective.\u201d <em>Cf. Okereke, </em>307 F.3d at 120-21 (finding \u00a7 2255 not \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d, where successive petitioner sought to raise sentencing claim based on intervening decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2001)). Furthermore, Thomas\u2019 assertion that his case is analogous to <em>In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245 (3d Cir.1997), in that he is actually innocent of the murder that provided the basis for his significant sentencing enhancement, see Memorandum in Support of Habeas Petition at 6-7, is without merit. Unlike the intervening change in law in <em>Dorsainvil </em>that potentially made the crime for which the petitioner was convicted non-criminal, <em>Booker </em>deals with sentencing and did not render robbery, Thomas\u2019 offense of conviction, non-criminal. <em>See Okereke, </em>307 F.3d at 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">Accordingly, as there is no substantial question presented by this appeal, we will summarily affirm. Third Circuit LAR 27.4; Third Circuit I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
