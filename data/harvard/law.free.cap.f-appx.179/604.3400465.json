He now appeals his sentence, contending that the court infringed his Sixth Amendment rights under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), when, applying the Sentencing Guidelines, it concluded that it could not depart downward from the sentence range prescribed by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(b)(1) because he is an armed career criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">In <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178 (11th Cir.2005), we held that <em>Booker' </em>s instruction that the district courts first consult the Guidelines in fashioning a sentence necessarily implies that they must determine the appropriate Guidelines sentence range. In <em>United States v. Brehm, </em>442 F.3d 1291, 1297 (11th Cir.2006), the defendant contended that the district court had the discretion to grant a safety-valve reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2, even though he had more than one criminal history point (and thus was ineligible for safety-valve treatment), on the theory that <em>Booker </em>rendered the eligibility requirements for safety-valve relief discretionary. We disagreed, and held that <em>Booker </em>does not render application of individual Guidelines provisions advisory; rather, the district court remains obligated to calculate correctly the guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>at 1300.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-11\">Section 4A1.3(b)(1) of the Guidelines provides for a downward departure in a defendant\u2019s criminal history category if the court finds that the defendant\u2019s criminal history category \u201csubstantially over-represents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes.\u201d Section 4A1.3(b)(2)(B), however, prohibits the court from making a downward departure under this subsection if the defendant is an armed career criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-12\">Appellant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights were not violated because the district court correctly calculated his advisory Guidelines sentence range. Since appellant is an armed career criminal, \u00a7 4A1.3(b)(2)(B) prohibited the court from granting him the downward departure he requested. Appellant\u2019s sentence is therefore due to be, and is,</p>\n<p id=\"b631-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
