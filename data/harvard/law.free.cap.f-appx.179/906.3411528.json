They now appeal the district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment against all claims in their premises liability suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-9\">They challenge the district court\u2019s determination that Chapter 95 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code applies and further challenge the district court\u2019s findings that Shell lacked control and actual knowledge and that therefore has not incurred liability under Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.Code Ann. \u00a7 95.003. We agree with the district court\u2019s assessment of the record and the law and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b933-11\">Shell Offshore, Inc. (\u201cShell\u201d) owns and operates a fixed production platform in the Gulf of Mexico, off the coast of Texas on the Outer Continental Shelf (\u201cOCS\u201d), the Shell High Island 350-A (\u201cHI 350-A\u201d or \u201cthe platform\u201d). Shell does not have any of its own employees working onboard the platform; rather, Greystar Corporation (\u201cGreystar\u201d) was contracted as the platform operator.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-17\">As a part of readying the platform for sale, Shell contracted with a company called Chet Morrison; the contract included \u201c[r]epair [of] any holes left or made in the wood deck resulting from modifications required to install [a] temporary crane, etc.\u201d 1 <em>R. </em>603. While performing that job, Chet Morrison apparently noted that other boards needed replacing beyond those immediately referenced in the project; it replaced those additional boards with Shell\u2019s permission. Shell had also contracted with Salamis Services (\u201cSalamis\u201d) for sandblasting and painting services to be performed on the platform, again in preparation for sale. Mr. Bryan was employed by Salamis on that contract, and was performing the above tasks when he stepped on a wooden deck board that gave way; the fall injured his back, neck, and other parts of his body. He received benefits under the Longshore Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (\u201cLHWCA\u201d) from Ace American Insurance Co. (\u201cAce\u201d), Salamis\u2019s provider.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-18\">Mr. Bryan and his wife (\u201cthe Bryans\u201d) filed suit in federal district court in April 2003 against both Shell and Greystar alleging both negligence and premises liability claims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Ace then filed as intervenor on subrogation grounds. Based on the platform\u2019s location on the OCS off the Texas coast, the court applied Texas law<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>dismissed the negligence claims, but retained the premises liability claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">The parties conducted discovery and twice participated in unsuccessful mediation. Shell then filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that Chapter 95 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code applied to shield it from liability. The district court granted the motion on May 13, 2005, dismissing all of the plaintiffs\u2019 and the intervenor\u2019s claims with full prejudice. The Bryans and Ace timely appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s summary judgment ruling de novo. <em>Hanks v. Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp., </em>953 F.2d 996, 997 (5th Cir.1992). The court applies the same standard on appeal as is applied by the district court. <em>Terrebonne Parish Sch. Bd. v. Mobil Oil Corp., </em>310 F.3d 870, 877 (5th Cir.2002) (citing <em>Auguster v. Vermilion Parish School Board, </em>249 F.3d 400, 401 (5th Cir. 2001)). Summary judgment is appropriate where the record shows \u201cthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). Facts and inferences reasonably drawn from those facts should be taken in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Services, Inc., </em>504 U.S. 451, 456, 112 S.Ct. 2072, 119 L.Ed.2d 265 (1992); <em>Huckabay v. Moore, </em>142 F.3d 233, 238 (5th Cir.1998). Where the non-moving party fails to establish \u201cthe existence of an element essential to that party\u2019s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial,\u201d no genuine issue of material fact exists. <em>Celotex, </em>477 U.S. at 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">Tex. Crv Prac. <em>&amp; </em>Rem.Code Ann. Chapter 95</p>\n<p id=\"b934-8\">Chapter 95 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code was enacted in 1996 \u201cto provide greater protection for property owners against both types of premises liability claims.\u201d <em>Arsement v. Spinnaker Exploration Co., LLC, </em>400 F.3d 238, 245 (5th Cir.2005); see also <em>Arsement, </em>400 F.3d at 249; <em>Dyall v. Simpson Pasadena Paper Co., </em>152 S.W.3d 688, 699 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-9\">Per \u00a7 95.002, the chapter\u2019s provisions apply to a claim</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-10\">(1) against a property owner ... for personal injury, death, or property damage to ... a subcontractor or an employee of a ... subcontractor; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-11\">(2) that arises from the condition or use of an improvement to real property where the contractor or subcontractor constructs, repairs, renovates, or modifies the improvement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b934-12\">Even where both of the above requirements are met, however, liability will not accrue unless</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-13\">(1) the property owner exercises or retains some control over the manner in which the work is performed [other than the right to start or stop work or to inspect]; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-14\">(2) the property owner had actual knowledge of the danger or condition ... and failed to adequately warn.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b934-15\">Tex. Civ. Prac. <em>&amp; </em>Rem.Code Ann. \u00a7 95.003. Both parts of \u00a7 95.003 must be satisfied for liability to be imposed on an owner. <em>Kelly v. LIN Television of Texas, L.P., </em>27 S.W.3d 564, 567 (TexApp.-Eastland 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-16\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b934-17\">Plaintiffs allege that the district court erred (1) in determining that Chapter 95 applied and (2) in determining that they had not established that Shell met the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>requirements for liability under the chapter. We address each issue in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"AfL\">\n<em>Applicability Of Chapter 95</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">On appeal, plaintiffs\u2019 arguments focus on (1) whether the claim arises from the condition or use of an improvement and (2) whether Salamis was engaged in construction, repair, renovation, or maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">Appellants argue that the defective wooden deck boards are the source of the injury, and do not constitute an improvement under the statute because \u201chis position on the platform, his work and his services had no relation to the defect.\u201d <em>Appellants\u2019 Brief </em>at 7. The district court, rather, found that the <em>platform, </em>was the improvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">Although the Texas Supreme Court has not yet taken up the issue, the state courts have thus far concluded that Chapter 95 applies in such a situation. In <em>Fisher v. Lee and Chang Partnership, </em>the plaintiff fell from a ladder, which \u201cprovided appellant a means to reach his work site. It was not the object of his work. Nevertheless, appellant\u2019s injuries arose from \u2018the failure to provide a safe workplace.\u2019 \u201d 16 S.W.3d 198, 202 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2000) (looking to the plain language of the statute and the legislative history); see also, <em>Francis v. Coastal Oil &amp; Gas Corp., </em>130 S.W.3d 76, 83 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2003) (\u201cthe injuries must relate to work being done by the injured party, but the injury \u2014 producing defect need not be the object of the injured party\u2019s work.\u201d). Moreover, the district court\u2019s interpretation comports with the approach in <em>Arsement, </em>where the installation of a sump deck was held to be an improvement to a platform. <em>Id., </em>400 F.3d at 242 (describing the sump deck); <em>Id. </em>at 245 (noting it was undisputed that the sump deck constituted an improvement). Although the record is not specific, presumably Mr. Bryan was standing on the deck boards either because he was on his way to his work site or standing on them to carry out his work. This court is bound to make its best determination of what the Texas Supreme Court would do, looking to the intermediate courts where that body is silent. <em>Howe v. Scottsdale Ins. Co., </em>204 F.3d 624, 627 (5th Cir.2000). Given the gloss used by numerous intermediate Texas courts and the adoption of that approach by cases in this circuit, the relationship between the boards and Mr. Bryan\u2019s work is sufficient such that the district court did not err in determining that no genuine issue of material fact existed on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-9\">Appellants further argue that the sandblasting and painting in which Mr. Bryan was engaged in fact constitute maintenance, rather than the \u201cconstruction, repair, renovation, or modification\u201d required by \u00a7 95.002(2). The district court refused to make the distinction, holding instead that the activity qualified as renovation or repair.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-10\">A sampling of Texas court cases offers a wide range of activities that are treated as repair or renovation, including repairing a roof \u2014 mounted air conditioner; replacement of a television station antenna; a \u201cwashout\u201d of coiled tubing to increase the flow of gas in a well; filtering mud for drilling to improve well performance; repairing a leaking flange at a chemical plant; and working as a \u201cholewatch\u201d and \u201cfirewatch\u201d on a large cleanup contract at a chemical plant. <em>See, respectively, Fisher, </em>16 S.W.3d at 201; <em>Kelly, </em>27 S.W.3d at 570; <em>Francis, </em>130 S.W.3d at 82; <em>Dyall, </em>152 S.W.3d 688 (which does not discuss the issue but proceeds to analyze \u00a7 95.003); and <em>Phillips v. The Dow Chemical Co., </em>186 S.W.3d 121, 131 (TexApp.-Houston [1 Dist.] 2005). In an unreported case, Judge Buchmeyer of the Northern District of Texas held that changing an air filter as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>part of a janitorial services contract did not require sufficient expertise such that Chapter 95 would apply. <em>Moore v. Howmet Corp., </em>2005 WL 856852 (N.D.Tex. 2005) at *2.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">Qualitatively, sandblasting and painting on an offshore platform in preparation for sale is closer in nature to the fact patterns in the various Texas cases cited above. Given the record before it, and the wide range of activities encompassed by Texas cases, the district court did not err in determining that there was no genuine issue of material fact that Mr. Bryan\u2019s work constituted \u201crepair or renovation\u201d such that Chapter 95 applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">\n<em>Proving Liability Under Chapter 95</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">Appellants\u2019 second set of arguments assert that Shell should not receive protection under Chapter 95 because it possessed both (1) sufficient control over the manner in which the work was performed and (2) actual knowledge of the danger or condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-7\">Appellants\u2019 entire argument regarding control is phrased around whether Shell had actual control over Chet Morrison\u2019s replacement of the deck boards. To meet their burden under \u00a7 95.003, however, appellants needed to raise a genuine question of material fact as to whether Shell had actual control over Salamis\u2019s (and by extension, Mr. Bryan\u2019s) contracted performance, and they have not done so. <em>See Arsement, </em>400 F.3d at 249 (\u201c[t]he requisite control factor is narrowly construed: the owner must control the \u2018mode or method\u2019 of the contractor\u2019s work.\u201d); <em>Dyall, </em>152 S.W.3d at 700-7 (\u201cWhile it is certainly true that, as the property owner, Simpson had \u2018control\u2019 of its facilities, this is not the type of \u2018control\u2019 of which the statute speaks. Simpson undoubtedly had the power to sell or lease its property, control access to its property, to shut down the facilities, etc. However, the statute speaks of \u2018control over the manner in which the work is performed.\u2019 \u201d). The district court was thus correct in finding that appellants had not shown that Shell retained the requisite control.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-9\">Appellants assert that their evidence that Chet Morrison was hired to replace the deteriorated board and informed Shell of the deteriorated board creates a genuine question of material fact as to Shell\u2019s actual knowledge of the condition. The statutory language, however, and the Texas courts\u2019 interpretation are uniformly clear that actual knowledge is required. <em>See, particularly, Dyall, </em>152 S.W.3d at 707 n. 18 (citing <em>Bishop v. Nabisco, Inc., </em>2004 WL 832916 at *3 (TexApp.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2004) for the proposition that \u201cknowledge that an activity is potentially dangerous is not sufficient to satisfy the second prong of Section 95.003 \u2014 actual knowledge of the danger is required.\u201d). The record does not reveal that Shell failed to address and repair any dangerous condition as to which it had been informed. A Greystar operator had noticed no deterioration when surveying the area the morning of the accident. The platform had been inspected by both Deepwater Specialties and the MMS, neither of whom identified a problem. While Shell did have notice that deck boards near the old site of the temporary crane needed replacing, all boards so identified had been replaced before the day of Mr. Bryan\u2019s accident. Appellants introduced no further evidence indicating that Shell had actual knowledge of a continuing problem. The district court thus properly found no genuine question of material fact as to whether Shell possessed the requisite actual knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-10\">CONCLUSIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b936-11\">Based on the record and arguments before us, we agree with the assessment of the district court that no genuine issue of material fact existed with regard to any of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>the above issues. The judgment of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b933-12\">. Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b933-13\">. The claims against Greystar have since been settled. Mrs. Bryan\u2019s claims for damages are based on loss of consortium.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b933-19\">. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1349, applies to this suit, and \u201cadopts the law of the adjacent state.\u201d <em>Fruge v.
