The district court sentenced him to 80 months\u2019 imprisonment and three years\u2019 supervised release. Thereafter, we ordered a limited remand under <em>United States v. Paladino, </em>401 F.3d 471 (7th Cir.2005), so that the district court could tell us whether it would have imposed the same sentence knowing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>the sentencing guidelines were only advisory.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">After reviewing the appropriate considerations under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the district court has responded that it would not have sentenced Fernandez-Reyes differently. Fernandez-Reyes did not respond to our invitation to file arguments concerning the appropriate disposition of the appeal in light of the district court\u2019s decision. The government did respond, however, and asks that we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Fernandez-Reyes\u2019s sentence of 80 months\u2019 imprisonment is within the guidelines range of 77 to 96 months. It is therefore presumptively reasonable, <em>United States v. Spano, </em>447 F.3d 517, 519 (7th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Mykytiuk, </em>415 F.3d 606, 608 (7th Cir.2005), and Fernandez-Reyes has not even attempted to rebut the presumption. Moreover, the district court thoroughly explained why the sentencing purposes of restraint and deterrence make a sentence within the guidelines range appropriate. The sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
