Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), in applying a two-point enhancement pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1). We will affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">Writing, as we do, only for the benefit of the parties, we recite only those facts essential to decide this appeal. On February 18, 2005, Robert Clarke, a native and citizen of Jamaica, pleaded guilty to a four-count indictment, charging, <em>inter alia, </em>conspiracy to traffic in controlled substances and possession of a firearm by an illegal alien.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At sentencing, the District Court imposed a two-point enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) for possession of firearms in connection with the drug conspiracy. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) requires courts to increase a defendant\u2019s offense level by two levels if a dangerous weapon was possessed by the defendant in the course of a drug trafficking offense. Note (3) of the Commentary to \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) specifies that the \u201cadjustment should be applied if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">Here, the police had arrested Clarke in his home pursuant to a criminal complaint and arrest warrant, discovering in that location three loaded firearms along with a small quantity of marijuana and drug ledgers. The District Court found that these facts, along with Clarke\u2019s guilty plea to the firearm and drug trafficking charges, established the requisite connection between the firearms and the drug trafficking to justify the two-point enhancement. This two-point enhancement, in turn, increased the advisory guideline range from 84-105 months to 100-125 months. As a result, upon consulting the guidelines as required by <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 264, 125 S.Ct. 738, the District Court ultimately imposed a sentence of 121 months imprisonment, 5 years of supervised release, a $1,000 fine, and a $400 special assessment. Clarke thereafter filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-11\">Clarke argues that the two-point enhancement contravened the Sixth Amendment, inasmuch as he never admitted or conceded that the firearms were possessed in connection with drug trafficking.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In so arguing, Clarke relies on <em>Booker </em>for the proposition that \u201cany factor which enhances a sentence must be determined by a jury or expressly conceded.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 5. Clarke, however, misreads <em>Booker. </em>The remedial portion of the <em>Booker </em>opinion demonstrates that judicial fact-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>finding by a preponderance of the evidence standard is unconstitutional only in the context of a <em>mandatory </em>sentencing regime. <em>United States v. Miller, </em>417 F.3d 358, 362-63 (3d Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Antonakopoulos, </em>399 F.3d 68, 75 (1st Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103, 112 (2d Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Dalton, </em>409 F.3d 1247, 1252 (10th Cir.2005). In other words, the Sixth Amendment is not violated simply because a judge finds sentencing facts under the guidelines; rather, to trigger constitutional error, the judge must do so pursuant to a mandatory guidelines system. Where, as here, such judicial fact-finding occurs in an advisory guidelines scheme, it raises no Sixth Amendment issues.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">Hi H\u00ab H&lt; # \u2756 *</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b897-7\">. The District Court had subject matter jurisdiction over this criminal action pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We have appellate jurisdiction to review Clarke\u2019s sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review of the District Court\u2019s interpretation and application of the now-advisory guidelines is plenary. <em>Cf. United States v. Irvin, </em>369 F.3d 284, 285 n. 2 (3d Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b897-8\">. The indictment, returned by a grand jury in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, charged (1) conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute approximately 80 kilograms of marijuana, contrary to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846; (2) conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of cocaine, also contrary to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846; (3) possession of a firearm affecting interstate commerce by an illegal alien, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(5); and (4) unlawful entry after deportation, contrary to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). Two co-defendants \u2014 William Jackson and Natasha Blalock \u2014 were also charged in the first count of the indictment. Neither co-defendant is involved in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b897-13\">. Appended to the indictment was a \u201cNotice of Additional Factors,\u201d which charged, in pertinent part, that Clarke \u201cpossessed a dangerous weapon ...\u201d as described in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1). However, Clarke never conceded the allegations in the \u201cNotice of Additional Factors\u201d appended to the indictment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b898-15\">. We note that Clarke limits his appeal to the legality of judicial fact-finding in a <em>post-Booker </em>world. Because he does not challenge the reasonableness or the factual basis of the two-level enhancement, we express no opinion on the matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
