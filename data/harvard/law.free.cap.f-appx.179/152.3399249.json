The decision is filed by a quorum of the panel pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 46(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b178-21\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b178-22\">Thomas Blake Siler appeals from the 122-month sentence imposed following his guilty plea to possession with intent to distribute 20.6 grams of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) &amp; (b)(1)(B) (2000), and use of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) (2000). Siler\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there were no meritorious issues for appeal, but challenging the reasonableness of Siler\u2019s sentence. Siler filed a pro se supplemental brief raising claims of prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective assistance of counsel. Because our review of the record discloses no reversible error, we affirm Siler\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-23\">Siler argues the district court\u2019s imposition of a 122-month sentence was unreasonable. We disagree. Siler admitted to possession of 20.6 grams of cocaine base, thus triggering the five-year mandatory minimum set forth in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(2)(B)(iii) (2000). Further, pleading guilty to use of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense resulted in the mandatory application of a second five-year term, which was to run consecutive to any other term of imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(I) (2000). Thus, the 122-month sentence is only two months longer than the shortest term of imprisonment to which the district court could have sentenced Siler. Accordingly, we find the sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>We have considered the claims raised by Siler in his supplemental brief and find them without merit. The record reveals no acts of misconduct on the part of the prosecutor, and Siler\u2019s allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel are more appropriately raised in a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Siler\u2019s guilty plea was knowingly and voluntarily entered after a thorough hearing pursuant to Rule 11. Siler was properly advised of his rights, the offenses charged, and the maximum sentences for the offenses. The court also determined that there was an independent factual basis for the plea and that the plea was not coerced or influenced by any promises. <em>See North Carolina v. Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 31, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970); <em>United States v. De-Fusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 119-20 (4th Cir.1991). We therefore affirm Siler\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
