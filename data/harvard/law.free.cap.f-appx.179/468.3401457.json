ANDERSON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-12\">Defendant-Appellant Jose Antonio Guerrero-Chavez pled guilty to one count of illegal reentry by a deported alien previously convicted for an aggravated felony, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a)(1) and (b)(2). He was sentenced to fifty-seven months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by a two-year term of supervised release. He has filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-17\">Guerrero-Chavez\u2019s appointed counsel, Louis Elias Lopez, has filed an <em>Anders </em>brief and moved to withdraw as counsel. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Guerrero-Chavez has filed a response brief to the <em>Anders </em>brief. The government has declined to submit a brief. For the following reasons, we grant Guerrero-Chavez\u2019s counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw as counsel and we dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-18\">Guerrero-Chavez was charged in a one-count indictment with unlawful reentry by a deported alien previously convicted for an aggravated felony, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a)(1) and (b)(2). He pled guilty after being informed by the district court of all the rights which he was thereby relinquishing and indicating that he understood the ramifications of his guilty plea and that his plea was voluntarily and freely made. As stated in Guerrero-Chavez\u2019s plea hearing, the factual basis for his guilty plea was the following: On June 23, 2004, Border Patrol agents responded to the activation of a Border Patrol sensor in Dona Ana County, New Mexico, and found Guerrero-Chavez and three other individuals hiding in the desert. Guerrero-Chavez admitted he was an alien and that he had just entered the United States illegally. Upon investigation, the Border Patrol agents discovered that Guerrero-Chavez had been previously deported from the United States on December 9, 1997. They further discovered that he had been convicted of a felony, corporal injury to a spouse, prior to his deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>The presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) prepared by the probation office calculated a total offense level of 21 and a criminal history category of IV, which yielded a sentencing range of fifty-seven to seventy-one months under the United States Sentencing Commission, <em>Guidelines Manual </em>(Nov.2004) (\u201cUSSG\u201d). The total offense level was determined by taking the base offense level of eight and adding sixteen points because Guerrero-Chavez was previously deported (in 1997) after being convicted for a felony crime of violence, then deducting three points for acceptance of responsibility. <em>See </em>PSR \u00b6 10, R. Vol. II (citing USSG \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii)). Guerrero-Chavez made no objection to the PSR and the district court adopted its findings. The district court then sentenced Guerrero-Chavez to fifty-seven months, after considering the sentencing factors contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and the advisory Guideline range, as required by <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Guerrero-Chavez\u2019s attorney, in his <em>Anders </em>brief, argues that there is no basis for challenging Guerrero-Chavez\u2019s guilty plea or his sentence and that there is therefore no legally non-frivolous issue to raise on appeal. <em>Anders </em>authorizes counsel to request permission to withdraw where counsel has conscientiously examined the case and determined that any appeal would be wholly frivolous. <em>Anders, </em>386 U.S. at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396; <em>see also United States v. Calderon, </em>428 F.3d 928, 930 (10th Cir. 2005). Accordingly,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-7\">[ujnder <em>Anders, </em>counsel must submit a brief to the client and the appellate court indicating any potential appealable issues based on the record. The client may then choose to submit arguments to the court. The Court must then conduct a full examination of the record to determine whether defendant\u2019s claims are wholly frivolous. If the court concludes after such an examination that the appeal is frivolous, it may grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and may dismiss the appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-10\"><em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Anders, </em>386 U.S. at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-11\">Guerrero-Chavez argues in his response to his counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief that, because his deportation in 1997 was stated to be because he had been convicted of a crime of moral turpitude, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(i), and not because he had been convicted of a crime of violence, his prior conviction for corporal abuse of a spouse cannot be deemed a felony crime of violence for purposes of his current proceeding. Accordingly, he argues, the district court erred in increasing his base offense level by sixteen points under USSG \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-12\">While creative, this argument is unavailing. It did not matter whether the prior deportation was <em>because of </em>his conviction for a crime of violence. As the application note to USSG \u00a7 2L1.2 specifically states, \u201c[a] defendant shall be considered to be deported after a conviction if the deportation was subsequent to the conviction, regardless of whether the deportation was in response to the conviction.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.1(A)(ii)). Further, the status of his prior conviction as a conviction for a crime of violence only becomes relevant in his current proceeding. In this proceeding, the government is free to determine whether his prior conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>was for a crime of violence. The PSR determined that it was, Guerrero-Chavez made no objection to the PSR, and the district court adopted the PSR, including its characterization of Guerrero-Chavez\u2019s conviction for corporal abuse of a spouse as a conviction for a felony crime of violence. Thus, the fact that the government may have chosen to deport Guerrero-Chavez in 1997 on the stated ground of having committed a crime of moral turpitude is irrelevant to the characterization in this case of that crime. What matters is that he was convicted of what was indisputably a crime of violence, subsequent to that he was deported, and he then illegally reentered the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">After fully examining the record and considering the <em>Anders </em>brief filed by Guerrero-Chavez\u2019s counsel, as well as Guerrero-Chavez\u2019s response thereto, we conclude that there are no non-frivolous issues upon which Guerrero-Chavez may base his appeal. We can discern no basis for challenging Guerrero-Chavez\u2019s guilty plea or his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">We therefore GRANT Guerrero-Chavez\u2019s counsel\u2019s request to withdraw and we DISMISS this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b495-13\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b496-8\">. USSG \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) provides that \"[i]f the defendant previously was deported ... after[ ] a conviction for a felony that is ... a crime of violence ... increase [the base offense level] by 16 levels.\u201d Deportation following a conviction \"for any other felony\u201d mandates a base offense level increase of four levels. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(D).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
