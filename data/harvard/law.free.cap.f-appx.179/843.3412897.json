In 1994, Davis was convicted by a Texas jury of possession with intent to distribute cocaine base and conspiracy. Davis was sentenced to life imprisonment for the cocaine conviction and, concurrently, to five years for conspiracy. Davis\u2019s convictions and sentences were affirmed on direct appeal. In 1997, Davis filed a motion to vacate sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, raising ineffective assistance of counsel claims. The sentencing court denied that motion, and Davis\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability was denied by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-15\">In 2004, Davis filed a habeas corpus petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 in the District Court, challenging his convictions and sentences on due process and equal protection grounds. Davis also asserted a claim based on <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 303-04, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), which held that the State of Washington\u2019s determinate sentencing scheme violated the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial by permitting the imposition of sentence enhancements based on facts found by a judge, using a less stringent standard of proof than that used by a jury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Over Davis\u2019s filed objections, the District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation and dismissed Davis\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-16\">We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. After a careful review of the record, we conclude that the appeal presents \u201cno substantial question.\u201d We will, therefore, summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment pursuant to Third Cir. LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>Section 2255 is the presumptive means for a federal prisoner to challenge his sentence or conviction. <em>Davis v. United States, </em>417 U.S. 333, 343, 94 S.Ct. 2298, 41 L.Ed.2d 109 (1974). We have held that a federal prisoner can seek collateral relief via habeas corpus under \u00a7 2241 in the rare situation where \u00a7 2255\u2019s scope or procedure makes it \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d to challenge a conviction or sentence. <em>See In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 248 (3d Cir.1997). However, this \u201csafety-valve\u201d provision of \u00a7 2255 applies only in narrow circumstances. <em>See id. </em>at 252. Section 2255 is not \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d merely because the petitioner was denied relief in a previous \u00a7 2255 proceeding or is unable to meet the stringent gatekeeping requirements of \u00a7 2255. <em>See Cradle v. United States ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538-39 (3d Cir.2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">Davis contends that his equal protection and due process challenges focus on Congress\u2019s legislative action in passing the laws under which he was convicted and sentenced, rather than on his particular convictions and sentences. <em>See </em>Objections to Report and Recommendation at 3. Such claims, Davis argues, are not cognizable in a motion filed under \u00a7 2255 and must be brought via \u00a7 2241. <em>See id. </em>Alternatively, Davis asserts that his claims challenge the execution of his sentence, as opposed to its imposition, thereby making \u00a7 2241 appropriate. <em>See id. </em>at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">Notwithstanding the sweeping language in his constitutional arguments, Davis\u2019s claims clearly embody the \u201cessence of habeas corpus,\u201d as they attack the legality of his custody and seek to secure his immediate release. <em>See Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 484, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973). Further, as the District Court observed, Davis\u2019s claims challenge the validity and imposition of his sentence, rather than the manner in which it is being carried out, making them inappropriate for \u00a7 2241. <em>Cf. Coady v. Vaughn, </em>251 F.3d 480, 485-86 (3d Cir. 2001). Finally, we agree with the District Court that Davis is not entitled to use \u00a7 2241 as a vehicle for his <em>Blakely/ Booker </em>claim merely because he would be barred from raising such a claim in a second \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Cradle, </em>290 F.3d at 538 (\u201c[i]t is the inefficacy of the remedy, not the personal inability to use it, that is determinative\u201d) .<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b871-10\">For these reasons, we agree with the District Court\u2019s refusal to entertain Davis\u2019s petition. We will, therefore, summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment. Davis\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b870-13\">. Since Davis filed his petition, the Supreme Court decided <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 243-44, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), which applied the <em>Blakely </em>rule to the federal Sentencing Guidelines, making them advisory rather than mandatory. As <em>Booker </em>is the more appropriate precedent for a federal sentencing challenge, we will refer to Davis's claim as arising under \"Blakely/ <em>Booker.\"</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b871-7\">. Davis\u2019s <em>Blakely/ Booker </em>claim also falls outside the \"safety-valve\u201d provision of \u00a7 2255, because neither <em>Blakely </em>nor <em>Booker </em>de-criminalized the conduct underlying Davis\u2019s convictions. <em>See Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 120 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
