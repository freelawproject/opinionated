In April 1994, he was sentenced to a term of 198 months imprisonment to be followed by five years of supervised release. The sentencing court also imposed an order of restitution in the amount of $12,320. The judgment and commitment order set no formal schedule for the amount or timing of payments. Instead, the court specified that the \u201cmonetary penalties\u201d were due \u201cin full immediately\u201d and payable during the period of incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-14\">From October 2004 to February 2005, while incarcerated at USP Terre Haute, Jackson made monthly $35 restitution payments pursuant to an agreement he made with the Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d) under the Inmate Financial Responsibility Program (\u201cIFRP\u201d). The IFRP encourages inmates to develop a plan to meet various financial obligations, including orders of restitution. <em>See </em>28 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 545.10-545.11. Non-participation in the program can lead to the loss of some privileges, including, inter alia, limitations on inmate pay, work and housing restrictions, and eligibility for community-based programs. <em>See </em>\u00a7 545.11(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-15\">In March 2005, Jackson filed a motion for modification of his order of restitution in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. He claimed that he lacked sufficient funds to make further monthly restitution payments and asked the district court to set a restitution payment schedule. Jackson also noted that the sentencing court\u2019s failure set such a schedule ultimately rendered him ineligible for the IFRP and, in turn, subjected him to various \u201csanctions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-16\">The District Court denied the motion, concluding that the sentencing court is under no obligation to set a schedule for restitution payments. It further determined that because the IFRP is a voluntary program, Jackson could restore his privileges by re-enrolling. Jackson appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-17\">A request that the District Court \u201cset a schedule of payment and the amount to be paid during [his] period of incarceration\u201d is properly brought pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(k). That statute provides that, upon notice \u201cof any material change in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>defendant\u2019s economic circumstances that might affect the defendant\u2019s ability to pay restitution,\u201d the District Court may \u201cadjust the payment schedule, or require immediate payment in full, as the interests of justice require.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(k). Before adjusting a defendant\u2019s restitution payment schedule, the District Court must receive certification from the Attorney General that those owed restitution have been informed of the defendant\u2019s changed circumstances. <em>United States v. Grant, </em>235 F.3d 95,100 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">We conclude that the District Court could not grant Jackson\u2019s request under \u00a7 3664(k). Jackson does not allege a material change in his economic circumstances, nor has he followed the procedural requirements for obtaining an adjustment in his restitution payment schedule. Nothing in the record suggests that the District Court received certification from the Attorney General of any changed circumstances. In short, the District Court correctly denied Jackson\u2019s request to set a payment schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Jackson also relied on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(f)(2) in asking the District Court to set a restitution payment schedule. In <em>United States v. Coates, </em>178 F.3d 681 (3d Cir.1999), we examined \u00a7 3664(f)(2), which requires the sentencing court, after ordering full restitution, to \u201cspecify in the restitution order the manner in which, and the schedule according to which, the restitution is to be paid.\u201d <em>Coates, </em>178 F.3d at 683 (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(f)(2)). In <em>Coates, </em>we held that the fixing of restitution payments is an exclusively judicial act and that a sentencing court commits plain error where it does not comply with the specification requirements of \u00a7 3664(f)(2). <em>Coates, </em>178 F.3d at 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">We are convinced that \u00a7 3664(k) does not provide an avenue for raising a challenge under <em>Coates. </em>As described previously, \u00a7 3664(k) provides a procedural device by which a defendant can petition the District Court to adjust his restitution payment schedule based on a change in economic circumstances. Section 3664(k), however, does not provide a vehicle by which a defendant can challenge the validity of the restitution order itself. Thus, Jackson may not raise in his \u00a7 3664(k) motion a contention that the sentencing court impermissibly delegated to the BOP the duty to set a schedule for his payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">Even assuming, arguendo, that \u00a7 3664(k) could be used by Jackson to allege that the sentencing court impermissibly delegated its judicial authority, we would reject the claim. The sentencing court did not delegate the scheduling of Jackson\u2019s restitution payments to the BOP. Rather, it simply exercised its authority to direct that \u201cmonetary penalties,\u201d including the restitution payment of $12,320, be paid \u201cin full immediately.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3572(d)(1). Ordering immediate payment is not an impermissible delegation because \u201csuch directives generally are interpreted to require not immediate payment in full but payment to the extent that the defendant can make it in good faith, beginning immediately.\u201d <em>See McGhee v. Clark, </em>166 F.3d 884, 886 (7th Cir.1998) (finding no conflict between a restitution order directing immediate payment and the BOP initiating an IFRP payment plan). Jackson\u2019s alleged inability to make the $35 monthly payments under the IFRP agreement does not require that the District Court establish a payment schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">In sum, this appeal presents \u201cno substantial question,\u201d <em>see </em>3rd Cir. LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6, and thus we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
