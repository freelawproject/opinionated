The United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania denied his habeas corpus petition, and we declined to issue a certificate of appealability. Sontag has filed a petition for a writ of mandamus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651 asking us to order the District Court to \u201caddress the state and local frauds,\u201d \u201ccorrect all the court records,\u201d and \u201cdetermine the real parties of interest in this fraud scheme.\u201d Sontag also asks that we issue \u201cindictments[] to resolve these issues,\u201d \u201cmake sure that any State which refuses to uphold the United States Constitution faces the wrath of the Federal Courts,\u201d and \u201cset up procedures that will prevent this heinous activity from happening in the future.\u201d Petition at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">Mandamus is a \u201cdrastic remedy\u201d which is generally used to \u201c \u2018confine an inferior court to a lawful exercise of its prescribed jurisdiction or to compel it to exercise its authority when it is its duty to do so.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kerr v. U.S. Dist. Court, </em>426 U.S. 894, 402, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976) (citations omitted). Only \u201c \u2018exceptional circumstances amounting to a judicial \u201cusurpation of power\u201d\u2019\u201d warrant the use of this extraordinary remedy. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">Even if the relief sought were within this Court\u2019s authority, a petition for a writ of mandamus is not the proper vehicle for Sontag\u2019s claims. Most of them were previously raised in his appeal of the District Court\u2019s denial of his habeas petition. The fact that Sontag was unsuccessful in that appeal is not grounds for pursuing mandamus relief. In his single new argument, Sontag contends that the District Court based its denial of his claims on a misunderstanding of the state court record with regard to certain testimony given by the victim at the preliminary hearing. He alleges that this misunderstanding is due to fraud on the part of the government. However, these arguments are more properly brought in an appeal or a motion for reconsideration. A mandamus petition is not a substitute for an appeal; if a petitioner can obtain relief by an ordinary appeal, a court will not issue the writ. <em>See In Re Ford Motor Co., </em>110 F.3d 954, 957 (3d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-10\">Accordingly, we will deny the petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
