We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-19\">This Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision where, as here, the BIA summarily adopted or affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion. <em>See Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Jin Hui Gao v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>400 F.3d 963, 964 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-20\">Where an asylum applicant demonstrates past persecution, the government may rebut the presumption of future persecution by showing that a \u201cchange in circumstances in the applicant\u2019s country of nationality has occurred such that the applicant\u2019s fear [of future persecution] is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>longer well founded.\u201d <em>Guan Shan Liao v. DOJ, </em>293 F.3d 61, 67 (2d Cir.2002) (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1)(i)). Here, in finding sufficiently changed country conditions, the IJ relied on the State Department Country Report for Macedonia. That report indicates that Macedonia\u2019s new, democratically-elected government has passed a broad-based amnesty law which applies to supporters of the Albanian National Liberation Army, like Lavdrim Spahiu. The Country Report adequately supports the IJ\u2019s finding that, due to the breadth of the amnesty law, and its application in Macedonia, Lavdrim Spahiu will not face a risk of persecution upon return to Macedonia. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 313 (holding that State Department report constituted \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d of changed country conditions).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">Furthermore, as the Spahius were unable to show the objective likelihood of persecution needed to prove an asylum claim, they were necessarily unable to meet the higher standard required to succeed on a claim for withholding of removal. <em>See Wu Biao Chen v. INS, </em>344 F.3d 272, 275 (2d Cir.2003). Moreover, as the Spahius have also failed to demonstrate that they would be tortured if returned to Macedonia, their claims under the CAT fail as well. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.16(c)(2), 208.18(a); <em>see also Mu-Xing Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 130, 133 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petitions for review are DENIED. The pending motions for a stay of removal in these petitions are DENIED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
