Pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 43(c)(2), Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales is automatically substituted for former Attorney General John Ashcroft.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b791-20\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b791-21\">Hua Chen, through counsel, petitions for review of the BIA decision which affirms an immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) holding that denies him asylum, withholding of removal and relief under Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-22\">Where, as here, the BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ without issuing an opinion, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004). Nevertheless, \u201cthe fact that the [agency] has relied primarily on credibility grounds in dismissing an asylum application cannot insulate the decision from review.\u201d <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir.2004). An adverse credibility determination must be based on \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d that \u201cbear a legitimate nexus\u201d to the finding. <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">Three of the IJ\u2019s four reason for finding Chen\u2019s testimony to be incredible do not qualify as \u201cspecific cogent reasons\u201d that \u201cbear a legitimate nexus\u201d to her adverse credibility finding. <em>Id. </em>The IJ erred in finding that Chen\u2019s failure to mention in his asylum application the exact date of his second beating by Chinese police adversely affected his credibility. Although Chen did not specify the exact day of his second encounter with authorities in his asylum statement, such information is a minor and isolated omission that does not go to the heart of Chen\u2019s claim. <em>See Chung Sai Zheng v. Gonzales, </em>440 F.3d 76, 79-80 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">The IJ also erred in finding that Chen\u2019s written application failed to mention that he was beaten by the police when he was arrested a few weeks after February 2001, because the application explicitly stated that the police \u201cbeat us with baton [sic], arrested us and then detained us in the police station.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 80 (stating that \u201cmanifest misconstrual of the record warrants reconsideration on remand\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">Finally, the IJ erred in finding that the letter Chen provided from his father contradicted his testimony that he was too afraid to return home after July 2001. The IJ found that the letter indicated that it became too dangerous for Chen to return to his home after his first arrest. However, the letter states only that \u201cin February 2001, you joined in the Falun Gong Movement seeking to live a perfect life. However, you also got trouble because of that since Falun Gong was classified as evil cult by the authorities. That is why you got arrested and could not come back home. Now we know it would be safe for you to be over there, we feel much relieved.\u201d This general account does not contradict Chen\u2019s more specific account.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">The IJ\u2019s final basis for discrediting Chen\u2019s testimony, his denial during his airport interview that he had ever been arrested, may have been sufficient by itself to discredit his testimony. <em>See Ramsameachire, </em>357 F.3d at 181 (2d Cir.2004). However, because \u201cwe ean[not] state with confidence that the IJ would adhere to [her] decision\u201d absent the error-infected portion of her analysis, we must remand. <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. DOJ, </em>434 F.3d 144, 158 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">For the foregoing reasons, Chen\u2019s petition for review is GRANTED, the BIA decision is VACATED and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this order. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED. Any pending request for oral arguments is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>34(a)(2), Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
