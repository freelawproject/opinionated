By order entered August 17, 2005, the District Court granted Azubuko\u2019s motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>and dismissed his complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). In conjunction with the dismissal, the District Court ordered Azubuko to show cause in writing why he should not be enjoined pursuant to the All Writs Act, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651, from filing any further actions in the District Court for the District of New Jersey without prior approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-22\">Azubuko did not respond to the show cause order. Instead, on September 1, 2005, Azubuko filed a motion for reconsideration of the District Court\u2019s August 17 order, which the District Court denied on September 13, 2005. In the meantime, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>order entered September 7, 2005, the District Court entered the injunction, finding that Azubuko had failed to show cause why the injunction should not be imposed. Azubuko then filed a motion for reconsideration of the District Court\u2019s September 7 order, arguing that the injunction was \u201ctreason[ousj\u201d and \u201cThird World-like.\u201d Azubuko\u2019s second motion for reconsideration was denied by order entered September 23, 2005. On November 15, 2005, Azubuko filed a motion to recuse District Court Judge Pisano pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a), asserting that Judge Pisano\u2019s September 7 order was \u201cinhuman, preposterous, and Saddam Husseinistic.\u201d The District Court denied Azubuko\u2019s recusal motion by order entered November 18, 2005. On December 7, 2005, Azubuko filed the underlying notice of appeal, indicating his intention to appeal only the November 18, 2005 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the District Court\u2019s denial of a recusal motion for abuse of discretion. <em>Securacomm Consulting, Inc. v. Securacom, Inc., </em>224 F.3d 273, 278 (3d Cir.2000). Under the circumstances presented here, we have little difficulty concluding that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Azubuko\u2019s recusal motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Under \u00a7 455, a judge must recuse where his impartiality \u201cmight reasonably be questioned.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a). Azubuko points to the District Court\u2019s September 7, 2005, order to support his claim that Judge Pisano\u2019s personal feelings clouded his professional judgment. However, \u201c[w]e have repeatedly stated that a party\u2019s displeasure with legal rulings does not form an adequate basis for recusal.\u201d <em>Securacomm, </em>224 F.3d at 278; <em>see also Jones v. Pittsburgh Nat\u2019l Corp., </em>899 F.2d 1350, 1356 (3d Cir.1990) (\u201cDisagreement with a judge\u2019s determinations and rulings cannot be equated with the showing required to so reflect on impartiality as to require recusal.\u201d). Moreover, we find nothing in the record to suggest \u201ca deep-seated favoritism or antagonism that would make fan-judgment impossible.\u201d <em>Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994). Nor do we perceive any facts from which a reasonable person would conclude that the impartiality of Judge Pisano might reasonably be questioned. <em>See Edelstein v. Wilentz, </em>812 F.2d 128,131 (3d Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s November 18, 2005, order denying Azubuko\u2019s motion for recusal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
