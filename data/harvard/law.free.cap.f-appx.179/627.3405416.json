Krebs (\u201cKrebs\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for partial summary judgment and the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the Appellee, Aviation Constructors, Inc. (\u201cAVI\u201d). In the district court, Krebs asserted a state-law breach of contract claim, as well as claims based on the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001 <em>et seq., </em>following his termination from his position as a company vice president.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">The court determined that Krebs\u2019s written employment contract is unenforceable under Georgia law because it does not contain terms essential to an employment agreement \u2014 compensation and duties. Krebs contends on appeal that the district court erred in its interpretation of Georgia contract claw. We find no error in the district court\u2019s determination. The contract at issue in this case lacked sufficient terms to make it enforceable under Georgia law. <em>See Weill v. Brown, </em>197 Ga. 328, 29 S.E.2d 54, 57 (1944) (holding an employment contract with indefinite terms of compensation, duration, and duties to be unenforceable and stating that, for an employment contract to be enforceable, \u201c \u2018the nature and character of the services to be performed and the amount to be paid therefor must be of such a character that it can be ascertained.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Mosteller v. Mashbum, </em>64 Ga.App. 92, 12 S.E.2d 142,145 (1940)).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-11\">Krebs also contends that the district court erred in concluding that Krebs\u2019s termination was not motivated by a desire to deprive him of ERISA-covered employment benefits. ERISA forbids termination of an employee for the purpose of depriving him of ERISA-covered benefits. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1140. To survive summary judgment on a claim based on this section, a plaintiff must provide direct or circumstantial evidence of the employer\u2019s specific intent to deprive him of benefits by terminating him. <em>Clark v. Coats &amp; Clark, </em>990 F.2d 1217, 1223 (11th Cir.1993). No direct evidence of specific intent exists in this case, so Krebs was required to show (1) that he was entitled to ERISA benefits; (2) that he was qualified for his position; and (3) that the circumstances surrounding his termination give rise to an inference of specific intent. <em>See id. </em>Assuming arguendo that Krebs made a sufficient showing in the district court to warrant this inference, the burden then shifted to AVI to articulate a legitimate business reason for terminating Krebs. <em>See Gitlitz v. Compagnie Nationale Air France, </em>129 F.3d 554, 559 (11th Cir.1997). And, because the written employment contract was unenforceable as an employment contract, the reason for termination did not need to be one permitted by this written employment agreement. AVI articulated a reason unrelated to Krebs\u2019s ERISA benefits \u2014 that he failed to comply with a directive of senior management \u2014 and Krebs did not demonstrate that this reason was pretextual. Accordingly, we conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>the court correctly determined that Krebs put forth insufficient evidence to survive summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
