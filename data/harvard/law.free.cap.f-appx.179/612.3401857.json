On appeal, McCloud argues that: (1) in his underlying criminal case, the district court did not have jurisdiction; (2) in this case, the government did not have authority to seize the funds; (3) the district court could not order the funds to be applied towards his outstanding criminal fine because they were not connected with criminal activity; and (4) he was not afforded an opportunity to be heard with regard to this issue. Finally, McCloud argues that his attorneys were ineffective, both in the underlying criminal proceedings and in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-20\">Because the district court generally can enforce a judgment imposing a fine against all property of a person who owes a criminal fine, we affirm the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-21\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b638-17\">. McCloud also has filed a motion to remand. We DENY the motion because it contains no new issues or arguments.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
