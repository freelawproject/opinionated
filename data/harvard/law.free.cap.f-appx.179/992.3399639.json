We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we grant the petition and remand to the BIA for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">Because the BIA affirmed without an opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s decision directly, requiring only that it be supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Garcia-Martinez v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 1066, 1074 (9th Cir.2004). The IJ rejected Santos Lopez\u2019s claim that the events were based on her actual or imputed political opinion. Santos Lopez does not challenge this conclusion. Instead, on this petition for review she again asserts the claim in her application that she was persecuted based on her \u201cmembership in a particular social group,\u201d her family. The IJ did not address this claim, and so there has been no agency determination of related facts and whether the facts as determined fall within that protected ground. We therefore must remand for the agency to decide in the first instance whether Santos Lopez\u2019s family \u201cpresents the kind of \u2018kinship ties\u2019 that constitute a \u2018particular social group.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gonzales v.

Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam) (court of appeals should not conduct de novo inquiry, but must remand to agency for additional investigation or explanation).</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b1018-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
