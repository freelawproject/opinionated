We assume familiarity with the facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-21\">Where the BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ, we review the IJ\u2019s decision directly. <em>Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005). This court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Jin Hui Gao v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>400 F.3d 963, 964 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam). We review the BIA\u2019s legal conclusions de novo. <em>Guan Shan Liao v. U.S. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number><em>Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>293 F.3d 61, 66 (2d Cir. 2002) . To establish eligibility for asylum, an applicant must show that he has suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a social group, or political opinion. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42). An applicant for withholding of removal must demonstrate a clear probability that his life or freedom would be threatened on account of one of these enumerated grounds. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">The IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination relied, in large part, on the lack of corroborating materials confirming petitioner\u2019s identity and political affiliation in Albania. We agree with the IJ that petitioner should have been able to produce many of the corroborative documents the IJ sought, especially letters from family members still in Albania testifying to instances of persecution and evidence of petitioner\u2019s political affiliation given that petitioner was in continuous contact with members of the Democratic Party while in the United States. <em>See Jin Shui Qiu v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 140, 153 (2d Cir. 2003) (IJ may deny asylum for lack of corroborating evidence if the IJ identifies particular pieces of documentation and demonstrates the information would be reasonably available); <em>Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 288-89 (2d Cir.2000). Because the IJ identified particular, relevant information and explained why it was reasonable to expect such documentation from petitioner, the IJ was entitled to rely on this ground in making her adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">While the parties\u2019 briefs assume that the case of petitioner\u2019s mother, Katrine Gjura, is also under review, the petition for review mentions only the petitioner, Filip. We therefore cannot review the IJ\u2019s decision as to Katrine. However, assuming Katrine\u2019s case were before us, we would deny her petition for the reasons outlined above.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-10\">For the reasons set forth above, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
