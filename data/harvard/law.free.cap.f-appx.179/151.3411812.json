The district court sentenced him as a career offender to a 180-month term of imprisonment. Boswell appeals his sentence, citing <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We vacate Boswell\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-22\">Boswell contends that the district court committed statutory <em>Booker </em>error by treating the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory rather than advisory. Because Boswell raised a timely objection at sentencing based upon <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), he has preserved his claim of statutory <em>Booker </em>error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>433 F.3d 411, 415-16 (4th Cir.2006). Thus, we review Boswell\u2019s claim for harmless error, which places \u201cthe burden ... on the <em>Government </em>to show that such an error did <em>not </em>affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 416. Our review of the transcript of the sentencing hearing leads us to conclude that the Government has not met its burden to show that the error is harmless. The district court\u2019s silence on how it would apply the factors in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005) in ascertaining a proper sentence for Boswell must be construed in Boswell\u2019s favor. <em>Rodriguez, </em>433 F.3d at 416. Thus, we conclude that Boswell is entitled to be resentenced.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-23\">Accordingly, we vacate Boswell\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with <em>Booker </em>and <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540 (4th Cir.2005).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b177-19\">. In light of our vacatur for statutory <em>Booker </em>error, we need not decide whether, as Boswell also contends on appeal, the district court committed Sixth Amendment error in sentencing him as a career offender. <em>See Rodriguez, </em>433 F.3d at 416 n. 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b177-24\">. \"We of course offer no criticism of the district judge, who followed the law and procedure in effect at the time of [Boswell\u2019s] sentencing.\u201d <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 545 n. 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
