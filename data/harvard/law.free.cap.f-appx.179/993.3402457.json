Avdaiyan challenges the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, arguing that it is not supported by substantial evidence. Avdaiyan further contends that the IJ erred in failing to consider independently his CAT claim. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review questions of law de novo, <em>see Vasquez-Zavala v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 1105, 1107 (9th Cir.2003), and the BIA\u2019s factual findings for substantial evidence, <em>see Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 1164, 1168 (9th Cir.2004). We deny the petition for review in part, grant it in part and remand for further proceedings. The parties are familiar with the facts, so we need not recite them in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-14\">Because the BIA summarily affirmed the IJ through its streamlining procedure, we \u201clook through the BIA\u2019s decision to examine the IJ\u2019s reasons for deeming the person not credible.\u201d <em>Bandari v. INS, </em>227 F.3d 1160, 1165 (9th Cir.2000). Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. Among the numerous reasons the IJ cited for his adverse credibility finding was the inconsistency in Avdalyan\u2019s testimony regarding the locations of his first and second arrests. At the asylum hearing, Avdaiyan testified that both arrests were at his pastor\u2019s house, whereas at his asylum interview he stated that the first arrest was at Samuel\u2019s house and the second at Varuzh\u2019s. When confronted with this inconsistency, Avdaiyan offered numerous explanations: first, that Samuel lived with the pastor and that he had said the second arrest occurred there also; second, that the church had built a place for religious services that was considered \u201ca part of our homes,\u201d and that his second arrest occurred there, at \u201cour house, Varuzh\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>house\u201d; and finally, that Varuzh\u2019s house was attached to the pastor\u2019s house. In rejecting these explanations, the IJ concluded that Avdalyan \u201ccaught himself up in the toils of trying both to extricate himself from his testimony to the asylum officer and to reconcile it with his direct testimony before the court.\u201d <em>See Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 963 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">Moreover, Avdalyan offered clearly contradictory accounts of the circumstances surrounding his third arrest. On direct examination, Avdalyan testified that he was arrested as he was about to enter the police station. On redirect examination, however, Avdalyan said that he was picked up by the police while walking towards the station and was placed in their car for a six to seven minute drive. In context of Avdalyan\u2019s overall testimony, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding based on the obvious and significant inconsistency in Avdalyan\u2019s testimony was proper, notwithstanding that the IJ never directly confronted Avdalyan with the inconsistency. C<em>f. Guo v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 1194, 1200 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201cWe have previously determined that <em>unclear testimony </em>may not serve as substantial evidence for an adverse credibility finding when an applicant is not given the chance to attempt to clarify his or her testimony.\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-6\">Although some of the other grounds the IJ relied on were arguably insufficient or improper, because at least one of the grounds the IJ properly cited is supported by substantial evidence and goes to the heart of Avdalyan\u2019s claim of persecution, \u201cwe are bound to accept the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding.\u201d <em>Li, </em>378 F.3d at 964.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-7\">Because Avdalyan failed to establish eligibility for asylum, he also failed to meet the higher standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Prasad v. INS, </em>47 F.3d 336, 340 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-8\">The IJ erred, however, in rejecting Avdalyan\u2019s CAT claim simply by relying on his reasons for rejecting Avdalyan\u2019s applications for asylum and withholding of removal. Contrary to our precedent, the IJ did not evaluate Avdalyan\u2019s CAT claim independently by paying attention to \u201call evidence relevant to the possibility of future torture,\u201d <em>Kamalthas v. INS, </em>251 F.3d 1279, 1283 (9th Cir.2001), including, as may have been appropriate in this case, the country conditions report, <em>see Zhang v. Ashcroft, </em>388 F.3d 713, 721 (9th Cir.2004) (per curiam). Because the IJ allowed his adverse credibility finding to \u201cwash over the torture claim,\u201d <em>Taha v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 800, 802 (9th Cir.2004), we remand for a proper determination of Avdalyan\u2019s eligibility for CAT relief, <em>see Mihalev v. Ashcroft, </em>388 F.3d 722, 731 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-9\">We reject the government\u2019s argument that we do not have jurisdiction to evaluate Avdalyan\u2019s CAT claim because he failed to exhaust the issue below. Avdalyan\u2019s brief to the BIA explicitly stated that he was appealing all of the IJ\u2019s determinations, including the IJ\u2019s finding that Avdalyan was not eligible for CAT relief. That was sufficient for exhaustion. <em>See Zhang, </em>388 F.3d at 721.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-10\">Avdalyan\u2019s unopposed motion for a 30-day extension of time to file his reply brief is granted. The clerk shall file the reply brief received on April 20, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-11\">Petition for review DENIED in part, GRANTED in part and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1020-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
