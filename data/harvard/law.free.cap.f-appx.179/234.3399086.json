Perez was sentenced to an 80-month term of imprisonment and to a three-year period of supervised release. Perez was also fined $2,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-21\">Perez contends that the district court\u2019s classification of him as a \u201cprohibited person,\u201d in determining his offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(B), was based improperly on admissions made to the probation officer during a presentence interview in violation of Perez\u2019s plea agreement with the Government. Our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Munoz, </em>408 F.3d 222, 226 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-22\">The Government did not agree expressly that the guidelines sentence should be calculated in a particular manner; nor did it agree expressly that admissions made pursuant to the cooperation agreement could not be used against him. Perez\u2019s contention that there was an implicit understanding is without merit. Perez acknowledged that he would be sentenced pursuant to the Sentencing Guidelines and that his guideline range could not be predicted until after the pre-sentence investigation was completed. Unlike <em>United States v. Marsh, </em>963 F.2d 72, 74 (5th Cir.1992), and <em>United States v. Kinsey, </em>917 F.2d 181, 184 (5th Cir.1990), cited by Perez, the Government does not concede in this case that it had agreed that Perez\u2019s cooperation agreement would be governed by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.8(a). Perez could not reasonably have believed that the Government\u2019s promise not to bring additional charges implicitly barred the use, in determining his sentence, of inculpatory admissions during his interview with the probation officer. Therefore, Perez cannot show that the plea agreement rested in any significant degree on a promise or agreement of the prosecutor or that the Government\u2019s conduct was inconsistent with Perez\u2019s reasonable understanding of the agreement. <em>See Munoz, </em>408 F.3d at 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Even assuming clear and obvious error, Perez cannot show that the error seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. Under \u00a7 2K2.1, comment, (n. 3), the term \u201c \u2018prohibited person\u2019 means any person described in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)____\u201d Under \u00a7 922(g)(3), it is unlawful for a person \u201cwho is an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance\u201d to ship or transport, possess, or receive a firearm or ammunition that has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce. <em>See United States v. Bennett, </em>329 F.3d 769, 776-77 &amp; n. 4 (10th Cir.2003) (drug use must be contemporaneous but need not be simultaneous with offense); <em>United States v. Nevarez, </em>251 F.3d 28, 30 (2d Cir.2001) (evidence of persistent drug problem sufficient). Evidence in the record of Perez\u2019s long-term marijuana use provides an ample basis for the court to determine that Perez\u2019s marijuana use was contemporaneous with the offense, regardless of the disputed admissions evidence. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>406 F.3d 323, 335 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, Perez cannot show that the district court committed reversible plain error. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b260-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
