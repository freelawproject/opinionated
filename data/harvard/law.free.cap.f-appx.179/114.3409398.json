In 1997, a jury convicted Thomas of armed bank robbery and carrying a firearm in relation to a crime of violence, and Thomas was sentenced to a total of 822 months\u2019 imprisonment. We affirmed Thomas\u2019s convictions and sentence on appeal. <em>See United States v. Thomas, </em>No. 97-7387, 1998 WL 166801 (judgment entered March 13,1998). Thomas\u2019s first motion to vacate sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 was filed in September 1998 and was denied by the District Court. We declined to issue Thomas a certificate of appealability. <em>See United States v. Thomas, </em>No. 99-3050 (order entered August 12, 1999). Thomas subsequently filed a series of applications under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244 seeking our authorization to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, each of which was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">In his current habeas petition, filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, Thomas argues that his sentence violates his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights because he did not concede and a jury did not determine that his prior state convictions qualified as a basis for enhancement under the sentencing guidelines. Thomas also argues that counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the sentence enhancements and because he \u201cwasted\u201d Thomas\u2019s appeal rights by only contesting the testimony of one witness, which he had failed to object to during trial. The District Court dismissed Thomas\u2019s petition for lack of jurisdiction, rejecting Thomas\u2019s contention that \u00a7 2255 was an \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d means by which to raise his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. After a careful review of the record, we conclude that Thomas\u2019s appeal must be dismissed. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Section 2255 is the presumptive means for a federal prisoner to challenge his sentence or conviction. <em>Davis v. United States, </em>417 U.S. 333, 343, 94 S.Ct. 2298, 41 L.Ed.2d 109 (1974). A habeas petitioner can seek relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 only if the remedy provided by \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of [the] detention.\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 \u00b6 5. As noted by the District Court, \u00a7 2255 is not inadequate or ineffective merely because Thomas cannot meet the AEDPA\u2019s stringent gatekeeping requirements. <em>See </em>Dist. Ct. Op. at 2; <em>Cradle v. United States ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 539 (3d Cir.2002) (per curiam). Rather, \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective only where the petitioner demonstrates a limitation in the scope or procedure offered by \u00a7 2255 which would prevent him from having a full hearing and adjudication of his claim. <em>See Cradle, </em>290 F.3d at 538. Thomas has not demonstrated such a limitation in \u00a7 2255\u2019s scope or procedure. Thomas\u2019s petition raises no claims which could not have been raised in a motion pursuant to \u00a7 2255. In fact, Thomas\u2019s proposed claims are similar, if not identical, to claims he attempted to raise in his \u00a7 2244 applications. Thomas cannot use \u00a7 2241 as an alternative means of presenting these claims in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">Section 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) instructs us to dismiss any appeal brought <em>informa pauperis </em>if, inter alia, it lacks an arguable basis in law or in fact. <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319,109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). Because the District Court\u2019s judgment was clearly correct, Thomas had no arguable legal basis upon which to appeal. Accordingly, Thomas\u2019s appeal will be dismissed under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). Appellant\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
