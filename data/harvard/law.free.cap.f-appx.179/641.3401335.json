On appeal, Nicolas argues that the district court erred in denying her petition because the Haitian police had a mixed-motive for persecuting her on account of her imputed political opinion. Nicolas contends that the police persecuted her because she investigated her claim that the police killed her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">When a single member of the BIA summarily affirms the IJ\u2019s decision without an opinion, such as here, the IJ\u2019s decision becomes the final removal order subject to review. <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1284 n. 1 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cTo the extent that the IJ\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, [our] review is de novo.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir.2004). The IJ\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial-evidence test, and we must affirm the IJ\u2019s decision \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283-84 (2001) (quotation omitted). \u201cTo reverse the IJ\u2019s fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-11\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-12\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. To establish asylum eligibility, the alien must establish past persecution or well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b). \u201cDemonstrating such a connection requires the alien to present specific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be <em>singled out </em>for persecution on account of such an opinion [or other statutory factor].\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287 (quotations omitted). An asylum applicant may not show merely that she has a political opinion, but must show that she was persecuted because of that opinion. <em>INS </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number><em>v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 816, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">To qualify for withholding of removal under the INA, an alien must show that it is more likely than not that if returned to her country, the alien\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). If a petitioner is unable to meet the \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d standard for asylum, she is generally precluded from qualifying for withholding of deportation. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">The alien\u2019s testimony, if credible, may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof for asylum or withholding of removal without corroboration. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.13(a), 208.16(b). \u201cHowever, the weaker the applicant\u2019s testimony, the greater the need for corroborative evidence.\u201d <em>In re Y-B-, </em>21 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 1136, 1139, 1998 WL 99554 (1998). If the alien establishes past persecution, it is presumed that her life or freedom would be threatened upon a return to that country. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.13(b)(1), 208.16(b)(1). An alien who has not shown past persecution may still be entitled to asylum or withholding of removal if she can demonstrate a future threat to her life or freedom on a protected ground in her country. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 208.13(b)(2), 208.16(b)(2). To establish a \u201cwell-founded fear,\u201d \u201can applicant must demonstrate that his or her fear of persecution is subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">We have held that \u201c[a]n imputed political opinion, whether correctly or incorrectly attributed, may constitute a ground for a well-founded fear of political persecution within the meaning of the INA.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289 (quotations omitted). \u201cAn asylum applicant may prevail on a theory of imputed political opinion if he shows that the persecutor falsely attributed an opinion to him, and then persecuted him because of that mistaken belief about his views.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alterations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-10\">Although we have not addressed a mixed-motive argument in a published opinion, the Second and Ninth Circuits have held that there is no requirement that persecution be based solely on account of a protected ground.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Borja v. INS, </em>175 F.3d 732, 735-36 (9th Cir.1999) (en banc); <em>Osorio v. INS, </em>18 F.3d 1017, 1028 (2d Cir.1994); <em>see also In re S-P-, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 486, 490, 1996 WL 422990 (1996) (noting that, in a mixed-motive case, \u201cthe standard for review is whether the applicant has produced evidence from which it is reasonable to believe that the harm was motivated by a protected ground\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-11\">In this case, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum and withholding of removal. Nicolas failed to present facts that would entitle her to relief. Nicolas asserted that the police killed her husband. Although she argues that part of the police\u2019s mixed-motive was imputed political opinion, she failed to cite any facts in support of this assertion. Thus, Nicolas has failed to show facts that compel a reversal of the IJ\u2019s denial of her asylum application. Likewise, Nicolas failed to show facts establishing a well-founded fear of future persecution because of a protected ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>Because Nicolas did not meet her burden of proof for her asylum claim, she cannot meet the higher burden of proof for withholding of removal. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93. Similarly, when a petitioner \u201chas failed to establish a claim of asylum on the merits, [s]he necessarily fails to establish eligibility for ... protection under CAT.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1288 n. 4 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">Accordingly, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Nicolas was not entitled to asylum, withholding of removal under the INA, or relief under the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b669-8\">.
