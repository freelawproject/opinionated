R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is, therefore, ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">Defendant Don Cornelius Dixon pled guilty to four drug-related crimes and was sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of 204 months. Dixon now appeals his sentence, arguing it is excessive and unreasonable in terms of its length, and asserting that the district court failed to adequately articulate its reasons for selecting the sentence. We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-11\">On January 26, 2005, Dixon was charged by criminal complaint with one count of knowingly and intentionally distributing cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). On February 16, 2005, a federal grand jury indicted Dixon on four criminal counts. Count 1 of the indictment charged Dixon with knowingly and intentionally using a telephone to facilitate the distribution of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b). Counts 2 through 4 charged Dixon with knowingly and intentionally distributing differing amounts of cocaine base on three separate occasions: 7.42 grams on July 8, 2004; 12.1 grams on July 15, 2004; and 4.7 grams on July 20, 2004. Dixon pled guilty to all four counts of the indictment on April 12, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-16\">A presentence investigation report (PSR) was subsequently prepared. The PSR concluded, in pertinent part, that Dixon should \u201cconservatively [be] held accountable for 750 ounces or 21,262.50 grams of cocaine base,\u201d ROA, Yol. 3 at 6, and that his base offense level should therefore be 38. <em>Id. </em>at 7. Dixon objected to these portions of the PSR, arguing that he should be sentenced in accordance with the drug quantities contained in the indictment and to which he pled guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-17\">The district court addressed Dixon\u2019s objections to the PSR at a sentencing hearing conducted on August 16, 2005. During the hearing, the government presented two witnesses, Richard Marshall and Kendra Chappell, both of whom testified about their drug dealings with Dixon. The district court expressly found the testimony of these two witnesses credible and, based on their testimony, found that the amount of crack cocaine attributable to Dixon was, conservatively, \u201csomewhere between ... 500 grams and ... 1.5 kilos....\u201d ROA, Vol. 2 at 76. In turn, the district court determined Dixon\u2019s base offense level to be 36, resulting in a guideline range of 188 to 235 months. <em>Id. </em>Dixon\u2019s counsel urged the district court to impose a sentence at the bottom of this guideline range. Id. at 80. In contrast, the government argued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>that, because Dixon was proven to be \u201ca very substantial drug dealer in the Chickasha area and elsewhere,\u201d the district court should \u201cnot impose a sentence at the bottom of the guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 79. Ultimately, the district court imposed a sentence of 204 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">In his appeal, Dixon challenges his sentence \u201cas excessive and unreasonable.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 9. In support of this challenge, Dixon argues \u201cthat had the district court adequately considered the section 3553 factors, a sentence of imprisonment of 188 months, the lower end of his guideline range, would have been sufficient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12-13. According to Dixon, \u201ca sentence of 188 months imprisonment would have been sufficient to provide [him] with much needed educational and substance abuse care.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">In <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the Supreme Court held that the mandatory application of the federal sentencing guidelines to judicially-found facts (other than the existence of a prior conviction) violates the Sixth Amendment. 125 S.Ct. at 749-50. To remedy this problem, \u201cthe Court excised the provision of the federal sentencing statute that made the Guidelines mandatory, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(1), effectively making the Guidelines advisory.\u201d <em>United States v. Kristl, </em>437 F.3d 1050, 1053 (10th Cir.2006). \u201cThe Court also excised 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e), which set forth the standard of review on appeal, and held that the proper standard of review for sentences imposed <em>post-Booker </em>is \u2018reasonableness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 764-66).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">We recently \u201cdelineatefd] the contours of this newly pronounced standard of review\u201d in <em>Kristl. </em>To begin with, we noted that \u201c[Reasonableness review is guided by the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).... \u201d <em>Id. </em>Among those factors, we emphasized, are \u201cthe now-advisory Guidelines,\u201d \u201cwhich means that district courts \u2018must consult those Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 767). Because the purpose of the Guidelines is to promote uniformity in sentencing, we held in <em>Kristi </em>\u201cthat a sentence that is properly calculated under the Guidelines is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1054. In other words, \u201cif we determine under the appropriate standard of review that the district court correctly determined the relevant Guidelines range, and if the defendant was subsequently sentenced to a term of imprisonment within that range, then the sentence is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness on appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Notably, \u201ceither the defendant or the government may rebut [this presumption] by demonstrating that the sentence is unreasonable when viewed against the other factors delineated in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">Here, Dixon does not challenge on appeal the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines. More specifically, he does not claim that the district court\u2019s factual findings regarding drug quantity were clearly erroneous, nor does he contend that any of the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding application of the Guidelines were erroneous.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because the district court properly considered the relevant guideline range at the time of sentencing and ultimately sentenced Dixon within that range, \u201cthe sentence is [there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>fore considered] presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1055.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">Although Dixon attempts to rebut this presumption, we easily conclude that the sentence imposed by the district court was reasonable in terms of its length. As previously noted, the only argument offered by Dixon is that a sentence at the bottom of the guideline range \u201cwould have been sufficient to provide [him] with much needed educational and substance abuse care.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 13. While this may be true (the PSR indicates that Dixon failed to graduate from high school and may be addicted to marijuana), it fails to take account of the other factors outlined in \u00a7 3553(a), including \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), and \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed ... to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A). As outlined in the PSR, Dixon was previously convicted in Oklahoma state court of trafficking in drugs. Notwithstanding that conviction, Dixon continued to engage in drug-trafficking and, in doing so, distributed a substantial amount of cocaine base. Given these circumstances, we conclude that the district court\u2019s decision to impose a sentence in the middle of the guideline range was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Dixon also complains that the district court failed to \u201cgive adequate reasons for the sentence imposed as required by section 3553(c).\u201d Aplt. Br. at 12. We disagree. In announcing the specific sentence it was imposing on Dixon, the district court stated on the record that it had considered \u201call of the factors\u201d (which we presume to be a reference to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors), including the background information contained in the PSR, Dixon\u2019s role in the offense, Dixon\u2019s relationship to defendants in related cases, and the guideline calculations. ROA, Vol. 2 at 81. Because Dixon made no arguments that he should be sentenced outside the guideline range, cited to no \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and offered no specific reasons why the district court should sentence him at the bottom of the guideline range, we conclude that nothing more was required of the district court. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Flores, </em>444 F.3d 1218, 1222 (10th Cir.2006) (\u201cWhen the defendant has not raised any substantial contentions concerning non-Guidelines \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the district court imposes a sentence within the Guidelines range, [we] do not require the court to explain on the record how the \u00a7 3553(a) factors justify the sentence\u201d imposed); <em>cf. United States v. Sanchez-Juarez, </em>446 F.3d 1109, 1117 (10th Cir.2006) (indicating that a district court must address on the record a defendant\u2019s \u201cnonfrivolous argument that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors warrant a below-Guidelines sentence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Dixon\u2019s motion for leave to file pro se supplemental brief is GRANTED. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b568-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b569-8\">. In his pro se supplemental brief, Dixon argues that <em>Booker </em>prohibited the district court from sentencing him for drug quantities other than those listed in the indictment. This, however, is a clear misreading of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
