Videla (\u201cthe IJ\u201d) denying Liu\u2019s application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the U.N. Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts of the case, its procedural history, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">This Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision where, as here, the BIA summarily adopted or affirmed it without opinion. <em>See Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, overturning the factual finding only if any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 543 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">Wang challenges the adverse credibility determination on which the denial of relief was based. The most important basis for the adverse credibility determination was the IJ\u2019s finding that Wang\u2019s failure to answer questions about the Pope and the Book of Genesis undermined her claim to have practiced Catholicism in China. This Circuit recently clarified the law governing questions about an applicant\u2019s knowledge of his or her professed religion in <em>Rizal v. Gonzales, </em>442 F.3d 84 (2d Cir.2006), in which we stated that \u201c[b]oth history and common sense make amply clear that people can identify with a certain religion, notwithstanding their lack of detailed knowledge about that religion\u2019s doctrinal tenets.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 90. <em>Rizal </em>explained that questions about substantive religious knowledge are permissible only to the extent that substantial evidence in the record supports the conclusion that an applicant should be prepared to answer them.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">Wang claimed to have participated in religious education, and so the IJ\u2019s questions concerning her religious knowledge would only be sustainable insofar as someone with her alleged background could have been expected to answer them. <em>See id. </em>at 90-91. However, the IJ did not merely reject Wang\u2019s claim to have participated in religious education. Rather, he concluded that \u201cit would be unthinkable that a true Catholic ... would know so little about the Catholic faith\u201d and that Wang \u201cappear[ed] to be so critically unfamiliar with some of the most basic concepts of Catholicism that it\u2019s very evident that [Wang] ... was <em>not a practicing Catholic </em>in China and apparently has very little familiarity with Catholicism.\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">In light of the significant clarification of our law set forth in <em>Rizal, </em>we remand for reconsideration of the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Wang was not a \u201ctrue Catholic.\u201d Of course, the agency on remand may also address the question of whether, under the analysis set forth in <em>Rizal, </em>Wang\u2019s claim to have participated in religious education and her answers to the IJ\u2019s questions about religion were irreconcilable.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-11\">In remanding, we note that even if the IJ\u2019s questions about religion were permissible, several of the IJ\u2019s other findings were potentially problematic, and the BIA or the IJ may wish to reconsider them on remand. For example, the IJ faulted Wang for failing to mention the Pope when, following a discussion of whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>churches in China are required to register with the government, Wang was asked a series of questions about whether there was someone outside China who \u201cis over your church in China\u201d and whether anyone had authority over the head of her church in the United States. Nothing about these questions, however, indicated that they referred to the church\u2019s hierarchy as opposed to governmental regulation of the church, which is how Wang understood them.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">Similarly, the IJ found it implausible that the police would ask Wang questions concerning the location of her church and its leadership, because the church was large and well-established, which suggested that the police would already know about it. But the IJ did not consider whether there are other reasons to ask questions during an interrogation, e.g., to confirm information already in the possession of the police, to incriminate the individual being interrogated, or simply to intimidate.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">The IJ found it implausible that Wang\u2019s mother would have been unable to find a church in New York that gave services in her dialect, Foo Chow, and consequently chosen to attend a non-Catholic church. The IJ took \u201cadministrative notice of the fact that there is at least one church, the Church of the Transfiguration, which is a Roman Catholic church in Chinatown not very far from where the respondent allegedly lives with her mother, that holds services in Foo Chow Chinese.\u201d We have serious doubts about whether substantial evidence could be said to support a finding based on \u201cadministrative notice\u201d of a fact of this kind.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Cf. </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(iv) (authorizing the BIA to take administrative notice only of \u201ccommonly known facts such as current events or the contents of official documents.\u201d). Furthermore, even if Wang\u2019s mother\u2019s attendance at a non-Catholic church was implausible, that implausibility was not obvious and therefore could not be relied upon unless Wang was given an opportunity to address it. <em>See Ming Shi Xue v. BIA, </em>439 F.3d 111, 121 (2d Cir.2006) (\u201c[W]here the perceived incongruities in an asylum applicant\u2019s testimony are not plainly obvious, an IJ cannot rely on them to support an adverse credibility ruling without first identifying the alleged inconsistencies for the applicant and giving the applicant an opportunity to address them.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-10\">Finally, we note that the IJ faulted Wang for failing to produce a letter from the church she attended in the United States, although Wang was never given an opportunity to explain her failure to procure the letter.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 287 (2d Cir.2000) (requiring that an IJ assess the sufficiency of a petition<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>er\u2019s explanations for failing to produce corroborating evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">In light of these potential flaws in the IJ\u2019s reasoning and the new opinion in <em>Rizal v. Gonzales, </em>we remand so that the agency may reconsider its earlier decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is GRANTED, the BIA\u2019s order is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b805-7\">. Thus, although \"we can certainly imagine instances in which the nature of an individual applicant\u2019s account would render his lack of a certain degree of doctrinal knowledge suspect and could therefore provide substantial evidence in support of an adverse credibility finding \u2014 for instance, where an applicant claims to have been a teacher of, or expert in, the religion in question,\u201d <em>Rizal, </em>442 F.3d at 90, \"many deeply religious people know very little about the origins, doctrines, or even observances of their faith.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 91 (quoting <em>Zhen Li Iao v. Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 530, 534 (7th Cir.2005)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b806-6\">. We also note that the IJ, in finding it implausible that a Chinese Catholic would state that Genesis \"says that ... [t]he Messiah will appear,\u201d apparently assumed that Chinese Catholics read the Book of Genesis literally. At least some Catholics, however, believe that Genesis 49:10 refers to the Messiah. <em>See </em>L.W. Geddes, <em>Messiah, </em>in The Catholic Encyclopedia, Volume X (2003), <em>available at </em>http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10212c.htm. The IJ did not consider whether any Catholics in China have this belief, or whether Wang might have been taught this version in the course of her Bible study.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b806-11\">. Indeed, it appears that the IJ may have been mistaken. The website for the church in question indicates that services are given in English, Cantonese and Mandarin, but apparently not Foo Chow. <em>See </em>Transfiguration Parish NYC: Mass Schedule, http://www.transfigurationnyc.org/mass_schedule (last visited April 26, 2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b806-12\">. Wang was asked whether there was proof of her attendance at the church in the United States. She discussed the certificate of baptism and photographs of her baptism. No one suggested that further documentation of her attendance at the church was required.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
