The government concedes that Morris is entitled to resentencing under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because the district court treated the Sentencing Guidelines range as mandatory rather than advisory. Accordingly, we vacate her sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b385-23\">Morris\u2019s additional argument \u2014 that the two-level enhancement to her sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) was clearly erroneous because the presence of a firearm was not proven by a preponderance of the evidence \u2014 is without merit. Based upon the Presentence Investigation Report (PSR), the district court found that Morris had admitted to possessing a firearm on May 21, 2001, when she pleaded guilty to the state-law offense of trafficking in a controlled substance \u201cwhile being in possession of a .38-caliber handgun.\u201d Morris argues that the possession of a firearm was not an element of her state conviction, but she provides no evidence to refute the findings of the PSR and district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>court. A defendant cannot show that a PSR is inaccurate simply by denying its truth, but must show \u201csome evidence beyond a bare denial that calls the reliability or correctness of the alleged facts into question.\u201d <em>United States v. Lang, </em>333 F.3d 678, 681-82 (6th Cir.2003).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
