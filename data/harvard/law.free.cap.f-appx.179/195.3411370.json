We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">Arias-Rodriguez challenges the validity of his guilty plea, asserting that he did not understand the jury trial rights he waived by pleading guilty pursuant to Fed. R.Crim.P. 11, because the district court failed to inform him of his right to confront and cross-examine witnesses against him and his right to counsel. Allegations of Rule 11 violations are reviewed for plain error where, as here, Arias-Rodriguez did not move to withdraw his guilty plea in the district court. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 527 (4th Cir.2002) (discussing standard of review). Our review of the transcript of the plea hearing convinces us that the district court\u2019s omissions did not affect Arias-Rodriguez\u2019s substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">Next, citing <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), Arias-Rodriguez asserts that the district court sentenced him in violation of the Sixth Amendment because the court applied a sixteen-level enhancement under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) (2001), based upon his prior North Carolina second-degree kidnapping conviction that the district court concluded was a crime of violence. We review this claim for plain error. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547 (4th Cir.2005) (stating standard of review). Section 2L1.2(B)(ii)(II) of the guidelines in effect at the time of Arias-Rodriguez\u2019s sentencing specifically stated that kidnapping was a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d Because the prior conviction qualified as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as a matter of law, the district made a purely legal determination in applying the \u00a7 2L1.2 enhancement. Accordingly, the challenged enhancement does not trigger the Sixth Amendment concerns addressed in <em>Booker. See United States v. Conelio-Pena, </em>435 F.3d 1279, 1288 (10th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>421 F.3d 278, 283-84 (4th Cir.2005), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1463, 164 L.Ed.2d 250 (2006); <em>see also United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349, 352-53 (4th Cir.) (stating that <em>Booker </em>expressly incorporates exception for recidivism-based sentence enhancements), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 640, 163 L.Ed.2d 518 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-15\">Finally, Arias-Rodriguez asserts that his sentence violates <em>Booker </em>because the district court sentenced him under a mandatory sentencing guidelines scheme. We review this claim for plain error. <em>See United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 215 (4th Cir.) (stating standard of review), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 668, 163 L.Ed.2d 539 (2005). Although we held in <em>White </em>that treating the guidelines as mandatory constitutes plain error, <em>see id. </em>at 216-17, our review of the record leads us <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>to conclude that there is no nonspeculative basis on which we could conclude that the district court would have sentenced Arias-Rodriguez to a lower sentence had the court proceeded under an advisory guidelines scheme. <em>See id. </em>at 223. Thus, Arias-Rodriguez has failed to demonstrate that the plain error in sentencing him under a mandatory guidelines scheme affected his substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Arias-Rodriguez\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
