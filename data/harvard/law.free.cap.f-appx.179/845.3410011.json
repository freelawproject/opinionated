Brown alleges that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at his trial on first degree murder and other charges because trial counsel failed to object to the unconstitutional definition of reasonable doubt contained in the trial court\u2019s jury instructions. He contends that the decision by the Pennsylvania Superior Court (\u201cSuperior Court\u201d) finding the jury instruction constitutional and rejecting Brown\u2019s ineffective assistance claim violated clearly established federal law such that Brown is entitled to habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-21\">Although we agree with Brown that the trial court\u2019s reasonable doubt formulation raises grave constitutional concerns, nothing in the Superior Court\u2019s decision as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>the jury instruction was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal Law\u201d under the standard for habeas relief articulated in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). Accordingly, we will affirm the Order of the District Court denying Brown\u2019s habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">Cynthia Linthicum was found in her apartment beaten and stabbed to death. Brown was arrested and indicted on several charges connected to Linthicum\u2019s death. At Brown\u2019s trial, the trial judge instructed the jury as follows on the definition of reasonable doubt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-7\">A reasonable doubt is a doubt that would cause a reasonably careful and sensible person to pause and hesitate before acting upon a matter of importance in his or her own affairs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-8\">It is not mere hesitation. A mere hesitation in and of itself is not a reasonable doubt. But a hesitation concerning the guilt of the defendant may become a reasonable doubt when and if that hesitation becomes a restraint, and would then cause you to be restrained from acting in a matter of the highest importance in your own life.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b873-9\">Brown was convicted of first-degree murder, robbery, possession of instruments of crime, aggravated assault, and theft of movable property.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-10\">The convictions were affirmed on direct appeal, and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court declined to hear the case. Brown filed a <em>pro se </em>petition under the Post Conviction Relief Act (\u201cPCRA\u201d), 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 9541 <em>et seq., </em>with the Court of Common Pleas, and new counsel was appointed to represent Brown. In his PCRA appeal, Brown alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to object to the definition of reasonable doubt given in the trial court\u2019s jury instructions, which Brown argues was unconstitutional as a violation of due process. The Court dismissed the PCRA petition, and the Superior Court affirmed, finding that the trial court\u2019s formulation of reasonable doubt did not violate due process and, therefore, that trial counsel was not ineffective for having failed to object to the court\u2019s formulation. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court again denied Brown\u2019s request for allowance of appeal. Brown then filed a petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus in Federal District Court, arguing that the above conclusions by the Superior Court violated 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1) such that Brown is entitled to habeas relief. The District Court denied the petition and affirmed the conclusions reached by the Superior Court. A Certificate of Appealability was granted on July 13, 2005, limited to the question of whether trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance in failing to object to the allegedly unconstitutional jury instruction on reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b873-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-16\">The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d or the \u201cAct\u201d) governs Brown\u2019s habeas petition. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>Court has interpreted \u00a7 2254(d)(1) to mean that habeas relief is appropriate when independent federal review shows that \u201cthe state court arrive[d] at a conclusion <em>opposite to that reached by [the Supreme] Court </em>on a question of law or ... on a set of materially indistinguishable facts,\u201d or \u201cthe state court identified] the correct governing legal principle from th[e] [Supreme] Court\u2019s decisions but unreasonably applied] that principle to the facts of the prisoner\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 413, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">In only one case, <em>Cage v. Louisiana, </em>498 U.S. 39, 111 S.Ct. 328, 112 L.Ed.2d 339 (1990), has the Supreme Court held that a definition of reasonable doubt violated due process. The instruction involved in that case informed jurors that to acquit, the doubt raised in their minds must \u201cgive rise to a grave uncertainty,\u201d that it must be an \u201cactual substantial doubt,\u201d and that \u201cmoral certainty\u201d as to the defendant\u2019s guilt was required. <em>Id. </em>at 40, 111 S.Ct. 328. In striking the instruction down, the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-5\">The charge ... equated a reasonable doubt with a \u201cgrave uncertainty\u201d and an \u201cactual substantial doubt,\u201d and stated that what was required was a \u201cmoral certainty\u201d that the defendant was guilty. It is plain to us that the words \u201csubstantial\u201d and \u201cgrave,\u201d as they are commonly understood, suggest a higher degree of doubt than is required for acquittal under the reasonable-doubt standard. When those statements are then considered with the reference to \u201cmoral certainty\u201d ... it becomes clear that a reasonable juror could have interpreted the instruction to allow a finding of guilt based on a degree of proof below that required by the Due Process Clause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANb\"><em>Id. </em>at 41, 111 S.Ct. 328.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-9\">Even if we assume that the jury instruction at Brown\u2019s trial was unconstitutional, Brown cannot show that the Superior Court\u2019s decision requires habeas relief under Williams.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Cage </em>decision certainly cannot be read to stand for the proposition that the \u201crestraint\u201d formulation of reasonable doubt necessarily \u201callow[s] a finding of guilt based on a degree of proof below that required by the Due Process Clause.\u201d <em>Cage, </em>498 U.S. at 41, 111 S.Ct. 328. None of the problematic terms from the <em>Cage </em>instruction were present in the instruction given here. Furthermore, the <em>Cage </em>decision in no way mentions or refers to the terms \u201crestrain,\u201d \u201crestraint,\u201d or \u201chesitate\u201d as part of a reasonable doubt formulation. Although the Supreme Court in <em>Victor v. Nebraska, </em>511 U.S. 1, 20, 114 S.Ct. 1239, 127 L.Ed.2d 583 (1994), tacitly approved a version of the \u201chesitate\u201d definition of reasonable doubt, the Court in <em>Victor </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>specifically held that \u201cthe Constitution does not require that any particular form of words be used in advising the jury of the government\u2019s burden of proof,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 5, 114 S.Ct. 1239 and no Supreme Court decision has struck down any version of the \u201crestraint\u201d formulation of reasonable doubt. We also note, regarding the \u201cunreasonable application\u201d prong of the <em>Williams </em>test, that every federal court within the Eastern District to address some version of the \u201crestraint\u201d formulation has upheld the formulation under direct constitutional analysis. <em>See Porter v. Horn, </em>276 F.Supp.2d 278, 340-41 (E.D.Pa.2003); <em>Peterkin v. Horn, </em>176 F.Supp.2d 342, 381 (E.D.Pa.2001); <em>Laird v. Horn, </em>159 F.Supp.2d 58 (E.D.Pa. 2001).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">Under our own precedent, we may not grant habeas relief \u201con the basis of simple disagreement\u201d with the Superior Court\u2019s constitutional analysis. <em>Matteo, </em>171 F.3d at 888. Rather, we must be convinced that \u201cSupreme Court precedent <em>requires </em>the contrary outcome\u201d to that reached by the Superior Court. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). We are not so convinced. Brown may have made a compelling constitutional argument against the reasonable doubt definition employed here, but based on the language of the instant jury instruction and the foregoing analysis of <em>Cage </em>and <em>Victor, </em>we cannot conclude that the Superior Court \u201carrive[d] at a conclusion <em>opposite </em>to that reached by [the Supreme] Court on a question of law or ... on a set of materially indistinguishable facts,\u201d or that the Court \u201cidentifie[d] the correct governing legal principle from th[e] [Supreme] Court\u2019s decisions but unreasonably applie[d] that principle to the facts of [Brown\u2019s] case.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>529 U.S. at 413, 120 S.Ct. 1495 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-9\">Moreover, even if we assume that the jury instruction raises grave constitutional concerns, we agree with the conclusion of the Superior Court that Brown\u2019s trial counsel did not render ineffective assistance. Supreme Court precedent requires that to prevail on an ineffective assistance claim, a defendant must show (1) that \u201ccounsel\u2019s performance was deficient,\u201d and (2) that the \u201cdeficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). In interpreting the first prong of the test, the <em>Strickland </em>Court stated that \u201c[t]he proper standard for attorney performance is that of reasonably effective assistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052. In other words, to obtain relief, a defendant must show that \u201ccounsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b875-10\">In assessing an attorney\u2019s performance, a reviewing court must be \u201chighly deferential\u201d and must make every effort \u201cto eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052. This effort requires that we \u201cindulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct [fell] within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.... \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b875-11\">Applying the <em>Strickland </em>standard for attorney performance, Brown cannot show that trial counsel\u2019s performance was defi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>cient for failing to object to the jury instruction. In the context of reviewing the proposed jury instruction with the trial judge and opposing counsel, trial counsel\u2014 a Pennsylvania practitioner \u2014 likely would have recognized both the \u201chesitate\u201d and \u201crestrain\u201d language as formulations that have been upheld repeatedly by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in defining reasonable doubt. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Hawkins, </em>567 Pa. 310, 787 A.2d 292, 301-02 (2001) (indirectly approving an instruction nearly identical to the instruction in Brown\u2019s case); <em>Commonwealth v. Ragan, </em>560 Pa. 106, 743 A.2d 390 (1999) (explicitly approving both formulations); <em>Commonwealth v. Donough, </em>377 Pa. 46, 103 A.2d 694, 697 (1954) (first case to approve the \u201crestraint\u201d formulation); <em>Commonwealth v. Kluska, </em>333 Pa. 65, 3 A.2d 398, 403 (1939) (first case to approve the \u201chesitate\u201d formulation). Additionally, as noted in section II., <em>supra, </em>federal district courts embracing Pennsylvania consistently have upheld versions of the \u201crestrain\u201d formulation. In the face of such authority, a reasonable practitioner could certainly be excused for failing to object to the instruction as worded in Brown\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">Even measured against the other actors in this case, counsel\u2019s assessment of the jury instruction as constitutional would seem to meet reasonable professional standards. Assuming that such an assessment was erroneous, counsel\u2019s error has since been duplicated by at least one Pennsylvania appellate court and a federal district court on habeas review, both of which had significantly more time \u2014 and presumably more expertise \u2014 to bring to bear in evaluating the instruction\u2019s constitutionality. In short, trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the jury instruction, even if ultimately incorrect, fell well within the range of reasonable professional assistance under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the Order of the District Court denying Brown\u2019s habeas petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b873-11\">. The District Court had subject matter jurisdiction over this habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a). This Court exercises jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b873-12\">. The AEDPA provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-13\">An application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-18\">(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal Law....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b873-19\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b874-6\">. Because of that conclusion, we need not pass formally on the constitutionality of the reasonable doubt definition appearing in the jury instruction. Having said that, we note our suspicion that the \"restrain from acting\u201d and \"restraint\u201d language as employed in the instruction is constitutionally problematic.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">The word \"restraint,\u201d as it is commonly understood \u2014 especially in conjunction with the previous discounting of the \"hesitate\u201d standard of reasonable doubt and the precise formulation \"restrain <em>from </em>acting\u201d \u2014 suggests at least as high a degree of doubt as do the phrases \"grave uncertainty\u201d and \"substantial doubt\u201d as employed in the <em>Cage </em>instruction. In fact, to the extent that we conceive of \"restraint\u201d or \"restrain from acting\" in their literal sense, those words arguably go beyond \"giving rise\u201d to a grave uncertainty or substantial doubt and become \"decision-determinative,\u201d i.e., they arguably suggest a level of doubt that, by its terms, <em>prevents </em>one from acting. Stated differently, we suspect that the formulation employed by the state trial court is one that \"suggest[s] a higher degree of doubt than is required for acquittal under the reasonable-doubt standard.\u201d <em>Cage, </em>498 U.S. at 41, 111 S.Ct. 328.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b875-6\">. Although federal court decisions below the Supreme Court level cannot serve as the legal benchmark against which to compare a state court\u2019s decision, our cases state that decisions of other federal courts are relevant in ascertaining the reasonableness of a state court\u2019s application of Supreme Court precedent. <em>Fischetti v. Johnson, </em>384 F.3d 140, 149-50 (3d Cir.2004); <em>Matteo v. Superintendent, SCI Albion, </em>171 F.3d 877, 890 (3d Cir.1999) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
