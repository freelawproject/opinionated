He argues that the district court\u2019s upward departure was an abuse of discretion. He asserts that the district court\u2019s sentence was unreasonable, even though the Guidelines are advisory after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because the district court relied on an impermissible factor, its subjective disagreement with the Guidelines. Aburto contends that his sentence should be vacated and that this matter should be remanded to the district court for resentencing because he was prejudiced since the court\u2019s \u201cdisagreement with the Guidelines was determinative in making its sentencing decision.\u201d He also argues that this matter should be assigned to a different judge on remand because of the district court\u2019s subjective dissatisfaction with the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-8\">After <em>Booker, </em>this court continues to review a district court\u2019s interpretation.and application of the Guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error. <em>See United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 202-04 (5th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014\u2014 U.S. \u2014\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 268, 163 L.Ed.2d 241 (2005). Upward departures are reviewed for reasonableness, which entails review of \u201cthe district court\u2019s decision to depart upwardly and the extent of that departure for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 346 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). An upward departure is not an abuse of the district court\u2019s discretion when it (1) \u201cadvance[s] the objectives set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)\u201d; and (2) is \u201cjustified by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 347 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-15\">Because the district court enhanced Aburto\u2019s sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 5K2.0 &amp; 5K2.14, the sentence was a guideline sentence. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707 (5th Cir.2006). \u201cThe record ... makes abundantly clear, through the court\u2019s adoption of the PSR, its statements at sentencing, and its Statement of Reasons, the reasons for an upward departure.\u201d <em>Zuniga-Peralta,, </em>442 F.3d at 347. The district court did not abuse its discretion or consider an improper factor when it upwardly departed. Given the court\u2019s reasons for the upward departure, the extent of the departure was not unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Simkanin, </em>420 F.3d 397, 419 (5th Cir. 2005), <em>petition for cert, filed </em>(Jan. 25, 2006) (No. 05-948); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>417 F.3d 483, 492-93 (5th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 713, 163 L.Ed.2d 543 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-18\">Because we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment, Aburto\u2019s argument that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>matter should be assigned to a different judge on remand is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b942-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
