Wynter was convicted in Arizona state court of transportation of marijuana for sale and sentenced to three years imprisonment. He was ordered removed because he had been convicted of an aggravated felony. Following his release from Arizona state prison he was detained by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), and in December 2002 he filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus challenging his continued detention pending removal. The district court denied the petition and Wynter appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-21\">We dismiss Wynter\u2019s appeal as moot, because Wynter is no longer in detention. He was removed to Jamaica on December 11, 2004. Wynter\u2019s petition requested only release from INS custody, and \u201c[bjecause he has been released, there is no further relief we can provide.\u201d <em>Picrin-Peron v.
