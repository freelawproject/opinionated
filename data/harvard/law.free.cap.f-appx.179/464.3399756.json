ANDERSON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">Amoldo Gutierrez-Ayala pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than fifty grams of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B), and 846. He was sentenced to 87 months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by four years of supervised release. He appeals his sentence, arguing that the district court erred in applying a firearm enhancement pursuant to United States Sentencing Commission, <em>Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d), \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) (Nov.2003). For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">Between November 2002 and April 2003, an individual working as an informant for the Drug Enforcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d) made several controlled purchases from Gutierrez-Ayala, involving a total of approximately four pounds of methamphetamine. The first of these transactions took place on November 5 at Gutierrez-Ayala\u2019s residence. The informant wore a wire during the transaction and was debriefed afterwards by DEA agents. According to the later testimony of one of these agents, the informant related that the transaction took place in the garage area and that while he and Gutierrez-Ayala were talking, Gutierrez-Ayala \u201cwent to a toolbox within the garage and brought to him wrapped in a red towel a [black] .45 caliber handgun\u201d with wood grips. Tr. of Sentencing Day 2 at 30, 52, R. Vol. VI. Gutierrez-Ayala \u201ctold the [informant] that he had purchased the gun at a local gun show and ... that he had had other weapons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30. According to the agent\u2019s testimony, in conjunction with showing the informant the gun, Gutierrez-Ayala also described a difficulty he had had with an associate who had not yet paid for the methamphetamine he had bought, and indicated \u201cthat he was going to hurt this associate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-14\">During the execution of a search warrant in April 2003, approximately fifteen firearms, including a black .45 caliber handgun with wood grips, were seized from a locked gun safe at Gutierrez-Ayala\u2019s residence. According to the DEA agent\u2019s testimony, the informant identified this .45 handgun as the gun he had been shown in the November 5 transaction. In a superseding indictment, Gutierrez-Ayala was charged with two counts involving methamphetamine distribution. In return for the dismissal of the indictment, he pled guilty to a one-count information, as indicated above.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-15\">Following Gutierrez-Ayala\u2019s guilty plea, the United States Probation Office prepared a Presentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d), which calculated a sentencing range according to the Guidelines. The PSR calculated a total offense level of 35, which, together with a criminal history category of I, yielded a sentencing range of 168 to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment. The PSR included a two-level enhancement to the of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>fense level pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1), based on Gutierrez-Ayala\u2019s possession of a firearm during the November 5 transaction with the informant, and a two-level enhancement pursuant to USSG \u00a7 3B1.1(c), based on Gutierrez-Ayala\u2019s role as a leader or organizer in the conspiracy. Gutierrez-Ayala objected to both of these enhancements.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">Responding to a motion by Gutierrez-Ayala, the district court deferred sentencing until the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The court then held a sentencing hearing to consider Gutierrez-Ayala\u2019s objection. The DEA agent testified as described above, and further indicated that the informant was not himself facing a criminal charge or under investigation at the time he provided assistance, though he had previously been a target of a DEA investigation. After hearing this testimony and counsels\u2019 arguments, the court disallowed the enhancement under \u00a7 3B1.1(c) but upheld the enhancement under \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1). The court \u201cf[ou]nd ... credible [the DEA agent]\u2019s testimony,\u201d and stated that it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-5\">believe[d] that ... as a part of the [November 5] transaction the [informant] \u25a0 saw a .45 caliber handgun that was displayed by Gutierrez-Ayala, and ... coupled with the fact that when a search warrant was executed on [Gutierrez-Ayala]^ home, 14 weapons were found, so the Court finds that there\u2019s an adequate record to justify the gun enhancement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Tr. of Sentencing Day 2 at 62, R. Vol. VI. The court also granted the government\u2019s motion for a three-level reduction pursuant to USSG \u00a7 5K1.1 for substantial assistance, and added an additional one-level reduction, leading to a guideline sentencing range of 87 to 108 months. Taking into account the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the court sentenced Gutierrez-Ayala to the low end of that range. Gutierrez-Ayala appealed his sentence, challenging only the applicability of the firearm enhancement under USSG \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">In <em>Booker, </em>\u201cthe Supreme Court held that the mandatory application of the Guidelines to judge-found facts (other than a prior conviction) violates the Sixth Amendment\u201d and thus rendered the Guidelines advisory rather than mandatory. <em>United States v. Kristl, </em>437 F.3d 1050, 1053 (10th Cir.2006) (per curiam). The advisory Guidelines remain \u201ca factor to be considered in imposing a sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, district courts \u201c \u2018must consult those Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 264,125 S.Ct. 738).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">On appeal, while we review a defendant\u2019s ultimate sentence for reasonableness, we continue to review the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines de novo, and we review any factual findings for clear error. <em>Id. </em>at 1054. Where the district court correctly applies the Guidelines and imposes a sentence within the applicable Guidelines range, that sentence \u201cis entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, if the district court errs in applying the Guidelines, we must remand unless the error is harmless. <em>Id. </em>at 1055.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">As indicated, Gutierrez argues on appeal that the district court erred in ruling that the USSG \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement for possession of a firearm was applicable in this case. The provision directs that a two-level increase be imposed \u201c[i]f a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1). The commentary to this section indicates that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>this enhancement \u201creflects the increased danger of violence when drug traffickers possess weapons\u201d and that it \u201cshould be applied if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2D1.1, comment, (n.3).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">In imposing this enhancement, the government \u201cbears the initial burden of proving possession of the weapon by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>431 F.3d 1234, 1237 (10th Cir. 2005), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1823, 164 L.Ed.2d 555 (2006) (No. 05-9895). This burden may be satisfied by a showing that \u201c \u2018a temporal and spatial relation existed between the weapon, the drug trafficking activity, and the defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Pompey, </em>264 F.3d 1176, 1180 (10th Cir.2001) (internal quotation omitted)). If the government succeeds in meeting this burden, \u201c \u2018the burden shifts to the defendant to show that it is clearly improbable the weapon was connected with the offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Pompey, </em>264 F.3d at 1181 (internal quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">Gutierrez-Ayala concedes that <em>\u201cif </em>he had displayed a weapon to [the informant] during the [November 5] drug transaction, imposition of the firearm enhancement would be appropriate.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. at 2. However, he argues that there was insufficient proof that he did display the weapon at that time because the government failed to introduce either the informant himself or the wire recording of the November 5 transaction at the sentencing hearing. According to Gutierrez-Ayala, the absence of the informant or the recording is fatal to the validity of the \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement because the credibility of the informant, who provided the only evidence that a firearm had been present at the November 5 transaction, was \u201cthe critical issue.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Op. Br. at 14. In contrast, Gutierrez-Ayala states, the credibility of the DEA agent who testified is \u201cnot particularly relevant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13. Gutierrez-Ayala further argues that the court\u2019s application of the \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement was inconsistent with its rejection of the \u00a7 3B1.1(c) enhancement, as the same DEA agent testified for purposes of both enhancements.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">We disagree with Gutierrez-Ayala\u2019s assertions regarding the nature of the government\u2019s evidence. A sentencing court \u201cmay consider hearsay evidence provided that the evidence has sufficient indicia of reliability,\u201d and use of such evidence, by itself, is insufficient to render a sentencing enhancement invalid. <em>United States v. Dazey, </em>403 F.3d 1147, 1177 n. 7 (10th Cir.2005); <em>see also United States v. Espinoza, </em>338 F.3d 1140, 1152 (10th Cir.2003). Thus, the government\u2019s failure to introduce the informant or the wire recording is not fatal. The issue is whether the hearsay evidence offered by the DEA agent has sufficient evidence of reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">Here, the account of the DEA agent, whom the district court deemed credible, provides details that adequately corroborate the informant\u2019s hearsay statements. Most significantly, the informant first told DEA agents that Gutierrez-Ayala displayed a gun when the informant was debriefed, shortly after the November 5 transaction occurred, and described the gun at that time. The timing of this first mention of the gun undermines Gutierrez-Ayala\u2019s speculation that the informant \u201cmay have seen that gun on a different occasion, and fabricated that he saw the gun during the drug transaction.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. at 3. A gun matching the informant\u2019s description was then found at Gutierrez-Ayala\u2019s residence, and the informant identified it then as the gun he had previously seen.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>We also disagree that there is any inconsistency in the court\u2019s rejection of a \u00a7 3B1.1(c) enhancement while applying a \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement. In rejecting the former enhancement, the court did not state that it considered the hearsay testimony in regard to that enhancement unreliable. The court merely found that it \u201cc[ouldn]\u2019t tell from the testimony ... who the leader or the follower was.\u201d Tr. of Sentencing Day 2 at 56, R. Vol. VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">We agree with the district court that the hearsay evidence offered by the government was sufficiently reliable. The court\u2019s consequent finding that Gutierrez-Ayala displayed a weapon during the November 5 methamphetamine transaction is not clearly erroneous. We therefore uphold the court\u2019s application of \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1). As Gutierrez-Ayala offers no other basis for holding his sentence unreasonable, we affirm his sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b491-10\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b494-8\">. Although Gutierrez-Ayala does not raise the issue, we note that the court\u2019s reliance on judge-found facts in applying the \u00a7 2D 1.1 (b)(1) enhancement does not violate the Sixth Amendment because the finding 'did not increase [Gutierrez-Ayala\u2019s] sentence beyond the maximum authorized by the facts\u2019 admitted by him in his plea agreement.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>431 F.3d at 1239-40 (quoting <em>Dazey, </em>403 F.3d at 1174); <em>cf. United States v. Clark, </em>415 F.3d 1234, 1239 (10th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>414 F.3d 1260, 1263 (10th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Hauk, </em>412 F.3d 1179, 1193 (10th Cir.2005). Gutierrez-Ayala's sentence of 87 months remains within the Guideline sentencing range, for an offense level of 27, of 70 to 87 months that would apply in the absence of the two-level \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement. <em>See </em>USSG Ch. 5, Pt.
