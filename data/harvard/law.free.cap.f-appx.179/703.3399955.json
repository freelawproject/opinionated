It is</p>\n<p id=\"b729-20\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the appeal be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-21\">The district court\u2019s order remanding to the agency the bycatch monitoring provisions of Amendment 13 to the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management Plan is not a \u201cfinal decision\u201d within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. <em>See Lakes Pilots Ass\u2019n v. U.S. Coast Guard, </em>359 F.3d 624, 625 (D.C.Cir.2004) (\u201cA remand order usually is not a final decision\u201d (citation omitted)). Contrary to Oceana, this appeal does not present one of those \u201climited circumstances\u201d in which a remand order is appealable under the collateral order doctrine because Oceana will have a later opportunity to appeal the two habitat-related claims \u201con which it got no satisfaction\u201d in the district court. <em>See Lakes Pilots, </em>359 F.3d at 625; <em>Occidental Petroleum Corp. v. SEC, </em>873 F.2d 325, 330 (D.C.Cir.1989) (noting exception to general rule that remand orders are not appealable final decisions \u201cwhere the agency to which the case is remanded seeks to appeal and it would have no opportunity to appeal after the proceedings on remand\u201d). Once the remanded proceedings are complete, Oceana may move for entry of a final judgment in this case, to be set forth on a separate document as required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58(a)(1), <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 58(d), and appeal from that judgment. The Government represents it will not oppose such a motion. Tr. of Oral Argument at 15:30.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-22\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed.
