We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-21\">This Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision where, as here, the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion. <em>See, e.g., Chun Gao v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 122, 124 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 305 (2d Cir.2003). The IJ\u2019s factual findings are reviewed under the substantial evidence standard and may be overturned only if any reasonable adjudi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>cator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4); <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">At the same time, \u201cthe fact that the [agency] has relied primarily on credibility grounds in dismissing an asylum application cannot insulate the decision from review.\u201d <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir.2004). An adverse credibility determination must be based on \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d that \u201cbear a legitimate nexus\u201d to the finding. <em>Zhou Yun Zhang, </em>386 F.3d at 74 (quoting <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003)). While an adverse credibility finding may be based on the inherent implausibility of particular allegations, <em>see, e.g., Jin Hui Gao v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>400 F.3d 963, 964 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam), it may not be based on flawed reasoning, such as speculation or conjecture, <em>see Secaida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 307, 312.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Even applying a deferential standard of review, we cannot find that the grounds the IJ relied upon to support the adverse credibility determination are valid. First, the IJ\u2019s characterization of Zheng\u2019s testimony as memorized and lacking \u201cdetails regarding alleged events\u201d was based upon flawed reasoning. The IJ noted that Zheng\u2019s confusion of the date of her abortion with the date of her birth evinces that she \u201csimply memorized [the dates] and ... [that they] have no meaning for her because these things did not happen.\u201d As we explained in <em>Jin Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t. of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 104, 114 (2d Cir.2005), \u201cwhere testimony is \u2018spare\u2019 yet specific and detailed enough to support the essential elements of an applicant\u2019s claim, ... the IJ and counsel for the [Government] may wish to probe for incidental details, seeking to draw out inconsistencies that would support a finding of lack of credibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 114 (quoting <em>Jin Shui Qiu v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 140, 152 (2d Cir.2003)). There is no indication in the IJ\u2019s decision that a search for incidental details was conducted. The IJ merely noted that Zheng\u2019s testimony lacked detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Secondly, the IJ\u2019s evaluation of Zheng\u2019s testimony as implausible was not supported by substantial evidence but rather was based only on speculation and conjecture. The IJ found Zheng\u2019s testimony to be improbable because he did not believe that: (1) Zheng would go to a governmental hospital for a pregnancy test if she knew that an out-of-wedlock pregnancy was illegal; (2) Zheng would register her parent\u2019s address as her address at the hospital if she lived with her boyfriend at another location; and (3) the family planning officers coincidently came to her parent\u2019s home to take her for an abortion on the day that she happened to be visiting. However, when asked to explain how the planning officers knew to find her at her parent\u2019s home, Zheng explained that she had registered under her parent\u2019s address when she went to the hospital for a pregnancy test. Moreover, she testified that she registered under her parent\u2019s address even though she was not living there because she did not consider the Chandler City address her home since it was a rental place. The IJ never addressed the adequacy of Zheng\u2019s responses. Although Zheng did not offer an explanation for why she went to the governmental hospital, the IJ \u201cimproperly speculated\u201d that Zheng had an alternative place to seek medical attention upon suspecting that she was pregnant. Sec<em>aida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 307. The IJ failed to point out why the explanations Zheng provided were illogical, and consequently did not \u201ccarefully detail the reasoning leading to the adverse finding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">Finally, to deny an application for lack of sufficient corroboration, an IJ must identify the specific documentation at issue and show that it was reasonably available. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number><em>Qiu, </em>329 F.3d at 153. Granted, the IJ \u201cidentif[ied] the particular pieces of missing, relevant documentation,\u201d specifically, letters or statements from Zheng\u2019s parents and boyfriend, but he did not rely on evidence in the record in determining that \u201cthe documentation at issue was reasonably available to the petitioner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The IJ merely concluded that Zheng could have submitted evidence, in addition to the recently-issued notarized birth certificate, without assessing her reasons, if any, for not providing the corroboration at issue. <em>See Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 280 (2d Cir.2000). Furthermore, a lack of corroboration is not always fatal. <em>See Qiu, </em>329 F.3d at 153. We find that it does not constitute an independent ground upon which we can affirm the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Since the IJ\u2019s credibility determination is not supported by substantial evidence, the BIA\u2019s decision affirming the IJ\u2019s decision cannot stand. <em>Secaida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 307, 312.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Zheng\u2019s CAT claim has been waived because Zheng did not challenge the IJ\u2019s finding that an IUD insertion would constitute torture in her brief before this Court. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">\n<em>Warning to Counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(a) requires that an appellant\u2019s brief include, <em>inter alia, </em>a succinct and clear summary of the argument, containing appellant\u2019s contentions, the reasons for them, and the accompanying citations and applicable standards of review. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(6), (7), (8), (9). These are mandatory requirements. <em>See Ernst Haas Studio, Inc. v. Palm, Press, Inc., </em>164 F.3d 110, 112 (2d Cir.1999) <em>(per </em>curiam,).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">In this case, the carelessly-written appellate brief filed by Zheng\u2019s counsel, Frank Liu, does not comply with these rules, for although he properly identifies the legal standards, he does not apply those standards to Zheng\u2019s claim other than by providing merely conclusory statements. Additionally, the brief erroneously states that Zheng \u201cclearly violated the widely-publicized coercive population control practices by the Chinese government by extending protection to her pregnant cousin,\u201d a statement that is not supported by any evidence in the record, and reflects a perfunctory use of prior briefs. Therefore, counsel is cautioned that future failure to comply with the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure could result in discipline. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 46(b), (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we GRANT Zheng\u2019s petition for review, VACATE the BIA decision, and REMAND to the BIA to determine Zheng\u2019s credibility based on substantial evidence, consistent with this order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
