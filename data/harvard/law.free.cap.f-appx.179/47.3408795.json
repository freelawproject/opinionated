(collectively, \u201cGlobal\u201d) appeal from the decision of the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota (\u201cdistrict court\u201d) granting the motion of I/O Concepts, Inc. (\u201cI/O Concepts\u201d) for summary judgment of non-infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 6,035,264, 6,044,393, 6,112,237, and 6,157,956 (collectively, \u201cthe patents-in-suit\u201d). <em>See Global Maintech Corp. v. I/O Concepts, Inc., </em>No. 03-4184 (D.Minn. Mar. 7, 2005) <em>(\u201cNon-infringement Order\u201d). </em>Because the district court properly granted I/O Concepts\u2019 motion for summary judgment of non-infringement, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b74-16\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b74-17\">Global is the owner of record of the patents-in-suit, all of which relate to the monitoring and control of \u201cheterogeneous computer systems.\u201d In particular, the patents-in-suit describe a process that translates signals sent by dissimilar host computer systems, each of which effectively speaks different languages, to either a common message signal format or a universal character set that is understood by a monitoring and control computer. <em>Non-infringement Order, </em>slip op. at 1-2. If the implemented procedures result in control signals that must be sent to a host computer, the monitoring and control computer translates the control signal from the common message signal format or universal character set to the message signal format of that host computer. <em>Id., </em>slip op. at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"A3y\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>The patent applications that issued as the \u2019237 patent, the \u2019393 patent, and the \u2019264 patent were all filed on November 26, 1997. All three patents include identical drawings and describe the same computer monitoring and controlling system. The only differences between the patents lie in the claimed subject matter. Specifically, the claims of the \u2019237 patent are directed to the monitoring aspects of the monitoring and controlling system, while the claims of the \u2019393 patent are directed to the control aspect of the system. The claims of the \u2019264 patent are also directed to the monitoring aspect of the system, but are more limited in scope and coverage in that they relate specifically to automation using a script language. <em>Id., </em>slip op. at 2-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">The United States Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cPTO\u201d) initially rejected each of the applications that resulted in these three patents because the claims were anticipated and/or obvious. To gain issuance of the patents, Global amended each independent claim of the three patents to clarify that they were limited to the external monitoring and controlling of \u201cheterogeneous computer systems.\u201d Ultimately, these patents were issued in March and August 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">The \u2019956 patent application was filed on March 28, 1977. Like the other three patents, the \u2019956 patent relates exclusively to the monitoring and controlling of \u201cheterogeneous computer systems.\u201d The \u2019956 patent has three independent claims, each of which specifically relates to performing operations using a \u201cuniversal character set\u201d in \u201cheterogeneous computer systems.\u201d In addition, certain claims of the \u2019956 patent also require the presence of an \u201cintelligent card\u201d that translates data into a \u201cuniversal character set.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">I/O Concepts markets three software programs: Console Consolidation System, CCS/SmartClient, and Websession. In 2003, Global sued I/O Concepts for infringement of the patents-in-suit. On December 6, 2004, both Global and I/O Concepts filed competing motions for summary judgment. I/O Concepts filed three motions for summary judgment relating to (1) non-infringement of the \u2019264, \u2019393, and \u2019237 patents; (2) invalidity of the \u2019264, \u2019393, and \u2019237 patents; and (3) non-infringement of the \u2019956 patent. Global filed a motion for partial summary judgment, which sought dismissal of all of I/O Concepts\u2019 affirmative defenses and counterclaims.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">On March 7, 2005, the district court issued a Memorandum and Order relating to the four pending summary judgment motions. The district court construed the \u201cheterogeneous computer system\u201d limitation, which appears in all the asserted claims, as a system in which at least two host computers use different operating systems. The district court granted summary judgment of non-infringement, concluding that there was no evidence that any I/O Concepts\u2019 product simultaneously monitors and controls multiple mainframes using different operating systems. The district court concluded that Global had failed to create a dispute of fact as to whether I/O Concepts sold or offered for sale a product that literally infringed the patents-in-suit. The district court denied, as moot, all the remaining motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">On March 7, 2005, the district court entered final judgment. <em>Global Maintech Corp. v. I/O Concepts, Inc., </em>No. 03-4184 (D.Minn. Mar. 7, 2005). Global timely appeals to this court. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-11\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"A3q\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b75-12\">\u2018We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo.\u201d Ethicon </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number><em>Endo-Surgery, Inc. v. U.S. Surgical Corp., </em>149 F.3d 1309, 1315 (Fed.Cir.1998). Summary judgment is appropriate only when there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c). \u201cIn determining whether there is a genuine issue of material fact, the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion, with doubts resolved in favor of the opponent.\u201d <em>Chiuminatta Concrete Concepts, Inc. v. Cardinal Indus., Inc., </em>145 F.3d 1303, 1307 (Fed.Cir.1998). If there are no material facts in dispute precluding summary judgment, \u201cour task is to determine whether the judgment granted is correct as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Marathon Oil Co. v. United States, </em>177 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed.Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">Claim construction is an issue of law, <em>see Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., </em>52 F.3d 967, 970-71 (Fed.Cir.1995) (en banc), <em>affd, </em>517 U.S. 370, 116 S.Ct. 1384, 134 L.Ed.2d 577 (1996), that we review <em>de novo. See Cybor Corp. v. FAS Techs., Inc., </em>138 F.3d 1448, 1456 (Fed.Cir.1998) (en banc); <em>Phillips v. AWH Corp., </em>415 F.3d 1303, 1328 (Fed.Cir.2005) (en banc). Infringement is a question of fact. <em>See Bai v. L &amp; L Wings, Inc., </em>160 F.3d 1350, 1353 (Fed.Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">B. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">On appeal, Global argues that the district court erred in construing \u201cheterogeneous computer system\u201d too narrowly, and argues that the proper construction should be \u201ccomputer systems having dissimilar processors and/or operating systems.\u201d Global further argues that the district court erred in including \u201csimultaneous,\u201d which is not present in any claim, as a claim limitation. Global argues that the district court erred in determining that I/O Concepts did not make, offer to sell, or sell its products for heterogeneous use. Finally, Global argues that the district court erred in requiring the presence of an \u201cintelligent card\u201d in the method claims of the \u2019956 patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">I/O Concepts responds that the district court correctly construed the \u201cheterogeneous computer system\u201d limitation. I/O Concepts further contends that the terms \u201csimultaneously\u201d and \u201csimultaneous\u201d were not used by the district court as words of limitation, but rather as explanatory terms describing how a person skilled in the art would understand the phrase \u201cheterogeneous computer system.\u201d Finally, I/O Concepts argues that the district court did not err in granting summary judgment of non-infringement because Global failed to make any showing regarding whether <em>I/O </em>Concepts\u2019 products monitor and/or control anything other than homogeneous computer systems.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">Because we conclude that the district court correctly construed the \u201chomogeneous computer systems\u201d limitation, and because summary judgment of non-infringement was proper on that basis, we do not consider Global\u2019s argument relating to the presence of \u201cintelligent card\u201d in the \u2019956 method claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">1. Claim construction</p>\n<p id=\"b76-11\">The claim limitation disputed by the parties is \u201cheterogeneous computer system,\u201d and the primary issue is whether it should be restricted to encompass only systems in which at least two host computers use a different operating system as the district court held. In determining the meaning of the disputed claim limitation, we look primarily to the intrinsic evidence of record, examining the claim language itself, the written description, and the prosecution history, if in evidence. <em>See Phillips v. AWH Corp., </em>415 F.3d 1303, 1312-1317 (Fed.Cir.2005) (en banc). Each of the as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>serted claims includes the \u201cheterogeneous computer systems\u201d limitation, but the claims do not provide guidance on what that limitation means. While the written description does not expressly define the disputed limitation, it lists examples of the monitored computer system. Specifically, the specification of the \u2019237 patent states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-5\">The computer system, which is to be monitored, may take many forms. For example, the computer system may be a data center, an enterprise computing system, a network of computers, a mainframe computer, a mini-computer, a server, a workstation, and/or a personal computer. Alternatively, the computer system may be an MVS operating system-based computer (or one of its derivative like IBM\u2019s OS/390), a UNIX operating system-based computer, an IBM AS400 computer, a Microsoft Windows operating system-based computer, an Apple Macintosh operating system-based computer, an OS/2 operating system-based computer, or a DOS-based computer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">\u2019237 patent, col. 46, l. 62-col. 47, l. 6. Contrary to Global\u2019s assertions, the first portion of the cited text does not set forth computer systems with different hardware. Rather, it merely lists different forms of computer systems. The second portion of the text, however, distinguishes computer systems running different operating systems. Thus, the written description supports the conclusion that one of ordinary skill in the art would understand \u201cheterogeneous computer systems\u201d to refer to systems in which at least two host computers use a different operating system. Nowhere does the written description disclose or describe the context of the claimed invention in broader terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">The prosecution history is consistent with the conclusion noted above. As the district court observed, the \u201cheterogeneous computer system\u201d limitation was added during prosecution in response to rejection of the claims over the prior art. In distinguishing over the prior art, the prosecuting attorney explained that \u201cAny monitoring features performed by [Windows] NT are not with respect to heterogeneous computer systems. For example, [Windows] NT has no facility to monitor operational processes (as provided on the system console) in a VMS and MVS system.\u201d In other words, the prosecuting attorney clarified that the prior art did not encompass monitoring host computers with different operating systems, such as a VMS and MVS system. Additionally, during prosecution of the \u2019264 patent, the prosecuting attorney stated that \u201cthe language of the claim has been clarified to indicate that the system of the claimed invention controls the operating systems of the heterogeneous computers.\u201d Thus, the prosecution history supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that the \u201cheterogeneous computer systems\u201d are restricted in scope to encompass only systems in which at least two host computers use different operating systems.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">Global contests the district court\u2019s reliance on expert testimony in its claim construction ruling. Specifically, the district court noted that Global\u2019s own expert \u201cexpressly defined a \u2018heterogeneous computer system\u2019 as one that simultaneously controls multiple computers that use different operating systems.\u201d <em>Non-infringement Order, </em>slip op. at 8. In <em>Phillips, </em>we reaffirmed that \u201cextrinsic evidence may be useful to the court, but it is unlikely to result in a reliable interpretation of patent claim scope unless it is considered in the context of the intrinsic evidence.\u201d 415 F.3d at 1319. Here, the district court considered the context of the intrinsic evidence and properly relied on the extrinsic evidence merely to support the conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>reached on claim construction from the claims, the written description, and the prosecution history. We discern no error in the district court\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">We disagree with Global\u2019s contention that the district court improperly imposed a \u201csimultaneous\u201d requirement in its claim construction. Indeed, we commend the district court for its thorough, careful, and precise analysis in this technically complex case. Recognizing that the two host computers are unable to communicate directly with each other because they speak different languages, the district court explained that \u201cthe monitoring and control computer must understand and speak the language of both host computers^ and thus] it simultaneously translates between the host computers.\u201d <em>Non-infringement Order, </em>slip op. at 9. The district court\u2019s use of the word \u201csimultaneous\u201d merely clarifies and explains a characteristic inherent in its claim construction of \u201cheterogeneous computer systems,\u201d and does not further limit the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">2. Non-infringement</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">The district court granted summary judgment of non-infringement based on its conclusion that Global failed to present sufficient evidence to create a dispute of fact relating to whether I/O Concepts\u2019 products monitor and control \u201cheterogeneous computer systems.\u201d Specifically, the district court concluded that Global failed to present evidence relating to the sale by I/O Concepts of any infringing product to AIG or to any offer to sell, within the meaning of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(a), of any infringing product by I/O Concepts. <em>See Non-infringement Order, </em>slip op. at 9-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">Without pointing to any specific errors by the district court, Global contends on appeal that \u201cAppellants have raised an issue of fact relating to the sale of Appellee\u2019s infringing product to AIG.\u201d The district court considered the evidence presented, including the testimony of an AIG representative who testified that, after remedying some initial problems, \u201cAIG now uses I/O Concepts to manage and control both MVS and VM operating systems.\u201d <em>Non-infringement Order, </em>slip op. at 10. The district court also excluded portions of an affidavit of John Raster as inadmissible hearsay, and Global does not challenge that evidentiary ruling. The district court noted that the record merely indicated that \u201cAIG uses one CCS system to monitor and control computers running on the MVS operating system, and another CCS system to monitor and control computers using the VM operating system.\u201d <em>Id., </em>slip op. at 10-11. We agree with the district court that the cumulative evidence submitted by Global is insufficient to create a dispute of fact as to whether I/O Concepts has sold a product that controls and monitors \u201cheterogeneous computer systems,\u201d as required by all the asserted claims. Thus, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment of non-infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment of non-infringement is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
