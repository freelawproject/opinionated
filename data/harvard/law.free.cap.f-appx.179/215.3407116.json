To qualify as a prevailing party, \u201cthe plaintiff [must have] succeeded on any significant issue in litigation which achieved some of the benefit [he] sought in bringing suit.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Menchaca argues that he prevailed at a conference held before the district court because the court allegedly ordered the Commissioner to reimburse Menchaca for his costs incurred in gathering documents for his Social Security file. Nothing in the record, however, establishes that the district court issued such an order or, assuming that it did, that this particular matter would qualify as a \u201csignificant issue,\u201d Menchaca\u2019s success in which would have \u201cachieved some of the benefit [he] sought in bringing suit.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">Second, the Commissioner\u2019s conclusion that Menchaca is not disabled within the meaning of the SSA is supported by substantial evidence and is not tainted by any legal errors. \u201cSubstantial evidence is \u2018more than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Notably, \u201cwe may not re-</p>\n<p id=\"b242-11\">weigh the evidence in the record, nor try the issues de novo, nor substitute our judgment for that of the [Commissioner], even if the evidence preponderates against [her] decision.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In other words, if the Commissioner\u2019s conclusion is supported by substantial evidence, we must affirm it, even in the face of conflicting evidence. This is because \u201c[e]onflicts in the evidence are for the [Commissioner] and not the courts to resolve.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-12\">The Commissioner based her conclusion that Menchaca is not disabled on both steps four (whether Menchaca retained the residual functional capacity to perform his past relevant work) and five (whether, considering Menchaca\u2019s residual functional capacity, age, education, and work experience, he is capable of engaging in other work that exists in significant numbers in the national economy) of the five-step se<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>quential evaluation process mandated by 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520 and 416.920. Menchaca challenges the Commissioner\u2019s conclusion at both of these steps, but expends most of his energy challenging the Commissioner\u2019s step four analysis. As the five-step sequential process embodies a conjunctive test, however, we must affirm the Commissioner\u2019s decision if her conclusion at <em>either </em>step four or step five is supported by substantial evidence and not tainted by legal error. It is therefore unnecessary for us to consider the propriety of her conclusion at step four because her conclusion at step five is both supported by substantial evidence and free from legal error.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">At step five, the Commissioner concluded that Menchaca\u2019s residual functional capacity, age, education, and work experience enable him to \u201cperform the full range of sedentary, unskilled work\u201d and that such jobs \u201care found to exist [in the national economy] in significant numbers.\u201d To reach this conclusion, the Commissioner relied on the testimony of a Vocational Expert and the Medical-Vocational Guidelines.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Menchaca argues that the Commissioner erred in both of these respects because \u201cthe hypothetical question [she] posed did not adequately incorporate\u201d Menchaca\u2019s characteristics, and reliance on the Medical-Vocational Guidelines is not permitted \u201cwhen there are non-exertional limitations.\u201d Like his other arguments, these are meritless. First, the Commissioner\u2019s hypothetical question adequately incorporated Menchaca\u2019s characteristics, and Menchaca\u2019s counsel had the opportunity to correct any problems with it on cross-examination of the Vocational Expert.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Second, our precedents permit the Commissioner to rely on the Medical-Vocational Guidelines \u201c[w]hen the characteristics of the claimant correspond to criteria in\u201d those Guidelines \u201cand the claimant ... suffers only from ... non-exertional impairments [that] do not significantly affect his residual functional capacity.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Here, the Vocational Expert explicitly testified that Menchaca\u2019s non-exertional limitations would cause \u201czero percent erosion\u201d in the amount of sedentary, unskilled jobs available to him. As Menchaca has made no attempt to rebut this evidence, we agree that his non-exertional limitations \u201cdo not significantly affect his residual functional capacity.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We thus perceive no error in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>the Commissioner\u2019s rebanee on the Vocational-Medical Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b241-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

To impugn the Commissioner\u2019s decision at step four, Menchaca most forcefully argues that the Commissioner improperly classified his residual functional capacity as limiting him to light work, claiming that the Commissioner erred in her consideration of Menchaca's evidence of pain. We need not address this argument, though, because the Commissioner's conclusion at step five assumed that Menchaca is correct that his residual functional capacity limits him to sedentary work. In his appellate brief, Menchaca agrees with this sedentary residual functional capacity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b243-7\">. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1569 &amp; Subpart P\u201e App. 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b243-8\">.
