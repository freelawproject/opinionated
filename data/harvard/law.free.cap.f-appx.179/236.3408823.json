First he asserts that the district court erred by finding that his prior Texas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>convictions for burglary of a habitation were crimes of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii). The district court did not err. <em>See United States v. Garcia-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d 454 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1398, 164 L.Ed.2d 100 (2006). Maldonado\u2019s argument that we failed to apply the categorical analysis of <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), in <em>Garcia-Mendez </em>is essentially an argument that <em>Garciar-Mendez </em>was incorrectly decided, and it is unavailing. <em>See Burge v. Parish of St. Tammany, </em>187 F.3d 452, 466 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">Similarly, Maldonado asserts that the district court plainly erred by assessing criminal history points pursuant to \u00a7 4A1.1(f) for two prior burglary of a habitation convictions, based on a finding that they were crimes of violence under \u00a7 4B1.2(a). Burglary of a habitation in Texas is the equivalent of the enumerated offense of \u201cburglary of a dwelling\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2), and therefore it is a crime of violence under that section. <em>See United States v. Hornsby, </em>88 F.3d 336, 339 (5th Cir.1996). Maldonado\u2019s assertion that <em>Hornsby </em>does not control because we did not apply <em>Taylor </em>is not persuasive. <em>See Burge, </em>187 F.3d at 466.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">Finally, although Maldonado contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule it in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Maldonado properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-12\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b262-10\">Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
