As an initial matter, we lack jurisdiction over Maina\u2019s claim that the immigration judge violated her due process rights because she failed to exhaust her administrative remedies by not appealing the immigration judge\u2019s initial order of voluntary departure. Furthermore, we find that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Maina\u2019s motion to reopen. Accordingly, the petition is DISMISSED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-23\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b604-24\">Maina, a native and citizen of Kenya, entered the United States in August 2000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>as a non-immigrant visitor for pleasure with authorization to remain until February 2001. She remained beyond her authorized date and, in December 2002, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> issued a notice to appear, charging her with removability under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B). Maina\u2019s removal hearing was set for 21 November 2003. In June 2003, Maina filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">In early November 2003, Maina filed a \u201cmotion to adjourn and continue\u201d the hearing on the ground that she had married a lawful permanent resident who was applying for naturalization. Administrative Record (\u201cAR\u201d) at 225. Maina asserted that, if her husband were naturalized, she would be eligible for an adjustment of status. In support of her motion, she submitted a copy of her husband\u2019s naturalization application. The marriage certificate, which Maina had submitted in October 2003, indicated that she had married John Gacunu Waruhiu on 3 April 2003. <em>Id. </em>at 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">On 21 November 2003, the IJ continued Maina\u2019s hearing until April 2004 and subsequently rescheduled it for 2 June 2004. At the rescheduled hearing, the IJ granted Maina\u2019s application for voluntary departure until 2 August 2004, with an alternate order of removal to Kenya. <em>See id. </em>at 84.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Both Maina and the INS waived their rights to appeal. <em>Id. </em>On 2 August 2004, the final day of Mama\u2019s voluntary departure time period, she filed a motion to reopen the 2 June decision and allow her to pursue an adjustment of status based on her marriage to a United States citizen. She claimed that her husband was scheduled to become a United States citizen on 13 August 2004 and that he would then file a \u201cPetition for Alien Relative\u201d on her behalf. <em>Id. </em>at 48. In support of her motion, Maina again submitted her marriage certificate and her husband\u2019s naturalization application. Maina also submitted (1) a copy of her husband\u2019s completed \u201cPetition for Aien Relative,\u201d (2) an apartment lease dated 29 April 2003 in both Maina and her husband\u2019s names, and (3) two utility bills, both in her name only. <em>Id. </em>at 72-80. The IJ denied Maina\u2019s motion to reopen stating: \u201c[Maina] sought and was granted voluntary departure and was to depart[ ] on August 2, 2004 but refused to do so. [Maina] was further married during proceedings. Insufficient reasons to reopen this proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-10\">Maina appealed to the BIA, arguing in her brief that her motion to reopen had been timely filed and that she had established the <em>bona fides </em>of her marriage through her submission of copies of her husband\u2019s Petition for Alien Relative and the joint lease she held with her husband. Maina also asserted that, during her hearing before the IJ, she had been subjected to an experimental INS pilot program under which she had been given the option of taking a grant of voluntary departure or proceeding with her asylum claim with the risk that, if she did not prevail on that claim, she would be immediately impris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>oned on a $50,000 bond.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Maina contended that her Fifth Amendment due process rights had been violated when the INS implemented the pilot program and applied it to Maina without any notice to her that it was doing so. She argued that the IJ should have granted her motion to continue the removal hearing to allow her an \u201copportunity to reflect upon the new policy.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">The BIA dismissed Maina\u2019s appeal, finding that Maina was not eligible for an adjustment of status based on a marriage that had been entered into after the commencement of removal proceedings. More specifically, the BIA found that, although Maina\u2019s burden was to present clear and convincing evidence of a strong likelihood of a <em>bona fide </em>marriage, the record was insufficient to establish such because the only supporting evidence was the apartment lease signed by both Maina and her husband. <em>Id. </em>at 3. The BIA observed that the utility bills that Maina had submitted did not even list Maina\u2019s husband. <em>Id. </em>The BIA further found that Maina, as an alien who had failed to depart following the grant of voluntary departure, was statutorily barred from applying for an adjustment of status, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(d)(1)(B). <em>Id. </em>Finally, the BIA refused to consider Maina\u2019s due process challenge to her removal hearing because she \u201cdid not appeal the [IJ\u2019s] decision at the hearing, and that order is now final.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">In her petition for review, Maina argues that (1) the INS and the IJ violated her right to due process by applying an experimental pilot program during her removal proceedings and (2) the BIA abused its discretion in dismissing her appeal of the IJ\u2019s denial of her motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">A. <em>Violation of Due Process</em></p>\n<p id=\"b606-10\">We are \u201cobligated to inquire into subject-matter jurisdiction sua sponte whenever it may be lacking.\u201d <em>Cadet v. Bulger, </em>377 F.3d 1173, 1179 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation omitted). We review our subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Resendiz-Alcaraz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>383 F.3d 1262, 1266 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-11\">In immigration cases, we may review a final order of removal only if \u201cthe alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1). Constitutional challenges and some due process claims, however, do not require exhaustion because the BIA does not have the authority to adjudicate those claims. <em>Sundar v. INS, </em>328 F.3d 1320, 1325 (11th Cir.2003). Nevertheless, where the BIA can provide a remedy to the constitutional claim, \u201cthe exhaustion requirement applies with full force.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(holding that an alien should have exhausted his due process claim that the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s application of an immigration statute violated the constitution, because \u201c[i]t was within the BIA\u2019s authority to reconsider and change its decision\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>Here, Maina argues that she did not receive due process of law because the IJ, in her removal proceedings, put her in a position that forced her to make an unconscionable decision. It is undisputed, however, that Maina failed to appeal the IJ\u2019s order of voluntary departure. As such, Maina \u201cdeprived [the BIA] of the opportunity to discover and correct its own error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and alteration indication omitted). If Maina had appealed the IJ\u2019s order of voluntary departure, the BIA could have ascertained whether the procedure implemented at Maina\u2019s removal hearing did indeed force her into an unconscionable decision and, if so, the BIA could have provided Maina relief. Because Maina did not appeal the IJ\u2019s order, however, the BIA determined that the order was final and that it would not review Maina\u2019s due process claim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, we are without jurisdiction to review the merits of Maina\u2019s claim because she did not exhaust her administrative remedies. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">B. <em>Motion to Reopen</em></p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Maina also argues that the BIA abused its discretion in dismissing her motion to reopen because (1) the motion was timely, (2) the motion was not barred by the regulations, (3) the motion was not barred on other procedural grounds, and (4) she presented clear and convincing evidence that her marriage was <em>bona fide.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u201cWe review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Abdi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>430 F.3d 1148, 1149 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). \u201cOur review is limited to determining whether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">\u201cA motion to reopen proceedings shall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(3). An IJ will not grant a motion to reopen \u201cunless the [IJ] is satisfied that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, an IJ \u201chas discretion to deny a motion to reopen even if the moving party has established a prima facie case for relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We have previously held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-10\">[a]t a minimum, there are at least three independent grounds upon which the [BIA] may deny a motion to reopen: 1) failure to establish a prima facie case; 2) failure to introduce evidence that was material and previously unavailable; and 3) a determination that despite the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>alien\u2019s statutory eligibility for relief, he or she is not entitled to a favorable exercise of discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-4\"><em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1302 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Here, in dismissing Maina\u2019s appeal, the BIA first found that the record contained insufficient evidence to support a finding that Maina and her husband had a <em>bona fide </em>marriage. Petitioners, such as Maina, who seek an adjustment of status based on marriages entered into while in admissibility or deportation proceedings, are barred from such adjustment unless they can prove \u201cby clear and convincing evidence to the satisfaction of the Attorney General\u201d that the \u201cmarriage was not entered into for the purpose of procuring the alien\u2019s admission as an immigrant.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(e). The only effective supporting evidence Maina submitted was the apartment lease in both her and her husband\u2019s names. It was not an abuse of discretion on the part of the BIA to find that this, standing alone, did not constitute \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d that her marriage was <em>bona fide.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Further, Maina failed to submit with her motion to reopen \u201cevidence that was material and previously unavailable.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1302. In support of her motion to reopen, Maina submitted, for the second time, her husband\u2019s naturalization application and their marriage certificate. She also submitted the completed \u201cPetition for Alien Relative,\u201d the apartment lease, and the utility bills. Because the apartment lease is dated 29 April 2003, it would have been available when she initially filed for a continuance in November 2003. The rest of the new evidence is not \u201cmaterial\u201d to Maina\u2019s claim that her marriage was <em>bona fide </em>because (1) there is no evidence in the record that Maina\u2019s husband ever actually filed the \u201cPetition for Alien Relative\u201d and (2) the utility and phone Mis do not reference Maina\u2019s husband. Therefore, Maina failed to meet the requirement that she present evidence that was \u201cmaterial and was not [previously] available.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">Finally, even if Maina had made a <em>prima facie </em>case for relief, the BIA would still have retained discretion to deny her motion to reopen. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(3). Accordingly, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Maina\u2019s appeal of the I J\u2019s denial of her motion to reopen.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b608-11\">Maina appeals the BIA\u2019s dismissal of her appeal of the IJ\u2019s denial of her motion to reopen removal proceedings. Because we lack jurisdiction over Maina\u2019s claim that the immigration judge violated her due process rights and because we find that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Maina\u2019s motion to reopen, we DISMISS IN PART and DENY IN PART Maina\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b605-7\">.

The HSA transferred INS functions to the DHS. This case was initiated while the INS was still in existence. This opinion, therefore, refers to the INS rather than the DHS as the relevant agency.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b605-11\">. The transcript of the removal hearing is not included in the record on appeal. However, the essential facts of the hearing are not in dispute and are adequately set forth in the briefs. <em>See generally </em>AR at 6-13, 14-20; Petitioner\u2019s Br. at 4 \u2014 5; Government's Br. at 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b606-6\">. The government explained in its brief to the BIA that, during the time of Mama\u2019s removal hearing, the INS had been implementing an experimental program entitled \u201cOperation Compliance.\u201d AR at 7. Aliens subjected to this program were informed at the beginning of their removal proceedings that, if they failed on the merits of their claims, they would be taken into custody immediately and the appropriate amount of bond, as determined on a case-by-case basis, would be imposed. <em>Id. </em>The bond amount could reach a maximum of $50,000. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b606-13\">. On appeal before the BIA, Maina for the first time characterized her motion to reopen as a \"motion to reopen and/or continue proceedings.\u201d AR at 36. The motion, as filed with the IJ, was simply a motion to reopen removal proceedings. <em>See id. </em>at 48.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b607-7\">. An alien may be granted voluntary departure only if the alien \"waives appeal of all issues.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.26(b)(1)(i)(D). In Maina\u2019s case, the IJ noted in the order of voluntary departure that both parties waived their rights to appeal. AR at 84. Although one might argue that this appeal waiver would have precluded Maina from directly appealing the IJ\u2019s order, she could have filed an appeal on the basis that her waiver had been involuntary, especially in light of the nature of her due process claim. Further, neither party has addressed the effect, if any, of the appeal waiver and the BIA did not rely on this waiver ground in its dismissal of Maina\u2019s appeal of her motion to reopen.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b607-11\">. As an initial matter, the government argues that we lack jurisdiction over Maina\u2019s claim\u2014 that she is not statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status because her motion to reopen tolled her voluntary departure period- \u2014 on the basis that Maina failed to raise this claim before the IJ or BIA. Although she did not raise this specific argument below, she did contend that her motion to reopen was timely and that she was eligible for adjustment of status. <em>See </em>AR at 18. Therefore, even if we are without jurisdiction to consider the specific argument regarding the tolling of her voluntary departure period, we retain jurisdiction over her other claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b608-7\">.
