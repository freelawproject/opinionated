CABRANES, and Hon. ROBERT D. SACK, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b118-10\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b118-11\">Hong Yan Si, a native and resident of China, appeals from the BIA\u2019s order affirming Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) Margaret McManus\u2019s order denying her application for asylum and withholding of removal. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-12\">This Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision where, as here, the BIA summarily affirms or adopts the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion. <em>See Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Arango-Aradondo v. INS, </em>13 F.3d 610, 613 (2d Cir.1994). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, overturning them only if any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-14\">In <em>Shao Yan Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>417 F.3d 303 (2d Cir.2005), this Court determined that an alien was not entitled to asylum on the basis of his mother\u2019s alleged forcible sterilization under Chinese family planning policies, as the mother\u2019s victimization did not sufficiently encroach on the alien\u2019s procreative rights to establish that the alien himself was subjected to persecution. In the instant case, Si\u2019s only claim for past persecution is the mistreatment of her mother under the Chinese family planning policies; therefore, it is clear that Si did not suffer past persecution in China.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-15\">In the absence of solid support in the record for Si\u2019s assertion that she will be subjected to forced sterilization, her fear is speculative at best. <em>See Huang v. I.N.S., </em>421 F.3d 125, 129 (2d Cir.2005) (citing <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 440, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987)) (well-founded fear does not require high probability of persecution, but does require \u201can objective situation ... established by the evidence\u201d). Si is single and is not pregnant. She may never have children or, if she does, may not have more than the permitted number of them. There is no evidence in the record to establish that Si will ever be subjected to China\u2019s family planning laws. The IJ reasonably determined that Si failed to meet her burden of proof that she had a well-founded fear of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-16\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DE<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>NIED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
