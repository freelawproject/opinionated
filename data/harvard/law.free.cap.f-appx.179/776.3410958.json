We assume familiarity with the facts and the procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>Cortijo\u2019s single claim, both here and below, is that the state trial court\u2019s supplemental charge had the effect of lowering or shifting the state\u2019s burden of proof. Underlying this claim is an amorphous jury note, which prompted the trial court\u2019s allegedly defective charge. The meaning of this note has been the subject of significant controversy between the parties; it is relevant to the extent that it bears on whether the jury was reasonably likely to misapply the supplemental charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">The parties did not include an actual copy of the disputed note in their initial briefings to this court. Instead, they cited to an iteration of the note, as reflected in the trial transcript. When the trial judge first read the note\u2019s contents to the lawyers, he restated the note as providing: \u201c \u2018The defendant\u2019s case included evidence that the defendant\u2019s statements may not be truthful <em>and </em>that the statements made [sic] be the result of delusions,\u2019 plural.\u201d Appendix at 100 (emphasis added). But when the judge reread the note in the presence of the jury, the note\u2019s contents took on a potentially different meaning: \u201c\u2018The defendant in this defendant\u2019s case [sic] included evidence that the defendant\u2019s statements may not be truthful, <em>parentheses, </em>that the statements may be the result of delusions. <em>Close parentheses. </em>\u2019 \u201d Appendix at 113 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">Neither party noticed the discrepancy; both briefed the case as if the trial judge\u2019s first reading accurately reflected the contents of the note, including its use of the conjunctive \u201cand\u201d. In fact, the State expressly relies on the conjunctive \u201cand\u201d as an indication that the jury distinguished between confessions that are \u201cnot truthful\u201d and those that are \u201cthe result of delusions.\u201d <em>See </em>Appellees\u2019 Br. at 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">At oral argument, a member of this panel identified the discrepancy and requested that counsel submit a copy of the jury\u2019s actual note. Counsel submitted a copy for the record, and it indicates that the trial judge\u2019s second reading more accurately reflects the text of the actual note, a reproduction of which is recounted in the margin.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-10\">Because the jury\u2019s note is central to Cortijo\u2019s claim, and because the district court rendered its judgment without the benefit of the actual text of that note, we conclude that the prudent course would be to allow the district court to pass on the note\u2019s meaning in the first instance, after having the benefit of new briefing by the parties. The briefing should be comprehensive, and not simply limited to a discussion of the effect of the new note on the district court\u2019s previous opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-11\">This case presents complicated legal questions, including whether the state court\u2019s application of the \u201creasonable likelihood\u201d standard was \u201cobjectively unreasonable.\u201d <em>Cf. Middleton v. McNeil, </em>541 U.S. 433, 437, 124 S.Ct. 1830, 158 L.Ed.2d 701 (2004). We are confident that the district court will proceed with the same care and comprehensiveness on remand as it did when it initially decided this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>Accordingly, and for the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is VACATED and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b803-7\"> WE THE JURY REQUEST that we receive further instructions on reasonable doubt and the burden of proof in the context of the people\u2019s rebuttal to the [defendant\u2019s case. With regards to the people\u2019s initial case, Judge Solomon instructed us that the people must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the [defendant\u2019s statements were (1) made in fact, (2) voluntary and (3) truthful. The [defendant\u2019s case included evidence that the [defendantl\u2019s statements may not be truthful (that the statements may be the result of delusions).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-13\">Do the people have the burden to rebut this evidence and what is the standard of proof? In other words, must the people prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the [defendant\u2019s statements were not a result of delusions? (Court Ex. XVII.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
