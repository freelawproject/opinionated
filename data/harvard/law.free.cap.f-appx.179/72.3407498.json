We presume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-21\">Where, as here, the BIA summarily affirms the IJ, the Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See, e.g., Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004). Nevertheless, \u201cthe fact that the [agency] has relied primarily on credibility grounds in dismissing an asylum application cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>insulate the decision from review.\u201d <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir.2004). An adverse credibility determination must be based on \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d that \u201cbear a legitimate nexus\u201d to the finding. <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Although Chen\u2019s petition for review timely challenges the BIA\u2019s April 2004 affirmance of the IJ\u2019s removal order, her attorney\u2019s brief inexplicably argues that the BIA\u2019s subsequent denial of a motion to reopen was an abuse of discretion. Although that subsequent decision is contained in the certified administrative record, Chen did not file a petition for review challenging it, and so it is only the April 2004 decision that is under review. <em>See Khouzam v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 161, 167 (2d Cir.2004). Arguments not raised on appeal are normally deemed waived or abandoned, but this Court will consider them if it has reason to believe that \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d would result otherwise. <em>See, e.g., Shakur v. Selsky, </em>391 F.3d 106, 119 (2d Cir.2004). In this case, the IJ\u2019s (strikingly brief) decision is sufficiently flawed on its face that we believe it would be manifestly unjust not to reach the merits of that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">The IJ provided very little analysis to support his adverse credibility finding, but he appears to have factored in the following reasons, either explicitly or by implication. First, the IJ found that Chen\u2019s story was \u201csparse and simple.\u201d This Court has noted that where an applicant gives very spare testimony, the adjudicator may fairly wonder whether the testimony is fabricated. <em>Jin Shui Qiu v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 140, 152 (2d Cir.2003). The Court has suggested, however, that the IJ or government counsel should question an applicant whose testimony is found sparse in order to draw out inconsistencies which could then support an adverse credibility finding. <em>Id. </em>at 152 <em>&amp; </em>n. 6. Here, the IJ posed no questions to Chen regarding her claim and cross-examination was extremely short, during which Chen answered questions forthrightly and consistently with prior statements. The IJ and government thus failed to create a record that could support the IJ\u2019s adverse finding. <em>See Jin Chen v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 104, 114 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Next, the IJ found that Chen had failed to offer corroborating evidence. JA at 117. To the extent that the lack of corroboration is the basis for an insufficiency finding as to an otherwise credible applicant, the IJ must first point to the missing document and then show that it was reasonably available. <em>Jin Shui Qiu v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 140, 153 (2d Cir.2003); <em>cf. Xiao Ji Chen v. U Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>434 F.3d 144, 162 (2d Cir.2006) (contrasting the situation of an applicant who is not otherwise credible). Here, the IJ\u2019s conclusory statement that Chen failed to corroborate her claim cannot support the adverse credibility determination and the IJ pointed to nothing that Chen could have offered. We also note, in this respect, that Chen did submit a corroborating affidavit from the one relative who lives in the United States, an uncle, [175] and that at least one of the news reports in the record, a CNN story included at pp. 211-13 of the Appendix, mentions reports that officials have threatened family members as a means of deterring Falun Gong adherents from practicing.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">Finally, the IJ noted that \u201cnothing in the record indicates that relatives or people who practice Falun Gong are in prison.\u201d Read literally, this statement would be clear error because the Department of State Report in the record states that thousands of Falun Gong adherents have been imprisoned or detained in reedueation-through-labor camps. Assuming that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>this is a transcript error, and the phrase should rather read, \u201crelatives <em>of </em>people who practice Falun Gong,\u201d the IJ apparently failed to consider both the extent of China\u2019s program to deter the practice of Falun Gong as well as the possibility that officials could impute Chen\u2019s parents\u2019 affiliation with Falun Gong to her. <em>Chun Gao v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 122, 129-30 (2d Cir. 2005). Thus, the fact that Chen\u2019s claim that relatives of Falun Gong supporters were being arrested was not corroborated by background materials cannot alone support an adverse credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Chen\u2019s statements were consistent throughout her airport interview, asylum application, and testimony, and the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination is not supported by substantial evidence. Because Chen failed to raise her claim for either withholding or CAT relief before the BIA, Chen failed to exhaust her remedies, and this Court does not have jurisdiction to review those claims. <em>See Gill v. INS, </em>420 F.3d 82, 86 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is GRANTED, the BIA\u2019s order is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED to the BIA for further proceedings consistent with this decision. Having completed our review, Chen\u2019s pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
