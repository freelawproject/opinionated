The BIA affirmed the IJ on two grounds: (1) the government, through presentation of State Department reports, successfully rebutted any presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution to which Ghotra was entitled; and (2) Ghotra had not shown sufficiently severe past persecution to warrant a grant of asylum on humanitarian grounds in the absence of such a well-founded fear. We review the BIA\u2019s denial of asylum on humanitarian grounds where the petitioner shows atrocious past persecution for an abuse of discretion. <em>Belayneh v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 488, 491 (9th Cir.2000). The BIA abuses its discretion when it acts \u201carbitrarily, irrationally, or contrary to the law.\u201d <em>Lainez-Ortiz, </em>96 F.3d 393, 395 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-14\">Even where there is no likelihood of future persecution, asylum can be warranted for humanitarian reasons where the petitioner demonstrates \u201catrocious forms of [past] persecution\u201d on account of a protected ground. <em>See Matter of Chen, </em>20 I &amp; N Dec. 16, 1989 WL 331860 (1989) (developing this exception, later codified at 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1)(ii) (1999)). This court has refused to impose a \u201cminimum showing of \u2018atrocity\u2019 necessary to warrant a discretionary grant of asylum based on past persecution alone,\u201d <em>Vongsakdy v. INS, </em>171 F.3d 1203, 1207 (quoting <em>Kazlauskas v. INS, </em>46 F.3d 902 (9th Cir. 1995)), and has resisted the BIA\u2019s attempts to impose strict requirements. <em>See Lai v. INS, </em>255 F.3d 998 (9th Cir. 2001) (granting humanitarian asylum and rejecting the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the regulation codifying <em>Chen </em>as requiring demonstration of ongoing disability). In determining whether humanitarian asylum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>is warranted, the BIA should consider whether a petitioner\u2019s experience is of \u201ccomparable severity to Chen\u2019s.\u201d <em>Vongsakdy, </em>171 F.3d at 1207. The BIA did not provide any reasoning for denying asylum on humanitarian grounds, simply stating that Ghotra \u201chas not shown sufficiently severe past persecution to warrant a grant of asylum in the absence of a well-founded fear of future persecution.\u201d AR 2. <em>See Lopez-Galarza, </em>99 F.3d at 962 (reversing BIA\u2019s denial of humanitarian asylum where \u201c[t]he BIA made no attempt to articulate why Lopez-Garaza\u2019s persecution was less \u2018atrocious\u2019 than that of the petitioner in <em>Chen. </em>\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">The record does not support the BIA\u2019s conclusion. In Chen\u2019s case, his father was tortured, and Chen himself was locked in a room for 6 months, suffered head injuries that required a month of intensive medical treatment, and was sent to rural villages for re-education during the Chinese \u201ccultural revolution,\u201d where he was denied medical care, suffered a month-long fever, and was once locked in a closet for five hours. <em>Chen, 20 </em>I. <em>&amp; </em>N.Dec. at 20. Ghotra\u2019s suffering, as described in the record appears to be at least comparable. He was beaten repeatedly, often with wooden rollers, wooden sticks, or leather belts. He was hung upside down, and given electrical shocks in his mouth. He was detained and beaten for over a year, cumulatively. The beatings left him with internal injuries. After one release, he was unable to walk for some six months, and after another release, he needed medical care from his uncle, a doctor. He and his family were threatened. His family spent substantial sums on bribes to gain his release. His father\u2019s death was mocked. His cousin was killed. It was both arbitrary and irrational for the BIA to fail to compare Ghotra\u2019s intense and repetitive suffering to Chen\u2019s, as it is required to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-9\">We do not reach the other issues raised in Ghotra\u2019s petition for review. We grant the petition for review and remand to the BIA for proceedings consistent with this memorandum. We retain jurisdiction over this and future cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-10\">PETITION GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b1016-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
