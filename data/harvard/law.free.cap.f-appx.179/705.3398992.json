We review the denial of a motion for leave to file a late notice of appeal for abuse of discretion. <em>See Mirpuri v. ACT Mfg., Inc., </em>212 F.3d 624, 627 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-26\">Appellant argues that he was unable to file a timely appeal because he did not receive notice of the final judgment entered April 1, 2003, until August 2005. Where a party has not received notice of the entry of a judgment, the thirty-day appeal period provided in Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A) may be re-opened for a fourteen-day period, but only when the motion to reopen \u201cis filed within 180 days after the judgment or order is entered or within 7 days after the moving party receives notice ... [of entry], whichever is earlier; and ... the court finds that no party would be prejudiced.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). Since appellant\u2019s motion was filed well beyond the 180-day period in which a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>motion to reopen would have been permitted, this exception is of no help to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">To the extent appellant suggests that the district court should have entered his motion to reopen nunc pro tunc, his argument is unavailing because, even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the district court had authority to follow such a procedure, it did not abuse its discretion in declining to do so given its finding that appellant had failed to fulfill his duty to diligently monitor the docket. <em>See Mirpuri, </em>212 F.3d at 631; <em>Witty v. Dukakis, </em>3 F.3d 517, 520 (1st Cir.1993). <em>See also </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 77(d) (\u201c[l]ack of notice of the entry by the clerk does not affect the time to appeal or relieve or authorize the court to relieve a party for failure to appeal within the time allowed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\"><em>Affirmed. See </em>1st Cir. Loc. R. 27(c).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
