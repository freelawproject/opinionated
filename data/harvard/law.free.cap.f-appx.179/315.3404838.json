We affirm the district court\u2019s ruling and sentence. Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we need not recite them.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea. <em>United States v. Pluto, </em>144 F.3d 968, 973 (6th Cir.1998). \u201c[T]he defendant has the burden of proving the existence of a fair and just reason supporting the withdrawal of his or her guilty plea.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and citation omitted). The district court did not abuse its discretion in holding, under the <em>Pluto </em>factors, that Pickett lacked a sufficient reason for withdrawing his plea. First, Pickett cites no case in which a court has granted a withdrawal motion filed fifty-four days or more after the plea. Second, even assuming that Pickett\u2019s prior lawyer frustrated his efforts to obtain new counsel, Pickett provides an inadequate explanation as to why it took nearly a month to file the withdrawal motion after securing new counsel. Third, Pickett\u2019s withdrawal motion does not assert or maintain his innocence. Fourth, on multiple occasions prior to entering his original plea, Pickett affirmed that he understood his rights, was satisfied with his legal representation, and was entering the plea voluntarily. Finally, the record supports the district court\u2019s findings that Pickett is \u201cintelligent and articulate\u201d and \u201cnot a stranger to the criminal process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-12\">Pickett\u2019s allegations of sentencing error also lack merit. The court did not err by engaging in judicial factfinding to calculate Pickett\u2019s Guidelines sentence range. <em>\u201cBooker </em>did not ehminate judicial fact-finding in sentencing in cases where a defendant plead [sic] guilty.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>411 F.3d 675, 678 (6th Cir.2005). The district court did not use judicially-found facts to sentence Pickett beyond the statutorily authorized maximum term. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 233-34, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-13\">Finally, Pickett does not demonstrate error in the district court\u2019s sentencing decision to overcome the rebuttable presumption of reasonableness credited to sentences falling within the Guidelines range. <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>437 F.3d 550, 553 (6th Cir.2006). \u201c[W]e may conclude that a sentence is unreasonable when the district judge fails to consider the applicable Guidelines range or neglects to consider the other factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and citation omitted). Contrary to Pickett\u2019s allegations on appeal, the district court considered his suggested mitigating factors but ultimately found them unpersuasive given the specific circumstances of his criminal activity. The court sufficiently addressed Pickett\u2019s \u00a7 3553(a) issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>and, therefore, the sentence it imposed was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
