Accordingly, the IJ determined that Gomez failed to demonstrate that she had suffered past persecution based on her race, religion, or social group and failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution. In dismissing Gomez\u2019s appeal and affirming the IJ, the BIA concluded that Gomez failed to show past persecution in Gambia and failed to demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution based on a protected ground under the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158, if she were to return to Gambia. The BIA also determined Gomez failed to establish grounds for withholding of removal or relief under the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-14\">We review the BIA\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>and findings of fact for substantial evidence. <em>Lopez-Gomez v. Ashcroft, </em>263 F.3d 442, 444 (5th Cir.2001). \u201cThe substantial evidence standard requires only that the BIA\u2019s decision be supported by record evidence and be substantially reasonable.\u201d <em>Omagah v. Ashcroft, </em>288 F.3d 254, 258 (5th Cir.2002). Under this standard, this Court will reverse the BIA\u2019s decision only if evidence compels the contrary conclusion. <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-15\">After a thorough review of the briefs, the parties\u2019 oral arguments, and the record on appeal, we cannot conclude that the evidence compels a conclusion contrary to that of the BIA. Accordingly, we deny Gomez\u2019s petition for review essentially for the reasons provided by the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-16\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b247-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
