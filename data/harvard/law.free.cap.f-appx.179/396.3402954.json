On limited remand under <em>United States v. Paladino, </em>401 F.3d 471 (7th Cir. 2005), the district judge stated that even if he had known that the Sentencing Guidelines were advisory and not mandatory, <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), he would have imposed the same sentence (which was at the low end of the guideline range). We have invited both parties to respond to the district court\u2019s statement, but only the government has done so. Mr. Lagunas-Delgado has therefore shown no reason why the sentence, which is presumed reasonable under <em>United States v. Mykytiuk, </em>415 F.3d 606 (7th Cir.2005), should not stand, and our own review shows none.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
