The district court granted summary judgment to United, concluding that Curl failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact that, <em>inter alia, </em>his disorder substantially limited a major life activity, including working. Curl appeals, and we review <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-24\">Under the ADA, Curl must show, <em>inter alia, </em>that he had a \u201cdisability,\u201d defined as \u201ca physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual....\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Emotional or mental illness can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>be a \u201cmental impairment.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Major life activities include \u201cfunctions such as caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and \u201csubstantially limited\u201d means \u201c(i) [ujnable to perform a major life activity that the average person in the general population can perform; or (ii)[s]ignif\u00edcantly restricted as to the condition, manner or duration under which an individual can perform a particular major life activity as compared to ... the average person in the general population. ...\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Regarding the major life activity of working, the term \u201csubstantially limited\u201d means</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-5\">significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training, skills and abilities. The inability to perform a single, particular job does not constitute a substantial limitation on the major life activity of working.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Factors to consider when determining whether someone is substantially limited in working include</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-7\">(A) The geographical area to which the individual has reasonable access;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-8\">(B) The job from which the individual has been disqualified ..., and the number and types of jobs utilizing similar training, knowledge, skills or abilities, within that geographical area, from which the individual is also disqualified because of the impairment (class of jobs); and/or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-16\">(C) The job from which the individual has been disqualified ..., and the number and types of other jobs not utilizing similar training, knowledge, skills or abilities, within that geographical area, from which the individual is also disqualified because of the impairment (broad range of jobs in various classes).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-17\">Even assuming that Curl had an \u201cimpairment\u201d affecting his claimed \u201csubstantial life activities\u201d of, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201csleeping, concentrating, interacting with crowds of people, thinking, [and] hearing,\u201d he has not shown a genuine issue of material fact that he was \u201csubstantially limited\u201d in those activities.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> His primary evidence consists of bald assertions based on textbook explications of the types of symptoms people with his impairment might experience, failing to show Curl\u2019s own symptoms \u2014 his own \u201cown experience\u201d of substantial limitation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Furthermore, that Curl was able to care for himself, complete a degree program, and work other jobs despite his impairment, and his testimony that his condition \u201chasn\u2019t affect any abilities,\u201d belie his conclusory testimony regarding his symptoms.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>Curl also argues that his impairment limited his major life activity of working because he could not work night shifts. Because he did not present this issue to the district court, it is waived.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> And even if we were to consider it, he has not raised a genuine issue of material fact. He points only to Department of Labor statistics showing that over four million positions in various industries involve night shifts, allegedly showing he is \u201cunable to perform a broad range of jobs in numerous industries.\u201d Not only are these statistics too broad because not limited to Curl\u2019s specific geographic area or people with \u201ccomparable training, skills, or abilities,\u201d but Curl\u2019s inability to perform a job at certain times \u2014 as opposed to an inability to perform the job in general \u2014 is an insufficient \u201cinability to perform one aspect of a job while retaining the ability to perform the work in general....\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Indeed, Curl concedes that he could perform the work of a doughnut fryer during the day and that he held daytime bakery and sales positions after leaving United. Curl was not unable to work a \u201cbroad range of jobs in various classes,\u201d he was only unable to work any job at a range of times.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b234-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

Moreover, as the district court noted, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>testimony referred to problems he was having before resigning from United the first time, rendering it irrelevant here. Curl concedes this, arguing instead that United has not produced any evidence showing that Curl no longer suffers from the same problems. This misplaces the burden of proof, for a plaintiff to survive summary judgment must proffer facts sufficient to support the claim. Only then does the non-movant have the burden to come forward with specific facts in rebuttal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b236-22\">. <em>See Little v.
