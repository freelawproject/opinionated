He then filed an amended complaint alleging claims against three additional defendants employed by the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections (\u201ccorrections defendants\u201d) on May 2, 2005. On August 3, 2005, the medical defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. The corrections defendants followed suit on August 16, 2005. Bronson did not file an opposition to either of these motions until November 4, 2005. Bronson then filed a declaration and supplemental arguments in support of his opposition brief on December 2, 2005. Thus, contrary to allegations made by Bronson in his petition for a writ of mandamus, the motions to dismiss have been ripe for adjudication since December, not August, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">The remedy of mandamus is reserved for the most extraordinary of circumstances. <em>DeMasi v. Weiss, </em>669 F.2d 114, 117 (3d Cir.1982). In order to ensure that mandamus is sparingly granted, a petitioner seeking a writ of mandamus must demonstrate that no other adequate means are available to obtain the desired relief and that the right to issuance of the writ is \u201cclear and indisputable.\u201d <em>Allied Chem. Corp. v. Daiflon, Inc., </em>449 U.S. 33, 35, 101 S.Ct. 188, 66 L.Ed.2d 193 (1980) (quoting <em>Bankers Life &amp; Cas. Co. v. Holland, </em>346 U.S. 379, 384, 74 S.Ct. 145, 98 L.Ed. 106 (1953) (quoting <em>United States v. Duell, </em>172 U.S. 576, 582, 19 S.Ct. 286, 43 L.Ed. 559 (1899))). Here, petitioner seeks an order directing the District Court to rule immediately on defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss. Petitioner has not demonstrated that his right to such a ruling is \u201cclear and indisputable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">As we have previously held, the management of its docket is committed to the sound discretion of the district court. <em>In re Fine Paper Antitrust Litig., </em>685 F.2d 810, 817 (3d Cir.1982). When a matter is discretionary, it cannot typically be said that a litigant\u2019s right is \u201cclear and indisputable.\u201d <em>Allied Chem. Corp., </em>449 U.S. at 35-36, 101 S.Ct. 188. Nonetheless, we have held that a writ of mandamus may be warranted where undue delay is tantamount to a failure to exercise jurisdiction. <em>Madden v. Myers, </em>102 F.3d 74, 79 (3d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">Petitioner has not demonstrated undue delay in this case. While defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss have been pending since December, the District Court has acted expeditiously on the various motions filed by Petitioner, has set a schedule for discovery and for the filing of dispositive motions, and has responded in a timely manner to frequent inquiries from Petitioner regarding the status of the case. We trust that the District Court will continue to respond to the parties\u2019 filings in an expeditious manner. The petition for a writ of mandamus is therefore denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
