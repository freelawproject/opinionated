Fornes appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the Osceola County Sheriffs Office (\u201cOCSO\u201d) in his Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d) action, which was brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101 <em>et seq. </em>The district court granted summary judgment in favor of OCSO based on its finding that Fornes could not meet the first prong of his prima facie case by showing that he had a disability. On appeal, Fornes first asserts that he met the first prong of his prima facie case for the following reasons. Fornes argues that he was substantially limited in the major life activity of \u201ccaring for himself\u2019 and \u201crunning.\u201d Fornes contends that his impairment, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (\u201cCIDP\u201d), substantially limited these major life activities because his impairment is permanent or long term. Also, Fornes argues that OCSO \u201cregarded\u201d him as having a disability and that it had a \u201crecord of his disability.\u201d Second, Fornes contends that he met the second prong of his prima facie case \u2014 that he was a \u201cqualified individual\u201d \u2014 because he could perform the essential functions of a \u201ctechnical service sergeant,\u201d and was not required to per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>form the essential functions of a \u201claw enforcement agent\u201d generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">\n<em>I. STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">\u201cWe review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing the materials presented and drawing all factual inferences in a light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>D\u2019Angelo v. Con-Agra Foods, Inc., </em>422 F.3d 1220, 1225 (11th Cir.2005). Summary judgment is properly granted when \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact\u201d and \u201cthe moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). \u201cThe movant bears the burden of demonstrating the satisfaction of this standard, by presenting pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any that establish the absence of any genuine, material factual dispute.\u201d <em>D\u2019Angelo, </em>422 F.3d at 1225 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">\n<em>II. ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">\n<em>A. Legal Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">The ADA provides that \u201c[n]o covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). For claims under the ADA, a burden-shifting analysis is used. <em>Hilburn v. Murata Elecs. N. Am., Inc., </em>181 F.3d 1220, 1226 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">Since the district court granted summary judgment at the first stage of the burden-shifting procedure \u2014 the prima facie case \u2014 we will focus only on that stage of the analysis. To establish a prima facie case under the ADA, the employee must show \u201cthat (1) he has a disability, (2) he is a \u2018qualified individual,\u2019 which is to say, able to perform the essential functions of the employment position that he holds or seeks with or without reasonable accommodation, and (3) the defendant unlawfully discriminated against him because of the disability.\u201d <em>Reed v. Heil Co., </em>206 F.3d 1055, 1061 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-12\"><em>B. First Prong of the Prima Facie Case </em>\u2014 Disability</p>\n<p id=\"b660-13\">The ADA defines disability as: \u201c(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of [an] individual; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102(2). The term \u201cmajor life activities\u201d is defined as \u201cfunctions such as caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(i). The Supreme Court has held that these terms need to be interpreted strictly to create a demanding standard for qualifying as disabled. <em>Toyota Motor Mfg., Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, </em>534 U.S. 184, 197, 122 S.Ct. 681, 691, 151 L.Ed.2d 615 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-15\">The district court held that Fornes failed to establish this first prong of the prima facie case. Fornes argued that he was substantially limited in the major life activity of running. The district court held that running was not a major life activity. We need not decide this issue, because even if running is a major life activity, Fornes fails to establish the second prong, that he is a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number><em>C. Second Prong of the Prima Facie Case </em>\u2014 \u201cQualified <em>Individual\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">For the second prong of a prima facie case, the ADA prohibits employment discrimination against a \u201cqualified individual with a disability,\u201d defined as an \u201cindividual with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). If the individual \u201cis unable to perform an essential function of his ... job, even with an accommodation, he is, by definition, not a \u2018qualified individual\u2019 and, therefore, not covered under the ADA.\u201d <em>Davis v. Fla. Power &amp; Light Co., </em>205 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir.2000). \u201cIn other words, the ADA does not require [the employer] to eliminate an essential function of [the plaintiffs] job.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">\u201cWhether a function is essential is evaluated on a case-by-case basis by examining a number of factors.\u201d <em>Id., </em>205 F.3d at 1305. In making this determination, the statute provides, \u201cconsideration shall be given to the employer\u2019s judgment as to what functions of a job are essential, and if an employer has prepared a written description before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job, this description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8); <em>see also Holbrook v. City of Alpharetta, </em>112 F.3d 1522, 1526 (11th Cir. 1997). Factors to consider under the ADA include,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-7\">(1) the amount of time spent on the job performing the function, (2) the consequences of not requiring the incumbent to perform the function, (3) the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, (4) the work experience of past incumbents in the job, and (5) the current work experience of incumbents in similar jobs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Azh\"><em>Davis, </em>205 F.3d at 1305 (citing 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(n)(3)).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-11\">Fornes and OCSO skirmish over whether this court should look to the job requirements of a deputy sheriff generally, or to those of a technical services sergeant, which was Fornes\u2019s particular assignment when he was terminated. Fornes, however, cannot establish that he is a \u201cqualified individual\u201d even if the essential functions of his job are limited to those of a technical service sergeant. Fornes contends that the essential functions of his job are limited to those of technical service sergeant as described in OCSO\u2019s job description. Fornes is correct that the job description used by OCSO should be given consideration in determining the essential functions of a position. <em>See Holbrook, </em>112 F.3d at 1526. However, Fornes\u2019s focus on only part of the job deseription-the limited importance of running \u2014 is misplaced. Regardless of the low import of running, there are essential functions in the job description he could not perform, namely, standing for a prolonged period and heavy lifting. In the official job description standing received an \u201cextremely-important\u201d ranking and heavy lifting received an \u201cimportant\u201d ranking. According to Dr. Littel\u2019s note, based on information that Fornes provided him, Fornes could not perform these activities. Dr. Littel\u2019s note stated that Fornes was restricted from running, standing for long periods, heavy lifting, and repetitive actions. Therefore, even assuming that Fornes need only perform the essential functions of a technical service sergeant, he still could not perform all of these functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-12\">In conclusion, looking at the record in the light most favorable to Fornes, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>conclude that Fornes\u2019s inability to run, stand for prolonged periods, or lift heavy objects shows he was not a qualified individual with a disability. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b660-10\">.
