The Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) summarily affirmed the denial of relief by the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-26\">Momin contends that the BIA and IJ erred by determining that he had not shown a well-founded fear of persecution or that it was more likely than not that he would be subjected to torture if he returned to India. However, because the record does not compel a finding that Mo-min was entitled to any of the relief he sought, Momin has failed to show that the decision was not supported by substantial evidence. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992); <em>Faddoul v. INS, </em>37 F.3d 185, 188 (5th Cir.1994).; <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 906-07 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-27\">Momin\u2019s petition for review therefore is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b233-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
