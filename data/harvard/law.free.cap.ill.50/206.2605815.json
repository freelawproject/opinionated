Though the defendant had admitted he struck the mule in disciplining him, he not having been broke to work, and that from the blow the mule died, he contested the fact of killing before the jury, and under the above instruction, the jury found for him.</p> <p id=\"b207-12\" pgmap=\"207\">This instruction must certainly have misled the jury. The law is not, in such a case, that there shall be a clear preponderance of evidence in favor of the plaintiff to entitle him to recover. It is sufficient, if the evidence creates probabilities in his favor\u2014that the weight of the evidence inclines to his side.</p> <p id=\"b207-13\" pgmap=\"207\">For this error the judgment must be reversed and the cause remanded.</p> <p id=\"b207-14\" pgmap=\"207\">Judgment reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
