The substantial averments in the indictment are as follows: \u201cThat J. C. Crouch in said county and State on or about the 6th day of April, 1915, did without lawful authority, and with intent to injure and defraud make a false instrument in writing, purporting to be the act of one J. W. Shields, as the duly and legally authorized agent of and for the Gulf, Colorado &amp; Santa Pe Bailway Company, said railway company being a private corporation duly and legally organized .and existing under the laws of the State of Texas, and being a common carrier of passengers and freight for hire, did on or about said date unlawfully and with intent to defraud, forge the name of said J. W. Shields, agent of said railway company at Abernathy, Texas, to said instrument in writing the same being a bill of lading, the tenor Whereof is as follows.\u201d Then follows the bill of lading upon one of the printed forms of the Gulf, Colorado &amp; Santa Pe Bailway Company purporting to have been issued at Abernathy, signed \u201cJ. W. Shields,\u201d Agent. Continuing, the indictment says: \u201cWhich said instrument in writing purports to be an original bill of lading issued by said Gulf, Colorado &amp; Santa Pe Bailway Company, the same being thereon designated: \u2018Order Bill of Lading\u2014Original/ and imports and implies that on the 26th day of March, A. D. 1915, one Tandy Coal Company as shipper, had delivered to the said Gulf, Colorado &amp; Santa Pe Bailway Company fifty three thousand (53,000) pounds of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>maize to be carried and transported by the said Gulf, Colorado &amp; Santa Fe Railway from Abernathy, in the State of Texas, to Temple, in the State of Texas, the same being consigned to the order of Tandy Coal Company, notify A. B. Crouch Grain Company.\u201d After making averments and explaining the meaning of various figures and provisions and misspelled words which are not material to the purpose of this opinion, it continues: \u201cThe words and letters 'J. W. Shelds\u2019 written before the word 'Agent\u2019 meant and were intended to mean 'J. W. Shields\u2019 and was intended to mean and imply that said J. W. Shields had signed such instrument as the agent of the Gulf, Colorado &amp; Santa Fe Railway Company, acknowledging the receipt of said maize for shipment as aforesaid; the instrument so written was and is the usual form of an original bill of lading as the same are generally written, executed and issued by said Gulf, Colorado &amp; Santa Fe Railway Company and said J. W. Shields was in fact the duly authorized agent of said railway company at Abernathy, in the State of Texas, and said! J. W. Shields as such agent had full authority to execute said bill of lading, and said instrument imported and meant to import and imply that said Gulf, Colorado &amp; Santa Fe Railway Company had in fact received and was in possession of 53,000 pounds of maize, the same having been received from the Tandy Coal Company, as shipper, at Abernathy in the State of Texas, and consigned to Tandy Coal Company at Temple, Texas, the destination of said shipment, the said instrument by its writing thereon, towit: 'notify A. B. Crouch Grain Co.\u2019 imported and meant to imply that <em>that </em>A. B. Crouch Grain Company had some-interest in said shipment of maize and would probably hold said bill of lading therefor, the said instrument in writing being a bill of lading, being a commercial paper and instrument in common use in the commercial world, the same being transferable, and the holder thereof being regarded as the owner and the holder of the title to said property described therein, and if said instrument had been true and genuine the-said Gulf, Colorado <em>&amp; </em>Santa Fe Railway Company would have been responsible to the shipper of said maize or other owner and holder of\" said bill of lading for the safe carriage of said maize and its delivery-to said shipper or other owner and holder of said bill of lading,, at: Temple, Texas, and if said instrument had been true and genuine the-same would have carried a pecuniary obligation on the part of the saidi Gulf, Colorado &amp; Santa Fe Railway Company, and the same would have transferred and might have transferred and been the means of transferring the title, ownership and property in and to said maize, andi said instrument, if genuine and true, would have possessed legal vaEdity and the same was legally capable of affecting a fraud, against the; peace and dignity of the State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">This indictment charges the offense renounced in article 1547, Vernon\u2019s Texas P. C., which is as follows: \u201cAny person who shall forge-the name of any agent of a railroad company, or other common carrier,, to a bill of lading, with the intent to defraud, or who shall forge the. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>name of any person to any certificate attached to a bill of lading issued by such carrier, with the intent to defraud, or who shall knowingly utt\u00e9r, or attempt to utter, any such forged instrument, with intent to defraud, shall be deemed guilty of a felony, and upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by confinement in the State penitentiary for a term \u25a0of not less than five and not exceeding fifteen years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">In the development of the case it was conclusively shown that Shields was not the agent of the Gulf, Colorado &amp; Santa Fe Bailway Company; that that railway company did not run through or.have an office at -Abernathy, the place at which it was alleged to have been issued, but \u00a1Shields lived there and was the agent of another and different railway \u25a0company. He denied signing the bill of lading.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The court in instructing the jury submitted the law of ordinary forgery which is defined in article 924, Vernon\u2019s Texas P. 0., as follows: \"He is guilty of forgery who, without lawful authority, and \"with intent to injure or defraud, shall make a false instrument in writing, purporting to be the act of another, in such manner that the false instrument so made would (if the same were true) have created, increased, diminished, discharged or defeated any pecuniary obligation, \u25a0or would have transferred, or in any manner have affected any property whatever.\u201d The penalty for this offense is set out in article 936 of the Penal Code, as follows: \u25a0 \"If any person be guilty of forgery he shall be punished by confinement in the penitentiary not less than two nor more than seven years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">The theory upon which the case appears to have been tried is that while the State failed to prove the offense charged as defined in article 1547, supra, that the allegations in the indictment contained the elements of ordinary forgery as defined in article 924, supra, and that the prosecution could, therefore, be maintained for the latter offense. We think this is a mistaken view for the reason that the two statutes mentioned define separate offenses and are punishable by different penalties. \u2018The penalty for violation of article 1547 is confinement in the penitentiary for not less than five nor more than fifteen years, and for violation of article 92-4 not less than two nor more than seven years. \"An indictment containing but one count in which two different and (distinct felonies with different penalties are completely alleged is bad for duplicity.\u201d 1 Branch\u2019s Ann. P. C., p. 260; State v. Dorsett, 21 Texas, 656; Heineman v. State, 22 Texas Crim. App., 44; Wood v. State, 47 Texas Crim. Rep., 543.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">The case of Dillard v. State, 77 Texas Crim. Rep., 1, 177 S. W. Rep., 99, was one in which there was a charge of passing a forged instrument which affected the titles to land defined in articles 947 and 949 of the Penal Code. The court submitted the passing of a forged instrument \u25a0such as described in articles 924 and 937, P. C. The court said: \"If the punishment prescribed was the same, we might deem it immaterial but for passing an ordinary forged instrument the punishment is not less than two nor more than five years, while the punishment for passing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>a forged instrument affecting the title to land is not less than five nor more than twenty years. In this case the punishment assessed was only two years.\u201d On this ground, among others, a motion for rehearing was granted and the case reversed. Other cases in point are Huton v. State, 38 S. W. Rep., 209; Osborne v. State, 42 Texas crim. Rep., 557; Sedgwick v. State, 57 Texas Crim. Rep., 420; Malley v. State, 58 Texas Crim. Rep., 425; Williams v. State, 42 Texas Crim. Rep., 602.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Under the indictment no conviction can be had except upon proof showing that the offense defined in article 1547 had been committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
