Under such circumstances the rule is that this court will presume that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the case as charged by the indictment. A state of facts will be presumed by this court which were provable under the allegations of the indictment in the absence of a statement of facts. We have other statutes with reference to punishing solicitors of this character, of a general nature, prohibiting all parties from doing such prohibited acts. In this particular matter the Legislature provided that parties who made such solicitations between a woman and a soldier should be punished as described in the statute. No sufficient reason has been suggested why the Legislature was not clothed with this authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Finding no reversible error in the record, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
