The attack on th'e complaint and information is that between the words \u201cdealer\u201d and \u201cwares\u201d the pleader uses the word \u201cof\u201d instead of the word \u201cin\u201d as used in the statute. The contention is that for this reason the complaint and information do not charge an offense in that it is not a sufficient compliance with the statute. We are not disposed to agree with this contention. While it is always best and safest in pleading to follow the language employed in the statute, yet if words of the same or greater import are used instead of the statutory words, this would not amount to a sufficient reason for holding the pleading bad. We are of opinion that as this complaint and information are drawn, the statement that appellant was a dealer <em>of </em>wares and merchandise instead of dealer <em>in </em>wares and merchandise, is not of sufficient importance to require the court to hold the complaint and information invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">Believing the complaint and information to be sufficient as presented in the record, we hold that there was no error in the trial court refusing to sustain appellant\u2019s contention, and this does not present sufficient reason why the judgment should be reversed, and it is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\"><em>IAffirmed. </em>_</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
