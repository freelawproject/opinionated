An officer testified that on two occasions in February or March, 1918, he had raided the house in which appellant and some other negroes lived, and found a trunk of beer there, on one occasion and a half trunk full at another time. The sheriff testified that the prosecuting witness, Hays, delivered to him the whisky gotten on each of three occasions. The sales were denied by appellant. She also claimed the beer found on the premises belonged to another person residing in the same house, and that she had received no whisky by express except one gallon, which she used herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">This is not a case in which the evidence consisted alone of isolated sales. The admission of appellant that she was selling whisky, and that she could make good money out of it, together with the evidence showing intoxicating liquor in her possession, or on her premises on several occasions, were circumstances supplementing the direct evidence of three sales, presenting a record on which we would not be authorized to re-, verse for the insufficiency of the evidence.
