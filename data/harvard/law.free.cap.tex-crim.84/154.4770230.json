This appellant shot and killed the deceased, for which he and Norvin Holland were convicted of manslaughter. A sufficient statement of the case is made in the opinions in the two appeals of Norvin Holland, the first in 80 Texas Crim. Rep., 637, 192 S. W. Rep., 1070, and the other this day decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">The evidence in this case was by the same witnesses, and substantially the same as in the Korvin Holland cases, except that in this case there was no testimony as to the claimed insanity of Horvin Holland.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">There are but few questions raised in this case. One is, appellant complains of the court\u2019s charge where he submitted the question of appellant\u2019s right to kill the deceased in defense of his brother Horvin. He told the jury, briefly stated, that if they believed Dorman Holland knew nothing of the difficulty between his brother Uorvin and the deceased, or was not a party to or concerned in said conspiracy, etc., and if they believed the other requisites necessary, showed he killed him in defense of his brother to acquit. The difference between the charge in this case and in the Uorvin Holland case is noticeable in that, as shown in the Korvin Holland case, he connected conjunctively Dorman Holland\u2019s knowledge of the difficulty, and his entering into the conspiracy. In this he used the disjunctive \u201cor.\u201d The charge complained of in this case is materially different in that respect from- what it was in the Horvin Holland case, and we think appellant\u2019s objection thereto majr not present reversible error. However, we suggest that on another trial the question of appellant\u2019s knowledge of the difficulty between Horvin Holland and deceased might properly be omitted from the charge. His knowledge of the difficulty might be a matter of argument before the jury in connection with other facts as tending to show he entered into the claimed conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">We think the court\u2019s charge did not shift the burden of proof from the State to appellant in submitting the question of the defense by appellant of his brother Horvin. It would be proper, however, for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>court in submitting that question, as is customary in such charges, to tell the jury that if they believed, etc.,, that he killed him in defense of his brother, or they had a reasonable doubt thereof, to acquit him.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Appellant properly raised and preserved his objection to the refusal of the court to give this special charge, towit: \u201cGentlemen of the Jury: You are instructed that you can not consider the acts and declarations of Horvin Holland and Hill Holland, made in the absence of defendant, for the purpose of proving a conspiracy, but you must find from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that a conspiracy was formed before you would be permitted to consider said acts and declarations of said Horvin Holland and Hill Holland for any purpose whatever.\u201d The court gave no charge covering this point. The charge enunciates a correct proposition applicable to the evidence in this case, and the court erred in refusing to give it.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">The court did not err, however, in refusing to give this charge requested by appellant: \u201cShould you find from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that a conspiracy was formed to whip the deceased, Lee Clement, and that the defendant was a party to said conspiracy, then you could only consider the acts and declarations of Horvin Holland and Hill Holland as circumstances to be considered by you in throwing light upon, illustrating and making manifest the purpose, object and motive and intent of the parties, and for no other purpose.\u201d It would have been improper for the court, with the evidence as it was in this case, to have restricted the jury to the consideration of said evidence of the acts and declarations of Horvin and Hill Holland as was sought by this special charge. The testimony of the acts and declarations of Horvin and Hill Holland, if a conspiracy, was proven as against appellant, should not have been so restricted as called for by said charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">Appellant sought to introduce substantially the same testimony as to the claimed insanity of Horvin Holland as was, introduced in, the trial of his case. The court excluded this testimony because, as stated by him in allowing appellant\u2019s bills on the subject, such testimony was immaterial, for appellant would have the same right to defend his brother if sane the same as he would if insane. Appellant did not present this question in his brief herein. The court\u2019s statement of why he excluded the testimony is correct, and still we think the testimony was admissible, for it might affect appellant\u2019s action in the killing\u2014he might act more quickly in \u2022 defending, if he did, an insane brother, if so, then of a sane brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">For the error above pointed out the judgment is reversed and. the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\"><em>Reversed and </em>remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
