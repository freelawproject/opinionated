There is no statement of facts. Appellant in no way at the time objected to the trial in the County Court, filed no plea to the jurisdiction or motion in any way questioning the jurisdiction of the County Court before trial. After his trial and conviction he then for the first time made a motion in arrest of judgment claiming the County Court did not have jurisdiction because the date of the election showing that prohibition was put in force as a misdemeanor was not alleged. His motion came too late and the court did not err in overruling it. This has been uniformly held by this court in a large number of cases. Garner v. State, 62 Texas Crim. Rep., 525; Hamilton v.
