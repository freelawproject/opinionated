B. Graham in violation of said law.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-13\">Appellant made no motion to quash the indictment, but after conviction he made a motion in arrest of judgment, and also at the trial,' when the order of the Commissioners Court declaring- prohibition had carried and prohibiting the \u2022 sale of intoxicating liquors in said county, was offered in evidence, he objected to it because the letter \u201ci\u201d in the middle of the word \u201cintoxicating\u201d first used in the indictment was omitted. The court did not err in overruling his motion in arrest of judgment, nor in admitting in evidence the said order of the Commissioners Court because of the omission of said letter in said word. The omission of this letter was wholly immaterial. It could in no way have misled the appellant nor in any way injured him; besides to take the allegations in the indictment as a whole they, without doubt, show that the omission of said'letter where indicated was completely supplied in the other allegations of the indictment. Johnson v. State, 4 Texas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>Crim. App., 268; Barrett v. State, 9 Texas Crim. App., 33; Hargrove v. State, 51 S. W. Rep., 1124; Luster v. State, 63 Texas Crim. Rep., 541; Somerville v. State, 6 Texas Crim. App., 433; Hudson v. State, 10 Texas Crim. App., 215, and cases therein cited; Bailey v. State, 63 Texas Crim. Rep., 584; Reyes v. State, 81 Texas Crim. Rep., 588, 196 S. W. Rep., 532.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Appellant has a hill which merely states that while appellant was on the stand testifying his attorney asked him this question: \u201cHow much family have you?\u201d The district attorney objected because that was immaterial, and the court sustained the objection. The bill states that if he had been permitted to testify he would have said that he had a wife and nine children. This is in substance the whole of the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">He has another bill which shows that while he was testifying he was asked: \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t get anything out of it?\u201d To which the district attorney objected because said testimony was immaterial, and the court sustained the objection. The bill states that defendant would have answered said question \u201cHo,\u201d if permitted to do so. This is in substance the bill in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">Each of these bills are so wholly defective as to preclude their consideration. James v. State, 63 Texas Crim. Rep., 75; Best v. State, 72 Texas Crim. Rep., 291; Lowe v. State, 206 S. W. Rep., 519, and the rules and authorities cited in these cases. But if either of these bills could be considered neither would show any error. It was wholly immaterial how much family appellant had. The appellant in his bill'in no way shows how this could have been material; nor in answer to the question in said second bill, does the bill show how his answer could have been material. It has all the time been held by this court that it was not necessary in a sale of intoxicating liquor for the seller to make any money out of it; in fact, he might lose money in making the sale; and it has also all the time been held that it would be wholly immaterial whether the intoxicating liquor belonged to the seller or not. He would be guilty of violating the law if he sold the liquor of someone else as well as if he had sold his own liquor. Besides, if we could go to the statement of facts it would show that he testified fully that the whisky was not his but belonged to a man by the name of Jones, and that while the purchaser at the time paid him two dollars for the whisky that he did not use it but later turned it over to Jones. <em>So </em>that in no event does either of his bills show any error.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">The record shows that appellant objected to this clause of the court\u2019s charge, towit: \u201cIn this connection you are further charged that it is immaterial who the real owner of the property may be, if the party charged with the sale is in possession of the property and exercising control over the same, and for a valuable consideration paid or promised to be paid by another, delivers the property to another, to be by such other person used and appropriated as his own, then in law the sale would be complete.\u201d \u2022 \"</p>\n<p id=\"b311-11\">.This charge lays down a correct legal proposition and was applicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>in this case. However, appellant took no bill of exceptions, presenting the matter, which was necessary. As appellant took no bill presenting the matter evidently he acquiesced' in the court\u2019s overruling his objections to the <em>charge.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
