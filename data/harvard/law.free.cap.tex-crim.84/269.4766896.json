P. C., provides that \u201cEvery railway company, street car company and interurban railway company,, lessee, manager, or receiver thereof doing business in this State as a common carrier of passengers for hire shall provide separate coaches or compartments, as hereinafter provided, for the accommodation of white and negro passengers, which separate coaches or compartments shall be equal in all points of comfort and convenience.\u201d Subdivision 5 of said article provides that: \u201cIf any passenger upon a train or street car or interurban car provided with separate coaches or compartments, as above-provided, shall ride in any coach or compartment not designated for his. race after having been forbidden to do so by the conductor in charge of the train, he shall he guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction shall be fined not less than five nor more than twenty-five dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">It will be observed from a reading of this statute, under which appellant was convicted, that there is no allegation in the complaint that, the interurban car was a common carrier of passengers for hire as required by the statute. It charges that appellant was upon an interurban car, hut does not charge that it was an interurban railway company. It does not allege the ownership; whether it was a- common carrier, or owned by an individual, nor does it allege that it was run as a common carrier of passengers for hire. The essential definition of this offense as found in the statute is not alleged. In order to \u2022 constitute a violation of that statute the necessary ingredients provided by the Legislature constituting the offense must be charged in the indictment, complaint or information. In order to constitute this offense the party must he a passenger, and the company must be a common carrier of passengers for hire. The complaint does not mention the name of the conductor who, it is stated, had forbidden appellant to ride on the interurban car. This, it seems under the authorities, is necessary. He was alleged to be the party in charge of the car, and his name should have been stated, and if not known, then it should have been stated that his name was unknown. This was decided in Daugherty v. State, 41 Texas Crim. Rep., 661.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>For the reasons indicated the judgment is reversed and the prosecution is ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
