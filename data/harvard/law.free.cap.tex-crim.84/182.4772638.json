Thomas and one Upchurch were together. Thomas testified that appellant handed him a hottle of whisky and that the witness gave appellant the money for it, that before he and Upchurch were able to drink any of it an officer\u201d took possession of it. Upchurch testified to substantially the same thing. Both of them identified the hottle of whisky, which was produced at the trial. The officer referred to also identified the whisky and testified that he did not see the money xiass hut saw the whisky pass.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Both counts in the indictment were submitted to the jury and a general verdict w\u00e1s rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">On a motion for new trial appellant produced the affidavits of the two witnesses Thomas and Upchurch to the effect that they were together at the time the whisky was purchased from appellant; that the money paid appellant belonged to Upchurch, who handed it to Thomas, and Thomas in his affidavit says that appellant approached him and Upchurch and asked them if they wanted to get something to drink, and receiving an affirmative answer the witness handed appellant $1.50 and he took a hottle of whisky out of his pocket and handed it to the witness. That the $1.50 had been given him hy Upchurch with which to buy some whisky. Upchurch\u2019s affidavit is substantially the same. Appellant, based on these affidavits, contends that this is newly discovered evidence and of such a material character as to require reversal in that it would appear therefrom that the sale was not made to Thomas, the person named in the indictment. It is not made to appear that the evidence was newly discovered; that is, it does not appear that the facts set out in the affidavits were unknown to appellant before the trial. Both of the witnesses making the affidavits testified on the trial. Bor do the facts set up in the affidavits sustain the contention that they would have produced a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">The transaction as detailed in the affidavits would sustain the allegations in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">The proposition that there is evidence that Thomas and Upchurch were military police and that the transaction was pursuant to their efforts to entrap bootleggers does not render the evidence insufficient upon the ground that they were accomplices. See Walker v. State, 73 S. W. Rep., 987; also Vernon\u2019s P. CL, p. 49. There is no complaint of failure to charge upon the law of accomplice\u2019s testimony and if that rule applied the testimony of the police officer furnished corroboration.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">Finding no errors in the record the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
