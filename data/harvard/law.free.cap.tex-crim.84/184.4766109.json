The court in his qualification says in substance that he did not sustain the objection to the testimony which would have resulted from an affirmative answer, but suggested to counsel the reframing of his question and that counsel acting upon this suggestion did develop all the facts. The hill says that the answer that was expected was'as follows: \u201cHe certainly is, mistaken, because I never hit or beat him at all, neither did Pedro Perez or Pancho Perez hit or beat him at all, and if he says that,v it is not true,\u201d It appears from the statement of fact that the witness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>to whom the appellant addressed the question was introduced hy the defendant and examined fully with reference to the various incidents of the transaction in which the-gaming took place and that he stated his version of the facts to which the inquiry wa's directed.</p>\n<p id=\"A0G\">\u2022There'are three propositions denominated \u201cassignments of error\u201d signed hy attorney for appellant hut not verified by the court, They present no matter that would require reversal and are not presented in a manner to raise any question for review.
