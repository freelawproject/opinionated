The evidence is fully sufficient to support the verdict of the jury. Appellant\u2019s theory of his case was self-defense. The jury, however, disregarded his view of it and found him guilty. We deem it unnecessary to review the facts. They would be of no practical utility to the bar and bench, and, therefore, the facts are not collated.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">The judgment will he affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-11\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
