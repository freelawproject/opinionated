We deem it unnecessary to state the testimony, but conclude, from a careful revision of the evidence, the jury was justified in reaching their conclusion. The house was burglarized and the property of the oivner taken. A short time after the burglary appellant was found in possession of the stolen goods, and pawned them. The evidence, we think, is sufficient to connect the appellant with the burglary under the authorities, and the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
