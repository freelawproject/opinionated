There is neither a statement of facts nor a bill of exceptions. The only question suggested in the motion for new trial is that the judgment is contrary to the law and the evidence, which, of course, can not be considered in the absence of a statement of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b286-8\">ON REHEARING.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">January 15, 1919.</p>\n<author id=\"b286-10\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"ANo\">This case is before the court on appellant\u2019s application for rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-11\">At a former time the case was affirmed, the only complaint being that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict, and there being then on file no statement of facts or bills of exception, as shown by the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-12\">In connection with this motion, for rehearing, appellant files a sworn statement from the cleric of the District Court at El Paso that a statement of facts was filed with him in time, and that it was his neglect in failing to send the same up to this court. The statement of facts is now on file in this court and has been duly considered before rendering this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-13\">As stated in the original opinion, the only contention of appellant is that the evidence is insufficient to support the conviction. Two witnesses testified positively to appellant\u2019s guilt. The testimony of one of them was attacked, and to some extent contradicted, by testimony introduced by the appellant. The evidence of the other witness is pointed and positive as to appellant\u2019s guilt, and this witness is in nowise impeached or contradicted except by the statement made by appellant\u2019s wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-14\">The question of the credibility of the witnesses is for the jury, and that issue having been decided in favor of the State, we do not feel that there is anything to show prejudice on the part of the jury or that they acted without due regard for the appellant\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-15\">The motion is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-16\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
