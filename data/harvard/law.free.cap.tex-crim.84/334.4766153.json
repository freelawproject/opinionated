The original must not be sent but kept on file in the lower-court. It is only in felony convictions that the original is authorized to be sent to this court instead of copied in the transcript.

There is what is endorsed as a statement of facts\u2014a separate paper\u2014but it is in no way approved by the trial judge. Besides the record shows that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>term of court at which the conviction occurred adjourned August 3rd. This document was not filed in the lower court until October 18, 1918. Hence for all these reasons if can not be considered by this court for any purpose. There is nothing presented which can be reviewed in the absence of a statement of facts. (McGee v. State, 78 Texas Crim. Rep., 638; Sorrell v. State, 79 Texas Crim. Rep., 453; 1 Branch\u2019s Ann. P.
