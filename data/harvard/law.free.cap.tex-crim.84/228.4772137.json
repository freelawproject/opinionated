Replying to further questions they each stated that the opinion that they had in their minds at the time was unfavorable to the defendant and that it would require evidence to remove it. The court then asked the jurors: \u201cIf selected as jurors to try this cause, can you lay aside the opinion you now have as to the guilt or innocence of the defendant and try this cause solely upon the evidence introduced upon this trial under ruling of the court, and be governed by the law given you in charge by the court?\u201d To which they each gave an affirmative answer. The jurors were challenged for cause; the challenge overruled. The appellant exhausted his remaining peremptory challenges in disposing of them and the bill says that he was compelled to and did accept other jurors, naming them, who were objectionable, stating the reasons. It further appears from the bill that each of the jurors challenged for cause had talked to the person who was named in the indictment as the owner of the automobile who testified in the case and was the prosecuting witness. They had heard him talk of the facts of the case, but as stated in the explanation, not the details.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-14\">Subdivision <em>13 </em>of article 692, C. C. P., declares that one having formed from hearsay or otherwise in his mind such a conclusion as to the guilt or innocence of the defendant as will influence his action in finding a verdict is disqualified. The statute further says: \u201cFor the purpose of ascertaining whether this cause of challenge exists, the juror <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>shall first he asked whether, in his opinion, the conclusions so established will influence his verdict. If he answers in the affirmative, he \u2022shall he discharged; if he answers in the negative, he shall be further examined by the court, or under his direction, as to how his conclusion was formed, and the extent to which it will affect his action.\u201d This \u25a0statute has been, in substance, as stated above for many years. It was amended in 1885 and again in 1903 and 1905. The amendments add to the statute the following: \u201cIf it appears to have been formed from reading newspaper accounts, communications, statements or reports or mere rumor or hearsay, and, if the juror states on oath that he feels able, notwithstanding such opinion, to render an impartial verdict upon the law and the evidence the court, if satisfied that he is impartial, and will render such verdict, may, in its discretion, admit him as competent to serve in such case.\u201d This statute as construed by the decisions of this court makes a distinction between the conclusions which \u2022are formed by the jurors upon information received from witnesses and those which are formed upon rumors or information received from hearsay. Keaton v. State, 40 Texas Crim. Rep., 139; Trotter v. State, 37 Texas Crim. Rep., 468. It is said by Mr. Branch in his Ann. P. C., p. 285: \u201cA juror who has formed an opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the defendant from talking with one or more of the material witnesses in the case is subject to challenge for cause although the juror states that such opinion will not influence his verdict.\u201d Citing cases above quoted. Also Ward v. State, 19 Texas Grim. App., 664; Quinn v. State, 51 Texas Crim. Rep., 155. See also Slack v. State, 67 Texas Crim. Rep., 460, 149 S. W. Rep., 107. \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">While the hill is not clear upon the subject, as it should be, it does show that the jurors had each been talked to about the case by Welsh, the prosecuting witness, the man whose property was charged to have been stolen. There is no suggestion that they reached the conclusion they had formed from any other source and we think from a fair interpretation of the bill, it appears that the witness mentioned was the source of the information or knowledge upon which they based their conclusion unfavorable to the appellant. We think that the ruling which overruled appellant\u2019s challenge of the jurors who had formed this opinion for cause resulting in the necessity of his exhausting his remaining peremptory challenges upon them and having fqrced upon him objectionable jurors was a transgression of the law entitling the accused to a trial by an impartial jury, which renders it necessary to order a reversal of the judgment, which is accordingly done.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
