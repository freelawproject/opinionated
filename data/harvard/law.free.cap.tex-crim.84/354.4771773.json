We don\u2019t understand\u2014I don\u2019t know what the purpose of the testimony is for, unless it is for impeachment purposes, and certainly is no predicate here that would justify an impeachment of his own witness.\u201d Whereupon the court instructed the sheriff to retire the jury, and the jury left the box in charge of the sheriff. \u201cYou may read the statement to the witness; now pay attention to it.\u201d And the district attorney immediately began reading to the prosecutrix a statement purporting to have been made by her in a court of inquiry as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-6\">\u201cThe State of Texas, County of Potter. Be it remembered that on this the 9th day of July, 1917, an examining court of inquiry was duly organized, with C. G. Landis, justice of the peace, precinct Ho. 1, Potter County, Texas, presiding, and W. M. Burwell, sheriff, being present, and the proceedings were conducted by the State through her district attorney, E. T.

I was thirteen on the 3rd day of January, A. D. 1917. I live in Amarillo, Potter County, Texas, at Ho. 1607 Buchanan Street. My father\u2019s name is W. F. Fincher. My mother\u2019s name is Deamon Fincher. I was in Amarillo on Saturday night, July 7, 1917. I left home that evening on the 8:15 car, and left town at 8:30 p. m.\u2019 \u201d At which point, in the proceedings had in this cause the defendant objected to the retirement of the jury in the following language:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-8\">Mr. Mood (counsel for defendant): \u201cMr. Miller, just a moment.

I went to the Deandi Theater. We stayed until after the vaude<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>ville performance, and then Irene Tucker and Mr. Gray drove up in front of the Deandi and asked us if we did not want to ride around. Nobody went with me to the show. I was by myself when I came out. After getting into the car we drove around up town with Irene Tucker and Mr. Gray and myself in the car, we drove around until time for sister to get off from work. It was 11 o\u2019clock p. m. when we got my sister Mabel. I was still with Irene and Mr. Gray in the car. It was a Ford car, and we three were all that were in the car at that time. My sister Mabel then, got into the car. The sailor boy and Mabel got into the car, and we all went around to the Deandi and got Billie Wilson. He got into the car with us at the Deandi Theater. After that we just drove around in the business part of town. We did not ride very long; we drove a while and then went to the Santa Fe depot to get some sandwiches; but we did not get any. While we were at the Santa Fe depot Buzz Venable drove up. He, Buzz Venable, called me, Ola Fincher, out to the car. He said to me, \u2018Ditch the boys; let\u2019s us, your sis, and Irene go riding.\u2019 I said, \u2018No, I won\u2019t do it.\u2019 So we all started up in the Ford again and drove out the Herring loop and back, and Buzz and Eosenberg followed us around. He drove up by our car and said to me, \u2018Meet us at the Golding drug store in ten minutes.\u2019 That was about 11:30 p. m. I did not say anything to him. We drove back out by the Sanitarium, and we turned around, and the driver, Mr. Gray, got mad at us. He had heard Buzz say \u2018Meet us at the Golding Drug.\u2019 He said, T will just put you out there\u2019; and he put us out at the Golding Drug. All of we girls and Mr. Wilson got out at the Golding Drug. After we got out at the Golding Drug we started to walk home, and Buzz and Von Eosenberg drove up about the Methodist Church, and we got in the car. Mr. Wilson, Mabel, Irene and I all got into the car with Buzz and Von Eosenberg. After we .got in the car we drove out east of town; we went out by Herring\u2019s, nearly to Canyon, Texas. We got off of the Canyon road, and went away west. I don\u2019t know just where. We rode, about two or three hours out that way, and then we came back to town. We were out here in San Jacinto, and they got out to see how much gasoline we had. They found that it had run nearly empty; then we came up to the oil station on Taylor Street, Pierce-Fordvcc filling station, and we got some gas and filled up the tank. We then went and took Mr. Wilson around to the Texan, the. hotel where he stays. That left Mabel, Buzz, Von Eosenberg, Irene, and myself in the car. We then rode around up Polk Street, and then we went on home. Mabel and I both started to get out. Mabel got out, and Irene said, \u2018You are not going to leave me with both of the boys by myself ?\u2019 Mabel says, \u2018I have to go to work in the morning, and I know that I am not going to stay with you\u2019; and I said, T am not going to stay with you\u2019; and when I started to get out she pulled me back, and Irene said, T wouldn\u2019t go home for $100.\u2019 Sis said, T will tell mother that you stayed all night with Slim.\u2019 Slim is Effie Eose. I knew that her first name is Effie. I think her last name is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Rose. They drove up, and we started on, Buzz, Yon Rosenberg, Irene and myself. We drove out by Glenwood park, we went on past it, and then turned east down that public road. The public road is a quarter of a mile south of the park. We went east a long way; I don\u2019t know how far; it was about three miles east down the road. They stopped the car down there east somewhere, and Buzz was asleep, with his head in my lap* and his feet was in the other part of the car; we were on the back seat. Irene and Yon Rosenberg were on the front seat. It was then that Yon Rosenberg had intercourse with Irene there on the front seat of the car. Irene was lying down across the front seat of the car, on her back, and Yon Rosenberg was lying on top of her, with his face toward her face. I went to sleep, and when I woke up he was going up and down on her. That was before we went south. When I woke up he started to drive the car, and he drove south, and we went in that direction about a mile. They then stopped the car again. They stopped by a haystack; the haystack was just inside the fence. I mean Yon Rosenberg and Irene went to the haystack. Before Yon Rosenberg and Irene went to the haystack, Buzz Yenable had his hand on my person up under my dress. They went to the haystack. Buzz kept asking me to have intercourse with him, and I told him, \u2018Ho,\u2019 I was sick. He kept on, and pushed me over in the back seat of the car. After he pushed me over, he pulled up my dress. He took his pants clear down. After he took his pants down, he had intercourse with me. I know what intercourse is. Ho officer of the court has told me what \u2018intercourse\u2019 is. I know what intercourse means. Intercourse means when a man takes his penis and puts it into the private parts of a woman. I know what you mean when you say private female organ. He took his penis and put it in my private female organ. His male organ penetrated my female organ. After he had penetrated my female organ, his body went up and down, and I could feel his male organ within my private female organ. I could feel his organ inside of me. He went up and down on me a short time; that is, from one to two minutes, I would think. [He then] got off of me. I was in the hack seat lying down, and he was on top of me, between my legs. It hurt me some when his penis entered my female organ. I suffered some pain from the act. I told him that it hurt me. The hurt was the greatest at the opening of my female organs. I told him that it was hurting me, and he got up; however, his male member went clear on into the inside of my female organ. He then got up. We -got up and walked out to the barbed wire fence. We looked over the barb wire fence, and Yon Rosenberg was on top of Irene; she was lying on her back.. I could see her naked white limbs. Yon Rosenberg was on top, going up and down. It was just a few feet away. Probably about twenty feet away. I saw a car coming, and I said, \u2018Come on quick!\u2019 They jumped up and got in the car, and we turned around and passed the car at a rate of about fifty miles per hour; then we went to Cliffside. We came to town and stopped at the post-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>office. Buzz and Yon Bosenberg went up in the St. Charles Apartments. They brought out one quilt. They got in the car, and we came around to the Merchants\u2019 Cafe on Taylor Street and got some sandwiches. We girls did not get out of the car. We then went out past Cliffside to the bridge across Amarillo Creek; it was about 5 o\u2019clock in the morning when we got out there. Just before we got to Cliffside, Buzz wanted Irene to get up in the seat with him, and she got back there with Buzz, and I got up in front with Yon Bosenberg. We rode that way until \u25a0we got about two miles beyond Cliffside, and Yon Bose'nberg put the quilt down on the ground under a shade tree, and the car was about twenty feet away. Yon Bosenberg said to me to come out there and sit with him on the quilt, and I did so. Buzz and Irene stayed in the car. They did not do anything for about fifteen minutes. Irene lay down on her back, and Buzz got on top of her, and they were going up arid down; that is, Buzz was going up and down on Irene. He was on Irene about five minutes. After they finished, Buzz got up and pulled up his pants and- buttoned them up. I did see them. There was nothing to obstruct my view in seeing them have the act of intercourse. I did not have intercourse with Yon Bosenberg. We did not stay out there very much longer. We drove on out west-after that. The reason we left was that we saw a car coming, and that car passed us. Louis Finklea and .Mollie Carder passed by us. I did not hide. They passed us in a hurry. We stopped at a gate, drove into the field, and then we turned around and came back out of the field. We did not stop in the field. We came on back to town. Buzz gave Irene $3 and told us to go to a hotel. I said, 'I do not want to go to a hotel; I want to go home\u2019; but Irene said that she was not going home, and would not let me leave her, so we went to the Cobb Hotel, 301 North Taylor Street, in Amarillo. They left us there. We stayed from that morning till about 4 o\u2019clock p. m., when I called Mabel, and told her to come on over there. I said that I was going home, and I went on home with Mabel. Irene said, 'No, don\u2019t go home and leave me here\u2019; and I said, 'The best thing for you to do is to go home, too.\u2019 .But she did not go home. We left her there, and I have not seen her since. .This is the 9th day of July, 1917, and I am well now, and I am not side. I took my cloth off this morning. I think that the cloth is burned up. I am not sure \"that it has been burned. None of my clothing have any blood on them. My sickness came on me last Friday morning. Mr. Mood'called up this morning, and my mother said that she did not want anything done about this matter. He called her over the telephone. All that I have told here is the truth. I have told it willingly. I have told what has happened without being scared, and not in response to set questions asked. You have only asked me for the truth, Ola Fincher.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-4\">\"The cloth that I used was a white, cotton cloth; it did not have much blood on it.

To all of which proceedings so had as above set out the defendant then and there in open court duly excepted, and here now tenders this his bill of exception No. 1, and prays that the same be approved, ordered filed and made a part of the record herein, which is accordingly done, and the above bill of exceptions is prepared largely in verbatim form; the court being of the opinion that such questions and answers are necessary in order to elucidate the facts and questions involved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"413\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-5\">The foregoing bill is approved with the following qualifications: The witness Ola Fincher had not testified fully with reference to the automobile trip and had not been directly interrogated as to an act of sexual intercourse between her and the defendant, but she was answering questions leading up to the main issues in a way which clearly indicated her leaning'towards the defendant, which she admitted in the trial of the case. She was very much opposed to the prosecution, and admitted on the stand that she did not want the defendant punished. The atmosphere of the trial at that stage of the trial was the most unusual. The defendant was at that time, and at all times until the retirement of the jury, and for the most part after the retirement of the jury, making signs, gestures, and nodding his head, and he was constantly looking at the witness, as if he considered himself possessed of some occult power over her, reminding gme of a cat undertaking to charm a bird, and at one time I had to ask the witness why she looked at the defendant before answering. The district attorney was undertaking to have the witness testify concerning matters which would have been wholly irrelevant and immaterial, except for the purpose of showing the jury the kind of witness before them, in order to enable them to pass upon her credibility and to test her memory, when he said: \u201cDo you remember Mr. Ritchey, the county attorney at Clarendon?\u201d She said that she did not, and he asked'her if she remembered telling the grand jury of. Donley County something, which she answered in the affirmative. She was then asked if that was the truth, when counsel for defendant objected because it was improper, irrelevant, immaterial, and prejudicial. The court then said, \u201cMr. Sheriff, I wish you would-retire the jury a few minutes.\u201d Then the transcript of the testimony taken before the court of inquiry was exhibited to the witness, and she was examined quite at length by the district attorney, court, and the district attorney\u2019s law partner, who was assisting gin the prosecution. The circumstances of the trial as developed convinced the judge beyond all question that the witness, who was a thirteen-year-old girl, was under the influence of some person. There were two young girls, the defendant and another, involved in the transaction, and the witness was one of the girls. One of the young girls and her mother had gone from the State and were beyond the jurisdiction of the court before subpoenas could be served; and it developed that both the young girls, their mothers and fathers were unfriendly to the prosecution, and were doing everything <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>within their power to prevent a prosecution. The witness Ola Fincher answered promptly the questions propounded hy defendant\u2019s counsel, but was neither prompt nor truthful, in the opinion of the judge, in answering questions propounded by State\u2019s counsel. Her attitude was so contemptuous that \u00a1the court remanded her to the custody of the sheriff, who kept her at his home over night, and under these circumstances, and with such influences working, the judge of this court felt and still feels that it was proper to protect the court\u2019s jurisdiction, and that it would not have been protected if the defendant and his counsel had then had the opportunity of discussing the case with her. In my opinion the slightest encouragement which might have been possible from the mere fact that counsel for defendant he accorded the right at that stage of the proceedings to discuss the -matter with her would in the opinion of the judge have thwarted the purpose of the law, to compel witnesses to respect their oath and testify truthfully to facts within their knowledge. But before the cross-examination of the witness the court did inform defendant\u2019s counsel that it was their privilege now to talk with the witness, and they availed themselves of the opportunity ; the court taking a recess and giving them the opportunity, and the jury not knowing the purpose for which the recess was taken. The statement taken before the court of inquiry is shown in bill of exception Ho. 1, and in addition to this the defendant introduced in evidence a statement given by the witness at his instance, which is shown in the statement of facts at page 64.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"414\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ASu\">The jury would have had no reason for knowing what was transpiring in their absence, in my opinion, and I am not aware, and have not been informed, that they did know what was transpiring in their absence, and when they returned into court the judge merely said to'the witness Ola Fincher, \u201cDo you feel well enough or able now to testify ?\u201d and she answered that she didn\u2019t feel so very good, and the district attorney then began propounding questions to her. Hothing was mentioned in the direct examination by the district attorney relative to what had transpired in the absence of the jury, and when defendant\u2019s counsel began cross-examining her they undertook to and did develop what they considered important to them pertaining to the proceedings had in the absence of the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"415\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-4\">Contempt proceedings against the defendant were initiated after the trial, and while the court had no doubt, and so stated to the defendant, of his 'guilt, yet the defendant broke down in that proceeding, and with tears in his eyes said that he did not intend any contempt of court hy the signs he was making, and did not know he was doing anything in the trial to bring himself in contempt, and he was a young man about twenty-one years of age, so he was discharged for the reason that it was thought best that the court under those circumstances might perhaps he merciful without injury to the defendant, or the court\u2019s dignity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"416\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b401-5\">Htjgh L.

The length of this bill is explained on the theory that the matter could not be made manifest to this court except by setting out all of the matters as they occurred with reference to the prosecuting witness. Before being asked with reference to the facts of the alleged rape, the district attorney and his associate were permitted to examine and cross-examine her mainly in the absence of the jury with reference to her testimony given before a court of inquiry. The court in his qualification of the bill anticipated that she would not testify on the trial before the jury as she had done before the court of inquiry, and also as it was claimed she did before a grand jury in Donley County. The examination was rigid. The girl stated while being examined that her testimony before the court of inquiry was not true, and that she had been frightened into making it by the prosecuting officers and other officers who were present, and that the parties who took down the statement wrote many things into the statement which she did not state and which were not true, and that she was badly frightened. This examination on the final trial lasted for a part of two days, if not nearly all of two days. She was threatened with prosecution for perjury, and was reminded of the fact by the court that he had power to inflict the. death penalty, and that he had just sent one woman to the penitentiary for twenty years, and that the prosecuting witness herself could be sent for perjury, and the district attorney in her presence threatened to prepare a charge of perjury against her. The court acted upon the theory that she was not telling the truth if she. failed or refused to repeat her' testimony as given before the court of' inquiry, and that he had authority as a court to require her to testify before the jury as she had testified before the court of inquiry. After committing her to custody over. night and the subsequent threat to send her to jail she testified in accordance with their wishes, but before and after so stating she denied the truth of it. She made statements to her mother directly after the examination by the' court of inquiry, that she had been threatened in making her statement, and that they were not true, and was chided by her mother for telling a story. She stated they had \u201cscared\u201d her. She also made another statement which is shown in the record under oath denying appellant\u2019s guilt, or that he had had intercourse with her. The testimony introduced by the defendant strongly supports the theory that he had not' had inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>course with her. It is uncontroverted both by prosecutrix and her mother that she had her monthly sickness,\u2014menstrual discharge, and \u201cwas flooding at the time\u201d of the alleged occurrence, and her \u201cwrappings\u201d were not disturbed. The city jailer and county jailer also testified to the fact that appellant was almost immediately arrested; that the clothing worn by appellant on the night of the supposed rape had not been changed at the time of his arrest, and had no blood upon them, which would have occurred had he had intercourse with the girl under the circumstances. These matters are briefly 'stated. The reporter will include in the report of the case a full and complete copy of the bill of exceptions. A reversal of the judgment, however, is based upon the action and conduct of the court, and the district attorney and prosecuting officer, and the conduct of the sheriff as well as the examination of the, girl indicating that she was compelled to testify under threats and coercion. A discussion of the case is not further indulged as it is a case so nearly within Hamilton v. State, 68 Texas Crim. Rep., 419, it is unnecessary. The facts are similar, and the conduct in connection with this witness analogous to that in the Hamilton ease. That case was reversed and for the same reason this judgment is ordered reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"421\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b403-7\">PRENDERGAST, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AKm\">(dissenting).\u2014Appellant, a young man twenty-one years old, was convicted of the rape of Ola Fincher, a girl just over thirteen and one-half years of age. His punishment was assessed at five years in the penitentiary\u2014the lowest prescribed by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">Appellant\u2019s sole complaint was to the action of the court in his endeavor to have the witness Ola Fincher to testify to the \u201ctruth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth\u201d as she had sworn to do. No complaint was made of anything which occurred before the jury. All that which was complained of was before the court only, while the jury was retired in the custody of a proper officer. The jury did not hear and were not aware at the time, of anything which occurred with reference to said witness while before the court alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">His two bills on this matter are very lengthy, more than forty typewritten pages. They contain the stenographer\u2019s verbatim report of all that was said and done to, and by, the witness in this examination of her in the absence of the jury. It is out of the question to give them in full in this opinion. The judge qualified each of them before approving them, in a lengthy qualification. The qualification was in accordance with, and borne out by, the record and facts. Appellant accepted the bills as qualified and under all the authorities is. bound thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">In no instance when he made an objection, or took an exception was any reason or cause assigned for his mere objection or exception. After stating in full in his bills all that was said and done, he says: \u201cTo all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>\u00f3f which proceedings so had as above set out, the defendant then and there in open court duly excepted.\u201d Ho reason or ground of exception is in any way stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-3\">The facts of. the case as shown by the record, together with the substance of the bills and the qualification thereof will be given. In connection therewith, the law applicable thereto will be stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Each witness before testifying must and does solemnly swear that the testimony he gives in the cause pending before the court \u201cshall be the truth, the whole truth -and nothing but the truth, so help me God.\u201d (Sec. 988, White\u2019s Ann. C. C. P.) This witness took that oath. The trial judge in this instance, as this record unquestionably shows, undertook in a proper way to have her comply with her oath. He did nothing more than that.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">This court, through Presiding Judge White, in Cox v. State, 8 Texas Crim. App., 254, said: \u201cTrue, a judge, technically speaking, may not be a representative of the State in prosecuting parties charged with crime; but he is nevertheless an officer of the State charged with the high and responsible duty of seeing that the law is faithfully administered. . . . Holding the \u2018scales of justice equally balanced,\u2019 and supposed to be far removed from the influences of interest, prejudice, and passion, he is expected to guard with equal jealousy the respective rights both of the State and the accused.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Our Supreme Court in Waters-Pierce Oil Co. v. State, 106 S. W. Rep., 326, held and quoted 8 Am. &amp; Eng. Encv. of Law, 28: \u201cEvery regularly constituted court has inherent power to do all things that are reasonably necessary for the administration of justice within the scope of its jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">In Holdman v. Mayor, 34 Texas, 668, it is said: \u201cThe refusal of a witness to answer a legal and proper question is a decided contempt; and no matter in what respectful terms or deference of manner the refusal is made, he stands out against the authority of the court. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">In 3 Ency of Ev., p. 494, it is said: \u201cA prevarication or an evasive answer on the part of a witness is considered equivalent to the refusal of the witness to testify.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">On page 485 it is said: \u201cWhen before the court a witness may be compelled to answer any lawful question. . . .\u201d And again on page 475 it is said: \u201cThe power to compel a witness to answer lawful questions is inherent to all courts of record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-11\">In 1 Thompson on Trials, section 354, it is said: \u201cThe manner of examining a witness is largely within the discretion of the court before whom the witness is produced, and that discretion must be governed in a great measure by the knowledge of the character of the witness a.nd from his demeanor during his- examination.\u201d In section 355 it is said: \u201cA judge presiding upon the trial of the case is more than a mere moderator between contending parties. He is charged with the grave duty of maintaining truth and preventing wrong and to this end <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>has a large discretion which, if exercised without abuse, will not be error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-3\">In 5 Jones on Ev., section 800, it is said: \u201cContempt of court involves two ideas\u2014disregard of the power of the court and disregard of its authority. /Disregard of power, in that lawful orders have not been obeyed: and disregard of authority, in that its jurisdiction to declare the law and ascertain and adjudicate rights of the parties is hindered, prevented or set at naught. Such conduct is an offense against the court as an organ of public justice, and may be rightfully punished on summary conviction/ . . . It is enough if the witness\u2019 conduct tends to bring the authority of the law and of the court engaged in the administration of the law into disrespect or disregard. It has never been doubted that a refusal to testify on the part of a witness or to give evidence on relevant questions is contempt. And the matter is not mended by a refusal obviously wilful to give intelligent, connected and reasonable answers to questions fairly calling for the same.\u201d Again: \u201cThe witness may not trifle with the court by pretending nominally to answer, but in reality <em>to </em>cloak a refusal. Prevarication by a witness has the same effect upon the administration of justice as a refusal to answer. To the same effect it puts the witness in the position of standing out against the authority of the court, and thwarts the court in its efforts and purpose of doing justice between the parties. It is contumacy. It is direct contempt of the authority of the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AvK\">In this instance the witness Ola Fincher was quite an intelligent girl, just past thirteen and one-half years of age and in the seventh grade in the public schools. On the night of July 7th appellant and another young man, Wesley Yon Kosenberg, picked up on the streets of Amarillo, when they were going to their homes, said Ola and another young girl about fourteen years old, Irene Tucker, in their automobile, took them out in the country several miles and kept them until just about daylight the next morning, when they took them back to Amarillo, put them in a hotel, where they remained until about 9 o\u2019clock that day, when they went to their homes. Yery soon thereafter, the Tucker girl, with her mother, before she could be subpoenaed, was run, or ran, out of this State and then took up their abode in another State. The State could not obtain her as a witness in this trial. Ola and her father and mother were very much opposed to the prosecution of appellant, and she admitted on the stand that she did not want him punished. She and her mother and father were very hostile to the State, and both of said girls and their fathers and mothers were unfriendly to the prosecution and were doing everything within their power to prevent a prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">The next day, after Ola returned to her home and before she had talked the matter over with anyone, and before she had been \u201cfixed\u201d or tampered with by anyone, the district attorney, county attorney and sheriff heard of the matter, and the sheriff took her, it seems with the consent of her parents, to the courthouse in Amarillo before the justice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>of the peace and there was had an examining trial, to find out the facts-as to what said young men had done to said two young girls when they had them out all night on the night of July 7th. Ola was duly sworn by the justice of the peace. She testified fully. Her testimony was taken down in writing, and she signed it and swore to it before the justice of the peace.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-3\">In this proceeding before the district judge, in the absence of the jury, her written, signed and sworn testimony before the justice of the peace was produced and exhibited to her. She admitted that she had signed and sworn to it. She then read it over herself. It was also then read over to her by the district attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">In this sworn testimony she stated her age, residence, the time she-had gone to town on the night of July 7th, all she did, the places she-went, with whom she was and a good deal of detail at that time unnecessary to state <em>here; </em>and then she told of appellant and Von Bosenberg picking her and Irene up in their automobile and taking them out into the country, telling the road they went, where they stopped, about how long they stayed there, when they returned and all about it. Therein she swore that Yon Bosenberg and Irene sat on' the front seat- and she and appellant on the back seat in the car. That they went out some miles when the car was stopped. That when they first stopped appellant was asleep with his head in her lap, but she woke him up. She swore: \u201cIt was then when Yon Bosenberg had intercourse with Irene there on the front seat of the car. Irene was lying down across the front of the seat on her back and Yon Bosenberg was lying on top of her with his face towards her face, ... he was going up and dowh on her.\u201d That they then drove the car to another point about a mile and stopped again 'by a haystack, and that Yon Bosenberg and Irene went to the haystack. She swore: \u201cBefore Yon Bosenberg and Irene went to the haystack, Buzz (appellant) Yenable had his hand on my person up under my dress. They went to the haystack. Buzz (appellant) kept asking me to have intercourse with him and I told him,, no, I was sick. He kept on and pushed me over in the back seat of the car. After he pushed me over he pulled up my dress. He took his pants clear down. After he took his pants down he had intercourse with me. I know what intercourse is. Ho officer of the court has told me what \u2018intercourse is/ I know what intercourse means. Intercourse-means when a man takes his penis and puts it into the private parts of a woman. I know what you mean when you say private female organs. He took his penis and put it in my private female organ. His male organ penetrated my female organ. After he had penetrated my female org\u00e1n his body went up and down and I could feel his male organ within my private female organ. I could feel his organ inside of me. He went up and down on me a short time; that is, from one to-two minutes, I would think. The get (He then) got off of me. I was in the back seat lying down and he was on top of me, between my legs. It hurt me some when his penis entered my female organ. I suffered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>some pain from the act. I told him that it hurt me. The hurt was the greatest at the opening of my female organ. I told him that it was hurting me and he got up; however, his male member went clear on into the inside of my female organ. He then got up. We got up and walked out to the barbed wire fence. We looked over the barb wire fence and Von Eosenberg was on top of Irene, she was lying on her back. I could see her naked white limbs. Von Eosenberg was on top going up and down. It was just a few feet away. Probably about twenty feet away. I saw a car coming and I said, \u2018Come on quick/ They jumped up and got in the car and we turned around and passed the car at a rate of about fifty miles per hour.\u201d She' further testified, where they then went, where they stopped and that the two men got, a quilt and then they went back out into the country to Cliffside. She-swore: \u201cJust before we got to Cliffside Buzz (appellant) wanted Irene: to get up in the scat with him and she got back there with Buzz and 1 got up in front with Von Eosenberg. We rode that way until we got; about two miles beyond Cliffside and Von Eosenberg put the quilt downt on the ground under a shade tree, and the car was about twenty feet, away. Von Eosenberg said to me to come out there and sit with him. on the quilt and I did so. Buzz and Irene stayed in the car. They did not- do anything for about fifteen minutes. Irene lay down on her back and Buzz got on top of her and they were going up and down, that is, Buzz was going up and down on Irene. He was on Irene about five-minutes. After they' finished Buzz got up and pulled up his pants and. buttoned them up. I did-see them. There was nothing to obstruct, my view in seeing them have the act of intercourse.\u201d She denied having intercourse with Von Eosenberg and swore they did not stay out there very much longer but went back into Amarillo. That appellant gave Irene $2 and told them to go to the hotel, which they did. She further testified that her monthlies came on the Friday morning before. That she was well on Monday morning and took her cloth off that morning. That none of her clothes had blood on them. That the cloth was a white cotton cloth and did not have much blood on it, but at the time she testified it had been burned. She swore: \u201cAll that I have told here is the truth. I have told it willingly. I have told what has happened without being scared and not in response to set questions asked.. You have only asked me for the truth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">The bills and'the qualification thereof show further that when the-State put the witness Ola Fincher on the stand that she testified to. some of the preliminary facts leading up to where these four parties; went, what they did and said until they led nearly up to the material', fact of whether or not appellant had had sexual intercourse with her-that night, but had not asked her as to that fact. The court says in his qualification that at this- time \u201cShe was answering questions leading up to the main issues in a way which clearly indicated her leaning towards the defendant and which she admitted in the trial of the case. She was very much opposed to the prosecution and admitted on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>stand that she did not want the defendant punished. The atmosphere of' the trial at that stage of the trial was the most unusual. The defendant was at that time and at all times until the retirement of the jury, and for the most part after the retirement of the jury, making signs, gestures and nodding his head \u00bfnd he was constantly looking at the witness as if he considered himself possessed of some occult power over her, reminding me of a cat undertaking to charm a bird, and at one time I had to ask the witness why she looked at the defendant before answering.\u201d -The court further said that the district attorney was asking these preliminary questions which would have been irrelevant and immaterial except for the purpose of showing the jury the kind of witness she was in order to enable them to pass upon her credibility and to test her memory, when he asked her: \u201cDo you remember Mr. Bichey, the county attorney, at Clarendon ?\u201d She said that she did not and he asked her if she remembered telling the grand jury of Donley County something, which she answered in- the affirmative. (The grand jury of Donley preferred the indictment herein.) She was then asked if that was the truth, when counsel for defendant objected because it was improper, irrelevant, immaterial and prejudicial; the court then said: \u201cMr. Sheriff, I wish you would retire the jury a few minutes.\u201d The jury did then retire out of the hearing of the court in charge of an officer. The appellant\u2019s attorney then said: \u201cYour honor, we want a bill of exceptions to your honor\u2019s retiring the jury.\u201d The court: \u201cWhy, sure, that is all right, you can have your bill.\u201d Nothing further appears in the bill as to why appellant objected to the retiring of the jury. No reason for the objection is given and none is suggested.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-3\">The bill and record further show that after the jury retired the district attorney began examining the witness about her said sworn testimony in the examining trial before the justice of the peace. He read the whole of it to her. He asked her questions about her said sworn testimony which showed that she testified that on the morning of July 9th the sheriff went to her residence and took her to the courthouse when she appeared before the justice of the peace and gave that written, signed, sworn testimony. The whole trend of questions to her shows that the State\u2019s attorney and the court dealt with her in the most considerate way and gentlest manner, endeavoring, and only endeavoring, to get her to testify to the truth, and only to the truth, whatever it might be. She tried every way she could to avoid testifying to what she had so testified, signed and sworn to. She claimed not to remember some of the statements therein which she had signed and sworn to. The court then admonished her not to try to dodge around in her testimony and this \u201cdon\u2019t remember\u201d business, and asked her if she had heard that it was an offense against the law to commit perjury. She said she did not know what he meant by that. He then explained it to her and told her that she could be punished for violating this law, and that it was a violation of the law for her not to tell the truth; that all he wanted her to do was to go on and tell the truth whatever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>it might be. Then the examination of her by the district attorney proceeded with the same result from her as theretofore. The district attorney then asked her if she knew what the penalty was for swearing a falsehood. She said she did not understand what that meant. The court then read the perjury statute to her and stated the penalty and asked her if she knew there was a' woman in jail at Amarillo, convicted and sent to the penit\u00e9ntiary for twenty years. She answered, \u201cNo, sir.\u201d . Appellant\u2019s attorney then said: \u201cWe desire to take a bill of exception.\u201d The court replied: \u201cYou understand that you will get a full bill.\u201d Another of appellant\u2019s attorneys said: \u201cI understand that your honor was going to give us a full bill.\u201d The court: \u201cCertainly, if you get any advantage out of this just go to it.\u201d Attorney: \u201cWell, we take an exception to that.\u201d The court: \u201cCertainly, you have got an exception to everything.\u201d No reason or ground is stated why they made these objections at this time. The examination of the witness proceeded for a while and then the district attorney said to her: \u201cOla, you -can either testify to the truth of the transaction or I will be perfectly frank with you, or be indicted for perjury. Now you can just go either route you want to go, now I want to give you a fair show and warning.\u201d One of appellant\u2019s attorneys then said: \u201cWe take a bill to that.\" And' the court replied he would get his bill to everything. No reason is assigned why he said he would \u201ctake a bill to that.\u201d The examination of the witness proceeded as before. The indictment herein was preferred by the grand jury of Donley County on July 30th. The district attorney then asked her if she did not tell the grand jury of Donley County, after being duly sworn, that her said testimony before the examining court was the truth. -(Her sworn testimony taken before the examining court in connection with her then oral testimony, was used before the grand jury.) She answered that she did and'that she told them that appellant had had sexual intercourse with her as stated therein, but when then asked if that was not the truth she said, \u201cNo, sir.\u201d The examination still proceeded along the same lines. When the district attorney failed to get her to testify what he believed was the truth and what her -sworn testimony before the justice of the peace showed to be the truth, he announced to the court that he would file a complaint against her. \u2022 The court thereupon suggested that another one of the attorneys for the State should examine her. And he did so at some length in the same considerate and gentlest manner, with a like result, she then claiming that she did riot know what certain words in her said testimony meant. The court thereupon examined her and asked her to point out to him what words in it she did not understand. And her written testimony was then handed to her. She read the first page and stated upon inquiry of the court if she found anything on the first page she did not understand, that she did not. She then read on and she pointed out the word \u201cintercourse\u201d to the judge as one word she did not understand; and then another, \u201cpenetrated\u201d' and then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>another, \"penis\u201d; and another, \"female organ\u201d; and then she told him she understood all the rest. The examination in this same manner proceeded for some time. She was asked many times her understanding of these words and her answers and manner indicated that she was prevaricating, that she did know what these words meant, each and every one of them. Clearly, when the court and the attorneys could not induce her to swear what they believed was the truth about the matter and what evidently was the truth, which she knew, the district attorney sought to withdraw his announcement ofo ready and wanted to continue the case, but the court refused to l\u00e9t him do so and said he would keep the court open for a year if necessary. The court then had prepared, and the clerk to enter an order reciting that it appearing to the court that the witness had knowledge of material facts which she had testified to in the absence of the jury hut which she refused to testify to in the presence of the jury and persisted in claiming not to remember, whereupon he adjudged her guilty of contempt of the court, and that she was attempting by such conduct to hold the court in contempt and without power and authority to compel truthful answers to fair questions, therefore he ordered that she be committed to the custody of the shpriff until she purged herself of contempt which she could do by giving answers to the questions in a truthful manner and at the time when the court was ready to hear the testimony. She thereupon late that evening was taken in charge by the sheriff and kept with him and his wife all night. The court adjourned until next morning. She was taken in charge by the sheriff; not placed in jail, hut taken to his residence, treated in the most gentle manner; she slept in a bed in the same room in which he and his wife slept and he returned her to the court the next morning upon its opening. She was again placed upon the witness stand, still in the absence of the jury, when the district attorney proceeded to further examine her when she began the same tactics as the evening before, and repeatedly when asked questions would give no answer. The court again admonished her and asked her what was the trouble, why she would not talk. She made no answer. The court thereupon ordered the sheriff to take her to jail, and told her he would hold the court open until she decided to talk. He then asked her if she did not understand that the court could pronounce the sentence of death, actually taking the life of a person, a7id asked her if she did not know that. She said, \"Yes, sir.\u201d He told her that her sitting there obstinately was very much out of the line with the right to say the least of it and asked her if she wanted the jury brought back; and if she would then go ahead and tell, or if she would rather go to jail now, and asked her what she said about it. He then asked her: \u201cWhat are you looking over there for?\u201d One of appellant\u2019s attorneys stated: \"I was waiting until your honor got through. I want to take a bill.\u201d The court asked the witness: \u201cWhat do you say about it?\u201d She said: \"I would rather tell what I have to tell.\u201d And upon inquiry of the court she repeated that. The court again asked her if she wanted the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>to be brought in and she replied it made no difference to her. The court then instructed the district attorney to question her, and said we will see. One of appellant\u2019s attorneys said: \u201cI understand we have a bill to all the court\u2019s remarks.\u201d The court: \u201cOh, yes, sir.\u201d The attorney : \u201cEspecially the threat to send her to the penitentiary and the threat of death.\u201d The court: \u201cSure, that is right, whatever was said (to the witness) you didn\u2019t understand me to say that I was threatening to put you to death, did you ?\u201d She answered, \u201cYes, sir.\u201d (On her cross-examination by appellant\u2019s attorney she swore the court corrected that at the time, and told her \u201c'he was not threatening to have me killed if I didn\u2019t tell this.\u201d) The court then explained to her that he meant no such thing. That what he meant to tell her was that the court was powerful enough to put a person to death\u2014an offender against the law and that it would be a very weak court that could not compel a witness to give testimony. The attorney interrupted to say: \u201cI am sure that she understood\u2014\u201d The court said: \u201cNow, I don\u2019t care to' hear from you further on this subject. You have got your exception all the way through and you have a record, and I don\u2019t, propose to hear anything further on this subject.\u201d And the attorney excepted to the court\u2019s \u201crefusal to hear a bill of exception.\u201d The district attorney then proceeded to further examine the witness and upon his asking material questions she gave no answers. The court thereupon announced that the witness had not purged herself of contempt. She said she did not want to go to jail. The court: \u201cGo right on to jail.\u201d She then protested repeatedly that she did not want to go to jail. The sheriff requested her to \u201ccome on, let\u2019s go,\u201d but she remained seated in the witness seat and refused to go with the sheriff. And she said she had not been treated fair enough. The court asked her in what way she had, not been treated fair enough, and she began crying. The court told her when she got through crying she could go ahead and talk. After consuming the whole of the morning with the witness as indicated the court reconvened at 2 o\u2019clock in the evening. The jury was placed in the hox and the witness then testified substantially in accordance with her sworn testimony before the examining court.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">In further qualification of appellant\u2019s bill, in addition to what is. stated above, the court stated that this' witness answered promptly questions propounded by appellant\u2019s attorneys but was neither prompt nor truthful, in his opinion, in answering the questions propounded by the State\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">In one of appellant\u2019s bills it is alleged that late the first evening, when the court ordered the sheriff to take charge of the witness and to let the sheriff of Donley County, who was present when she testified in said examining trial and who was then under the rule, talk to the witness. Appellant then sought to have his attorneys present at this conversation but the court refused to permit them to be present. He excepted to the action of the court in refusing to permit his attorneys to be present at the conversation between these two witnesses, but assigned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>no reason. He did not object to the witnesses having a conversation, nor to the action of the court in permitting it. The bill in no way shows what the conversation was. The court then further says: \u201cHer attitude was so contemptuous that the court remanded her to the custody of the sheriff, who kept her at his home over night, and under these circumstances and with such influences working the judge of this court felt and still feels that it was proper to protect the court\u2019s jurisdiction and that it would not have been protected if the defendant and his counsel had then had the opportunity of discussing the case with her. In my opinion the slightest encouragement which might have been'possible from the mere fact that counsel for defendant be accorded the right at that stage of the proceeding to discuss the matter with her would in the opinion of the judge have thwarted the purpose of the law, to compel witnesses to respect their oath and testify truthfully to facts within their knowledge. But before the cross-examination of the witness the court did inform defendant\u2019s counsel that it was their privilege now to talk with'the witness and they availed themselves of the opportunity; the court taking a recess and giving them the opportunity and the jury not knowing the purpose for which the recess was taken. . . . The jury would have had no reason for knowing what was transpiring in their absence in my opinion, and I am not 'aware and have not been informed that they did know what- was transpiring in their absence, and when they returned into court the judge merely shid to the witness Ola Fincher: \u2018Do you feel well enough or able now to testify ?\u2019 And she answered that she didn\u2019t feel so very good, and the district attorney then began propounding questions to her. Nothing was mentioned in the direct examination by the district attorney relative to what transpired in the absence of the jury and when defendant\u2019s counsel began cross-examining her they undertook to and did develop what they considered 'important to them pertaining to the proceedings had in the absence of the jury. Contempt proceedings against the defendant were initiated after the trial and while the court had no doubt, and so stated to the defendant, of his guilt, yet the defendant broke down in that proceeding and with tears in his eyes said that he did not intend any contempt of court by the signs he was making and did not know he was doing anything in the trial to bring himself in contempt; and he was a young man about twenty-one years of age, so he was discharged for the reason that it was thought best that the court under those circumstances might perhaps be merciful without injury to the defendant or the court\u2019s dignity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-3\">After she had completed her testimony before the jury, on her direct examination and before the appellant undertook to cross tier, as stated, the court \"announced to appellant\u2019s counsel that they could then interview her privately, which they did. When they placed her back on the stand for cross-examination, they then had her go over before the jury each and every item of what he claimed was improper before the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>in the absence of the jury and asked her everything about all of those matters. So that in that way the appellant himself reproduced substantially all of the conduct of the court and of the district attorney and prosecuting attorney and everything that they thought would show to the jury her mistreatment and what caused her to ultimately tell the true facts of the case; and then they had her to testify in substance ahd effect and deny appellant had had sexual intercourse with her on said occasion. The State on redirect examination went over the matter again briefly with her and she said th\u00e1t he did have intercourse with her and that her testimony to that effect was true. This passed back and forth a time or two with the same result. Appellant\u2019s attorney asked her: if in finally testifying against appellant as she did it was \u201cbecause you willingly want to give this jury the truth, or because you are scared.\u201d A. \u201cWell, I admit to it, that I am scared.\u201d Q. \u201cThat is all.\u201d A. \u201cI am telling the truth.\u201d .</p>\n<p id=\"b413-3\">Upon the whole, whether or not her testimony against appellant to the effect that he did have sexual intercourse with her was a question of fact for the jury to pass upon. Taking the whole circumstances, no one could for a moment doubt her testimony when she swore he did have sexual intercourse with her. It is certain that he did, and that her testimony so stating was unquestionably true, and the jury believed her.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">The action of the court in dealing with this witness from start to finish demonstrates that the court and the prosecuting attorneys had no other purpose or intention whatever than to induce this girl to testify to the truth and nothing but the truth; that their conduct towards her was most considerate and the manner towards her was no other than to induce her to tell the truth and nothing but the truth. The treatment of her was in no way harsh, overbearing or oppressive.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Ueither can there be any question but that this girl was undertaking in every way conceivable, no doubt inspired by appellant himself or through him to testify falsely in his behalf and save him from the just punishment which his rape of her undoubtedly merited. The law and justice and right should not be permitted by the courts to be trampled under as it was attempted to be done by the witness and the appellant in this case. If such conduct by an accused and a witness doing everything possible to shield him could prevail then the power and authority of the court to administer justice, to ascertain and declare the truth and to execute and carry out the law would be a farce and a mockery. It was not tolerated by the courageous judge in this instance and should not have been. What he did was right. What he did was within his undoubted authority and what he ought to have done.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">The only other complaint appellant has is to the refusal of a special charge which he requested. The court specially stated in his qualification to the appellant\u2019s bill what the appellant explained to him-at the time and that he modified his charge to meet the exact question for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>which the charge was asked and thereupon refused his. As explained, the bill presents no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-3\">The judgment should be affirmed, not reversed. I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
