He explained his possession of it with testimony that he had some months before taken it to a refinery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>at which he worked at the request of one of the guards who was guarding the property, the guard stating that he wanted to buy it. That he left it at the refinery, the guard laying it away where it remained until the day of the arrest, at which time appellant was on his way home taking the pistol with him, the guard having failed to buy it. The evidence shows that he was going directly home the nearest route. The Assistant Attorney General concedes the insufficiency of the evidence to sustain the conviction, and in this we agree with him. See Mangum V. State, 90 S. W. Rep., ,31; Roberts v. State, 60 Texas Crim. Rep., 111; Buckley v. State, 70 Texas Crim. Rep., 550, 157 S. W.
