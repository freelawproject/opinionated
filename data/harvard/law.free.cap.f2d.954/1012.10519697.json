Solim\u00e1n appeals, claiming that the trial court erred in refusing to make a downward departure from the sentencing guidelines based on his claimed significantly reduced mental capacity at the time of the offense. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-17\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-18\">Solim\u00e1n responded to video advertisements, covertly placed by the United States Customs Service and the Chicago Customs Office, and ordered a videocassette depicting child pornography. An undercover United States Customs Service representative delivered the film; a search of Soli-man\u2019s home pursuant to a warrant resulted in seizure of a variety of pornographic materials, including two videocassettes and six magazines depicting prepubescent children in sexually explicit conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-19\">Solim\u00e1n pleaded guilty to one count of importing and receiving child pornography, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(2). At the sentencing hearing both a treating psychologist and an examining psychiatrist testified that Soli-m\u00e1n was suffering from depression. The psychologist, who began treating Solim\u00e1n following his arrest, opined that even though Solim\u00e1n was employed at the time of the offense his depression had significantly affected his ability to make decisions and contributed to his lack of judgment in placing the videocassette order. The district court declined a downward departure on the basis of significantly reduced mental capacity but sentenced Solim\u00e1n at the lower end of the guideline range and recommended that he be placed in a sex-offender treatment program. Solim\u00e1n timely appeals the court\u2019s refusal to make a downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-20\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-21\">Where, as here, the trial court has sentenced a defendant within the guideline range, appellate review is limited to determining whether the guidelines were correctly applied. United States Sentencing Commission, <em>Guidelines Manual, </em>intro, comment (Nov.1991). We make a <em>de novo </em>review of legal issues. <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1014\">*1014</page-number><em>Arellano-Rocha, </em>946 F.2d 1105 (5th Cir.1991). As a general rule, we will not disturb the sentencing court\u2019s discretionary-decision not to depart downward from the guidelines. <em>United States v. Keller, </em>947 F.2d 739 (5th Cir.1991), and <em>United States v. Hatchett, </em>923 F.2d 369 (5th Cir.1991) (citing <em>United States v. Buenrostro, </em>868 F.2d 135 (5th Cir.1989)). We need not give deference to the sentencing court\u2019s exercise of discretion, however, if the court mistakenly believed that departure was not permitted. Id.; <em>United States v. Miller, </em>903 F.2d 341, 349 n. 10 (5th Cir.1990) (citations omitted). In reviewing a sentence we must accept findings of fact of the district court unless such findings are clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Fields, </em>906 F.2d 139 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 111 S.Ct. 200, 112 L.Ed.2d 162 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-6\">Soliman maintains that the district court erred in failing to depart downward based on his depressed mental state at the time of the offense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-7\">If the defendant committed a non-violent offense while suffering from significantly reduced mental capacity not resulting from voluntary use of drugs or other intoxicants, a lower sentence may be warranted to reflect the extent to which reduced mental capacity contributed to the commission of the offense, provided that the defendant\u2019s criminal history does not indicate a need for incarceration to protect the public.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1078-8\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.13 (policy statement).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s significantly reduced mental capacity must be a contributing cause of the offense, but need not be the sole cause. <em>United States v. Ruklick, </em>919 F.2d 95 (8th Cir.1990); <em>United States v. Speight, </em>726 F.Supp. 861 (D.D.C.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-9\">Soliman argues that the district court was bound by the definition of \u201csignificantly reduced mental capacity\u201d provided by the testifying psychologist and psychiatrist. He also claims that the court was bound to give deference to his witnesses\u2019 evaluation of the effect of depression on his judgment at the time of the offense. Soliman asks that we adopt, by analogy, the deference that the United States Supreme Court has given to psychological experts in commitment proceeding cases. <em>See Addington v. Texas, </em>441 U.S. 418, 99 S.Ct. 1804, 60 L.Ed.2d 323 (1979), and <em>Parham v. R., </em>442 U.S. 584, 609, 99 S.Ct. 2493, 2507-08, 61 L.Ed.2d 101 (1979) (discussing due process requirements in state commitment proceedings). Such an application is without precedent. <em>See e.g., Keller, </em>947 F.2d at 741 (psychiatric reports <em>and </em>probation officer\u2019s report are among the appropriate sources to be considered by a district court in a section 5K2.13 p.s. analysis). The court in the case at bar specifically found that the mental condition described by Soliman\u2019s witnesses did not contribute to the commission of the crime, and that Soliman was not suffering from a significantly reduced mental capacity. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-12\">I don\u2019t see that ... this disorder could possibly have impaired him that much. I just don\u2019t see it, not a man who works at Brown and Root, is a good employee, writes articles for oil and gas journals, I mean, it just doesn\u2019t compute. The doctor can say he\u2019s got this disease, but I don\u2019t see that in this man. And that\u2019s my ruling, I just do not see that. I don\u2019t think I can downwardly depart. No matter' how sorry I feel for him and his wife, I can\u2019t downwardly depart based upon his mental capacity. I can\u2019t do it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1078-13\">The sentencing court had the power and duty to determine whether the mental condition described by the witnesses was a contributing cause of the crime. <em>Cf. Christophersen v. Allied-Signal Corp., </em>939 F.2d 1106 (5th Cir.1991) (discussing the Federal Rules of Evidence standard for judicial analysis of the methodology employed by an expert in connecting facts to conclusions). Upon finding that depression was not significantly causally linked to the offense, the court refused the requested downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>Solim\u00e1n insists that the court\u2019s unduly restrictive definition of \u201csignificantly reduced mental capacity\u201d led it to underestimate its power to make a downward departure. The court had the discretion to impose a sentence outside the range established by the applicable guideline if there existed \u201can aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentence different from that described.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court found, however, that such mitigating circumstances were not extant. We find neither error nor abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-4\">The sentence of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1078-10\">. It has been suggested that the Commission contemplates that a departure under this policy statement should result in probation without imprisonment. <em>See </em>T. Hutchinson &amp; D. Yellen, <em>Federal Sentencing Law and Practice </em>398 n. 2 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1079-14\">. The sentencing courts are not foreclosed from making departures provided the court articulates its reasons. Indeed, the United States Sentencing Commission anticipated the need for departures. <em>See Miller, </em>903 F.2d at 349 n. 8. The Commission describes the significant role that sentencing courts will play in guideline amendments; \u201cThe Commission is a permanent body that can amend the guidelines each year. Although the data available to it, like all data, are imperfect, experience with the guidelines will lead to additional information and provide a firm empirical basis for consideration of revisions.\u201d United States Sentencing Commission, <em>Guidelines Manual, </em>intro, comment (Nov.1991). The Commission was granted permanent status precisely because the guideline-writing process is evolutionary and will change as the guidelines conform to, among other things, the pattern of district court departures. Id.; <em>see </em>Sen. Rep. No. 98-225, 98th Cong., 1st Sess., <em>reported in </em>1984 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 3182, 3261 (\u201c[Section 3553] provides the flexibility necessary to assure adequate consideration of circumstances that might justify a sentence outside the guidelines.\u201d); <em>see also </em>A. Alschuler, <em>Departures and Plea Agreements Under the Sentencing Guidelines, </em>117 F.R.D. 459 (reported remarks of November 5, 1987) (\u201c[T]he Commission has recognized its inability adequately to consider many aggravating and mitigating circumstances.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
