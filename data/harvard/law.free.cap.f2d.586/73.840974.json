We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">On September 4, 1977, James Eagle, Gladys Bissonette\u2019s grandson, shot Calvin Janis. Later that day, Eagle was arrested by tribal authorities with two juveniles, Thomas Allen \u2014 Bissonette\u2019s son \u2014 and Darvin Makes Shine. Allen escaped en route to the tribal jail. On September 5, Allen and Black Smith came to the jail, and Allen, brandishing a rifle, forced the jailer to release Eagle and Makes Shine. After fleeing the jail, Eagle, Allen, Makes Shine, and Black Smith met at Bissonette\u2019s house in Pine Ridge and entered.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Some time that day, Bissonette was apprised of the facts surrounding the jail break. She told Eagle, Allen, and the others to stay in the basement when she was out of the house, to keep the doors locked, and the blinds drawn. In the following days, she purchased food and cooked for Eagle and Allen, and cashed a check for Eagle.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">On September 6, a warrant issued for Eagle\u2019s arrest for assault resulting in serious bodily injury; and for Allen\u2019s arrest for assault with a deadly weapon, in connection with the jail break. The next day, the United States Parole Commission issued a parole violator warrant for the arrest of Eagle pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4213(a)(2). On September 12, the assault warrant for Eagle\u2019s arrest was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-16\">On September 14, Bissonette went to the FBI office in Pine Ridge and asked if there were any federal warrants outstanding against Eagle and Allen. At Bissonette\u2019s request, Agent Crouch wrote down that Eagle was wanted for assault resulting in serious bodily injury, and that Allen was wanted for assault with a dangerous weapon. Crouch asked Bissonette if she knew the whereabouts of Eagle or Allen; she replied she did not. The agents testified that at the time of Bissonette\u2019s visit, they were unaware the assault warrant for Eagle had been dismissed, and were unsure of the existence of a parole violator warrant, but that they told Bissonette of the parole violator warrant, Crouch explaining that he did not write it down because of his uncertainty. Bissonette denied having been told of the parole warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-17\">On September 16, federal and tribal law enforcement officials arrested Allen at Bissonette\u2019s house. Bissonette called Allen up from the basement but did not inform the officials of Eagle\u2019s presence. On September 30, after Makes Shine informed FBI agents that Eagle had been staying there, they searched Bissonette\u2019s house, found Eagle hiding between the attic rafters, and arrested him.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Bissonette was indicted three weeks later under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3 (1948) for assisting Allen (Count I), and under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1071 (1954) for harboring Eagle (Count II).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>After trial before a jury, Bissonette was convicted on both counts. The imposition of sentence was suspended, and Bissonette placed on unsupervised probation for two years, on the condition that she abide by all federal, state, local and tribal laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">\n<em>Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The issues are whether: (I) the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3, and denial of the motion to dismiss Count I; (II) the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1071, and denial of the motion to dismiss Count II; and (III) a discussion between the trial court and defense counsel in the presence of the jury, concerning presentation of irrelevant evidence, constituted reversible error.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">I. <em>The evidence was sufficient to support the conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3, and denial of the motion to dismiss Count I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">The government had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that: (1) Allen had committed an assault with a dangerous weapon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1153 and 113(c); (2) Bissonette had actual knowledge of the assault; and (3) with that knowledge, Bissonette in some way assisted Allen in order to hinder or prevent his apprehension, trial, or punishment. <em>United States v. Bux, </em>412 F.2d 331, 333 (9th Cir. 1969). Bissonette concedes that Allen committed a federal offense, element (1) of the government\u2019s burden, and that she gained knowledge of that offense on September 14, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">Section 3 requires knowledge that a federal offense has been committed; it does not require knowledge of the fact that a warrant has been issued. Direct evidence is not necessary to prove knowledge of the offense; circumstantial evidence is sufficient. <em>Id. </em>at 333. A jury can infer from the evidence presented that the accused had the requisite knowledge and with that knowledge assisted the offender. <em>United States v. Norton, </em>464 F.2d 85, 86 (5th Cir. 1972). Therefore, with respect to proving elements (2) and (3), the government was not limited to the three days between Bissonette\u2019s visit to the FBI office and the arrest of Allen.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-11\">The record shows sufficient direct and circumstantial evidence from which the jury could have inferred that Bissonette knew of the assault as early as September 5, and that it was a federal offense. A continuing pattern of conduct was established at trial, from which the jury could infer that Bissonette assisted Allen, with the intent to hinder or prevent his apprehension. That Allen made his home with Bissonette prior to the jail break, and that his room was in her basement, does not militate against that inference. Bissonette\u2019s conduct did not consist merely of offering Allen the comforts of home; she instructed the fugitives to stay in the basement when she was out of the house, to keep the blinds drawn, and the doors locked; she berated them when they tried to contact friends outside the house, lest their discovery result. Likewise, Bissonette\u2019s calling Allen from the basement when law enforcement officials sought his arrest does not negative intent; Bissonette minimized her losses by preventing a search that would have disclosed Eagle\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-12\">Bissonette attempted at trial to demonstrate that her behavior was motivated by fear and mistrust of law enforcement authorities, concern for the safety of Allen and Eagle, and a desire to retain a lawyer for Allen and Eagle. However, her personal belief that she acted with a \u201cnoble purpose\u201d does not negative the existence of the requisite statutory intent; the law does not permit the private luxury of determining if and when federal custody of a fugitive shall commence.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>Bissonette alleges that the correct test for determining the sufficiency of the evidence is whether reasonable minds could find it exclusive of every hypothesis except that of guilty. This court described the proper test in <em>Durns v. United States, </em>562 F.2d 542, 545-46 (8th Cir. 1977), <em>cert denied, </em>434 U.S. 959, 98 S.Ct. 490, 54 L.Ed.2d 319 (1977):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-4\">On appellate review of the sufficiency of the evidence, the <em>court must </em>view the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict rendered. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). It must accept as established any and all reasonable inferences from the evidence that tend to support the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>United States </em>v. Overshon, 494 F.2d 894, 896 (8th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>419 U.S. 853, 878, 95 S.Ct. 96, 42 L.Ed.2d <em>85 (1974). The evidence need not </em>\u201cexclude every reasonable hypothesis except that of guilt [; it is enough] that it be sufficient to convince the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Shahane, </em>517 F.2d 1173, 1177 (8th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>423 U.S. 893, 96 S.Ct. 191, 46 L.Ed.2d 124 (1975). Furthermore, because circumstantial evidence is intrinsically as probative as direct evidence, <em>Holland v. United States, </em>348 U.S. 121, 140, 75 S.Ct. 127, 99 L.Ed. 150 (1954), the same standard applies where a conviction rests entirely on circumstantial evidence. <em>United States v. Carlson, </em>547 F.2d 1346, 1360 (8th Cir. 1976).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-5\"><em>See also United States v. Nelson, </em>419 F.2d 1237, 1242-45 (9th Cir. 1969). The record shows that the evidence was \u201csufficient to convince the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">The motion to dismiss Count I, denied after the government rested its case, was based on Bissonette\u2019s alleged facilitation and cooperation in the arrest of Allen. The mere act of calling Allen up from her basement, however, does not nullify the affirmative, continuing pattern of conduct establishing Bissonette\u2019s intent to prevent Allen\u2019s apprehension. The evidence being sufficient to support Bissonette\u2019s conviction on Count I, the motion to dismiss that count was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">II. <em>The evidence was sufficient to support the conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1071, and denial of the motion to dismiss Count II.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">The government had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that Bissonette: (1) had specific knowledge that a federal warrant had issued for Eagle\u2019s arrest; (2) harbored or concealed Eagle; and (3) intended to prevent Eagle\u2019s discovery and arrest. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1071.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">Because the FBI was mistaken respecting which warrant was actually outstanding on September 14, 1977, against Eagle, Bissonette alleges she had no specific knowledge that a federal warrant had been issued. However, the FBI\u2019s mistake related to knowledge of the specific charge on which a warrant existed. Section 1071 only requires knowledge that a warrant has issued. Of that fact, Bissonette was fully informed. As the Second Circuit has recognized, rarely would direct proof of knowledge be available. <em>United States v. Giampa, </em>290 F.2d 83, 84 (2d Cir. 1961). The knowledge element can be established by evidence from which the trier of fact \u201ccould properly infer knowledge and guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 84-85. The evidence in this case includes Bissonette\u2019s close relationship with Eagle and familiarity with his activities; the conversations between Bissonette, Eagle, and the other fugitives after the jail break; Bissonette\u2019s desire to keep Eagle at her house and attempts to keep him out of public view; Makes Shine\u2019s testimony that the occupants of Bissonette\u2019s house were aware of a federal charge against Eagle; Bissonette\u2019s conversation with the FBI agents; and Bissonette\u2019s familiarity, through personal experience, with federal law enforcement on the reservation.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-12\">The evidence supporting the knowledge element also establishes that Bissonette\u2019s conduct throughout constituted the harboring or concealing of Eagle, and intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>prevent Eagle\u2019s discovery and arrest. The intent element is further supported by Bissonette\u2019s behavior at the time of Allen\u2019s arrest: by calling Allen from the basement, Bissonette forestalled a possible search of the house that would have resulted in Eagle\u2019s discovery and arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Contrary to Bissonette\u2019s contention, \u00a7 1071 does not require a showing of intent \u201cto prevent, for all time, the discovery and arrest\u201d of a fugitive. Bissonette also counters the intent element with the \u201cnoble purpose\u201d theory argued respecting Count I. We reject that theory as being no more applicable to Count II than it was to Count I.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">The motion to dismiss Count II was based on the FBI\u2019s misunderstanding of the charge outstanding against Eagle, Bissonette\u2019s alleged resultant lack of specific knowledge, and her lack of intent. The trial court denied the motion after the government rested its case, correctly stating \u201cthis is going to be something the jury . is going to have to decide . . .\u201d The evidence being sufficient to support Bissonette\u2019s conviction on Count II, the motion to dismiss that count was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">III. <em>The discussion between the trial court and defense counsel did not constitute reversible error.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">Judge Bogue interrupted the testimony of the sixth defense witness to inform defense counsel that he would allow statements concerning Bissonette\u2019s fear of the FBI, but not the reasons for her fear. He explained that the FBI was not on trial, and the accuracy of Bissonette\u2019s beliefs was not relevant. During the ensuing exchange with defense counsel, Judge Bogue remarked, \u201cYou are going to extend this trial a long time if you are going to continue to ask why [Bissonette fears the FBI].\u201d At proceedings held in chambers, defense counsel moved for a mistrial because \u201csome members of the jury could have received the impression the Court would be blaming the Defense for any delay . . . Just the tone, the approach, the Court used placed the Defense in a very negative light . . I feel that criticism such as delay could have a deterimental [sic] effect on how the jury views the accused. I would ask, if the Court denies this, at least the Court explain to the jury that . it should not be interpreted . . . that the Court is being critical of one side or the other.\u201d After further discussion, defense counsel indicated that Judge Bogue\u2019s tone was not critical, but normal. Prior to calling the next witness, Judge Bogue, as requested, explained to the jury, \u201cI may have some opinion about whether evidence is admissible and I might suggest that to let in immaterial matters might delay the trial . . [T]here is nothing intended as any castigation or criticism of the attorneys involved in this case at all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-12\">Bissonette here alleges prejudicial error because of the apparent criticism of defense counsel for improper tactics, and the proximity of the remark to the beginning of the defense. Bissonette further argues that Judge Bogue\u2019s remedial comments heightened and perpetuated the prejudicial effects of the initial remark.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-13\">\u201cA trial judge does not become an advocate in litigation by stopping on his own motion ... an improper line of inquiry.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>542 F.2d 975, 979 (7th Cir. 1976), <em>cert, denied, </em>429 U.S. 1073, 97 S.Ct. 810, 50 L.Ed.2d 790 (1977). Judge Bogue\u2019s intervention therefore was not prejudicial. The remark itself, taken in context, was not critical of the defense, and counsel admitted that the tone was normal. The nature of the remark makes its timing irrelevant to the question of prejudice (we note, however, that the defense had already reached its sixth witness), and defense counsel, having requested a remedial explanation of Judge Bogue, cannot now complain because that explanation was made. Reviewing the record as a whole, the criticized remark could not reasonably have contributed to Bissonette\u2019s conviction, and did not constitute error.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-14\">Finding no error, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b171-11\">.
