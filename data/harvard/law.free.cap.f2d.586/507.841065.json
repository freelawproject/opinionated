Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., </em>5 Cir., 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b603-25\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b603-26\">In 1975, Carl Joseph Mundy was arrested and incarcerated for five-and-one-half months on charges of homicide and armed robbery that were later dropped. He subsequently brought this damage suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that his constitutional rights had been violated by his arrest and imprisonment. The suit was originally brought against the State of Georgia, DeKalb County, the Assistant District Attorney for DeKalb County, and Officer D. C. Brown of the DeKalb County Police Department. All defendants except Officer Brown were dismissed prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-27\">After Mundy had presented his evidence at trial, the District Court, upon proper motion, directed a verdict in favor of defendant Brown. Mundy appeals, contending that he presented sufficient evidence that he had been arrested without probable cause and had been incarcerated in deliberate and malicious disregard of his constitutional rights for his case to go to the jury. After having carefully examined the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>transcript, we conclude that a jury verdict against Officer Brown would not have been warranted and therefore entry of the directed verdict against Mundy was proper. <em>See generally Boeing Co. v. Shipman, </em>5 Cir., 1969, 411 F.2d 365 (en banc); 9 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2524 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Mundy\u2019s principal argument both at trial and on appeal is that a photographic array from which several witnesses identified him as one of two individuals involved in the murder/robbery was so impermissibly suggestive that the identifications could not constitutionally have been admitted against him in a criminal trial. Regardless of how meritorious that argument might be, however, the photographic identifications \u2014 together with other information that placed Mundy in the area of the crimes about the time they occurred \u2014 certainly provided Officer Brown with ample probable cause to swear out a warrant for his arrest. A police officer who arrests someone with probable cause or a valid warrant is not liable in a \u00a7 1983 suit for unlawful arrest. <em>See Hunter v. Clardy, </em>5 Cir., 1977, 558 F.2d 290; <em>Perry v. Jones, </em>5 Cir., 1975, 506 F.2d 778. Nor is that officer liable for any subsequent incarceration over which he no longer has any control.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
