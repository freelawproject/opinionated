We disagree and accordingly affirm the judgment of the United States District Court for the Western District of New York, John T. Elfvin, <em>Judge.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1036-17\">The three elements of the crime are (1) endeavoring, (2) corruptly, (3) to influence an officer of the court or the due administration of justice. Taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, as we must, each of the elements was sufficiently proven.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-18\">Appellant did \u201cendeavor\u201d under the statute. Not once, but twice, he approached one Messina, an attorney and acquaintance of his who was also Commissioner of Jurors for Erie County, New York, and acquainted with United States District Judge Curtin, about a sentencing pending before the judge involving one Quaranta. Appellant, seeking to obtain for Quaranta probation on a mail fraud charge involving up to five years\u2019 imprisonment, asked Messina whether he \u201c[cjould . . . talk to the Judge, take him to lunch?,\u201d and received the reply, \u201cNo, it\u2019s out of the question.\u201d At appellant\u2019s request, however, Messina did find out from the probation office that the presentence report was favorable and reported this to appellant. Appellant then told Messina that he \u201cshould talk to the Judge and take him out to lunch\u201d; Messina replied, \u201cLook, I told you that\u2019s out of the question the first time, forget it.\u201d No one approached Judge Cur-tin in any way. Nevertheless, there was an endeavor within the statute, which is very similar to a criminal solicitation statute, <em>see </em>W. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, <em>Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 58 (1972), and does not require proof that would support a charge of attempt. <em>Osborn v. United States, </em>385 U.S. 323, 87 S.Ct. 429, 17 L.Ed.2d 394 (1966); <em>United States v. Russell </em>255 U.S. 138, 41 S.Ct. 260, 65 L.Ed. 553 (1921); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rosner, </em>485 F.2d 1213 (2d Cir. 1973), <em>cert, denied, </em>417 U.S. 950, 94 S.Ct. 3080, 41 L.Ed.2d 672 (1974). Thus, it is no defense that the putative intermediary declined to approach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>the judge or that the endeavor was unsuccessful. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Russell, supra, </em>255 U.S. at 143, 41 S.Ct. 260. The crime is one that can be committed merely by words, and words are sometimes misunderstood, LaFave &amp; Scott, <em>supra, </em>at 416-17; but the likelihood of a misunderstanding here was substantially removed by appellant\u2019s repetition of the solicitation albeit phrased first as a question and later as a declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-5\">Appellant\u2019s endeavor was also made \u201ccorruptly.\u201d In response to the statement of a Government informer that he was concerned about a certain person in federal court, appellant said, \u201cYou need something in federal? What\u2019s the guy\u2019s name?\u201d He then elaborated that he asked because he thought that it might be Quaranta and that as to him, \u201cI got a guy going in to straighten that out. . . [T]his guy\u2019s going up on the 13th for sentencing, we\u2019re trying to get him maybe two or three years probation .... my man\u2019s having lunch with Curtin tomorrow . . .\u201d and that if the report were favorable his man could \u201c[elaborate on the good.\u201d In the course of a subsequent conversation with the informer appellant stated that he was charging only $1,000 and that the money would not be paid until sentencing because appellant had \u201cguaranteed\u201d two or three years\u2019 probation. As appellant suggests in his brief, the jury could have taken this guarantee to be mere puffery, designed to impress the informant and set him up for a \u201csting,\u201d because appellant\u2019s \u201cman\u201d was <em>not </em>going to see the judge; but the jury could also have found in this statement an admission that appellant was in fact not only trying to do something for Quaranta, he was doing it for money. And Messina <em>did </em>go to the probation office and find out about the presentence report although what he said to the probation officer is in dispute. Whether the endeavor was \u201ccorrupt\u201d was a question for the jury, <em>Knight v. United States, </em>310 F.2d 305, 307-08 (5th Cir. 1962), under proper instructions emphasizing that the endeavor had to be \u201cmotivated by an improper purpose.\u201d The court instructed the jury that it could find appellant\u2019s intent to be corrupt if it determined that appellant knew that Messina had no personal knowledge about Quaranta or information relevant to his sentencing and that appellant \u201cknew or thought that Mr. Messina had some friendship or special relationship or special association with Judge Curtin which [appellant] thought would, <em>by itself, </em>be persuasive with Judge Curtin\u201d (emphasis added). We agree with the government that an endeavor to exploit such a relationship, actual or perceived, may be found to be corrupt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-10\">The appellant argues, however, that the admissions to the Government informer were not competent evidence absent corroboration that the admissions were reliable or that the crime charged was in fact committed. <em>United States v. Marcus, </em>401 F.2d 563, 565 (2d Cir. 1968), <em>cert, denied, </em>393 U.S. 1023, 89 S.Ct. 633, 21 L.Ed.2d 567 (1969). Independent evidence is required because it tends to make the admission reliable while helping to establish independently the other necessary elements of the offense. <em>Smith v. United States, </em>348 U.S. 147, 151-59, 75 S.Ct. 194, 99 L.Ed. 192 (1954); <em>Opper v. United States, </em>348 U.S. 84, 93, 75 S.Ct. 158, 164, 99 L.Ed. 101 (1954). But such corroborative evidence need not be in and of itself sufficient to establish, independent of the admission, the corpus delicti; \u201c[i]t is sufficient if the corroboration supports the essential facts admitted sufficiently to justify a jury inference of their truth.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Smith </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>348 U.S. at 156, 75 S.Ct. 194. The corroborative evidence here meets, if by no great margin, that standard. At appellant\u2019s request, and as appellant told the informer Messina would, Messina did in fact find out about Quaranta\u2019s presentence report and report back to appellant on its favorability, even though Messina had no relationship whatsoever to the Quaranta case and, curiously, neither appellant nor Messina apparently ever approached Quaranta\u2019s lawyer who probably could have given appellant the same information. In addition to being a lawyer, Messina <em>did </em>have an official position as a state jury commissioner which in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>appellant\u2019s eyes gave Messina power; and he and appellant had a social relationship, which appellant conveyed to the informer by the phrase \u201cmy guy\u201d or \u201cmy man.\u201d Although Messina declined in fact to approach the judge, appellant\u2019s repetition of his request, established by Messina\u2019s testimony, indicated that appellant thought that Messina might do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-4\">Finally, the evidence of the corrupt endeavor clearly shows that it was made \u201cto influence\u201d the judge or the due administration of justice. Appellant solicited Messina to importune the judge to impose a lenient sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1036-14\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503 provides in pertinent part: Whoever corruptly, or by threats or force, or by any threatening letter or communication, endeavors to influence, intimidate, or impede any . . officer in or of any court of the United States ... in the discharge of his duty, . . or corruptly or by threats or force, or by any threatening letter or communication, influences, obstructs, or impedes, or endeavors to influence, obstruct, or impede, the due administration of justice, shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1036-21\">. <em>United States v.
