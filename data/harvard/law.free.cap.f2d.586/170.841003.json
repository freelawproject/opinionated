(Cape) of orders entered by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) requiring Cape to cease and desist from certain operations and practices in performance of some certificated transportation services. The orders arise from proceedings initiated January 30, 1973, on a \u201cPetition Under Rule 102 Seeking Extraordinary Relief\u201d filed by some nine (9) intervening motor carriers operating under ICC certificates, each of whom are competitors of Cape. The ICC treated the petition as a complaint to either cancel or modify the challenged Cape certificates.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-15\">Following certain procedural skirmishes, Cape filed an \u201cOffer to Satisfy Complaint and of Settlement\u201d on January 28, 1975. The offer and settlement was denied by the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). Thereafter, following hearings, the ALJ rendered his Initial Decision on January 7, 1976. He found that Cape did not render its authorized air freight transportation services on its own and that Cape had been operating unlawfully by obtaining the contractual services of certain \u201cagents\u201d over which Cape exercises little, if any, actual control in the performance of its transportation service, all in violation of Sections 203(c), 206(a) and 216(b) of the Act, 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 303, 306 and 316. Cape was ordered to cease and desist such operations and directed henceforth to utilize employees, terminals and vehicles under its direct control and supervision. The Initial Decision was affirmed by the ICC. This petition for review followed. Cape is a Kansas corporation and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>maintains its principal offices in that state. Jurisdiction is conferred upon this court by virtue of 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2341, <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">At the commencement of the proceedings before the ALJ on March 4, 1975, Cape moved for dismissal of the complaint and proceedings based upon its offer of settlement prepared and submitted to the ICC on January 28, 1975, <em>which was accepted by the ICC\u2019s Bureau of Enforcement on February 18, 1975. </em>The offer of settlement constituted an agreement by Cape to effect substantial changes in its working arrangement with \u201cagents\u201d in order to assure that Cape would assume substantial \u201ccontrol\u201d and \u201cresponsibility,\u201d to-wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-5\">\u2014All agents have been or will be made district managers and full-time employees of the company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-6\">\u2014All district managers will be subject to full operational control by three regional managers, one each for operations in the Southern, Midwestern and Eastern areas we serve.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-7\">\u2014All sales, solicitation and advertising will be for Cape alone, and not in connection with any other organization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-8\">\u2014All banking is handled by Cape personnel through Cape bank accounts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-9\">\u2014All telephone lines are acquired by Cape and for its use alone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-10\">\u2014All equipment is properly placarded and devoted solely to Cape\u2019s operations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFq\">\u2014All freight bills and shipping documents are limited to Cape alone (except in cases of interchange or interline arrangements, where necessary).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-11\">\u2014All billing, and other paper work is controlled through the company\u2019s central office, through review, although receipts, collections, etc., are handled at the district office level.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-12\">\u2014All district and regional managers are authorized and encouraged to review any difficulties with me, our counsel and Commission field personnel as they arise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqz\">\u2014AH insurance is consolidated under policies obtained, bought and paid for by Cape. Formerly, each district office maintained its own policies. This process will be completed on April, when the last district office policy lapses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-13\">\u2014All territorial restrictions on the district managers have been removed, and they are responsible, with the help of regional managers, for the fullest utilization of any company equipment in their area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-14\">[R., Appendix, pp. 237-238; R., Appendix, Motion to Dismiss, pp. 159-168.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-15\">The ICC\u2019s order of August 19, 1974, dismissed the complaint filed against Cape, <em>except </em>for allegations relating to Cape\u2019s authorities in MC-134906 and Subs 1, 2, 4 and 5 thereunder for failure to exercise control and responsibility or to perform operations in accordance with Section 216(b) of the Act. <em>The intervening complainants sought in these proceedings to seek revocation of Cape\u2019s certificates above identified which, under Section 212(a) of the Act, 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 312, requires proof of \u201cwillful failure\u201d to comply with the provisions of the Act or any lawful rule, regulation or order of the ICC promulgated thereunder. </em>Cape\u2019s contention, in resistance to further proceedings on the allegations of the complainants following Cape\u2019s filing of its offer of settlement, was two-fold: (a) the ICC\u2019s \u201cCorrected Order\u201d of August 19, 1974 rejected the complainants\u2019 efforts to obtain <em>revocation </em>of the Cape certificates based upon the alleged \u201cwillful failure\u201d by Cape to render proper, adequate and continuous service; the \u201cCorrected Order\u201d thus confined the proceedings on the complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAy\">. for oral arguments for the sole purpose of determining whether [Cape] pursuant to its authorities contained in MC-134906 and Subs 1, 2, 4 and 5 thereunder, <em>is failing to exercise control and responsibility or perform operations thereunder in violation of Section 216(b) of the Act; . . .. </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-17\">[R., Appendix, pp. 169, 170.]</p>\n<p id=\"A1B\">and, (b) after the ICC eliminated any consideration of the <em>revocation </em>of the challenged certificates and authorities contained in MC-134906 and Subs 1, 2, 4 and 5 thereunder, Cape cooperatively subjected itself to lawful ICC cease and desist orders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>relative to the allegations that it had failed to exercise \u201ccontrol and responsibility.\u201d Cape contends that this was accomplished, without acknowledgment of wrongdoing, through its \u201cOffer to Satisfy Complaint and of Settlement\u201d filed January 28, 1975, which was accepted by the ICC\u2019s Bureau of Enforcement on February 18, 1975. Cape argues that the offer of settlement constitutes its full agreement to perform all of the changes in its practices, policies and methods of operations required to assure that it maintain that degree of control, supervision and responsibility deemed necessary by the ICC\u2019s Bureau of Enforcement. Cape bolsters this contention by pointing to the extensive changes it had made and those yet to be made under the guidance of the ICC\u2019s Bureau of Enforcement evidenced by letter-report of November 20, 1974. [R., Appendix, pp. 274-277, 282.]</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">The intervening complainants refused to consider Cape\u2019s offer of settlement, notwithstanding the Bureau of Enforcement\u2019s acceptance. On February 18, 1975, the complainants filed a reply to Cape\u2019s \u201cOffer to Satisfy Complaint and of Settlement\u201d and to the Bureau of Enforcement\u2019s acceptance of that offer. [R., Appendix, pp. 173-179.] That reply contained: (a) a reiteration that the complainants seek <em>revocation </em>of the subject certificates (notwithstanding that the ICC had already determined that revocation was not to be considered) apparently grounded on Section 212(a) of the Act which provides for revocation upon \u201ccomplaint\u201d from one other than the ICC upon proof of Cape\u2019s <em>willful failure to comply, </em>(b) insistence that the information in the possession of the Bureau of Enforcement would (contrary to the prior determinations of the ICC and the Bureau) \u201cshow that Cape has, since its inception, continuously and willfully failed to provide service under its certificates in violation of Section 216(d) . . . \u201d [Appendix, p. 177.], (c) allegation that the Offer of Settlement and Satisfaction of Complaint filed by Cape is of <em>no value </em>because it admits of no wrongdoing, offers no description of the activities which Cape will agree to cease and offers no facts upon which a determination of the willful nature of those violations can be made, and (d) a contention that the complaint should be that of the ICC; acknowledgment that the Bureau of Enforcement has pursued extensive investigation into Cape\u2019s services upon request of complainants; allegation that complainants are not \u201cprivy\u201d to the Bureau\u2019s investigative reports and therefore cannot proceed upon them and that the \u201c. . . Bureau should not be allowed to rob complainants of the facts which prove their allegations ..\u201d [Appendix, p. 179.] Thus, the hearings proceeded upon the investigative report-evidence of the Bureau of Enforcement which had, based thereon, accepted Cape\u2019s offer of settlement. The record reflects that none of the complainants presented any evidence at the hearing before the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">In Cape\u2019s response to the objections of complainants, Cape observed that while the complainants insist upon seeking <em>revocation </em>of Cape\u2019s certificates, this matter had already been decided adversely to complainants by the ICC; thus the only issue remaining was that of Cape\u2019s \u201ccontrol\u201d over and assumption of \u201cresponsibility\u201d for services performed by its agents. Pertinently, Cape contended that (a) its offer of settlement was acceptable to the Bureau of Enforcement which had conducted two extensive investigations of Cape\u2019s operations, (b) the Bureau of Enforcement did not believe that further hearings were necessary, and (c) because complainants had no evidence to present independent of that introduced by the Bureau of Enforcement, the Bureau\u2019s recommendation for acceptance of the terms of the offer of settlement should have been adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">Notwithstanding the above related background, when the matter came on for hearing before the ALJ on March 4, 1975, the judge refused to grant Cape\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaints based upon Cape\u2019s willingness to comply with an order directing that the terms of the offer of settlement be adopted, coupled with an appropriate ICC cease and desist order. At the hearing, these preliminary discussions pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>ceded the Judge\u2019s order denying the Cape motion, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-5\"><em>Mr. Kretsinger </em>(for Cape): Your Hon- or, this proceeding has been pending for some time. ... It has been through the Commission on many, many allegations of various activities which were alleged to be unlawful, and which have all been resolved by Division 1, <em>other than the question of whether or not the proper control of the operations is in effect by the carriers.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-6\">The Bureau of Enforcement was directed to appeal, enter an appearance and participate in the proceedings. An extensive investigation was made. After that investigation was made, [7] the Bureau\u2019s attorney and we entered into discussions for a proper solution to that issue and we have agreed to a cease and desist order as to certain facets of the, I suppose, indicia of control which were determined to maybe not suffice to meet the standards of the substantial control.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-7\"><em>An offer of settlement </em>was <em>prepared and revised and finally submitted to the Commission. A reply was made by the Bureau accepting the offer as far as they were concerned. Mr. Goff, on behalf of his clients, also filed a response not accepting the offer and stating that he had no further evidence to put in, in any event, but he would kind of like to have the Bureau put all their evidence in.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-8\">That is the status as I see it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-9\">If this case went through several days of hearing and an order was issued, a recommended order was issued, petitions, replies, exceptions, all these kind of pleadings going on for a couple more years, it <em>would not accomplish any more, at the most, than an order of the Commission requiring the respondent to cease and desist from the operation alleged to be unlawful or alleged to be not having proper control of the operation.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-10\">\n<em>Now, the offer has been made, it is enforceable in court if the cease and desist order is entered, and the adverse effect of one or two more years of litigation on the respondent would be very damaging, it has been damaging up to this point, we consider, to the tune of many, many thousands of dollars.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-11\">There is a competitive fight going on between the complainants and the respondent. As far as I can see, the only result we are trying to arrive at in this proceeding is to determine and assure that respondent has proper control over his operations. That is the only issue left.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-12\">Now, if the facts of that control are of record, and they are set out in the APA letter which was served last week, and respondent agrees to cease and desist from the operations alleged to be, I can\u2019t say illegal, I\u2019ll say not within the proper control and responsibility of the respondent, I see no further purpose in proceeding here this morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-13\">I believe that if Mr. Goff starts the case off, he will probably say that they have no evidence to produce. That is what he said in his response. This indicates to me that there is really nothing to be here for this morning except for the Judge to accept the offer of settlement and recommend the offer of settlement be accepted and a cease and desist order be issued pointed toward the things and other matters in the APA letter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-14\">That is our position this morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-15\"><em>Judge Sarbacher: </em>Does the Bureau have any further comment to make?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-16\">\n<em>Mr. Kapnistos: The Bureau\u2019s response would be, Your Honor, that we have no objection to the offer of settlement submitted by the defendant.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-17\"><em>Judge Sarbacher: </em>The complainants?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-18\"><em>Mr. Goff: </em>Your Honor, Mr. Kretsinger is quite right that this proceeding has been of some duration. The first pleading which I filed in this matter was in January of 1973 and certainly there have been pleadings filed since then. I hold in my hand the two submissions which I have made on behalf of the complainants, which are about 700 pages long, and which are, to some extent, briefs, but basically they are verified statements of the complainants and other folks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>The plain truth was that we took this case as far as we were then able to take it, not being private investigators and not, at that time, having much leverage to go to see Mr. Clair or any other one of these folks and say that we would like to have you tell us about these operations and so show us your records and what have you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-4\">\n<em>We took it as far as we could, then we asked that the commission have the Bureau of Enforcement enter this case and to do whatever investigation it could and then to help us make a record. For that reason, we understand that the Commission did tell the Bureau to intervene. It has done so. It has made, I assume, extensive investigations. I have not seen them because I am not privy to them.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-5\">We originally asked the Commission to either cancel this certificate of Cape Air Freight or modify them. We also alleged that they had never operated the certificates and that, [10] in fact, it was a big franchising operation, that is, that they have agents all over the place to actually perform the service and they do very little. We have never retreated from that position. I think I set forth what I want to do in our reply, which I am sure that Your Honor has a copy of.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-6\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-7\">Now, we come up to this case and the Bureau investigates apparently seven of their agents and they come to me with an offer of settlement that says we don\u2019t admit that we did anything wrong, but whatever it is you said we did, we will quit with respect to these seven people only. Now, I am proceeding under Section 2(12)(b) [212(b)] of the Act. I have asked from the first day of this proceeding that these certificates either be can-celled [11] or that they be modified and I have asked it on several different grounds. Today we are proceeding on the grounds that they have never operated the certificates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-8\"><em>In order for this complaint to have any substance, it must proceed, as the statute says, to show that all of this activity was willful, that is to say that they knew they were doing it, that it has been done all along, that they knew they were doing it and they have continued to do it. </em>It does not serve the purpose of the complaint which I filed for these gentlemen to take a cease and desist voluntarily in which they say they did nothing wrong, but whatever it is you said we did, we will quit. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-10\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-11\">[R., Appendix, pp. 186-189.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-12\">After the ALJ denied Cape\u2019s motion, he directed the Bureau of Enforcement to present its witnesses. This procedure was strongly protested by both Cape and the Bureau. Their position was that the burden of proof under the circumstances and posture of the proceeding was on the complainants as proponents of the order requested. [R., Appendix, pp. 194, 195, 196.]</p>\n<p id=\"b272-13\">The hearing proceeded. The Bureau presented one witness, a Mr. Vernon Cable, the ICC\u2019s District Supervisor at Kansas City, Missouri, who had conducted the detailed investigations of Cape\u2019s operations and of Cape\u2019s \u201cagents.\u201d In addition to Cable\u2019s testimony, the Bureau introduced in evidence multiple page exhibits. <em>None </em>of the complainants presented any witnesses. Thus, the ALJ\u2019s Initial Decision rendered December 18, 1975, was predicated on the evidence presented by the Bureau. That decision referred to the \u201cchanges\u201d proposed by Cape in its Offer of Settlement, noting that certain of the \u201cchanges\u201d had already taken place but that it was impossible to determine whether all of them had been effected. Even had the \u201cchanges\u201d been made, the ALJ found and concluded, <em>inter </em>alia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-14\">. that such changes are insufficient to constitute control and the pertinent administrative and operational responsibility on the part of Cape for the operations conducted pursuant to the authority set forth in Certificate No. MC-134906 and subs thereunder. Mr. Clair can cancel the \u201cagency\u201d contracts and replace them with \u201cemployment\u201d contracts; he can instruct \u201cagents\u201d to open <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>bank accounts in Cape\u2019s name, and list telephones in Cape\u2019s name; he can purchase \u201cfront\u201d insurance; and he can even set up a central computer system, for which the \u201cagents\u201d will be billed for a computer service fee. None of these render any transportation service of its own. The transportation service rendered under the authority set forth in Appendix A hereto is being rendered by \u201cagents\u201d which do not hold pertinent authority from this Commission. In essence, Cape is providing a centralized, nontransportation service for its numerous \u201cagents,\u201d a service for which Cape is fully reimbursed by each of the \u201cagents\u201d on the basis of a specified percentage of the \u201cagent\u2019s\u201d gross revenues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-4\">VII</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-5\">In view of the evidence of record and the pertinent case law, it is here concluded that (a) Cape does not render any transportation service of its own; (b) the transportation service which is being rendered under Cape\u2019s certificates are operations performed by \u201cagents\u201d over which Cape exercises little if any control; (c) that the foregoing constitutes a violation of section 216(b) of the Interstate Commerce Act; (d) that the involved transportation service performed by the \u201cagents\u201d constitutes unauthorized operations which are in violation of sections 203(c), 206(a), and 209(a) of the Act; (e) that Cape has been aiding and abetting the \u201cagents\u201d in their violations of the Act; and (f) that all such operations must cease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-6\">VIII</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-7\">In order to insure that the violations cease, there will be entered herein an order requiring Cape to cease and desist all operations found herein to be unlawful. <em>Also, Cape is hereby admonished to discontinue all operations conducted through the use of \u201cagents\u201d, and henceforth its operations must utilize company employees, company terminals, and company vehicles, all of which are under the direct control and supervision of Cape. </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-10\">[R., Appendix, pp. 237-238, 240-241.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-11\">The ALJ also entered a cease and desist order requiring Cape to refrain and abstain from all such unlawful operations and practices and \u201c . . . hereafter to exercise the necessary control and administrative operational responsibility in performing a transportation service . . . \u201d within the criteria set forth in <em>Performance of Motor Common Carrier Service by Riss &amp; Co., Inc., </em>48 M.C.C. 327 and cases cited therein. [R., Appendix, p. 245.]</p>\n<p id=\"b273-14\">On July 12, 1976, the ICC, Division I, affirmed the statement of facts, conclusions and findings of the ALJ. Cape was ordered to cease and desist its unlawful operations and to comply with 49 CFR \u00a7 1100.99. Upon review of Cape\u2019s petitions for reconsideration, the full Commission denied same and ruled that the findings of Division I are \u201cin accordance with the evidence and the applicable law.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-15\">On review, Cape contends that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-16\">(1) the finding of a violation and the requirements of the Commission\u2019s order are not justified by the facts of record or the applicable law, serve no legitimate remedial or regulatory purpose, are improperly punitive in character, fail to reflect the required exercise of judgment in tailoring any remedy required to the facts of the case, and constitute an improper invasion of matters properly left to managerial discretion, (2) the activities of Cape complained of are wholly consistent with the Interstate Commerce Act and the Commission\u2019s regulations; and the principal decision relied on by the Commission to sustain its order, <em>Performance of Motor Common Carrier Service by Riss &amp; Co., Inc., </em>48 M.C.C. 327 (1948), was itself subsequently modified to relieve the carrier of the harsher aspects therein which were imposed on Cape, (3) the Commission erred in considering the allegations of the complainants\u2019 Statement of Position as a complaint without having granted leave for the filing of an amended complaint or service as required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>in former Commission Rule 34 (49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1100.34, now amended to 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1100.32), and in rejecting the Offer to Satisfy the Complaint and, (4) the decision of the Commission, and its refusal to institute a general investigation, improperly singles out Cape for requirements inconsistent with the requirements of those similarly situated, improperly fails to take into consideration the anticompetitive effects of the order issued, and fails to sufficiently disclose the basis for its decision to permit intelligent review thereof by the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-4\">[Brief of Petitioner, pp. 14, 30, 40, 41.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3\">We believe that this review can be properly disposed of by considering two fundamental aspects of this dispute. The first involves the issue of Cape\u2019s alleged failure to exercise adequate control and responsibility over its certificated operations. The second involves the issue whether the terms and provisions of the offer of settlement should have been accepted by the ICC and appropriate orders entered thereon rather than permitting further enforcement proceedings to be pursued before the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Cape insists that its \u201cactivities,\u201d i. e., its operational arrangements with its agents do not violate the Act or any law because the use of leased vehicles is specifically authorized, the use of agents is implicitly recognized by the ICC and, most significantly, \u201c . . . there is not a shred of evidence . . . that the shipping public is not receiving the service authorized under Cape\u2019s certificates; that the organizational structure as opposed to Cape\u2019s ability to compete \u2014 is in any way harming the complainants; or that the Commission\u2019s powers of enforcement are in any way impaired.\u201d [Brief of Cape, pp. 15, 16.]</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">Cape relies substantially on <em>Thomson v. United </em>States, 321 U.S. 19, 64 S.Ct. 392, 88 L.Ed. 513 (1944). Cape misses the mark. The issue in <em>Thomson </em>was not akin to the issue presented here. Even so, the Supreme Court held in <em>Thomson </em>that the railroad, which employed certain motor vehicle operations as an integral part of its railway service, must maintain rigid control:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-11\">[The Railway] fixes the truck schedules so as to coordinate them with the rail schedules and designates the amount and particular shipments of freight to be moved. The motor vehicle operators issue no billing of any kind and solicit none of the freight transported for the railroad. They have no contractual or other relationships with either the shippers or the receivers of the freight. Their trucks are loaded at the freight stations by railroad employees, sometimes assisted by the truck drivers. After a truck is loaded a manifest is issued by the railroad\u2019s agent . . .; upon delivery of the freight to another railroad freight station the manifest is signed by another railroad agent .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Asm\">321 U.S. at pp. 21, 22, 64 S.Ct. at p. 393. The provisions and actual operation of the contracts with the [motor vehicle] operators demonstrate the railroad\u2019s rigid control over the movement of the freight and its retention of full responsibility to the shippers. The operators are \u201cindependent\u201d only by grace of contract nomenclature. By any realistic test they are mere aids in carrying out a part of the railroad\u2019s coordinated rail-motor freight service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-14\">321 U.S. at p. 25, 64 S.Ct. at p. 395.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-15\">49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 304(a)(1) provides that it shall be the duty of the Commission:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-16\">(1) To regulate common carriers by motor vehicle and to that end the Commission may establish reasonable requirements with respect to continuous and adequate service, transportation of baggage and express, uniform systems of accounts, records, and reports, preservation of records, qualifications and maximum hours of service of employees, and safety of operations and equipment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-17\">49 CFR \u00a7 1057 contains the ICC\u2019s leasing regulations, which require that the ICC approve the <em>form of a lease </em>to insure that the equipment is under the actual control of the lessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>In <em>Transamerican Freight v. Brada Miller, etc., </em>423 U.S. 28, 96 S.Ct. 229, 46 L.Ed.2d 169 (1975) the Court was concerned with the \u201ccontrol and responsibility\u201d requirement of the ICC\u2019s equipment leasing regulation, 49 CFR \u00a7 1057.3(a) (1975). The narrow question was whether the ICC\u2019s \u201ccontrol and responsibility\u201d requirement prohibited, as a matter of public policy, an agreement between the carriers whereby the lessor (Brada Miller Freight Systems, Inc.), which was not a certified ICC carrier, agreed to indemnify and hold harmless Transamerican Freight Lines, Inc., which held authority from the ICC to serve the points involved:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-6\">. from any and all claims, suits, losses, fines or other expenses arising out of, based upon or incurred because of injury to any person or persons, or damage to property sustained or which may be alleged to have been sustained by reason of any negligence or alleged negligence on the part of [Brada Miller], its agents, servants or employees . Nothing in this Paragraph 9 contained shall be construed to in anywise limit the liability of [Transamerican] to the public in connection with the use of said equipment under this agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">423 U.S. at p. 31, 96 S.Ct. at p. 231.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">Paragraph 4 of the same agreement provided that during the term of the lease, Transamerican \u201c . . . shall have the control and responsibility for the operation of said equipment in respect to the public, shippers and Interstate Commerce Commission . . . .\u201d 423 U.S. at p. 31, 96 S.Ct. at p. 231.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-12\">While a leased vehicle was being operated under the lease agreement, an accident occurred. Suit was filed against the two carriers. Transamerican settled the claim and thereafter sought recovery against Miller under the indemnification clause. The District Court granted Miller\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the ground that the indemnification clause contravened ICC regulation 49 CFR \u00a7 1057.43(a) (1975) which requires that lease agreements between regulated carriers must contain a written understanding that \u201ccontrol and responsibility for the operation of the equipment shall be that of the lessee.\u201d The court of appeals affirmed. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that the indemnification agreement does not contravene the ICC\u2019s control-and-responsibility requirement in that the control over the vehicle did remain with Transamerican and that the furnishing of Miller\u2019s driver involved only ministerial control and not a delegation of responsibility for the shipment. Further, the Court held that the indemnification provision did not conflict with ICC safety regulations, because such a provision, which places ultimate financial responsibility on the negligent lessor, may tend to increase rather than diminish protection of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-14\">In <em>American Trucking Associations, Inc. v. United States, </em>344 U.S. 298, 73 S.Ct. 307, 97 L.Ed. 337 (1953), the Supreme Court considered, in part, ICC Rule 207.4, 52 M.C.C. 744, which dealt with augmenting equipment obtained by an authorized common carrier from a carrier not so authorized. The rule permitted the authorized carrier to contract, lease or otherwise arrange for the use of equipment from one not so authorized. The authorized carrier was permitted to contract, lease or otherwise arrange for the use of equipment from one not authorized provided that the \u201c . exclusive possession, control and use of the equipment, and . . . complete assumption of responsibility in respect thereto [be assumed] by the authorized carrier.\u201d The appellant, American Trucking Associations, Inc., contended that the Interstate Commerce Act (as distinguished from ICC Rule 207.4, <em>supra) </em>does not permit the ICC to control, regulate or affect leasing practices nor does the Act grant any implied power to do so. The Supreme Court rejected these challenges and upheld Rule 207.4 as within the power of the ICC:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-16\">[Appellants] . . . urge upon us the fact that nowhere in the Act is there an express delegation of power to control, regulate or affect leasing practices, and . there is no direct implication of such power. ... As a matter of principle, we might agree with appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>lants\u2019 contention if we thought it a reasonable canon of interpretation that the draftsmen of acts delegating agency powers, as a practical and realistic matter, can or do include specific consideration of every evil to be corrected. But no great acquaintance with practical affairs is required to know that such prescience, either in fact or in the minds of Congress, does not exist. ... Its very absence, moreover, is precisely one of the reasons why regulatory agencies such as the Commission are created, for it is the fond hope of their authors that they bring to their work the expert\u2019s familiarity with industry conditions which members of the delegating legislatures cannot be expected to possess. . . . The purpose of the rules is to protect the industry from practices detrimental to the maintenance of sound transportation services consistent with the regulatory system. . . . Section 204(a)(2) requires the Commission to impose rules relating to safety of operations for vehicles and drivers. These are likewise threatened by the unrestricted use of nonowned equipment by the common carriers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\">344 U.S. at pp. 309, 310, 73 S.Ct. at pp. 314.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">The ALJ found, in summary, based upon the record that Cape\u2019s \u201cagents\u201d had:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-8\">(1) assumed the cost of vehicle operation and maintenance, insurance premiums, and telephone service, (2) furnished officer and terminal facilities, (3) hired and fired employees, (4) withheld employee deductions, (5) solicited traffic, (6) picked up and delivered freight, (7) prepared freight bills, (8) controlled the dispatching of vehicles, (9) received customer calls for service, (10) collected freight charges, and (11) investigated, paid, and maintained files for loss and damage claims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">Cape does not directly challenge these findings. It does, however, contend that because the use of leased vehicles is authorized by law, the use of agents is thus implicitly recognized by the Act. Further, Cape argues that inasmuch as the nature of a carrier\u2019s arrangements for terminal and office facilities and like services are not subject to regulation, the inquiry should be directed only to one issue: Has the shipping service the public is entitled to as authorized under Cape\u2019s certificates been fully, properly and adequately performed and supplied? We agree with Cape\u2019s assertion that the record <em>does not </em>evidence that the services required under Cape\u2019s authorities have not been fully, properly and adequately performed. Even so, the record reflects that Cape recognizes the validity of the ICC\u2019s requirement that it (Cape) exercise direct \u201ccontrol and responsibility.\u201d This recognition, in our view, is evidenced implicitly by reason of Cape\u2019s offer of settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">We hold that the ICC requirements of \u201ccontrol and responsibility\u201d are valid and enforceable. <em>Trsnsamerican Freight </em>v. <em>Brada Miller, supra; Gilbertville Trucking Co., Inc. v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 115, 83 S.Ct. 217, 9 L.Ed.2d 177 (1962); <em>American Trucking Associations, Inc. v. United States, supra; Performance of Motor Common Carrier Service by Riss &amp; Co., Inc., </em>48 M.C.C. 327 (1948); <em>Diamond Transportation System, Inc. Ext.-Wis. and Okla. Origin, </em>117 M.C.C. 7 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-12\">We further hold that the ICC finding that Cape failed to exercise and maintain the necessary control over and the operational responsibility relative to its performance of transportation services under its subject certificates in violation of the provisions of 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 304(a)(1) and 316(b), and 49 CFR \u00a7 1057 is supported by substantial evidence and is otherwise lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-14\">We turn now to the issue whether the ICC properly exercised its discretion in entering the order upholding the findings and recommendations of the ALJ and its Division I, requiring Cape to cease and desist from those operations found to be unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-15\">In <em>Gilbertville Trucking Co., Inc. v. United States, supra, </em>the Supreme Court ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>served that the power of the ICC is <em>corrective </em>rather than <em>punitive, </em>and that the justification for the remedy is the removal of the violation. The court there observed, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-5\">. the choice of remedy is as important a decision as the initial construction of the statute and finding of a violation. The court or agency charged with this choice has a heavy responsibility to tailor the remedy to the particular facts of each case so as to best effectuate the remedial objectives just described. Cf. <em>Hecht Co. v. Bowles, </em>321 U.S. 321, 329-331, 64 S.Ct. 587, 88 L.Ed. 754.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATP\">371 U.S. at p. 130, 83 S.Ct. at p. 226.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">We are not here concerned with deficiencies or inadequacies of service. The record is clear, of course, that Cape has not engaged in any \u201cwillful failure\u201d to comply with the Act. No contention is made that Cape\u2019s <em>actual service </em>rendered, notwithstanding its lack of adequate \u201ccontrol and responsibility\u201d has been other than adequate, economical and efficient in meeting the public interest. Under these circumstances, the discretion to be exercised by the ICC in determining the proper remedy required of Cape to satisfy the \u201cpublic convenience and necessity\u201d must be scrutinized based upon the entire record leading to the choice made. <em>Burlington Truck Lines v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 156, 83 S.Ct. 239, 9 L.Ed.2d 207 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">Central to the issue here under consideration, in our view, is the following determination made by the ALJ following the hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-9\">VIII.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-10\">In order to insure that the violations cease, there will be entered herein an order requiring Cape to cease and desist all operations found herein to be unlawful. <em>Also, Cape is hereby admonished to discontinue all operations conducted through the use of \u201cagents,\u201d and henceforth its operations must utilize company employees, company terminals, and company vehicles, all of which are under the direct control and supervision of Cape. </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-11\">[R., Appendix, pp. 240, 241.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">Even though it appears that the \u201cblanket\u201d prohibition against use of \u201cagents\u201d above referred to was thereafter tempered by the ALJ\u2019s reference to the <em>Riss </em>case for \u201cguidance and further adherence\u201d in relation to the control-responsibility requirement, still the all-encompassing admonishment and command above quoted was in fact adopted <em>without modification </em>by the ICC. We hold that this all-encompassing prohibition, as commanded by the ALJ and thereafter adopted by the ICC, is clearly erroneous, arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-13\">It is established that the use of non-owned equipment and non-employee personnel by authorized carriers is not illegal and that the right of a carrier to augment its equipment and personnel by a lease agreement or other like arrangement is specifically authorized by 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 304(e) and 49 CFR \u00a7 1057. <em>See also: American Trucking Assn\u2019s v. United States, supra; Carolina Freight Carriers Corp. v. Pitt County Transportation Company, </em>492 F.2d 243 (4th Cir. 1974), <em>cert, denied, </em>423 U.S. 983, 96 S.Ct. 391, 46 L.Ed.2d 301 (1974); <em>Allstate Insurance Company v. Alterman Transport Lines, Inc., </em>465 F.2d 710 (5th Cir. 1972); <em>Alford v. Major, </em>470 F.2d 132 (7th Cir. 1972). The governing statutes and regulations were intended to assure that authorized, certificated carriers would be responsible <em>in fact, as well as in law, </em>for the use and maintenance of leased equipment and the supervision of personnel, such as drivers, supplied by the lessor. Thus, we believe that the effect of the ICC cease and desist requirements, which adopt the ALJ findings and conclusions <em>in toto, </em>is to deny Cape the use of agents under any circumstances in the course of its operations. The ICC erred in this regard. Beyond this, we hold that once the ICC had determined that Cape was not guilty of \u201cwillful failure\u201d to comply with the Act, the thrust or goal of the ICC\u2019s governing activities in the public interest should have been expeditiously di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>rected to remedies to be undertaken by Cape in order to meet the \u201ccontrol\u201d and \u201cresponsibility\u201d requirements. Surely, this could have been accomplished under the guidelines of the Offer of Settlement tendered by Cape to the ICC on January 28, 1975. That offer was accepted by the ICC\u2019s Bureau of Enforcement after it had conducted extensive investigations into Cape\u2019s operations, following the initial complaint filed against Cape. The terms of the \u201cOffer of Settlement\u201d are all-encompassing. They thus provide, in our view, an ideal springboard for administrative directives in specific areas relating to the degree and nature of the \u201ccontrol\u201d and \u201cresponsibility\u201d deemed necessary. We believe that the ICC\u2019s acceptance of the \u201cOffer of Settlement\u201d would have accomplished the proper <em>remedial goal </em>required. Such is evidenced, in our view, by the extensive changes made by Cape as reported to the Bureau of Enforcement on November 20, 1974, <em>supra. </em>Thus, we hold that the ICC abused its discretion when it refused to accept Cape\u2019s \u201cOffer of Settlement\u201d in accordance with the Bureau of Enforcement recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">The respective orders of the ICC here under review are, accordingly, set aside. The ICC is directed to undertake such further proceedings necessary to effect the acceptance of Cape\u2019s \u201cOffer of Settlement\u201d tendered on January 28, 1975, subject to such reasonable administrative directions, commands and advisements the ICC deems necessary in order to eliminate Cape\u2019s failure to exercise that degree of control and responsibility required for the proper performance of its operations under Cape\u2019s certificates and authorities contained in MC-134906 and Subs 1, 2, 4 and 5 thereunder.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
