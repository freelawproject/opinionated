Subsequently, the Omnibus Judgeship Bill, Public Law 95-486 (95th Congress), 92 Stat. 1629, was approved October 20, 1978 and none participated in this decision. Judges Hill, Fay, Rubin and Vance, who were not members of the Court at the time of the en banc consideration although afforded an opportunity to do so, did not desire to participate in this order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b625-25\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b625-26\">In <em>Muzquiz v. City of San Antonio, </em>5 Cir., 1975, 520 F.2d 993, a panel of this Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>held that the Board of Trustees of the policemen\u2019s and firemen\u2019s pension fund was a \u201cperson\u201d within the meaning of 42 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 1983. Having made this determination, the Court further found that plaintiff\u2019s claims of constitutional violations held no merit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">On rehearing en banc, 528 F.2d 499, this Court upheld the panel\u2019s result, but found (1) that neither the City nor the Board was a \u00a7 1983 \u201cperson,\u201d and (2) that we did not have jurisdiction over the individual members of the Board to require them to make payments from the fund to plaintiffs as restitution. The Supreme Court subsequently vacated our judgment and remanded the cause for our \u201cfurther consideration in light of <em>Monell v. Department of Social Services of New York, </em>436 U.S. 658 [98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611] (1978).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">We have done so and find that <em>Monell </em>should not change the result we originally reached. According to <em>Monell, </em>local governing bodies may now \u201cbe sued directly under \u00a7 1983 for monetary, declaratory, or injunctive relief where . . . the action that is alleged to be unconstitutional implements or executes a policy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision officially adopted and promulgated by that body\u2019s officers.\u201d 436 U.S. at 691, 98 S.Ct. at 2036, 56 L.Ed.2d 635.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Following this decision, we of course find the City of San Antonio and the Board of Trustees amenable to suit under \u00a7 1983, subject to establishing that the conduct under review satisfies the requirement of implementation or execution of a policy statement, regulation, or officially adopted decision promulgated by the governing body. We do not reach this issue since, assuming the requisite official binding nature of the questioned actions, the Court en banc did not disturb the panel\u2019s specific conclusion that no constitutional violations were established. <em>See </em>528 F.2d 499 at 500. Since the case was put en banc to resolve the \u00a7 1983 and related problems, the Court neither then nor now considers it appropriate to review the decision of the panel on the underlying merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">The City\u2019s and Board\u2019s new status as potentially suable parties does not change the result reached by the District Court, the panel, and the Court en banc to affirm the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b626-20\">. We also affirmed the District Court\u2019s dismissal of the claim against the City of San Antonio. 520 F.2d at 996.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
