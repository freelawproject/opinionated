Lawrence, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Georgia, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b732-21\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b732-22\">Appellant Magee seeks reversal after a conviction by a jury on one count of smuggling goods into the United States, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 545 (1976), and an additional count of conspiracy to do so under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-23\">The evidence at trial showed that Magee, traveling in a car driven by one Jenkins, sought to enter the United States from Canada after Jenkins had told the customs inspector that they had nothing to declare. On inspection, $1,400 worth of clothes, which Magee admitted he had purchased in Canada, were discovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-24\">Appellant\u2019s principal argument on appeal is that the regulation of the Customs Service was so overbroad and vague as to deny him due process. Our review of the statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 545 and two regulations, 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 148.11 and 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 123.3, indicates no such lack of specificity or overbreadth.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-25\">Further, the District Judge did not err in admitting statements of Magee\u2019s co-conspirator, Jenkins, and there was ample evidence to corroborate defendant\u2019s own admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>The judgments of conviction are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
