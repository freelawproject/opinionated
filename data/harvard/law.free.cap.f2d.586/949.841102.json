Zampano of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1046-15\">VAN GRAAFEILAND, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1046-16\">On June 24, 1977, Sperry Rand management proposed a slate of eleven candidates for election to the corporation\u2019s board at the July 1977 annual meeting. All of the candidates were incumbents, and together they had a total of sixty-four years of prior service as Sperry directors. All of them were also officers or directors of at least one other company, several serving on at least six different corporate boards. The slate as a whole had outside affiliations with at least forty companies. All of the foregoing information was contained in the proxy statements that Sperry sent to its shareholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-17\">One of management\u2019s candidates, appellee Finley, had been on the Sperry board since 1970. He was a director of five outside companies, including J. P. Stevens and Co., Inc., where he was Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. Plaintiff, a Sperry shareholder, sued to set aside Finley\u2019s election on the ground that Finley\u2019s biographical r\u00e9sum\u00e9 failed to include any information concerning labor disputes in which J. P. Stevens had been involved. Plaintiff contends that the omission of this material violated section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78n(a), and Rule 14a-9(a) of the Commission, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.14a-9(a). Rule 14a-9(a) prohibits solicitation by a proxy statement that is false or misleading with respect to a material fact or which omits to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>state a material fact needed to make other statements therein not false or misleading. The district court, finding that reasonable minds could not differ on the conclusion that the omissions complained of were not of material facts within the meaning of <em>TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., </em>426 U.S. 438, 96 S.Ct. 2126, 48 L.Ed.2d 757 (1976), and that there were no material issues of fact to be resolved, granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and dismissed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s appeal from that order was argued in June 1978, one month before the expiration of Finley\u2019s one-year term of office. Since then, another election has been held. Although the question of mootness was not an issue at the time of argument, it must now be considered. To avoid mootness, the controversy between the parties must remain alive up to the final moment of appellate disposition. <em>Lunz v. Preiser, </em>524 F.2d 289, 290 (2d Cir. 1975). Moreover, because mootness is a jurisdictional question, this Court must consider it, even though it has not been raised by one of the parties. <em>North Carolina v. Rice, </em>404 U.S. 244, 245-46, 92 S.Ct. 402, 30 L.Ed.2d 413 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-6\">The factual situation in the instant ease is similar to the one which existed in <em>Browning Debenture Holders\u2019 Committee v. DASA Corp., </em>524 F.2d 811 (2d Cir. 1975). There, as here, plaintiffs alleged that defendant\u2019s shareholders\u2019 meeting had been conducted illegally because of misleading proxy statements. Because the directors elected at the disputed meeting had completed their terms and had been reelected prior to trial, the issues involving the legality of the meeting were held to be moot. In <em>Browning, </em>however, plaintiffs sought only declaratory relief, and the Court carefully distinguished between declaratory and injunctive relief, pointing out that the latter applies significant sanctions and therefore deters future improper conduct. Here, plaintiff seeks an injunction restraining Finley \u201cfrom sitting on the Sperry Board unless and until he shall be elected thereto pursuant to a proper and lawful shareholder vote.\u201d Had the district judge decided that plaintiff was entitled to injunctive relief, he might well have issued an order applicable to future, as well as past, elections. A suit for an injunction seeks not only to eliminate the effect of past wrongdoing, but also to prevent its recurrence. <em>United States v. W. T. Grant Co., </em>345 U.S. 629, 632 -33, 73 S.Ct. 894, 97 L.Ed. 1303 (1953); <em>Swift &amp; Co. v. United States, </em>276 U.S. 311, 326, 48 S.Ct. 311, 72 L.Ed. 587 (1928). The district court has a wide range of discretion in framing its decree to afford complete relief. <em>See United States v. Crescent Amusement Co., </em>323 U.S. 173, 185, 65 S.Ct. 254, 89 L.Ed. 160 (1944). We conclude, therefore, that the dispute between the parties is not moot and proceed to a consideration of the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-8\">Plaintiff did not contend in the district court that Stevens\u2019 labor problems or Finley\u2019s presence on Sperry\u2019s board had had any adverse effect on Sperry\u2019s business.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district judge found that plaintiff presented no support, other than speculation, for her contention that Stevens\u2019 activities attributable to Finley would have an adverse effect in the future. Citing <em>Prettner v. Aston, </em>339 F.Supp. 273, 291-92 (D.Del.1972), he held that plaintiff\u2019s claim of proxy irregularities could not be based upon mere speculation. The district judge felt that, if Sperry\u2019s proxy solicitations contained information of the sort demanded by plaintiff concerning every outside corporation with which Sperry\u2019s candidates were affiliated, the solicitations would swamp shareholders in an \u201cavalanche of trivial information \u2014 a result that is hardly conducive to informed decisionmaking.\u201d <em>TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., supra, </em>426 U.S. at 448 49, 96 S.Ct. at 2132.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-9\">Plaintiff\u2019s affidavits in opposition to defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion contain no allegations that Finley was disqualified per se from serving as a Sperry director. <em>See Missouri Portland Cement Co. </em>v. <em>H. K. Porter and Co., </em>406 F.Supp. 984, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>991 (E.D.Mo.1975), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>535 F.2d 388 (8th Cir. 1976); <em>Lyman </em>v. <em>Standard Brands, Inc., </em>364 F.Supp. 794, 797-98 (E.D.Pa.1973); <em>cf. SEC v. Kalvex Inc., </em>425 F.Supp. 310, 315 (S.D.N.Y.1975); <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Penn Central Co., </em>336 F.Supp. 655, 658 (E.D.Pa.1971). Moreover, no charge is made that Finley has played an improper role in Sperry\u2019s labor negotiations or that he has deviated in any manner from his duty of unswerving loyalty to the best interests of Sperry. The gravamen of plaintiff\u2019s claim is simply that Finley\u2019s relationship with Stevens will result in injury to Sperry\u2019s corporate image and business. Despite the fact that Stevens\u2019 labor troubles have persisted since 1963, this has admittedly not yet occurred. Sperry\u2019s failure to discuss the speculative possibility that adverse effects might occur in the future does not fit readily, therefore, within the concept of a materially misleading omission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-4\">Sperry\u2019s lack of discussion must be viewed in the light of the fact that Stevens\u2019 labor difficulties were matters of general public knowledge. Affidavits submitted by both parties show that these difficulties were reported countrywide in the press and on radio and television, were discussed in Congress, and were analyzed in published administrative and judicial opinions; that a nationwide consumer boycott was being conducted against Stevens, accompanied by massive media advertising.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Clearly, all this was information already in the public domain. <em>Johnson v. Wiggs, </em>443 F.2d 803, 806 (5th Cir. 1971); see <em>SEC v. Bausch &amp; Lomb, Inc., </em>565 F.2d 8, 17 (2d Cir. 1977). Although the underlying philosophy of federal securities regulations is that of full disclosure, <em>Kennecott Copper Corp. </em>v. <em>Curtiss-Wright Corp., </em>584 F.2d 1195, 1199 (2d Cir. 1978), \u201cthere is no duty to disclose information to one who reasonably should already be aware of it.\u201d <em>Myzel v. Fields, </em>386 F.2d 718, 736 (8th Cir. 1967), <em>cert, denied, </em>390 U.S. 951, 88 S.Ct. 1043, 19 L.Ed.2d 1143 (1968); <em>see Missouri Portland Cement Co. </em>v. <em>Cargill, Inc., </em>498 F.2d 851, 873 (2d Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>419 U.S. 883, 95 S.Ct. 150, 42 L.Ed.2d 123 (1974). A party\u2019s \u201creasonable belief that the other party already has access to the facts should excuse him from new disclosures which reasonably appear to be repetitive.\u201d <em>Frigitemp Corp. v. Financial Dynamics Fund, Inc., </em>524 F.2d 275, 282 (2d Cir. 1975). Likewise, where information is equally available to both parties, a defendant should not be held liable to the plaintiff under the securities laws for failure to disclose. <em>Hafner v. Forest Laboratories, Inc., </em>345 F.2d 167, 168 (2d Cir. 1965); <em>Walpert v. Bart, </em>280 F.Supp. 1006, 1015 (D.Md.1967), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>390 F.2d 877 (4th Cir. 1968). As the district court held, any reasonable shareholder who was not already familiar with Stevens\u2019 labor problems had this information readily available to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-7\">The essential facts were not in dispute. We agree with the district court that reasonable minds could not differ as to the immateriality of the omissions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because remand would lead only to a purposeless and expensive trial, <em>see Williams v. McAllister Bros. Inc., </em>534 F.2d 19, 21 (2d Cir. 1976); <em>United States v. Matheson, </em>532 F.2d 809, 813 (2d Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>429 U.S. 823, 97 S.Ct. 75, 50 L.Ed.2d 185 (1976); <em>Steinberg v. Carey, </em>439 F.Supp. 1233, 1241-42 (S.D.N.Y. 1977), the order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1047-10\">. Between 1970 and 1977, Sperry\u2019s net income, earnings, and dividends more than doubled.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1048-5\">. In <em>NLRB v. J. P. Stevens &amp; Co., </em>563 F.2d 8. 13 (2d Cir. 1977), we referred to Stevens as a \u201cnotorious\u201d violator of the labor laws. This , was not a careless choice of words. \u201cNotorious\u201d means \u201cbeing or constituting something commonly known\u201d or \u201cwell known\u201d. Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1545 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1048-9\">. Because the alleged omissions were not materially misleading, plaintiff cannot create a cause of action by alleging that Sperry\u2019s board did not give proper consideration to the omitted facts before recommending Finley\u2019s reelection. Undoubtedly, there were numerous immaterial facts which the board did not consider before making its recommendation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
