Upon Wagner\u2019s motion, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> granted summary judgment, dismissing the complaint upon the ground that it failed to meet the time limitation jurisdictional prerequisite of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e). Rudolph appeals, alleging her claim was timely filed. We affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-12\">Rudolph was dismissed from her job with Wagner in February 1973 for \u201cinsufficient productivity.\u201d Pursuant to the labor contract entered into between Wagner and Local 1104, International Union of Electric, Radio and Machine Workers, AFL-CIO, of which Rudolph was a member, she filed a union grievance in February 1973 protesting that there was not \u201ccause\u201d for discharge as required by the labor contract. The resolution of the dispute was submitted to arbitration in December 1973 and on April 22, 1974, the arbitrator upheld Rudolph\u2019s dismissal on the basis of insufficient productivity. On May 15, 1974, Rudolph filed a charge against Wagner with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), alleging sex discrimination by Wagner. On January 10, 1977, Rudolph received her right to sue letter from the EEOC and on March 28, 1977, she filed suit in district court, alleging that Wagner violated various provisions of Title VII, including failure to remedy the effects of all the discriminatory practices alleged. The district court dismissed Rudolph\u2019s action for her failure to file her charge within 180 days of her discharge as required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e): \u201cA charge under this section shall be filed within one hundred and eighty days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-17\">Rudolph claims on appeal that the arbitrator\u2019s decision, issued pursuant to the contractual labor agreement, upholding the discharge, is the \u201coccurrence\u201d for purposes of section 2000e-5(e), and thus her claim was filed within 180 days of the occurrence. This argument has implicitly been rejected by this court,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and has specifically been rejected by the Supreme Court in <em>International Union of Electrical Workers, Local 790 v. Robbins &amp; Myers, Inc., </em>429 U.S. 229, 234-35, 97 S.Ct. 441, 50 L.Ed.2d 427 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-18\">Rudolph alleges her fact situation can be distinguished from <em>Electrical Workers </em>primarily because Rudolph considered the arbitration decision to be the final disposition, and thus the \u201coccurrence,\u201d and she did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>consider the February 1973 discharge as final. However, this claim amounts to no more than the bare assertion raised by plaintiffs in <em>Electrical Workers. </em>There the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-4\">Throughout the proceedings both in the District Court and in the Court of Appeals, both sides appear to have assumed, as did the courts, that the date of discharge was October 25, 1971 [herein February 1973]. There being no indication that either party viewed the October 25 [herein February 1973] discharge as anything other than \u201cfinal,\u201d there is certainly no reason for us to now torture this mutual understanding by accepting the bare assertions to the contrary raised by petitioners for the first time before this Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 235, 97 S.Ct. at 446 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">The Supreme Court did state that the parties may have a contractual understanding that confirmation from higher management of a recommendation for discharge would be considered as the relevant statutory \u201coccurrence,\u201d but that is clearly not the case here.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It was understood by Rudolph that she was fired. The labor agreement only provided for a contractual appeal route. It did not render her discharge provisional.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rudolph was dismissed from her employment in February 1973, and that was the occurrence for purposes of the Title VII limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">Rudolph also makes the allegation that Wagner failed to remedy the discharge during the grievance and arbitration process. This \u201ccontinuing violation\u201d claim is without merit, as it is simply a restatement of Rudolph\u2019s allegation that the February 1973 discharge was not the occurrence for Title VII purposes. \u201cTermination of employment either through discharge or resignation is not a \u2018continuing\u2019 violation. It puts at rest the employment discrimination because the individual is no longer an employee.\u201d <em>Olson v. Rembrandt Printing Co., </em>511 F.2d 1228, 1234 (8th Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">Rudolph\u2019s second claim on appeal is that even if the February 1973 discharge was the occurrence for purposes of Title VII, pursuing her grievance in accord with the labor contract tolled the time period for filing with the EEOC. Rudolph argues that <em>Electrical Workers, </em>which held to the contrary, should not be applied retroactively to her case.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-12\">The standards to be considered in regard to retroactivity were articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, </em>404 U.S. 97, 92 S.Ct. 349, 30 L.Ed.2d 296 (1971). The major factors are whether the court ruling in question was of first impression or \u201cclearly foreshadowed,\u201d whether the retroactivity will further or retard the purpose of the rule, and whether inequities will result by retroactive application of the rule.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>Although the discussion in <em>Electrical Workers </em>is not articulated as a discussion of the <em>Chevron </em>standards, the Supreme Court considers the substance of each of the <em>Chevron </em>standards in reaching its decision. Initially the Court notes: \u201cWe think that petitioners\u2019 arguments for tolling the statutory period for filing a claim with the EEOC during the pendency of grievance or arbitration procedures under the collective-bargaining contract are virtually foreclosed by our decisions in <em>Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., </em>415 U.S. 36, [94 S.Ct. 1011, 39 L.Ed.2d 147] (1974), and in <em>Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, </em>421 U.S. 454, [95 S.Ct. 1716, 44 L.Ed.2d 295] (1975).\u201d <em>International Union of Electrical Workers, Local 790 </em>v. <em>Robbins &amp; Myers, Inc., supra, </em>429 U.S. at 236, 97 S.Ct. at 446. Although we recognize that these cases occurred after Rudolph\u2019s 180 day period for filing with the EEOC had expired, the basis on which this foreshadowing exists is still applicable. The Court in <em>Electrical Workers </em>points out that the legislative history of Title VII is quite clear in revealing the congressional intent to \u201csupplement, rather than supplant\u201d existing remedies for employment discrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 236, n.8, 97 S.Ct. 441. The Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Electrical Workers </em>was not a surprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">At the time of Rudolph\u2019s discharge, several courts had dealt directly with the tolling issue herein, and had indicated that the grievance procedure tolls the Title VII filing period.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The primary case holding this was <em>Culpepper v. Reynolds Metals Co., </em>421 F.2d 888 (5th Cir. 1970). However, the only cases Rudolph cites that have occurred in courts within this circuit and upon which her attorney might have relied in deciding that the grievance system would toll the limitations period, are <em>Richard </em>v. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp., </em>469 F.2d 1249 (8th Cir. 1972), and <em>Lowry </em>v. <em>Whitaker Cable Corp., </em>348 F.Supp. 202 (W.D.Mo.1972), <em>affd, </em>472 F.2d 1210 (8th Cir. 1973). Both of these decisions dealt with the question of whether initially filing a complaint with the EEOC served to toll the running of the statutory time period while state proceedings were utilized. This is a sufficiently different issue; it does not provide the \u201cclear past precedent\u201d that <em>Chevron </em>mentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">At the time of Rudolph\u2019s discharge, the most Rudolph can claim is that she did not know from existing precedent in this circuit whether the grievance procedure would toll the time period for filing with the EEOC.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-12\">Even more importantly, under the facts of this case, is the fact that even when one considers the Culpepper line of cases, none of the cases Rudolph relies upon contain language that would have led her to believe that she was prevented from filing her sex discrimination claim with the EEOC. She does not allege that she was under this impression at the time of her discharge.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The <em>Electrical Workers </em>Court also discusses this fact in its opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-13\">In no way is this a situation in which a party has \u201cbeen prevented from asserting\u201d his or her rights, <em>Burnett v. New York Central R. Co., </em>380 U.S. [424], at 429 [85 S.Ct. 1050, 13 L.Ed.2d 941], There is no assertion that [plaintiff] was \u201cprevented\u201d from filing a charge with the EEOC within [the statutory time period]; indeed, it is conceded and even urged that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>she could have filed it the following day, had she so wished.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-5\"><em>International Union of Electrical Workers, Local 790 v. Robbins &amp; Myers, supra, </em>429 U.S. at 237 n.10, 97 S.Ct. at 447. <em>See generally id. </em>at 237-38, 97 S.Ct. 441.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">There were no cases that instructed Rudolph not to file her EEOC complaint at that time, and no cases within this circuit indicating that the grievance system tolls the EEOC time period for filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">The second part of the <em>Chevron </em>test is deciding whether retroactive application of <em>Electrical Workers </em>will further or retard the purpose of the rule announced in <em>Electrical Workers. </em>For example, in <em>Chevron, </em>the case in question included the ruling that state law rather than admiralty law applied in an action on a personal injury occurring on a fixed structure on the Outer Continental Shelf. \u201cA primary purpose underlying the absorption of state law as federal law,\u201d stated the <em>Chevron </em>Court, \u201cwas to aid injured employees by affording them comprehensive and familiar remedies.\u201d <em>Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, supra, </em>404 U.S. at 107-08, 92 S.Ct. at 356. Because retroactive application of the rule would have imposed a state statute of limitations and consequently deprived the plaintiff of any remedy, retroactive application would not have furthered the purpose of the new rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">In this case, the Supreme Court held that the grievance procedure will not toll the Title VII limitations filing period. The purpose of the Electrical Workers decision is to further the legislative intent of the Act: \u201c[T]he contractual rights under a collective-bargaining agreement and the statutory right provided by Congress under Title VII \u2018have legally independent origins and are equally available to the aggrieved employee[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>International Union of Electrical Workers, Local 790 v. Robbins &amp; Myers, Inc., supra, </em>429 U.S. at 236, 97 S.Ct. at 447, <em>quoting from Alexander </em>v. <em>Gardner-Denver Co., supra, </em>415 U.S. at 52, 94 S.Ct. 1011: \u201c \u2018Title VII was designed to supplement, rather than supplant, existing laws and institutions relating to employment discrimination.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>429 U.S. at 236 n.8, 97 S.Ct. at 447, <em>quoting from Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., supra, </em>415 U.S. at 48-49, 94 S.Ct. 1011. Thus retroactive application is not inconsistent with the purpose of the <em>Electrical Workers\u2019 </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">This, of course, leads us to the third of the <em>Chevron </em>standards \u2014 the equities involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-11\">The most obvious inequity with which Rudolph would be left, should this court give retroactive effect to <em>Electrical Workers, </em>is that she would not be able to pursue her sex discrimination claim under Title VII. This is admittedly contrary to the liberal and broad interpretation meant to be given remedial legislation such as Title VII. This same type of inequity resulted in <em>Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., </em>421 U.S. 454, 95 S.Ct. 1716, 44 L.Ed.2d 295 (1975), inasmuch as plaintiff therein was barred from filing a section 1981 claim when the Court ruled that filing with the EEOC did not toll the 1981 limitations period. There the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-12\">We note expressly how little is at stake here. We are not really concerned with the broad question whether these respondents can be compelled to conform their practices to the nationally mandated policy of equal employment opportunity. If the respondents, or any of them, presently are actually engaged in such conduct, there necessarily will be claimants who are in a position now either to file a charge under Title VII or to sue under \u00a7 1981. The question in this case is only whether this particular petitioner has waited so long that he has forfeited his right to assert his \u00a7 1981 claim in federal court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 467 n.13, 95 S.Ct. at 1723.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-14\">The <em>Johnson </em>language applies to this situation also. We are simply determining whether Rudolph waited too long before filing her Title VII claim. Our decision will deprive her of her Title VII remedy. Yet she did elect to pursue her contractual remedy \u2014 a remedy distinct from Title VII provisions \u2014 apparently at which time her dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>crimination claims were considered.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As we have already pointed out, Rudolph was never prevented from timely filing her EEOC charge. She chose to await the outcome of her contractual remedy before filing her Title VII claim. We endorsed the rationale of the <em>Culpepper </em>v. <em>Reynolds Metals Co., supra, </em>court in <em>Richard </em>v. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp., </em>469 F.2d 1249 (8th Cir. 1972), in that time limitations \u201c[are] meant to penalize only those who sleep on their rights and remedies, not one who actively attempts to settle his complaint by following the \u2018rules of the shop.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1252 n.10, <em>quoting from Culpepper </em>v. <em>Reynolds Metals Co., supra, </em>421 F.2d at 892. But even though Rudolph followed the rules of the shop in pursuing her contractual remedy, this does not provide a sufficient justification for her \u201cfailure to take the minimal steps necessary to preserve each claim independently.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Railway Express Agency, Inc., supra, </em>421 U.S. at 466, 95 S.Ct. at 1723.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">By not applying the <em>Electrical Workers </em>rule retroactively we would also defeat the purpose of the limitations period, which is to give notice to the employer. Even though Wagner acknowledges that Rudolph raised the sex discrimination charges in the grievance procedure, this did not give notice that she planned to pursue her complaint in a Title VII statutory claim. The grievance procedure is an independent remedy; a sex discrimination argument raised in a grievance procedure is not tantamount to the notice required by the Title VII period of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">There is obviously some inequity inherent in whatever choice we make. However, the inequity of leaving Rudolph unable to pursue her Title VII remedy is not so great when one considers that she was never prevented from filing her claim in a timely fashion with the EEOC. Thus, we find the <em>Chevron </em>standards to be better served by applying the <em>Electrical Workers </em>rule retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">We affirm the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b187-14\">.
