HEYMANN</p>\n<p id=\"Aq9\">Crim. A. No. 75-681.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-6\">United States District Court, E. D. Louisiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-8\">Oct. 6, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-9\">REASONS FOR RULING</p>\n<p id=\"Aqa\">CHARLES SCHWARTZ, District Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"ALD\">This matter came before the Court on October 5, 1977 on defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, founded upon the constitutional prohibition against putting a defendant twice in jeopardy for the same offense, at which time same was and is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-10\">Succinctly put, defendant argues that by integrating evidence utilized in a previous trial (Criminal No. 75-680)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> into a subsequent trial (Criminal No. 75-681),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the double jeopardy clause of the United States Constitution, Amendment V precludes further prosecution of charges emanating from the November 1974 incident. In particular, defendant avers that \u201cmultiple prosecutions\u201d and prosecutorial misconduct and neglect are prohibitive of a second trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-11\">Having carefully considered and thoroughly reviewed the record in its entirety, the Court specifically finds there to be no \u201cprosecutorial misconduct\u201d nor \u201cprosecutorial overreaching\u201d in the Government\u2019s prior prosecution of the defendant. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dinitz, </em>424 U.S. 600, 96 S.Ct. 1075, 47 L.Ed.2d 267 (1976); cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kessler, </em>530 F.2d 1246 (5th Cir. 1976). Accordingly, there is no constitutional impediment to allowing this matter to proceed forthwith by retrial. <em>Hardwick </em>v. <em>Doolittle, </em>558 F.2d 292, esp. 297 (5th Cir. 1977) . Moreover, the <em>per curiam </em>opinion of the Fifth Circuit indicates its awareness of the double jeopardy claim as its aversion to it was the predicate for its reversal. Further, the opinion especially sanctioned a retrial as the last paragraph of same concludes, \u201cThe judgment appealed from is reversed; the case is remanded for a new trial.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1136-13\">. In the previous trial, the district court granted defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal on charges stemming from Mr. Heymann\u2019s alleged April 1974 incident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1136-14\">. The subsequent trial held before Judge Robert J Kelleher resulted in a jury conviction on the charges arising out of the November 1974 incident, but was reversed per <em>curiam </em>by the Fifth Circuit (Summary Calendar # 76-2202) which held that the use of evidence of the April 1974 transaction was reversible error violative of the double jeopardy clause of the U.S. Constitution Amendment V. Accordingly, the Fifth Circuit reversed the conviction and \u201cremanded for a new trial.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1136-16\">JAMES C. HILL, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AFf\">specially concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-17\">I concur in the result in this case. I am not prepared to suggest, however, that a prosecutor\u2019s overreaching in revealing to the jury inadmissible and prejudicial facts or contentions which, under the law, ought to produce a mistrial can escape a double jeopardy bar to retrial merely because the district judge erroneously permits the prejudicial material to be presented to the jury and then erroneously declines to grant the mistrial motion which has been forced by prosecutorial misconduct. <em>See United States v. Dinitz, </em>424 U.S. 600, 611, 96 S.Ct. 1075, 47 L.Ed.2d 267 (1976); <em>United States v. Crouch, </em>566 F.2d 1311, 1317 (5th Cir. 1978); <em>United States v. Kessler, </em>530 F.2d 1246, 1256 (5th Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-19\">On the other hand, I am certainly not prepared to suggest that every error made by the trial court in the admission of evidence tendered by the government would bar a retrial even though the evidence thus admitted ought to have produced a mistrial. Such a holding would be at odds with the general rule that a mistrial granted at the defendant\u2019s insistence will ordinarily not preclude a retrial on double jeopardy grounds unless the mistrial motion was forced upon the defendant by prosecutorial or judicial overreaching \u201cmotivated by bad faith or undertaken to harass or prejudice.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1041\">*1041</page-number>Lee v. <em>United States, </em>432 U.S. 23, 32, 97 S.Ct. 2141, 2147, 53 L.Ed.2d 80 (1977); <em>United States v. Dinitz, </em>424 U.S. at 611-12, 96 S.Ct. 1075; <em>United States v. Jorn, </em>400 U.S. 470, 485, 91 S.Ct. 547, 27 L.Ed.2d 543 (1971); <em>United States v. Crouch, </em>566 F.2d at 1316\u2014 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-5\">I view the error here to be of the sort not involving overreaching. The retrial of this defendant does not amount to double jeopardy.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
