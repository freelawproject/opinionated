He rarely employs any help other than himself. Occasionally he hires part-time help.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-17\">Plaintiff applied for union membership in 1960 and 1964. The defendant, Sheet Metal Workers Local 232 (Local 232), rejected plaintiff\u2019s application because plaintiff operated his shop without employees. Since that time, according to plaintiff, Local 232 has intimidated building contractors to cease dealing with him. Further, plaintiff claims that the Pendleton Oregon Labor Council, an unincorporated association (Labor Council), of which defendant is a member, placed plaintiff\u2019s name on a \u201cDo Not Patronize\u201d list which was published in a local newspaper. These two actions by defendant, plaintiff contends, constitute an unfair labor practice in violation of federal labor law.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-18\">Plaintiff filed an action against defendant and several other unions. Plaintiff joined the other unions based upon the acts of their agents on the Labor Council. Plaintiff claimed that defendants violated the secondary boycott provisions of the Labor Management Relations Act by the commission of the alleged unfair labor practices. Further, plaintiff contended that defendants committed the common law torts of defamation and business disparagement.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-19\">In response to plaintiff\u2019s action, defendants filed motions for summary judgment. The district court granted summary judgment and dismissed the action as to all defendants except Local 232 and the Labor Council. Regarding Local 232 and the Labor Council, the court granted partial summary judgment. The court held that publication of the \u201cDo Not Patronize\u201d list was not actionable; it determined that federal labor law preempted any claim of defamation or business disparagement based under state law; and it also found that federal labor law preempted plaintiff\u2019s punitive damages claim. Summary judgment was denied on a statute of limitations argument and a challenge to the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">The court must determine the propriety of the district court\u2019s ruling. Such determination requires an examination of the following questions as to the granting of summary judgment:</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">1. Are the unions represented on the Labor Council liable for actions of the council?</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">2. Could the publication of plaintiff\u2019s name on a \u201cDo Not Patronize\u201d list constitute an unfair labor practice?</p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">3. Does the court have jurisdiction to hear plaintiff\u2019s state law claims of defamation and business disparagement and, consequently, to award punitive damages to plaintiff?</p>\n<p id=\"b789-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b789-10\">1. UNION LIABILITY FOR LABOR COUNCIL ACTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"ADx\">Each named defendant union had a representative seated on the Labor Council. Plaintiff claims that principles of agency demand that each union be liable for the Labor Council\u2019s acts through its representative. Because the Labor Council placed plaintiff\u2019s name on a \u201cDo Not Patronize\u201d list, plaintiff contends that each union must, therefore, be liable for damages resulting from the publication.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-11\">In <em>Laborers and Hod Carriers Local No. 341 v. NLRB, </em>564 F.2d 834 (9th Cir. 1977), the Ninth Circuit addressed the question of union liability for the acts of its agents. The court stated that \u201c[cjommon law agency principles govern . . . therefore, implied or apparent authority is sufficient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 839.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-13\">Similarly, in <em>NLRB v. International Longshoremen\u2019s and Warehousemen\u2019s Union, Local 10, </em>283 F.2d 558 (9th Cir. 1960), the Ninth Circuit applied common law agency principles to a labor dispute. In this particular case, union stewards fired certain longshoremen. The longshoremen brought an action against the union. The court held that the Union was responsible for the steward\u2019s acts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-17\">\u201cTaft-Hartley rendered common law principles of agency equally applicable to both labor and management groups.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-18\"><em>Id. </em>at 563.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-19\">\u201c[Only] when an agent performs an act within the general scope of employment but with no intention to further the interests of his principal, the principal is not responsible for the agents\u2019s conduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJI\"><em>Id. </em>at 567.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-20\">In the instant case, defendants\u2019 agents seated on the Labor Council were acting within the scope of their employment and in the interests of the union which they represented. Thus, defendants are potentially liable under the law. However, an examination of the legal principles governing the Labor Council\u2019s purported illegal acts indicates that the lower court properly granted summary judgment because the Labor Council acted within the scope of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-21\">2. \u201cDO NOT PATRONIZE\u201d LISTING AS AN UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE</p>\n<p id=\"b789-22\">Plaintiff claims that the Labor Council\u2019s inclusion of plaintiff\u2019s shop on the \u201cDo Not Patronize\u201d list constituted a violation of section 8(b)(4) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(b)(4), for which damages are available under section 303 of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 187.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-23\">Plaintiff concedes that the listing would be protected under the publicity proviso to section 8(b)(4)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> if a labor dispute existed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>between him and Local 232. To avoid this result, he contends that there was no labor dispute. He argues that \u201cDo Not Patronize\u201d lists imply the presence of a dispute between the union and those listed; that that implication in this case was false; and thus that the list was neither \u201ctruthful\u201d publicity nor connected to a \u201cprimary dispute\u201d as required by the proviso.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">We disagree. There is no doubt on this record that plaintiff and Local 232 were engaged in a primary labor dispute. There was a history of discussion between both sides regarding the employment situation in plaintiff\u2019s furnace shop. Local 232 sought to persuade plaintiff to hire union members. When he did not, the union resorted to the \u201cDo Not Patronize\u201d advertisement. Under the broad statutory definition,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> this was a \u201clabor dispute\u201d as a matter of law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Plaintiff makes much of one exchange in the depositions in which the union business agent concedes that Local 232 had no dispute with plaintiff. Read in context, the concession is more ambiguous than plaintiff would allow. More important, whether a labor dispute existed is a question of law which the court must answer from the whole record. The union officer\u2019s opinion in a deposition is not conclusive on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">Because a primary labor dispute did exist between plaintiff and Local 232, the \u201cDo Not Patronize\u201d advertisement contained no express or implied falsehoods. It therefore came within the protection of the publicity proviso. Thus it was not an unfair labor practice under section 8(b)(4) and could not give rise to a cause of action under section 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-11\">3. OREGON DEFAMATION AND BUSINESS DISPARAGEMENT CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b790-12\">Plaintiff also asserts as pendent to his section 303 action, claims of defamation and business disparagement under Oregon law.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-13\">Insofar as these claims are grounded on the publication of the \u201cDo Not Patronize\u201d list, federal labor law preempts them. Falsity is a <em>sine qua non </em>for the maintenance of state defamation or disparagement actions in the labor field. <em>Old Dominion Branch No. 496, National Assn. of Letter Carriers v. Austin, </em>418 U.S. 264, 283-84, 94 S.Ct. 2770, 41 L.Ed.2d 745 (1974). Circulating the name of plaintiff\u2019s shop on the \u201cDo Not Patronize\u201d list involved no express false statement. Nor was its implication that a labor dispute existed false or misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-14\">Insofar as plaintiff\u2019s defamation and disparagement claims rest on Local 232\u2019s alleged intimidation of Pendleton area building contractors, they are before this court prematurely. Summary judgment was denied on plaintiff\u2019s section 8(b)(4) claim arising out of that alleged conduct. The state law claims, to the extent they rely on that conduct, represent only alternate legal theories based on a set of facts common to the federal claim. As such, they do not constitute separate \u201cclaims\u201d for which certification under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b) is appropriate. <em>See CMAX Inc. v. Drewry Photocolor Corp., </em>295 F.2d 695, 697 (9th Cir. 1961). We therefore do not reach the preemption question with respect to the application of Oregon Law to the portion of the case still pending below.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>4. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Against the Labor Council and each union except Local 232, plaintiff\u2019s suit rested entirely on the publication of the \u201cDo Not Patronize\u201d list. That activity was protected from federal liability by the publicity proviso and from state liability by federal preemption of state remedies. The district court acted properly in granting summary judgment in these defendants\u2019 favor and in dismissing them from the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">Against Local 232, plaintiff alleged the publication of the \u201cDo Not Patronize\u201d list and, in addition, earlier acts of intimidation against plaintiff\u2019s customers. The district court treated these as two independent causes of action and granted summary judgment for Local 232 with respect to the list. This too was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b789-14\">. The proviso to section 8(b)(4) states:</p>\n<p id=\"b789-15\">Nothing contained in such paragraph shall be construed to prohibit <em>publicity, </em>other than picketing, for the purpose of <em>truthfully </em>advising the public, including consumers and members of a labor organization, that a product or products are produced by an <em>employer </em>with whom the labor organization has a <em>primary dispute </em>and are distributed by another employer, as long as such publicity does not have an effect of inducing any individual employed by any person other than the primary employer in the course of his employment to refuse to pick up, deliver, or transport any goods, or not to perform any services, at the establishment of the employer engaged in such distribution .</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(b) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">Plaintiff also concedes that the list would enjoy First Amendment protection if a labor dispute existed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b790-9\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(9) defines a \u201clabor dispute\u201d as</p>\n<p id=\"b790-10\">any controversy concerning terms, tenure or conditions of employment, or concerning the association or representation of persons in negotiating, fixing, maintaining, changing, or seeking to arrange terms or conditions of employment, regardless of whether the disputants stand in the proximate relation of employer and employee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b790-16\">. Rarely have courts found concerted union activity to fall outside this broad definition. Where the union acts for some arguably job-related reason and not out of pure social or political concerns, a \u201clabor dispute\u201d exists. <em>See Mountain Navigation Co. v. Seafarers, </em>348 F.Supp. 1298, 1302-3 (D.Wis.1971), and cases discussed therein.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
