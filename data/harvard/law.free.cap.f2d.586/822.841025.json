The Customs Court held that proper classification was under item 678.50, TSUS, as \u201cmachines not specially provided for * * *.\u201d We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">The imported goods are machines used to inspect drug-containing ampuls for foreign matter in the drug solution, and for defects in the ampuls.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">A conveying rod moves filled and sealed ampuls from an input chute to an inspection stage, where they are held by vacuum cups and rapidly rotated. Rotation is stopped abruptly and, before the contents cease swirling, an operator views the ampuls through a magnifying lens. Swirling mobilizes foreign matter, making it more readily visible. The ampuls are illuminated and viewed against panels of varying translucence. The operator separates unacceptable ampuls with push-button activated air jets. Acceptable ampuls are collected in a discharge chute. Customs classified the goods under TSUS item 710.90,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> modified by Presidential Proclamation 3822, 32 Fed.Reg. 19002, T.D. 68-9, as \u201c[ojptical measuring or checking instruments * * Corning advanced alternative claims for classification under item 678.50 TSUS,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as \u201c[mjachines not specially provided for * * and several other TSUS items not relevant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-21\">The Customs Court held that legislative history and the rule of <em>ejusdem generis </em>limited TSUS item 710.90 to optical instruments that measure or verify the accuracy of a measurement. Because the imported goods lacked those functions, the court held the government\u2019s classification improper. Whether the imported goods were optical instruments was not determined. Corning\u2019s claim under item 678.50 TSUS was sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-22\">\n<em>Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b920-23\">The issue is whether the Customs Court erred in finding that the goods were erroneously classified under item 710.90<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b921-4\">The superior heading to TSUS items 710.-86-710.90 provides for \u201c[o]ptical measuring or checking instruments * * *.\u201d The parties having agreed that the goods at issue are not \u201cmeasuring\u201d instruments, the controversy centers on whether the goods are optical \u201cchecking\u201d instruments.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">Absent contrary indications, we give tariff schedule language its common meaning. <em>John S. James a/c The Consolidated Packaging Corp. v. United States, </em>48 CCPA 75, 79, C.A.D. 768 (1961). \u201cCheck\u201d is defined as \u201cto inspect and ascertain the condition of esp. in order to determine that the condition is satisfactory: * * * investigate and ensure accuracy, authenticity, reliability, safety or satisfactory performance of * * *: to investigate and make sure about conditions or circumstances * * <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Applying that definition, \u201cchecking instruments\u201d clearly and unambiguously encompasses machines, like those imported here, that carry out steps in a process for inspecting ampuls to determine whether they conform to an imperfection-free standard. An ambiguity does not arise merely because additional dictionary meanings exist for \u201cchecking.\u201d If that were the test, most statutes would be ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-8\">Although \u201cchecking\u201d includes the concept of verifying a measurement, the common meaning of \u201cchecking\u201d is not limited to that concept. \u201cChecking,\u201d in the context of TSUS item 710.60-710.80, was found broad enough to include egg candling (i. e., viewing eggs against a light to detect staleness, blood clots, fertility, and growth) machines. <em>Bruce Duncan Co., Inc., a/c Staalkat of America, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>67 Cust.Ct. 430, C.D. 4312 (1971).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Limiting \u201cmeasuring or checking instruments\u201d to devices that measure or verify the accuracy of a measurement, improperly renders \u201cchecking\u201d superfluous, because verification of a measurement is itself a form of \u201cmeasuring.\u201d When possible, we must give effect to every word in a statute. <em>United States v. Gulf Oil Corp., </em>47 CCPA 32, 35, C.A.D. 725 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-12\">The Customs Court found support for its restrictive interpretation in the legislative history of TSUS item 710.90. However, creation of an ambiguity in an otherwise clear and unambiguous statute, by reference to legislative history, is improper. <em>American Customs Brokg. Co., Inc., a/c Hamakua Mill Co. v. United States, </em>433 F.2d 1340, 58 CCPA 45, 48, C.A.D. 1002 (1970); <em>Akawo, Morimura &amp; Co. v. United States, </em>6 Ct.Cust.App. 379, 381, T.D. 35921 (1915). The tariff provision at issue here is clear and unambiguous, and resort to legislative history is unnecessary and erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-13\">The superior heading, as construed above, defines the cumulative scope of inferior items 710.86-710.90 TSUS. The scope of the superior heading is not limited by language in the inferior items. The rule of <em>ejusdem generis </em>is inapplicable where, as here, the statute is clear and unambiguous. <em>Sandoz Chemical Works, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>50 CCPA 31, 35, C.A.D. 815 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-14\">We hold that Coming\u2019s imported machines were \u201cchecking\u201d instruments in the context of TSUS item 710.90, and, accordingly, that the Customs Court\u2019s contrary conclusion was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>The Customs Court expressly declined to decide whether the present machines are \u201coptical\u201d instruments within the meaning of TSUS item 710.90. The testimony respecting the function of the lens, and whether that function is subsidiary, as defined in headnote 3 to Part 2, Schedule 7,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> is in conflict. Because that issue is crucial in determining the correctness of the classification under TSUS item 710.90, and because the initial evaluation of conflicting testimony is the province of the Customs Court, we remand the case for consideration of that question.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b920-8\">.

In its motion for rehearing, the government argued that the presumption of correctness remained attached to its finding that the imported goods were \u201coptical,\u201d even though the court had held the goods not to be \u201cmeasuring or checking\u201d instruments. The government cited item 708.89, \u201c[o]ptical appliances and instruments not provided for * * * [o]ther, * * as an alternate classification more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>specific than item 678.50. The court rejected the alternative because the government had failed to assert it as an affirmative defense. On appeal, the government repeats the argument in maintaining that the court below erred in finding item 678.50 the proper classification. Absent a finding on whether the imported machine is an \u201coptical\u201d instrument, we do not reach the correctness of classification under item 678.50.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b921-10\">.

A machine essentially the same as that here involved, was found to have been correctly classified under item 710.90 in <em>Amaco, Inc. v. United States, </em>74 Cust.Ct. 172, C.D. 4602 (1975). The court below distinguished that case on the basis of plaintiffs concession in <em>Arnaco </em>that that machine was a checking instrument, the sole issue in <em>Arnaco </em>being whether the machine was an optical instrument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b922-11\">.
