C. Trading Company, Inc.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (\u201cN. C. Trading\u201d) to intervene in <em>Airco, Inc. v. United States, </em>Customs Court No. 76-3-00643. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-25\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b319-26\">Aireo, Inc. (\u201cAireo\u201d), an American manufacturer of ferrochrome, brought suit in the Customs Court under section 516(d) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, (19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516(d)),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> challenging a determination by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>the Secretary of the Treasury (\u201cSecretary\u201d) that bounties or grants are not being bestowed on ferrochrome imported from the Republic of South Africa within the meaning of Section 303 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, (19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1303).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">In its motion to intervene in the Customs Court, N. C. Trading argued that (1) as an importer-consignee of merchandise involved in a section 516(d) proceeding, it has a statutory right under section 516(f) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, (19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516(f)),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to intervene because actions under section 516 have been three-party actions since 1922 and, in enacting the Trade Act of 1974,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Congress did nothing to change this; (2) the failure of the Customs Court to allow it to participate would raise serious constitutional questions because of its direct and substantial interest in the proceedings, which interest is not adequately represented by the existing parties; and (3) the Customs Court should look to Fed.R. Civ.P. 24(a) for guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Both Aireo and the Government opposed N. C. Trading\u2019s motion, arguing that (1) N. C. Trading failed to establish that it was a consignee of ferrochrome from South Africa; (2) the statute does not authorize a consignee of merchandise subject to a proceeding under section 516(d) to appear and be heard as a party in interest; (3) there is no constitutional right to participate; and (4) N. C. Trading failed to meet the criteria set forth in Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(a), which in any event is not applicable to the Customs Court. On December 14, 1977, the Customs Court denied N. C. Trading\u2019s motion to intervene without opinion. N. C. Trading filed a motion for rehearing which was denied on February 28, 1978, without opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-12\">On April 28, 1978, N. C. Trading filed a notice of appeal with this court and moved for a stay of the proceedings in the Customs Court pending disposition of the appeal. After a series of oppositions and cross-motions,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> this court, on June 7, 1978, ordered a stay of the proceedings before the Customs Court pending disposition of the appeal and directed the court below to supplement the record with findings of fact and conclusions of law on which the orders of December 14, 1977, and February 28, 1978, were based.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-14\">\n<em>Customs Court</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b320-15\">Pursuant to this court\u2019s direction, the Customs Court transmitted on June 30, 1978, the following findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-17\">1. that section 1516(f) employs the definite article \u201cThe\u201d before the word \u201cconsignee\u201d and not the indefinite article \u201cA\u201d before such word as contended for by the movant, and, therefore, the word</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>\u201cconsignee\u201d has limited textual application;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-5\">2. that the validity of section 1516(d) was not challenged by the movant on any constitutional grounds in its motion to intervene.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">The Customs Court also transmitted the following conclusions of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-7\">1. that the words \u201cThe consignee\u201d in section 1516(f) refer <em>solely </em>to the consignee of the entry underlying the three party action provided for in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516(c) between the American manufacturer, the United States, and the consignee of an entry of merchandise upon which the action is predicated and whose right to intervene is provided for in rule 5.1 of the Customs Court rules;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-8\">2. that section 1516(d) provides only for the maintenance of a two party action in the Customs Court between the American manufacturer and the United States, independent of any particular entry of merchandise; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-9\">3. that absent a statutory basis the movant lacks standing to intervene, and the Customs Court lacks power to permit intervention of additional parties not properly before the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b321-11\">This appeal presents three issues for resolution: (1) whether N. C. Trading has established that it is a \u201cconsignee\u201d of merchandise of the same kind as that involved in the Customs Court proceedings, namely: South African ferrochrome; (2) whether the Constitution requires that section 516 be so construed that a consignee of merchandise of the same kind as that involved in an action under section 516(d) has a right to appear and be heard as a party in interest; and (3) whether a consignee of merchandise of the same kind as that involved in a section 516(d) action has a statutory right under section 516(f) to appear and be heard as a party in interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-16\">\n<em>1. N. C. Trading\u2019s Status as a Consignee</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b321-17\">Appellees<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> argue that N. C. Trading has not established its alleged consignee status, \u201cbut relied solely on the self-serving statement that it is a consignee of South African Ferrochrome and on an unverified list of entries of ferrochrome purportedly made by N. C. Trading during 1976-1977.\u201d Nevertheless, Schedule A of N. C. Trading\u2019s original motion to intervene listed fifteen entries totaling over 35 million content pounds of South African ferrochrome imported during the period preceding the filing of that motion \u2014 March 12, 1976, through August 3, 1977 \u2014 for which N. C. Trading paid over $222,000 in duties.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> With its motion for rehearing, N. C. Trading submitted a <em>certified copy </em>of the consumption entry form, along with supporting documents, for entry No. 234735, which is listed on Schedule A.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> These exhibits are sufficient to demonstrate that N. C. Trading imported South African ferrochrome during the pertinent period.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-18\">Appellees further argue that \u201c[e]ven if N. C. Trading may have imported South African ferrochrome in June of 1977, that does not give to the company the eternal and unchanging status of \u2018importer-consignee\u2019,\u201d and \u201cthere is nothing on the record herein to show whether appellant is in the business of importing ferrochrome from South Africa, is currently importing ferrochrome, or will be importing such merchandise in the future from South Africa when this case is finally concluded.\u201d While the remedy provided by section 516(d), which is discussed <em>infra </em>in greater detail, is prospective in nature, <em>i. e., </em>to protect a domestic manufac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>turer <em>from </em>future importations, the basis of such a proceeding is a determination by the Secretary \u201cthat a bounty or grant is not being paid or bestowed.\u201d The Secretary must, therefore, look to the foreign government\u2019s current and past practices with respect to current and past exportations (although no specific entry is involved in a section 516(d) proceeding) to make his determination. Therefore, in light of N. C. Trading\u2019s demonstration of importations of South African ferrochrome immediately preceding its motion to intervene, we conclude that it has sufficiently demonstrated its status as a consignee of merchandise <em>of the same kind as that involved </em>in the Customs Court proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">\n<em>2. Statutory Construction of Section 516</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AlU\">\n<em>A. Historical Development</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ajc\">Section 516, which first appeared in the Tariff Act of 1922, is unique in its authorization of intervention in a proceeding in the Customs Court. Under the 1922 act, section 516 permitted a domestic manufacturer to challenge the appraised value, the classification, or the rate of duty of imported merchandise of the kind manufactured by him. When dissatisfied with the action taken by the appraiser or the Secretary, the domestic manufacturer could, under appropriate circumstances, file either an appeal for reappraisement or a protest in connection with <em>a specific entry. </em>Tariff Act of 1922, ch. 356, \u00a7\u00a7 516(a)-(b), 42 Stat. 970-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\"><em>The </em>consignee of the merchandise <em>on the entry involved in the appeal or protest </em>filed by the domestic manufacturer was given the concomitant right to be notified of such action and to appear as a party in interest. <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 516(c), 42 Stat. 971.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Moreover, <em>the </em>consignee\u2019s right to prevent the confidential information contained in the entry papers from being disclosed to the domestic manufacturer was recognized. <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 516(d), 42 Stat. 971.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">As carried over into the Tariff Act of 1930, section 516 reserved to <em>the </em>consignee of the merchandise <em>of the disputed entry </em>(in the appeal for reappraisement or protest filed by the domestic manufacturer) the same rights accorded in the 1922 act.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-11\"> Minor changes were made to section 516 prior to the Trade Act of 1974. The provisions of section 516(d) were transferred to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2634(b),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and the Customs Courts Act of 1970 reenacted that provision in almost identical language to that of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2637(b).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The 1970 act also revised section 516 to reflect the consolidation of appraisal and classification functions within the Bureau of Customs. The right of the domestic manufacturer \u201cto contest the appraised value or classification of, or rate or duty assessed upon, the merchandise\u201d was carried over in section 516(c).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Nevertheless, as in the previous statutes, this right was limited to the merchandise of a designated entry; section 516(c) then provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AO1x\">Upon receipt of notice [of desire to contest] from the petitioner, the Secretary shall cause publication to be made of his decision as to the proper appraised value or classification or rate of duty and of the petitioner\u2019s desire to contest, and shall thereafter furnish the petitioner with such information as to the entries and consignees of such merchandise, entered after the publication of the decision of the Secretary at such ports of entry des<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>ignated by the petitioner in his notice of desire to contest, as <em>will enable the petitioner to contest the appraised value or classification of, or rate of duty imposed upon, such merchandise in the liquidation of one such entry at such port. </em>The Secretary shall direct the appropriate customs officer at such ports to notify the petitioner by mail immediately when the first of such entries is liquidated. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Section 516(e) preserved the right of <em>the </em>consignee to be heard as a party in interest in these actions.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Nevertheless, these revisions were not designed to have a substantive effect on the rights of parties under existing laws. H.R.Rep.No.91-1067, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 30 (1970), <em>reprinted in </em>[1970] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News pp. 3188, 3217.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Throughout the many revisions of the statute, section 516 preserved the right of <em>the </em>consignee to appear and protect <em>its interests in the property </em>which was the subject of the domestic manufacturer\u2019s action. Prior to the Trade Act of 1974, the only three-party suits which could be brought under section 516 involved a domestic manufacturer, the Government, and <em>the </em>consignee of the designated entry which was the subject of the action. The statute made</p>\n<p id=\"b323-13\">no provision for participation by other \u201cinterested\u201d consignees.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-14\">B. <em>The Trade Act of 1974</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-15\">The Trade Act of 1974 amended sections 516(a), (b), and (c) to provide for judicial review of negative countervailing duty determinations by the Secretary. Trade Act of 1974, Pub.L.No.93-618, \u00a7 331, 88 Stat. 2052 \u2014 53.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The amendment followed this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Hammond Lead Products, Inc., </em>440 F.2d 1024, 58 CCPA 129, C.A.D. 1017 (1971), which held that judicial review of negative countervailing duty determinations was not available to domestic manufacturers. H.R.Rep.No. 93-571, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. 76-77 (1973); S.Rep.No.93-1298, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 185 (1974), <em>reprinted in </em>[1974] U.S.Code Cong. <em>&amp; </em>Admin.News, pp. 7186, 7320.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-16\">The House version of H.R. 10710, which became the Trade Act of 1974, retained the language of the previous sections 516(a), (b), and (c), except that it provided for judicial review of the failure of the Customs Service to assess countervailing duties in the liquidation of a designated entry at a specified port.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-17\">H.R. 10710, as reported by the Senate Finance Committee, redesignated sections 516(d), (e), (f), and (g) as 516(e), (f), (g), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>(h), respectively. A new section 516(d) was inserted, providing for judicial review of a negative determination by the Secretary with respect to alleged sales at less than fair value of imported merchandise under section 201 of the Antidumping Act of 1921.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Action could be initiated by American manufacturers of the same type of merchandise as that described in the Secretary\u2019s negative determination, without reference to any specific entry.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> On the Senate floor, the new section was amended to permit domestic manufacturers to obtain judicial review of the Secretary\u2019s negative determination under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1303 concerning the existence of a bounty or grant.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>Sections 516(a), (b), and (c) were also amended to provide for judicial review of the failure of the Customs Service to assess antidumping duties in the liquidation of a designated entry at a specified port.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">It is to be emphasized that the Trade Act of 1974, while continuing authority for countervailing duty proceedings (with the added judicial review of a negative determination) under section 516(c)<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> also preserved the right of <em>the </em>consignee of the liquidated entry involved (section 516(f)). Moreover, it created a new cause of action under section 516(d) for a dissatisfied domestic manufacturer to challenge the Secretary\u2019s negative determination under the countervailing duty provisions <em>without designating any particular entry, </em>such as provided by section 516(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">C. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">N. C. Trading argues that an action under section 516 has been, and continues to be a three-party action, including an American manufacturer, the Government, and a consignee, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-8\">The legislative history shows that Congress merely intended to make clear the scope of judicial review available to American manufacturers without otherwise disturbing the substance of Section 516. Nowhere in the legislative history of Section 516 is there a single expression of congressional intent to exclude a consignee from a proceeding brought pursuant to Section 516(d) or to change what had been for over 50 years a three party action to a two party action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-14\">However, we are persuaded that appellant\u2019s argument is premised on a misunderstanding of section 516 proceedings prior to the 1974 amendment. Indeed, appellant furnishes the key to the resolution of this issue in its brief, thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-15\">This provision [section 516 before the 1974 amendment] manifests Congress\u2019 recognition, from the very beginning, that <em>a consignee of the merchandise that is the subject of the proceeding under Section 516 </em>has a direct and substantial interest in such proceeding. The amendments enacted by the Trade Act of 1974 did not change this. Such a change would, if enacted, have radically altered the very nature of a proceeding under Section 516. [Emphasis added,]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-16\">Prior to 1974, only a consignee <em>of the merchandise of the entry involved </em>in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>the section 516 proceeding had a right to be heard as a party in interest; no other \u201cinterested\u201d consignee was authorized to participate as a party in interest.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We agree with appellant that the Trade Act of 1974 did not alter previous practice. Only a consignee <em>of the merchandise of the entry involved </em>has a right to participate as a party in interest. Indeed, if any other consignee were allowed to become a party in interest, such a change would have radically altered the very nature of a proceeding under section 516.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">In support of its argument, appellant states that there \u201cis absolutely no authority in the legislative history (and none is cited by the Government) for the proposition that Congress \u2018intended\u2019 singular treatment for Section 516(d)\u201d and that section 516(f) does not apply exclusively to a cause of action authorized under sections 516(a), (b), and (c). However, there is no legislative history indicating that Congress intended that the section 516(f) right of \u201c[t]he consignee\u201d to participate as a party in interest applies to section 516(d) proceedings. Moreover, there is no designated entry mentioned in section 516(d), so that there can be no corresponding consignee as required by section 516(f).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> N. C. Trading cites 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 [\u201cIn determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, unless the context indicates otherwise \u2014 words importing the singular in-elude and apply to several persons, parties, or things\u201d] for the proposition that \u201cthe definite article \u2018The\u2019 before the word \u2018consignee\u2019 in Section 516(f), instead of the indefinite article \u2018A\u2019 before such word, is of little or no significance,\u201d and, thus, \u201c \u2018the consignee\u2019 in Section 516(f) may be construed generically to include any consignee.\u201d Such citation is unconvincing in light of the clear statutory reference to <em>the </em>consignee in section 516(c) of the Tariff Act of 1930, which provided the context for section 516(e) of the 1970 act (changed to section 516(f) by the Trade Act of 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">Interpreting section 516(d) to authorize only two-party actions, involving the domestic manufacturer and the Government,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> not only continues the long-standing practice that consignees of merchandise other than that involved in a section 516 action are excluded from participation, but also is consistent with the absence from section 516(d) of any mention of \u201cconsignees.\u201d To interpret section 516(d) as N. C. Trading suggests would open action thereunder to participation by numerous consignees \u2014 all past and current importers of merchandise of the kind involved, and even all future or potential importers. It is highly improbable that Congress would have so intended without mentioning it in the legislative history of the Trade Act of 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Although the parties have discussed at some length the application of Fed.R.

Shevin, </em>407 U.S. 67, 92 S.Ct. 1983, 32 L.Ed.2d 556 (1972). Appellant has cited no departures from this principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">This court, relying upon <em>Phillips, </em>has held that an importer has no right to a hearing prior to the assessment of duties, if the opportunity given for ultimate judicial review of the determination of liability is adequate. <em>Dart Export Co. v. United States, </em>43 CCPA 64, 75, C.A.D. 610, <em>cert, denied, </em>352 U.S. 824, 77 S.Ct. 33, 1 L.Ed.2d 48 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">Since N. C. Trading has no right to a hearing prior to the assessment of duties,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> we must conclude that it had no right to intervene in the section 516(d) proceeding below in order to be heard <em>before </em>posting bond or other security on importation, or even <em>before </em>paying duties that it believed to be unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-11\">In contending that there will be no prompt and meaningful post-deprivation hearing of any kind,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> appellant says that should the Customs Court reverse the Secretary\u2019s negative countervailing duty determination, liquidation of entries of all South African ferrochrome would remain suspended pending appeal (and any certiorari petitions); that during this period appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>would be exposed to the possibility of additional duties of an unknown amount;<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> and that, were Aireo to ultimately prevail on appeal, only after the Secretary determined the actual amount of the countervailing duties to be imposed would the entries be liquidated and N. C. Trading have its first opportunity to protest the decision. Appellant also suggests that its protest could only be denied in light of the judicial precedent, so that it would not have any meaningful administrative review.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> However, there would be no adverse impact on appellant unless a court of competent jurisdiction holds that countervailing duties should be imposed. Although an importer would be \u201crelegated to the sidelines\u201d during any appeal therefrom, shortly after a decision on appeal it would have the right to protest any countervailing duty assessed<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> and to file a summons and complaint. We are satisfied that the delays involved would not be excessive, so that there would be no violation of either the First or Fifth Amendments. Indeed, appellant\u2019s position is not materially different from that of an importer involved in the usual classification or valuation dispute which, although dissatisfied with the amount of duty, may have a long wait for the appropriate customs officer to liquidate his entry. <em>See United States v. Boe, Chief Judge, United States Customs Court, </em>543 F.2d 151, 64 CCPA 11, C.A.D. 1171 (1976); <em>Dart Export Corp. </em>v. <em>United States, supra. </em>Appellant\u2019s contentions are more appropriately directed to the financial risk-taking necessarily associated with the import business. Like many successful litigants, N. C. Trading, even if it prevails, will never be entirely whole since it will have endured business uncertainty, loss of interest, the payment of attorneys\u2019 fees, and the expenditure of executives\u2019 and employees\u2019 time.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">Regarding appellant\u2019s point that it would be difficult to obtain meaningful judicial review, we note that, in numerous test cases brought by importers before the Customs Court, there are other importers of the same kind of merchandise that is the subject of the litigation, which importers are not parties to the particular litigation, although they have an interest in, and stand to be affected by, a decision in a particular test case. However, an \u201cinterested\u201d nonparty who is displeased over the outcome of a test case is free to bring its own action with a view to improving the record,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> rearguing the law, and urging that the earlier decision should not be followed. <em>See United States v. Stone &amp; Downer Co., </em>274 U.S. 225, 47 S.Ct. 616, 71 L.Ed. 1013 (1927). If and when N. C. Trading becomes a consignee subjected to the payment of countervailing duties, it will be entitled to review of every aspect of a protested administrative decision. We agree with the following statement of appellee Aireo:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AD\">Under N. C. Trading\u2019s theory, none of those \u201cinterested\u201d nonparties could obtain meaningful judicial review that would pass Constitutional muster in a later case because of the precedential value of the earlier adverse decision \u2014 notwithstanding the Supreme Court\u2019s recognition and approval of the \u201crelitigation\u201d practice in the customs tribunals. <em>Stone &amp; Downer, supra. </em>Clearly, that N. C. Trading has no statutory right to participate in the subject American manufac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>turer\u2019s proceeding (just as an interested American manufacturer has no right to participate in an importer\u2019s action challenging the assessment of countervailing duties) is totally without Constitutional significance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Although appellant argues that the Government will not adequately represent its interests in the proceeding below, it will have an opportunity, if countervailing duties are assessed on its imports, to fully represent its own interests in the Customs Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">In view of the foregoing, we hold that the Constitution does not require that section 516 be so construed that a consignee of merchandise of the same kind as that involved in an action under section 516(d) has a right to appear and be heard as a party in interest; further, that a consignee of merchandise of the same kind as that involved in a section 516(d) action does not have a statutory right under section 516(f) to appear and be heard as a party in interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The order of the Customs Court denying N.

Thus, the present review system is only of benefit to importers and others adversely affected by countervailing duties. The bill would amend section 516 of the 1930 Tariff Act so that manufacturers and others could petition the Secretary of the Treasury to reconsider his determination that countervailing duties should not be levied in a particular case. There would be no time frame for the Secretary to reach a decision on the merits of the complaint by the petitioner.

The House report makes references to an informal opinion of the Treasury Department which asserts that existing law provides for judicial review of negative antidumping decisions on the part of the U.S. manufacturers, producers, or wholesalers. The Committee generally agrees with this opinion. However, it is the view of the Committee that since some question remains as to the ability of American manufacturers, producers, and wholesalers to obtain judicial review of negative antidumping determinations under section 516 of the Tariff Act of 1930, the law ought to be explicit on this point. The Committee believes it essential that domestic producers have the right to judicial review of negative price discrimination (LTFV) determinations, just as foreign producers and importers have the right to obtain judicial review of positive price discrimination (LTFV) determinations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-11\">The Committee, therefore, added new subsection (g) of section 321, which would amend section 516 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516) and sections 2631 and 2632 of title 28, United States Code, to provide <em>explicitly </em>for judicial review of negative antidumping determinations made by the Secretary of the Treasury. Under the amendment, within 30 days after a negative fair value determination by the Secretary, any American manufacturer, producer, or wholesaler of merchandise of the same class or kind as that described in such determination may file with the Secretary a written notice of his desire to contest the decision. The Secretary would then publish notice of the desire to contest the determination and, within 30 days after such publication, the manufacturer, producer, or wholesaler may commence an action in the Customs Court for review of the Secretary\u2019s determination.

The written notice of desire to contest must be filed with the Secretary of the Treasury within 30 days after the determination.

The concept of intervention by \u201cinterested\u201d parties has not been incorporated in the statute governing Customs Court litigation. Neither an importer-consignee who is \u201cinterested\u201d in another importer\u2019s action, nor a domestic manufacturer \u201cinterested\u201d in another domestic manufacturer\u2019s proceeding, can become a party in interest and thereby circumvent the statutorily prescribed conditions precedent to the initiation of litigation. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1514-16; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1582. An importer, who shares an identity of \u201cinterest\u201d with one who has become a party in interest in a section 516(c) proceeding, cannot, by intervention, become another party in interest, since the statute has limited importer representation to the importer of a <em>particular entry.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b326-6\">.

Appellees argue that in the \u201cabsence of express statutory authority to intervene in an action in the Customs Court, which is a court of limited statutory jurisdiction, none may be implied.\u201d If the Customs Court does have authority to allow intervention, it would clearly be discretionary.

The Customs Court found \u201cthat the validity of section 1516(d) [516(d)] was not challenged by the movant on any constitutional grounds in its motion to intervene.\u201d While N. C. Trading did not argue that section 516(d) was unconstitutional, it did argue that \u201cto construe the statute in a way that would deny a consignee the right to appear and be heard in this action would render section 516(d) unconstitutional.\u201d N. C. Trading also argues that \u201cfailure to give effect to the statute would raise serious constitutional questions, since a consignee has a direct and substantial interest in the outcome of the case \u2014 an interest not adequately represented by the existing parties.\u201d Hence, in the court below and in this court, appellant has contended that since the statute is capable of two different constructions, it must be construed in a manner that will avoid any constitutional infirmity.

Sherman, </em>237 U.S. 146, 152, 35 S.Ct. 520, 59 L.Ed. 883 (1915).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b328-12\">. Appellant cites the recent Supreme Court opinion in <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Shapiro, supra, </em>424 U.S. at 630 n.12, 96 S.Ct. at 1072, wherein the Court stated that \u201cit is very doubtful that the need to collect the revenues is a sufficient reason to justify seizure causing irreparable injury without a prompt post-seizure inquiry of any kind.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b329-5\">. This uncertainty, according to N. C.

Appellant opines that.\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">although the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>does not preclude relitigation, the prior adverse decision will stand in N. C. Trading\u2019s path as controlling legal precedent, which will be difficult, if not impossible, to overcome. Therefore, meaningful judicial review, as well as administrative review, will be impossible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b329-10\">. 19 CFR 174.22 provides for accelerated disposition of protests within thirty days after an appropriate request.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b329-11\">. If it is not possible to produce a new and factually different record and only legal arguments are at stake, appellant faces no different risk under the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>than any person who finds that a principle of law has been decided adversely to him prior to a decision on his lawsuit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
