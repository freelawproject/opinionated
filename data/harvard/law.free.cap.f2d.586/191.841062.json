We now have the opinion of the Court of Appeals, Division 2, State of Oklahoma, in <em>King v. Southwestern Cotton Oil Co., </em>585 P.2d 385. The court there held that the dissenting shareholders were not entitled to prejudgment interest. The court stated that the Business Corporation Act made no provision for such interest, and no other statute covered the claim. We so hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-12\">The Oklahoma court also decided that the amount of dividends paid should be credited against the value of the shares to be paid. The United States District Court here so provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-14\">This leaves the issue as to costs recoverable by the shareholders. <em>See </em>18 O.S. \u00a7 1.160 e. The Oklahoma trial court allowed costs in the amount of $3,273.08 incurred in the litigation, and the court of appeals affirmed. It appears that the Oklahoma statute contemplates the recovery of costs incurred by the dissenting shareholders except for attorney fees. The affidavit in the record before us of William J. Campbell shows the costs incurred exclusive of attorney fees to have been $4,765.81. It is ordered that these expenditures be recovered as part of the judgment herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-15\">The judgment is affirmed as to reasonable market value, the denial of prejudgment interest, and the application of dividends; however, the judgment is reversed with directions to permit the recovery by plaintiffs of the amount of $4,765.81 as additional recovery permitted under the Oklahoma statute.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
