Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., </em>5 Cir.,</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b483-26\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b483-27\">Mississippi Code \u00a7 37-41-3 provided that students living one mile or more from their attendance centers were entitled to state financed transportation, with the exception that students residing within the corporate limits of a municipality and attending school within those corporate limits were not entitled to free transportation regardless of the distance from the school.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-28\">Upon a challenge filed on behalf of students residing within corporate limits, the District Court held that the statutory distinction between students residing within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>and without corporate limits was an unconstitutional denial of the equal protection of the laws, both on its face and as applied. The enforcement of the statute was permanently enjoined.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">After this appeal was filed, the Mississippi Legislature responded to the decision of the District Court by amending the statute so as to provide free transportation for <em>all students </em>living one mile or more from their attendance center. This legislative action eliminated the unconstitutionality denounced by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">This being so, we are no longer presented with a live case or controversy. We adhere to the rule that the enactment of a superseding statute which satisfies all the principles sought in an attack on the prior statute simply moots the case. See <em>Kremens v. Bartley, </em>431 U.S. 119, 97 S.Ct. 1709, 52 L.Ed.2d 184 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">See, also, <em>Bowles v. Blue Lake Development Corporation, </em>5 Cir., 1974, 504 F.2d 1094, 1098.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">The District Court reserved its judgment on the issue of attorneys\u2019 fees, a matter it is amply able to hear and decide in keeping with the applicable jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">We therefore remand the case to the District Court with directions to dismiss the complaint as moot after an appropriate adjudication as to the reserved issue of attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
