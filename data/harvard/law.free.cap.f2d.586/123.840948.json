We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-22\">I. <em>Facts and Proceedings Below</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-23\">On January 4, 1977, appellant Thomas, seven codefendants, and eight other eoeonspirators were named in a thirty-two count indictment. Count one charged codefendants Richard Avery, Edsel Newbins, Jeannette Haydel, Jeffrey Jackson, Calvin White, Richard Williams, William Tann and William Thomas with knowingly and unlawfully conspiring to distribute, and to possess with intent to distribute, heroin during the period March 4, 1976 to October 21, 1976. The remaining counts, seven of which named appellant, charged the unlawful use of a communication facility in the commission of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>Six of the eight persons charged as codefendants pleaded guilty to the \u201ctelephone counts,\u201d with only Thomas and Tann opting for trial. At the conclusion of their joint trial, Tann was acquitted of all counts, while Thomas was convicted of all counts. Appellant received a total sentence of five years imprisonment: he was sentenced to four years on the conspiracy count, and one year on the first of the seven \u201ctelephone counts,\u201d the sentences to run consecutively. He was also sentenced to one year on each of the remaining \u201ctelephone counts,\u201d to run concurrently with each other and with the sentence on the conspiracy count.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">The indictment was based upon evidence from an investigation conducted during the period 1974 to 1976 by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). The investigation focused on Avery, who was suspected of being the hub of a heroin distribution system in the Seattle-Tacoma area. A court-ordered wiretap of Avery\u2019s residence was authorized on September 30, 1976, resulting in the recording of 867 conversations between October 1 and October 20, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The Government\u2019s evidence, including the tape-recorded conversations, disclosed that Avery was indeed involved in a conspiracy with others named in the indictment to purchase heroin in Southern California and distribute it to wholesale dealers in the Seattle-Tacoma area. One of these wholesale dealers was Newbins, who provided Haydel, White and Jackson with heroin to be diluted, packaged and distributed on the street. At trial, the Government endeavored to show that Thomas was involved in this scheme through his efforts to obtain a temporary supply of heroin for the other conspirators while the main source, Avery, was away purchasing more heroin in Southern California.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">On or about October 1, 1976, Avery, accompanied by Williams, Williams\u2019s wife and a female acquaintance, traveled to Southern California to purchase heroin from one William Gomez. The Government theorized that while Avery was out of town, Newbins ran short of heroin and turned to Thomas for an interim source of supply; Thomas attempted to accommodate him and others in the conspiracy. The evidence supporting this consisted of, <em>inter alia, </em>phone conversations that took place on October 2 and 3 between an individual calling himself \u201cMerrick\u201d \u2014 identified at trial as Thomas <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u2014and several others including Newbins, Haydel and White. These conversations, together with eyewitness testimony of DEA agents, constituted the Government\u2019s principal evidence of appellant\u2019s participation in the Avery distribution conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">In addition, other significant evidence was introduced for the purpose of proving Thomas\u2019s connection with the conspiracy. This included a list finder directory seized from Avery\u2019s house pursuant to a warranted search, containing Thomas\u2019s phone number (listed under the name \u201cBill Merrick\u201d) as well as the names and phone numbers of other coconspirators; a \u201clittle black book\u201d seized from Avery\u2019s person, also listing Thomas\u2019s phone number under the name \u201cMerrick\u201d; and one of Thomas\u2019s business cards, seized from appellant\u2019s wallet after his arrest. Written on the reverse of the business card was the name \u201cRich\u201d and Richard Avery\u2019s phone number \u2014 the same number intercepted by the Government\u2019s wiretap.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-12\">On appeal, Thomas raises three objections: (1) that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction; (2) that the proof established, if anything, his involvement in a separate conspiracy and not his participation in the Avery distribution scheme; and (3) that permitting a DEA agent to identify his voice as that of \u201cMerrick\u201d constituted reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-13\">II. <em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-14\">We reject Thomas\u2019s contention that the evidence at trial was insufficient to support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>his conviction. The jury could reasonably have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt both that Thomas was connected to the Avery conspiracy to possess and distribute heroin in the Seattle-Tacoma area, and that he utilized a communication facility in furtherance thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">A. <em>The Conspiracy Count</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">In determining whether evidence is sufficient to link a defendant to a conspiracy, this court has invoked the slight evidence rule, interpreted as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-7\">Once the existence of a conspiracy is established, evidence establishing beyond a reasonable doubt a connection of a defendant with the conspiracy, even though the <em>connection is slight, </em>is sufficient to convict him with knowing participation in the conspiracy. Thus, the word \u201cslight\u201d properly modifies \u201cconnection\u201d and not \u201cevidence.\u201d It is tied to that which is proved, not to the type of evidence or the burden of proof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-8\"><em>United States </em>v. <em>Dunn, </em>564 F.2d 348, 357 (9th Cir. 1977) (emphasis in original; footnote omitted). Thomas does not dispute the existence of the Avery distribution scheme, but only his connection with it. Thus, the only issue is whether the evidence was sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Thomas had a slight connection to the Avery conspiracy proved. <em>See United States v. Bracy, </em>566 F.2d 649, 659 (9th Cir. 1977); <em>United States v. Garcia-Rodriguez, </em>558 F.2d 956, 960 (9th Cir. 1977), <em>cert, denied, </em>434 U.S. 1050, 98 S.Ct. 900, 54 L.Ed.2d 802 (1978); <em>United States v. Valdovinos, </em>558 F.2d 531, 533 (9th Cir. 1977). Viewed in the light most favorable to the Government, <em>see Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942), the evidence linking Thomas to the conspiracy was sufficient to enable the jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that his connection was far more than \u201cslight.\u201d The following acts performed by Thomas, which may either be inferred from or were directly proved by the evidence at trial, substantiate our decision on this issue:</p>\n<p id=\"b223-16\">1. <em>Thomas picked up or delivered heroin during a visit to Newbins at Avery\u2019s house on October 2, 1976. </em>On October 2, Newbins was measuring and preparing heroin for distribution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This took place at Avery\u2019s house, where there were customers waiting during the day.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Avery was away buying heroin in California, and called during the afternoon to advise Newbins that he was \u201cgetting everything in shape, making sure everything is all right here.\u201d That night, Thomas \u2014 who had been at Avery\u2019s house the previous day<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u2014 phoned for Avery, ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>parently to see if he had returned; <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> since Newbins was still there, he answered the phone. Upon learning it was Thomas calling,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Newbins asked him to come over, stating that it was \u201cquite important\u201d and that it would be to Thomas\u2019s benefit. DEA agents then saw Thomas drive from Avery\u2019s house and subsequently travel to another location where Thomas supplied another conspirator, Jackson, with fifty dollars\u2019 worth of heroin.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">2. <em>Thomas transported and supplied heroin to conspirator Jackson on October 3, 1976. </em>During the early hours of October 3, DEA agents saw Thomas drive from Avery\u2019s house to the apartment of conspirators Haydel and White, followed by another car. The occupants of both vehicles were seen entering the Haydel-White apartment. Subsequent evidence established that at this time Thomas sold Jackson fifty dollars\u2019 worth of heroin, which Jackson then injected \u2014 an act that Haydel revealed in a later intercepted phone conversation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">3. <em>Thomas arranged to purchase heroin for Newbins and other conspirators from a third party. </em>These arrangements are directly inferable from several intercepted phone conversations played at trial. For example, in one of the tapes Thomas instructed Newbins to get \u201cup front money\u201d so they could \u201ctake care of business with[in] the next 45 minutes or hour, otherwise we\u2019re going to have to wait until four or five; he\u2019s taking his kids to the mountains.\u201d When the terms for the heroin purchase were finally agreed upon, however, New-bins and the third-party seller could not settle on where the transfer was to take place.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, the deal Thomas arranged fell through.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-19\">4. <em>Thomas later attempted to purchase heroin for Newbins and other conspirators from another source, but the transaction was not consummated because the price was too high. </em>In taped conversations Thomas himself stated that he \u201cworked all day and all night to get everything organized,\u201d and that \u201cthings didn\u2019t come down right today . . . but the dude wants such an outrageous bunch of bread for it, maybe it\u2019s best not to do business with him anymore.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>5. <em>Thomas again agreed to supply several of the conspirators with heroin. </em>In another intercepted telephone conversation Thomas agreed that he and others would \u201chave that QP at 10:00 in the morning.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">6. <em>Thomas served as an intermediary for White and Newbins. </em>Eyewitness testimony by DEA agents established that in the early hours of October 3 and 4, while Avery was out of town, Thomas traveled back and forth between Avery\u2019s residence, where Newbins was staying, and the HaydelWhite apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Furthermore, substantial additional evidence connected Thomas to the conspiracy. Evidence such as the business card from appellant\u2019s wallet with Avery\u2019s name and phone number written on the back and Avery\u2019s telephone directories listing appellant linked him to the Avery conspiracy by virtue of the common appearance of aliases and the interchange of phone numbers. Thomas\u2019s relationship with others in the conspiracy was established by evidence of a variety of continuing contacts with them, including a visit to Avery\u2019s house the day before his dealings outlined above transpired,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> a first meeting with Avery\u2019s roommate \u201cquite a long time\u201d before trial and at least one subsequent meeting at Avery\u2019s house, which other conspirators frequented,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and numerous calls to Avery\u2019s house from appellant\u2019s business phone during September and October, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Finally, based on the evidence of narcotics items seized from Avery\u2019s residence,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> whieh Thomas frequented along with other coconspirators, it is implausible that he did not know the nature and purpose of the conspiracy and the involvement of the others in it. The evidence on the conspiracy count was sufficient.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-14\">B. <em>The \u201cTelephone Counts\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b225-15\">The jury found Thomas guilty on all seven of the \u201ctelephone counts,\u201d charging him with use of a communication facility in furtherance of the conspiracy. He asserts that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction on these counts for four reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-16\">First, Thomas argues that in none of the conversations supporting these counts did he use the word \u201cheroin\u201d or any other established synonym. However, narcotics code words have repeatedly been recognized as a commonly used tool of parties to a conspiracy. <em>See United States v. Abascal, </em>564 F.2d 821, 827 (9th Cir. 1977), <em>cert, denied, </em>435 U.S. 953, 98 S.Ct. 1583, 55 L.Ed.2d 804 (1978); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mejias, 552 </em>F.2d 435, 437-38, 445 (2d Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>434 U.S. 847, 98 S.Ct. 154, 54 L.Ed.2d 115 (1977); <em>United States v. Chavez, </em>533 F.2d 491, 494 (9th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>426 U.S. 911, 96 S.Ct. 2237, 48 L.Ed.2d 837 (1976); <em>United States v. Sisca, </em>503 F.2d 1337, 1343 (2d Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>419 U.S. 1008, 95 S.Ct. 328, 42 L.Ed.2d 283 (1974). In <em>Sisea, </em>the Second Circuit held that the use of \u201cnarcotics code\u201d was properly considered by the jury to support the inference that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>defendant was an active participant in the conspiracy charged. Here, in the context of the other intercepted conversations played at trial and the other evidence in the case, the jury similarly could properly infer from appellant\u2019s cryptic language that the focus of the conversations was upon the narcotics transactions in furtherance of the overall conspiracy that were proved at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Second, relying on <em>United States v. Murray, </em>492 F.2d 178, 187 (9th Cir. 1973), <em>cert, denied, </em>419 U.S. 854, 95 S.Ct. 98, 42 L.Ed.2d 87 (1974), appellant claims that the Government failed to present independent evidence connecting each telephone call to a particular narcotics transaction. This claim is without support; each call is connected to a particular transaction by the context of other calls and other evidence surrounding it.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Moreover, appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Murray </em>to impose such a requirement on the Government is misplaced. In that case, two of the defendants were convicted on the theory that certain persons who actually used the telephone were their agents; it was not the defendants\u2019, but others\u2019 voices that were recorded. Their convictions were reversed because there was insufficient evidence linking the calls intercepted to the defendants themselves. Here, in contrast, Thomas\u2019s voice and alias were identified in all seven of the calls for which he was indicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">Third, appellant relies on <em>United States v. Leslie, </em>411 F.Supp. 215 (D.Del. 1976), for the proposition that the Government was required to show that heroin was actually distributed by the conspiracy to establish a violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b). In <em>Leslie, </em>the district court indeed dismissed a \u00a7 843(b) charge on the ground that the distribution of drugs was not proved. However, <em>Leslie </em>is clearly distinguishable in that the felony allegedly facilitated was distribution of drugs, whereas the telephone counts in this case alleged furtherance of the separate and distinct offense of conspiracy. <em>See United States v. Carman, </em>577 F.2d 556, 567 n.12 (9th Cir. 1978) (\u201cconspiracy is a separate and distinct offense; . Completion of the objective is not an element of [the] conspiracy\u201d). The fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>several of the arrangements Thomas made over the telephone in furtherance of the conspiracy\u2019s objectives fell through is thus immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-2\">Fourth, appellant contends that by utilizing evidence of the recorded conversations to prove both the conspiracy count and the telephone counts, the Government has subjected him to double jeopardy and denied him due process. However, as this court stated in <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>546 F.2d 302, 307 (9th Cir. 1976):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-3\">[A] conspiracy can be furthered by overt acts, some of which may or may not be criminal in nature. If the former, an individual may be charged with both his participation in the separate criminal act which furthers the conspiracy, and for his participation in the conspiracy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">We thus find this contention to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Finally, we note that six of the seven \u201ctelephone counts\u201d were ordered to run concurrently to the conspiracy count. Since we have determined that appellant\u2019s conviction on the conspiracy count must be affirmed, under the concurrent sentence doctrine we need not consider his objections to these six counts. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Weiner, </em>578 F.2d 757, 776 (9th Cir. 1978); <em>United States v. Walls, </em>577 F.2d 690, 699 (9th Cir. 1978); <em>United States v. Ingman, </em>541 F.2d 1329, 1331 (9th Cir. 1976). The phone call supporting the single telephone count that was to run consecutively to the conspiracy count was more than sufficiently proved to have furthered the conspiracy to support appellant\u2019s conviction for violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\"><em>Separate Conspiracies </em>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">Thomas contends that the Government alleged a single overall conspiracy in the indictment, yet proved two separate conspiracies at trial. He asserts that this variance between indictment and proof requires reversal of his conviction, relying on <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 766\u2014 77, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-11\">In <em>Kotteakos, </em>thirty-two defendants were charged with one overall conspiracy. At the close of the evidence, the jury was instructed that \u201c[i]t is one conspiracy, and the question is . which of the defendants, are members.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 767, 66 S.Ct. at 1249. However, the evidence showed \u201cat least eight, and perhaps more, separate and independent groups, none of which had any connection with any other, though all dealt independently with [one central figure] as their agent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 754-55, 66 S.Ct. at 1243, <em>quoting United States v. Lekacos, </em>151 F.2d 170, 172 (2d Cir. 1945), <em>rev\u2019d sub nom. Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946). The Supreme Court held that given the evidence in the case, both the indictment and the judge\u2019s instruction were \u201cplainly wrong,\u201d since \u201c[t]he jury could not possibly have found . . . that there was only one conspiracy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 768, 66 S.Ct. at 1249. Because the error was not harmless, the seven convictions in <em>Kotteakos </em>were reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-14\">In this case, unlike <em>Kotteakos, </em>only fifteen people were allegedly involved in the Avery conspiracy, and only eight individuals where charged in the indictment, six of whom pleaded guilty.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Indeed, as noted <em>supra, </em>appellant does not contest the existence of the Avery conspiracy, but only his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>connection to the Avery conspiracy proved.' Moreover, the jury in this case was not instructed to find one conspiracy as was the jury in <em>Kotteakos. </em>Rather, the instructions carefully distinguished between single and multiple conspiracies. In addition, the judge specifically admonished the jury that if \u201ctwo or more separate conspiracies have been proven, rather than the single conspiracy charged in the indictment, then you must acquit . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Whether a scheme is one conspiracy or several conspiracies is ordinarily a question for the jury. <em>See United States v. Ricco, </em>549 F.2d 264, 268 (2d Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>431 U.S. 905, 97 S.Ct. 1697, 52 L.Ed.2d 389 (1977); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>509 F.2d 1342, 1347 (5th Cir. 1975); <em>Koolish v. United States, </em>340 F.2d 513, 526 (8th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>381 U.S. 951, 85 S.Ct. 1805, 14 L.Ed.2d 724 (1965). Submitting the question to the jury in this case was proper, since a prima facie case of a single conspiracy was clearly presented. <em>See United States v. Rosales, </em>584 F.2d 870, 373 374 &amp; n.3 (9th Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">To prove his participation in the single Avery conspiracy, the prosecution was required to show that Thomas agreed to effectuate that conspiracy\u2019s central criminal design: the distribution of narcotics in the Seattle-Tacoma area. <em>See Daily </em>v. <em>United States, </em>282 F.2d 818, 820 (9th Cir. 1960). Specifically, the Government must have shown that Thomas knew this was in fact the purpose of the conspiracy, <em>see Marino v. United States, </em>91 F.2d 691, 696 (9th Cir. 1937), and that he knew or had reason to know that the others were involved and that his own benefits from his dealings with them were probably dependent upon the success of the entire venture, <em>United States v. Kearney, </em>560 F.2d 1358, 1362 (9th Cir. 1977); <em>United States v. Baxter, </em>492 F.2d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">150, 158 (9th Cir.), <em>cert, dismissed, </em>414 U.S. 801, 94 S.Ct. 16, 38 L.Ed.2d 38 (1973). Because \u201ca partnership in crime is seldom evidenced by a written agreement . among the partners,\u201d circumstantial evidence was sufficient for this purpose. <em>Daily v. United States, </em>282 F.2d at 820. It was not necessary for the Government to prove that Thomas knew the exact scope of the conspiracy, the identity and role of each of the coconspirators, or the details of the operations or any particular plan. <em>See Blumenthal v. United States, </em>332 U.S. 539, 557, 68 S.Ct. 248, 92 L.Ed. 154 (1947); <em>Marino v. United States, </em>91 F.2d at 696. Proof that Thomas knew he was plotting in concert with others to violate the law was sufficient to raise the necessary inference that he joined in the overall agreement. <em>United States v. Kearney, </em>560 F.2d at 1362.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">Again, viewed in the light most favorable to the Government, the evidence was sufficient to create a jury question on the existence of a single conspiracy.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Rosales, </em>584 F.2d at 872, 873; <em>United States v.

The prosecution established, prior to the admission of agent White\u2019s testimony and the introduction into evidence of the relevant tapes themselves,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> that White had conversed with Thomas over the telephone on three separate occasions. This laid the requisite foundation of agent White\u2019s familiarity with the speaker. The voice identification by lay opinion testimony under these circumstances was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-12\">We also reject appellant\u2019s contention that admitting agent White\u2019s testimony violated his fifth amendment right against compulsory self-incrimination. This court has stated that one\u2019s voice is \u201ca physical characteristic,\u201d and that \u201crequiring [a] suspect to speak, where doing so does not involve communicating what he knows\u201d does not violate his fifth amendment rights. <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>366 F.2d 923, 937 (9th Cir. 1966), <em>cert, denied, </em>393 U.S. 985, 89 S.Ct. 460, 21 L.Ed.2d 446 (1967). <em>See United States v. Wade, </em>388 U.S. 218, 222-23, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967); <em>see also Gilbert v. California, </em>388 U.S. 263, 266-67, 87 S.Ct. 1951, 18 L.Ed.2d 1178 (1967). Nor were Thomas\u2019s fifth amendment rights violated because <em>Miranda </em>warnings were not given prior to the telephone conversations with agent White. Such a warning, as it relates to the fifth amendment, is designed to insure that incriminating statements are voluntarily made; whether appellant's statements were in any way compelled is irrelevant here since they were not used for their content. <em>Cf. Gilbert v. California, </em>388 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>U.S. at 267, 87 S.Ct. 1951 (handwriting exemplars not \u201ctestimonial or communicative matter\u201d). As the Supreme Court has observed, \u201cthe Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination . . . \u2018offers no protection against compulsion to . speak for identification . . .\" <em>United States v. Wade, </em>388 U.S. at 223, 87 S.Ct. at 1930; <em>quoting Schmerber v. California, </em>384 U.S. 757, 764, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Finally, appellant maintains that because these conversations with agent White took place after his indictment, they arose during a \u201ccritical stage\u201d of the proceedings. Thus, he argues, given the prosecution\u2019s failure to show that <em>Miranda </em>warnings were delivered on these occasions, he was deprived of his sixth amendment right to counsel, and agent White\u2019s testimony derived from these conversations should have been excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">In <em>Gilbert v. California, supra, </em>the taking of handwriting exemplars was held not to be a \u201ccritical stage\u201d of the proceedings in which a defendant is entitled to the assistance of counsel. The Court reasoned that the likelihood of an unrepresentative exemplar as a result of the absence of counsel was not great, and that any inaccuracy that might exist could be \u201cbrought out and corrected through the adversary process at trial\u201d via \u201c \u2018cross-examination of the [State\u2019s] expert [handwriting] witnesses . . . . \u2019 \u201d 388 U.S. at 267, 87 S.Ct. at 1953; <em>quoting United States v. Wade, </em>388 U.S. at 228, 87 S.Ct. 1926. In <em>Wade, </em>the Court distinguished between pretrial lineups \u2014 which were deemed susceptible to \u201crisks of suggestion,\u201d 388 U.S. at 229, 87 S.Ct. 1926, and hence required the presence of counsel\u2014 and \u201ccompelling [the defendant] to speak within hearing distance of the witnesses, even to utter words purportedly uttered by the robber,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 222, 87 S.Ct. at 1930. And in <em>United States v. Ash, </em>413 U.S. 300, 321, 93 S.Ct. 2568, 37 L.Ed.2d 619 (1973), the Court held that the sixth amendment does not grant the right to counsel at photographic displays for the purpose of identifying the offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">The determinant of whether counsel is required in these situations is whether the risk of prejudice in the particular identification procedure is such that \u201cthe absence of counsel might derogate from ... a fair trial.\u201d <em>Gilbert v. California, </em>388 U.S. at 267, 87 S.Ct. at 1953. We have recently held that the risk of prejudice is not sufficient to require the aid of counsel for pretrial voice identifications, and that these do not constitute \u201ccritical stages\u201d of a criminal proceeding. <em>United States v. Kim, </em>577 F.2d 473, 480-81 (9th Cir. 1978). Certainly, based on the foregoing authority, the absence of counsel during appellant\u2019s telephone conversations with agent White did not violate his sixth amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b222-7\">.
