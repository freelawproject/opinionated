Honorable Robert A. Grant, United States of Indiana, sitting by designation. Senior District Judge for the Northern District</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b109-13\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b109-14\">In this case petitioner Calvert Fire Insurance Company (\u201cCalvert\u201d) seeks a writ of mandamus compelling the district court to immediately adjudicate Calvert\u2019s federal securities laws claims against American Mutual Reinsurance Company even though all but one of those claims is being concurrently litigated in Illinois state court. We previously granted the writ. <em>Calvert Fire Insurance Co. v. Will, </em>560 F.2d 792 (7th Cir. 1977). The Supreme Court reversed and remanded the case for further proceedings in conformity with its judgment. <em>Will v. Calvert Fire Insurance </em>Co.,-U.S.-, 98 S.Ct. 2552, 57 L.Ed.2d 504 (1978). We now determine the proper course which this case should take on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-21\">Carrying out the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate is somewhat difficult because there was no majority opinion for the Court. In order to interpret the Court\u2019s mandate correctly, it is necessary first to review the various opinions written by the Justices.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-22\">Justice Rehnquist, joined by three other members of the Court, expressed the view that the decision whether to defer to state court proceedings in a case such as this one is \u201clargely committed to the discretion of the District Court.\u201d 98 S.Ct. at 2558. Justice Rehnquist disagreed with our conclusion that the district court was compelled to immediately adjudicate Calvert\u2019s federal claims under Colorado River Water <em>Conservation Dist. v. United States, </em>424 U.S. 800, 96 S.Ct. 1236, 47 L.Ed.2d 483 (1976). He instead found persuasive the holding of <em>Brillhart v. Excess Ins. Co., </em>316 U.S. 491, 494, 62 S.Ct. 1173, 86 L.Ed. 1620 (1942), that district courts are \u201cunder no compulsion\u201d to exercise their jurisdiction when the same proceedings are pending in a state court. He concluded that Calvert had not satisfied the heavy burden of showing that the district court had so clearly abused its discretion that a writ of mandamus, which is only available when \u201ca litigant\u2019s right to a particular result is \u2018clear and indisputable,\u2019 \u201d was a proper remedy. 98 S.Ct. at 2559.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-23\">Justice Brennan, joined by Chief Justice Burger and Justices Marshall and Powell, dissented and would have voted to affirm our judgment. Justice Brennan rejected Justice Rehnquist\u2019s premise that the decision whether to defer in eases of contemporaneous federal state jurisdiction lies largely with the district court; rather, he asserted, under <em>Colorado River, </em>the federal courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>have a \u201cvirtually unflagging obligation . to exercise the jurisdiction given them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2561. He argued that federal deference to contemporaneous state proceedings was only permissible under \u201cexceptional\u201d circumstances not present in this case. Finally, he contended that Justice Rehnquist\u2019s reliance on <em>Brillhart </em>was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">Justice Blackmun provided the deciding vote for reversal, but did so on grounds that were significantly different from those relied upon by Justice Rehnquist. He began his opinion by agreeing with Justice Brennan that Justice Rehnquist\u2019s reliance upon <em>Brillhart </em>was erroneous:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-5\">The Court\u2019s opinion, <em>ante, </em>p. 2557, appears to me to indicate that it now regards as fully compatible the Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Brillhart v. Excess Ins. Co., </em>316 U.S. 491, 62 S.Ct. 1173, 86 L.Ed. 1620 (1942), a diversity case, and <em>Colorado River Water Conservation v. United States, </em>424 U.S. 800, 96 S.Ct. 1236, 47 L.Ed.2d 483 (1976), a federal issue case. I am not at all sure that this is so. I \u2014 as were Mr. Justice Stewart and Mr. Justice Stevens \u2014 was in dissent in <em>Colorado River, </em>and if the holding in that case is what I think it is, and if one assumes, as I do not, that <em>Brillhart </em>has any application here, the Court cut back on Mr. Justice Frankfurter\u2019s rather sweeping language in <em>Brillhart, </em>316 U.S., at 494-495, 62 S.Ct. 1175-1176 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">But Justice Blackmun then went on to state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-7\">Because Judge Will\u2019s stay order was issued prior to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Colorado River, </em>and he therefore did not have such guidance as that case affords in the area, I join in the Court\u2019s reversal of the Court of Appeals\u2019 issuance of a writ of mandamus. The issuance was premature. The Court of Appeals should have done no more than require reconsideration of the case by Judge Will in light of <em>Colorado River.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">98 S.Ct. at 2560.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">Thus, Justice Blackmun did not vote for reversal because he agreed with Justice Rehnquist that <em>Colorado River </em>did not control this case. Instead, his vote was predicated on a narrower ground: that it was improper for us to issue a writ of mandamus when the basis for the writ was the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Colorado River, </em>which had not been decided at the time the district court acted. Justice Blackmun\u2019s view is that, in the context of a petition for a writ of mandamus, we should have merely required the district court to reconsider its action in light of <em>Colorado River </em>rather than ourselves determining whether <em>Colorado River </em>compelled the district court to immediately adjudicate Calvert\u2019s federal claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-11\">Since the four Justices who joined Justice Brennan\u2019s opinion believed that under <em>Colorado River </em>the district court now has a clear obligation to immediately adjudicate Calvert\u2019s federal claims, it follows logically that these four Justices would favor going at least as far as Justice Blackmun and require the district court to determine whether its earlier deferral to concurrent state proceedings is now correct. Calvert is therefore arguably entitled to an order requiring the district court to reconsider its actions in this case in light of <em>Colorado River.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b110-12\">The district court, however, in its statement filed with this court on remand, has indicated that it intends to follow such a course on its own motion. There is therefore no need for this court to take any further action.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-13\">The petition for a writ of mandamus is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
