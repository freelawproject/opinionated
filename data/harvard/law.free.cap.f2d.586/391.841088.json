Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et </em>al., 5 Cir., 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b487-24\">AINSWORTH, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b487-25\">Thomas Edward Flood appeals his conviction for forcibly assaulting a federal correctional officer while that officer was engaged in performance of his official duties, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111. Flood contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a continuance and in refusing to dismiss the indictment, which did not explicitly allege that Flood had committed the assault intentionally. Both assertions are meritless and we therefore affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-26\">When the assault occurred, Flood was imprisoned at the Federal Correctional Institution in La Tuna, Texas. On November 15, 1977, Frank C. Malone, a La Tuna correctional counselor, and another prison employee took Flood from his cell to an office to make an authorized local telephone call. Upon completing that call, Flood sought to telephone, at Government expense, a person in San Francisco. When Malone explained that the Government would not pay for such a call, Flood attacked the officer, beating him about the head, breaking his glasses, bloodying his face, tearing his clothing and kicking him in the chest. With the help of other staff members who had an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>swered his call for aid, Malone finally subdued Flood and returned him to his cell.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">On the trial date of March 7, 1978,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the district court granted from the bench a motion filed jointly by Flood and his counsel to inspect jury selection records in possession of the clerk of the court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At that time, Flood requested a continuance of the trial to enable him personally to inspect those records and formulate any objections to the selection process. The trial judge denied that request, but informed Flood that he could file any objections related to jury selection in the time remaining before trial and explained that a mistrial would be granted if any objections were sufficient. Selection of the jury was completed on that date and the court set the trial for taking of evidence for March 27. When the case reconvened on March 27, Flood\u2019s counsel filed a second motion for a continuance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judge denied that motion as well and the trial commenced on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Flood now asserts that the judge\u2019s denials of his motions for a continuance left him insufficient time to inspect the jury records. \u201cContinuances are not a matter of right, but rather are in the discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>United States v. Miller, </em>5 Cir., 1975, 513 F.2d 791, 793. To show that the district court abused its discretion in this case, Flood must demonstrate that denial of the continuance \u201cmaterially prejudice[d]\u201d his case. <em>Id. </em>However, he has failed to demonstrate any prejudice whatever flowing from the trial judge\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-12\">In his second assertion of error, Flood claims that the lower court should have dismissed the indictment because it did not explicitly charge him with <em>intentionally </em>assaulting Malone. The inclusion of \u201ctechnical \u2018intent\u2019 terms\u201d in an indictment is \u201cunnecessary where the statute itself contains no such terms and the indictment clearly sets forth a charge of specific intent in the factual averment.\u201d <em>United States v. Purvis, </em>5 Cir., 1978, 580 F.2d 853, 859. The count of the indictment on which Flood was convicted<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> charged that he had \u201cforcibly assaulted, resisted, opposed, impeded and interfered with Frank C. Malone, an officer of the Federal Correctional Institution, La Tuna, Texas, while the said officer was engaged in and on account of the performance of his official duties.\u201d The indictment thus followed almost verbatim the language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which makes no reference to willfulness or intent. Moreover, a charge of \u201cintentional assault\u201d would obviously be redundant, since by definition intent is an essential element of assault. Because the indictment in this case \u201cadequately contains the elements of the offense charged and fairly informs defendant of this charge\u201d and because the trial judge gave \u201can adequate jury instruction regarding the intent necessary for conviction,\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Purvis, supra, </em>580 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>F.2d at 859, we reject Flood\u2019s second argument and affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"Av\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b488-6\">. The trial had originally been scheduled for February 13, 1978. However, after examining Flood and his court-appointed counsel on February 7, the district judge concluded that they had not had sufficient time to confer regarding the preparation of Flood\u2019s defense. Therefore, the lower court decided that a continuance was necessary to enable Flood to prepare adequately for trial and on February 8 the court entered an order continuing the cause until March 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b488-7\">. The court issued a formal order permitting Flood to inspect these records on March 13.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b488-8\">. On March 22, following a telephonic motion from the defendant, the court had entered an order replacing Flood\u2019s previous attorney with new counsel. This lawyer filed the second motion for a continuance and represented Flood throughout the trial and this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b488-13\">. The jury acquitted Flood on the other two counts of the indictment, which charged him with two separate violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111 involving alleged assaults on two other correctional officers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b488-14\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111 provides that \u201c[wjhoever forcibly assaults, resists, opposes, impedes, <em>intimidates </em>or interferes with any person designated in section 1114 of this title while engaged in or on account of the performance of his official duties shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.\u201d (emphasis added) Among those persons designated by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114 are \u201cofficer[s] or employee[s] of any United States penal or correctional institution.\u201d Flood received the maximum three-year sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
