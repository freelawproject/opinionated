The breach of contract claim seeking return of the fee plaintiff paid to defendant should have been dismissed as redundant of the malpractice claim, there being neither allegation nor proof of an express special promise to effect a cure or accomplish some definite result <em>(see, Winegrad v Jacobs, </em>171 AD2d 525, <em>lv dismissed </em>78 NY2d 952).
