In September 1993, petitioner commenced this proceeding against respondent alleging that she had abused Edward QQ. and, further, had neglected Edward and the remaining children. When respondent failed to appear for the scheduled hearing, an inquest was held and, by order entered November 30, 1994, Family Court adjudicated the children to be neglected. Additionally, Family Court ordered that respondent abide by the terms of an order of protection, also entered on that date, directing her to, <em>inter alia, </em>have no contact with the children. Family Court thereafter issued an amended order of protection, entered December 9, 1994, directing respondent to refrain from, <em>inter alia, </em>violent and abusive behavior with respect to or in the presence of the children. These appeals by respondent followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">Although respondent argues on appeal that she was not ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>vised of the hearing date and, further, did not receive effective assistance of counsel, her arguments overlook the fact that no appeal lies from an order entered upon default <em>(see, Matter of Benjamin G., </em>228 AD2d 813, 814). Rather, the appropriate remedy is to move to vacate the default and, if necessary, appeal the denial of that motion <em>(see, id., </em>at 814; <em>Matter of Hurst v Hurst, </em>227 AD2d 689). Accordingly, the instant appeals must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\">Mikoll, J. P., White, Yesawich Jr. and Spain, JJ., concur. Ordered that the appeals are dismissed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
