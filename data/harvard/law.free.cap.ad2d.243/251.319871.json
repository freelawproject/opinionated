Co., </em>4 AD2d 440, 441, citing <em>Manhattan Cas. Co. v Cholakis, </em>206 Misc 287, <em>affd </em>284 App Div 1041; <em>see also, General Acc. Fire &amp; Life Assur. Corp. v Katz, </em>3 Misc 2d 328). The motion court also correctly awarded defendant insured his costs in defending this declaratory judgment action, since plaintiffs cast him in a defensive posture by the legal steps they took in trying to free themselves from their policy obligations <em>(see, Mighty Midgets v Centennial Ins. Co., </em>47 NY2d 12, 21). Concur\u2014Murphy, P. J., Milonas, Tom, Andrias and Colabella, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
