By the death of the co-defendant, the judgment being joint, survives against the surviving co-defendant or co-defendants as to the personality, and the personal estate of the decesed co-defendant is discharged from liability at law upon it, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>can only be reached by proceeding in a Court of equity, and there only by showing that the deceased participated beneficially in the cause of action upon which the judgment was obtained. In other words, in such a cease the judgment ceases to be a judgment at law against the personal estate of the deceased, and at law is no longer a debt due from the personal representatives of the deceased.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b513-5\">1 <em>Pars, on Contr., </em>11; <em>2 Wm.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AWp\">announced the opinion of the Court:</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">Upon consideration of the question presented by the case stated, and consulting the authorities, we are satisfied that the <em>scire facias </em>in this case was properly issued. It is in accordance' with the opinion of Lord Holt in the case of <em>Parton v. Hale, </em>2 Salk., 598, cited by plaintiff\u2019s counsel, and is also warranted- by the form suggested by him, and as adapted into Tidd\u2019s Appendix of Forms.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">The reason why it is not proper to join the administrator of the deceased co-defendant in a judgment in an execution or writ of <em>scire facias </em>upon it, is this\u2014that, at law, in the case of a joint contract, upon the death of a contractor his executor or administrator is discharged from liability, to be sued upon it, and the survivor or survivors can alone be sued; and if all of them be dead it is only the executor, or administrator of the last survivor who can be charged. 2 <em>Wm. on Ex., </em>1239, citing <em>Goodson v. Good, </em>2 Marsh., 300, and 6 Taunt. 594, S. C.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">If the contract be several, or joint and several, the executor or administrator of the deceased contractor may be sued at law upon the contract in a separate action; but he cannot be sued jointly with the survivor, because one is to be charged <em>de bonis te\u00e9tatoris, </em>and the other <em>de bonis propriis, Id., </em>1249 citing <em>Freem, </em>248; 2 <em>Lev. </em>228.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-11\">It is not necessary to pass upon the effect of our statute (Rev. Code, Chap., 63, Sec. 9,) with respect to obligations or written contracts, which declares that they shall be joint and several unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>otherwise <em>expressed; </em>for the objection with respect to joinder would still be the same as that last mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
