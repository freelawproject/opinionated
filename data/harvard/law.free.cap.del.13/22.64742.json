When the interests of <em>bona fide </em>purchasers are involved the vendor cannot lie by, but must resort to his remedy ' within a reasonable time and at least by the second term of court after the default in payment has been made. A lapse of nine months would bar a recovery against an innocent third party,</syllabus>\n<court data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b30-8\">\n<em>(New Castle,</em>\n</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A3\">November, 1887.)</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-9\">Replevin for a soda water apparatus. The plaintiffs had sold to W. C. R. Colquhoun a soda water fountain for $500, under an agreement that it should be the property of the vendors until it should be fully paid for. The terms of the sale were an allowance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>of $100 for an old fountain,.cash to that amount and six notes for $50 each for the balance. Three of these notes had been paid, the remaining three were still due. The amount claimed was $192.15} interest from April 6, 1883, included. Colquhoun sold his store on Delaware avenue to Anderson &amp; Smith, and that firm in turn sold to Garrett S. Smith, the defendant in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-5\">The contract for the apparatus was put in evidence. The evidence of W. C. R. Colquhoun and Garrett S. Smith showed that the fountain and its appurtenances had been purchased in good faith by .both Anderson &amp; Smith and the defendant. The latter testified that the first intimation he had of the true state of affairs was on April 3, 1886, when Mr. Conrad had notified him by letter. He had succeeded the firm of Anderson &amp; Smith on April 19 of that year- After placing the writ of replevin in evidence, the plaintiffs rested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-6\">Mr. Colquhoun was recalled and said that he had sold the fountain to Anderson <em>&amp; </em>Smith in good faith. He had given three additional notes to Mr. Conrad at three, four and five months in settlement of the Mathews claim against him. The defendant then took the stand and testified that he knew of no claim against the soda water apparatus when he bought it, supposed a clean title went with the sale.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b31-7\"><em>Henry C.

This amounts to a waiver of the right to reclaim the property and is an election to stand upon the personal security of the vendee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-10\">The recovery of judgment was conclusive on the fact that there was a good consideration for the last notes; and that consideration was the sale of the property.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b33-11\">Comegys, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ap\">charged the jury:</p>\n<p id=\"b33-12\">Cited the contract under which the soda-water apparatus was sold by the plaintiffs to Colquhoun. Conditional contracts, did not originate in this State, and had only been recognized by the court here after considerable hesitation. A strict construction had been placed upon them whenever brought before the court, because they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>were considered dangerous, the danger arising from their secrecy. This arose from the fact that there was no possible way by which the public might be made aware of the position occupied by property involved so far as its actual ownership was concerned. The law in all cases protects a bona fide purchaser. When under the terms of one of these conditional contracts the vendor has a right to proceed and enforce it, that right must be exercised within a reasonable time. The vendor cannot lie by, but must resort to his remedy within the passing of the first term of court subsequent to the failure of payment, or at least by the second term after the default has been made., In the case under consideration fully nine months had elapsed after default of payment on the last note and upon this ground the defendants are entitled to a verdict.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
