But if he renders any efficient services as such agent in bringing about the sale of it afterwards by the owner himself, or by any other agent or broker of his employed by him for the sale of it, and the jury is satisfied from the evidence that he rendered any such efficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>service in bringing about the sale afterwards so made of the premises to the purchaser, he is entitled, not to the commission on such sale as agent in the sale of it, but to a just and reasonable compensation for such services as the jury may consider them to have been, worth according to the evidence before them.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Verdict for the plaintiff for $25.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
