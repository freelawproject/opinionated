Ward </em>for the mortgagee and purchaser.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b434-8\">This is riot a case for apportionment of the rent in question. My reasons are as follows :</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b434-9\">1. There is a clear distinction in kind between <em>Judicial </em>Sales and <em>Execution </em>Sales of real property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b434-10\"><em>Rorer on Judicial Sales, </em>Chapters I &amp; II and particularly Secs. 2,7, 12, 15, 17, 23, 26, 30, 31, 41, also Secs. 46, 50, 51 &amp; 52.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b434-11\">\u201c Judicial sales occur in probate and in chancery proceedings for partition of real estate, when a division of the property can not be made in kind; in guardian and administration sales of land in probate; <em>in mortgage foreclosures by equitable proceedings </em>(fee., and we may add, whenever a right or proceeding is enforced, by a sale made by a judicial order or decree, under direction of the Court, as contra-distinguished from sales on execution.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b434-12\">The most common sort of execution sale is that by the Sheriff upon execution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b434-13\">2. The sale under which Catharine H. Pascault bought the farm in question was in foreclosure of mortgage proceedings in Equity, in the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Delaware; William C. Spruance, Esq., the Trustee of the Court to make sale, formally returning his sale, and the Court by special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>decree confirming the sale and ordering the deed to be made by the Trustee to the purchaser. Thus the sale to Catharine H. Pascault was a judicial, as distinguished from a Sheriff\u2019s or execution sale. The proceedings, excepting the deed, which strictly followed the decree, are fully set forth in the special answer of the garnisheed tenant, so as to show the character of this sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-4\">3. Section 28, Chapter III, Rev. Code, applies only to execution or Sheriff sales of land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-5\">Sec. 28, Ch., III Rev. Code and adjacent Sections.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-6\">This <em>\u201c </em>provision \u201d for apportionment of rent in case of Sheriff\u2019s sales \u201c extends no further.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-7\"><em>Wilson v. Delaplaine </em>3 Harr., 499, 500.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-8\">4. The sale to Catharine H. Pascault, having occurred on June 5th, 1888, (and being thereafter duly confirmed and deed executed,) before the crops were cut and the rent was due, she is entitled to the whole rent, without apportionment, <em>Because \u201c </em>The rent follows the reversion. The reversion is vested in the purchaser by virtue of that sale, at the time when the rent falls due. For rent is indivisible. None of it is due until the expiration of the time during which it is accruing.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-9\"><em>Wilson v. Delaplaine, </em>3 Harr., 499, 500.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-10\">5. Rent is indivisible; during the time it is accruing, none of it is due.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-11\">\n<em>Wilson v. Delaplaine, Supra.</em>\n</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-12\">The rent of the Cochran farm in question, being payable in kind, was accruing during the growing and maturing of the crops, but payable or demandable, only at harvest time; that is to say, the rent was due after the reversion was vested by sale on foreclosure in Mrs. Catharine H. Pascault, and therefore, being indivisible, and following the reversion, was payable, as far as the former owner is concerned or any one claiming under him, in its entirety, to her.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>6. It is to be borne in mind, also, that in this case no question is raised between the right of the tenant, Robert R. Cochran, and of Mrs. Catharine H. Pascault, for such tenant\u2019s share of the growing crops. The contention is simply between Mrs. Pascault, a mortgagee, who afterward purchased the land at the foreclosure sale, and the mortgagor, William A. Cochran. In this case, also, the land, upon its sale, failed to pay the debt secured thereby, by many thousand dollars, as appears by the deed referred to in the special answer. Under such circumstances, it is a well settled and equitable principle that \u201c the purchaser of mortgaged premises, upon a foreclosure and sale thereof, is entitled to the growing crops or emblements thereon as against the mortgagor.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-5\"><em>Aldrich v. Rylands, </em>1 Barbour, N. Y. Ch., 613 &amp;c.; Followed by 9 Mo. App. 3, &amp; other courts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-6\">The mortgage of lands is only by way of security for payment of the debt. While the debt is unpaid, the land and its growing products are equally the security for the debt. The mortgagor cannot, either legally or equitably, claim the land, or <em>his share </em>of the growing products, after sale upon foreclosure for an insufficient sum, as against any purchaser at such sale, and much less as against the loss-suffering mortgagee who becomes such purchaser. Even during the continuance of the mortgage, if' the interest become in arrear, a mortgagee can compel the payment of the rent to himself or herself. Much more, after foreclosure and purchase by \u25a0such mortgagee, when land has proven insufficient, ought such mortgagee to be able to hold the mortgagor\u2019s share of the crops growing on the land, which constitute his rent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-7\">T. The right of creditors of the mortgagor attaching rents \u25a0due him, is only co-extensive with his property therein. The springing right \u00a1to collect his rent when due, was divested by the sale under foreclosure before such rent became due, and was thereby vested in the purchaser of the reversion; and the divestiture of the mortgagor a right to collect the rent, divested, <em>a fortiori, </em>the rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>of the rent attaching creditors of the mortgagor to that rent. This appears almost axiomatic.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-4\">8. The purchaser at foreclosure sale is entitled to the crops, growing on the land at the time of the sale, in preference to the mortgagor or any one claiming under him, whose claim originated subsequently to the mortgage. The title takes effect by virtue of the original deed; the sale carries that title, and cuts off all liens and interests created subsequent to the mortgage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-5\"><em>Jones on Mortgages, </em>Sec., 1654; <em>Shepard v. Philbrick </em>2 Denio, 174-6; <em>Lane v. King, </em>8 Wend., 584; <em>Alrich v. Rylands, </em>1 Barbour Ch. (N. Y.,) 613, above cited; <em>Houts v. Showalter, </em>10 Ohio St., 124, 127.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-6\">This case of <em>Shepard v. Philbrick, </em>is very much to the point, and is declared by the Eeporter\u2019s note to the case, to express the well settled English doctrine.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-7\">As above stated, we do not contend for the tenant\u2019s share of the growing crops. He was afterwards continued as tenant of the premises, and all matters arranged by agreement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-8\">As to the arguments advanced by the counsel for the attaching: creditors of the mortgagor, we do not conceive that they in any respect weaken the arguments and conclusions above set forth.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-9\">(1) Sections 67, 69, Ch. 120, Eev. Code, does not expressly contemplate the attachment of rent in kind. Its words apply readily to the conditions attending the payment of a many rent. The law can hardly contemplate the payment of wheat and corn, &amp;c., <em>\u201c to </em>the sheriff to be paid into Court,\u201d Section 68, first sentence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-10\">(2) The argument that Mrs. Pascault, the mortgagee purchaser at foreclosure sale, had constructive notice of the claim of these attaching creditors, by reason of the records thereof in the Superior Court, is a very sharp two edged sword; for, upon the same principal, the record of the Pascault mortgage, the long pending suit in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>the United States Court, the decree therein of March 19, 1888, all of which were before the issuing of the writs of attachment, must surely be considered like constructive notice to these attaching creditors, that William A. Cochran\u2019s, the mortgagor\u2019s, right in these growing crops was liable to be divested, before the harvesting of the crops, by sale upon foreclosure proceedings.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-6\">(3) The argument that, because a tenant is entitled by law in this State to return after the expiration of his term and harvest certain crops which he has sown the previous year, therefore the landlord\u2019s share of such crops constitute rent due the previous year, can not be sound. For the encouragement of agriculture, custom and law will not permit a tenant to lose the benefit of his toil, and will not permit another to reap what he has sown. But if words mean anything, rent is <em>due </em>when it is <em>demandable </em>or <em>payable. </em>Particularly, rent in kind, consisting of harvested grain &amp;c., can not be conceived as <em>due, demandable </em>or <em>payable, </em>until the maturity and harvesting of the crop; for until then the rent paying medium does not exist.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-7\">(4.) The main contention of the counsel for the attaching creditors, appears to be bottomed on the third paragraph of Section 28, Ch. III, Rev. Cdde. Upon this section of the Code, they contend that the attachment of the rent in Robert Cochran\u2019s, the \u2022 tenant\u2019s, hands, would have been a \u201c fair defense \u201d which would have availed against William A. Cochran, the person as whose property the premises were sold, and that therefore the same defence shall avail against Mrs. Pascault, the purchaser.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-8\">But it is to be observed,</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-9\">(1st) That this section is the one treating of apportionment of rent upon Sheriff\u2019s sales and giving remedies for the recovery of such apportionments, and that the third paragraph is expressly limited to such rent and such sales by the words, <em>\u201c </em>In any action, or proceeding for <em>such rent &amp;c. </em>As above shown,, the sale before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>you is not a Sheriff\u2019s sale, and the rent in question not apportion-able, and hence the present is not an \u201c action for <em>such rent</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-4\">(2) The argument based upon this section is, as applied to the law and the facts of this case, pure and simple <em>petitio principii. </em>It assumes that, at the time the rent was due and payable, Eobert Cochran, the tenant, owed it to William A. Cochran, the mortgagor, and concludes that the plea of the attachments would avail against a demand for rent of William A. Cochran, and hence of Mrs. Pascault the purchaser at the foreclosure sale. But the very point of our contention is, that under the facts of this case and the law of this State as laid down in <em>Wilson v. Delaplaine </em>and the unquestioned law of England and the other States, Eobert Cochran, the tenant, owed the entire rent when due and payable, not to William A. Cochran the foreclosed mortgagor, but to Mrs. Pascault, who then was vested with the land and the reversion. To contend that the plea of prior attachment of rent, under a writ against the mortgagor, \u201d. the right to which rent had been, before the same was due and payable, wholly divested out of the mortgagor and into the purchaser at the foreclosure sale, could be set up against the lawful demand of such [purchaser, is manifestly absurd.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b439-6\">Houston, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AWW\">announced the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">In the cases of <em>fi. fa,. </em>attachment of Nathaniel Williams <em>v. </em>William A. Cochran et. al., No. 75, to May Term, 1888, and of The Walton &amp; Whann Company <em>v. </em>William A. Cochran, No. 99, to the same term of this Court, and which were heard before us' at the last, and were held under advisement by us until this term, full arguments in writing having in the meantime been submitted to us by the counsel in them, and which attachments were laid in the hands of Eobert E. Cochran, as garnishee and tenant of William A. Cochran, to attach whatever share of the rents, if any, the latter might be entitled to in the premises in question under all the facts disclosed in the record of the cases before us, and in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>the garnishee in his answer to the respective attachments submits the question to the Court whether the plaintiffs in them, the said Nathaniel Williams, and The Walton &amp; Whann Company, or the said Catharine H. Pascault, the purchaser of the premises under the proceedings and decrees for the sale of them in foreclosure of the mortgage in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Delaware District referred to in the record, and to what proportion of said rent, if the same should legally be apportioned; and concluding his answer in each case with the statement that he holds said rent subject to the order of this Court. There is but one answer the Court can give to this question and that is that this is no case for any apportionment of the rent in question under the provisions of our statute, because the sale of the premises was neither by the sheriff, or by virtue of execution directed to him, but it was made under a decree of foreclosure in the Circuit Court of the United States for this District, of a mortgage upon the premises, and by a trustee of that Court appointed for that purpose, and were purchased at a sale by the mortgagee for a sum of money less than the amount of principal and interest due upon it. We therefore order the rents referred to in the answers of Thomas R. Cochran, the garnishee as in hands be paid to the said Catherine H. Pascault, the purchaser of the premises under the mortgage. We consider the ruling in this case to be well sustained by the cases cited in the argument of the counsel for her. For what was said by the Court in the case cited by him of <em>Wilson v. Ddaplaine, </em>3 Harr., 499. which was an action in this court for money had and received, being for a part of the year\u2019s rent of intestate land sold by the Orphans\u2019 Court, up to the time of sale claimed by the administrators of the intestate, is as applicable in this as it was in that case, viz : that <em>\u201c </em>the rule of the common law that rent follows the reversion is admitted on both sides. But it is contended for the administrators that this rule ought to be, or is, modified by our acts of Assembly apportioning rent in certain cases. We are of the opinion that those acts do not apply to the present case, and the principle of the common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>law applies. The rent follows the reversion. The reversion is vested in the purchaser by virtue of the sale and assignment under the Orphans\u2019 Court, at the time when the rent falls due. For rent is indivisable. None of it is due until the expiration of the time during which it is accruing. The legistature has changed this in the particular case of a sale by the sheriff by virtue of execution process on judgment or decree, and they have apportioned the rent in that case between the debtor and the purchaser. But the provision extends no further. And in case of a sale of intestate land, under an order of the Orphan\u2019s Court, which is but a mode of dividing the land among the heirs of the intestate, and the purchaser takes all the estate of the intestate with its incidents, the accruing rent being one of them.\u201d 3 Harr., 500. And the reason for this ruling is only the stronger when the land is mortgaged and the sale of it is under a decree of foreclosure of the mortgage in an equity proceeding in the Circuit Court of the United States for the district by a trustee appointed to sell it, as in this case where the lien of the mortgage was as binding both in law and equity on the accruing rents and profits of the premises, as it was upon the land itself; for by the common law the non-payment of the mortgage money at the time fixed upon by the parties, was in the nature of a forfeiture of the estate by the mortgagor, and authorized the mortgagee to enter immediately, and to take the emblements. But in Equity he held them, as he did the land, only as a security for the payment of the mortgage debt; and upon redemption he was bound to account for such emblements. Having the legal right, however, and the land and its products being a security to the mortgagee for his debt, a court of equity will not deprive him of his legal right to the emblements until the mortgage money and interest is fully paid. <em>Alrich v. Rylands, </em>1 Barb. Ch., 613; <em>Jones on Mortgages, </em>Sec., 1654: <em>Shepard v. Philbrick, </em>2 Denio, 174; <em>Houts v. Showalter, </em>10 Ohio St., 124. And to these citations we may add the authority of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number><em>Chancellor Kent\u2019s Commentaries, </em>Vol. 4, 160, 161, and of 2 <em>Sto.

Cochran,. should be paid to the said Catharine H. Pascault, the purchaser of the premises at the sale thereof on the foreclosure of the mortgage of the same wherein before stated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
