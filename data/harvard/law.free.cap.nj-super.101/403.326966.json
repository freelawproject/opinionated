J. Super. </em>8 (Ch. <em>Div. </em>1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">On this appeal, in addition to the argument that the separate classification of multi-tenant dwellings for rate making purposes as embodied in the amended ordinance is arbitrary, discriminatory and unreasonable, plaintiffs contend that the rates imposed by the amended ordinance were discriminatory as to them inasmuch as they were charged a greater amount per gallon for allowable gallonage than the rate imposed upon an owner of a single dwelling. This issue was not raised by the complaint, nor presented to Judge Mountain, and consequently was not decided by him. We therefore do not pass upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
