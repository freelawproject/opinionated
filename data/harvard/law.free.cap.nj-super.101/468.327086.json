See <em>Baum v. Tazwell, </em>26 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>292, 61 <em>A. 2d </em>12, 13 <em>(Cir. Ct. </em>1948); 32 <em>Am. Jur., </em>Landlord and Tenant, \u00a7\u00a7 65, 431.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">Appellant contends however that in this case, as in <em>Dorfman v. Barnett, </em>24 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>212, 48 <em>A. 2d </em>217 <em>(Cir. Ct. </em>1946), the general rule is inapplicable. We disagree. We are satisfied from our examination of the lease and the stipulated facts that they furnish no support for appellant\u2019s claim that the contract of lease here involved was entirely personal to the decedent so as to give rise to an implied covenant that it would terminate on her death. <em>Cf. Brigham v. Kidder, </em>99 <em>N. J. L. </em>79, 80 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1923); <em>C. J. S. </em>Landlord and Tenant, \u00a7 92, <em>p. </em>660.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
