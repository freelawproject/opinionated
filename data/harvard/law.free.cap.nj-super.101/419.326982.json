J. S. 2A </em>:170-28, and was given1 a 60-day jail sentence (suspended), fined $58,' and placed on probation for six months. He appealed to the Essex County Court. The matter wa&amp; heard on. the record made at the municipal court hearing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>and resulted in an affirmance. The present appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\"><em>N. J. S. 2A </em>:170-28 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-6\">\u201cAny person wlio by noisy or disorderly conduct disturbs or interferes with the quiet or good order of any place of assembly, public or private, * * * is a disorderly person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">Defendant argues that he did not violate the statute because he was neither noisy nor disorderly. Additionally, he contends that his arrest and conviction as a disorderly person violated his constitutional rights of free speech and assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">The basic facts are not in dispute. On Juno 12, 1965 the Newark Planning Board held a public meeting in the city council chamber to determine whether a certain area of Newark was \u201cblighted\u201d and therefore eligible for an urban renewal program involving the construction of the New Jersey College of Medicine and Dentistry. Just prior to the opening of the hearing, board chairman Booker recognized defendant as floor manager for a majority of those in attendance. He also outlined the procedure that would govern the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">At the time of the incident in question one George Bichardson, who had been speaking for some time, had the floor. Miss Beverly Taylor arose for a point of information. Although the speaker agreed to yield for the purpose of entertaining the question, chairman Booker refused to permit the interruption. At this point defendant went to the microphone to quote <em>Robert\u2019s Rules of Order </em>as supporting Miss Taylor\u2019s request. The chairman ruled him out of order. When Moore continued with his reference to <em>Robert\u2019s, </em>the chairman again ruled him out of order, stating that Moore was not following the procedure set by the board for the hearing \u2014 the board was not using <em>Robert\u2019s. </em>Moore persisted in his efforts to explain what <em>Robert\u2019s </em>held, so that the chairman had to rule him out of order throe more times.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">Moore then said that he wanted to appeal the ruling to the entire board. Booker denied the request. Moore insisted that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>the chair had no legal right to deny such an appeal, that he would not yield, and that \u201cif yon don\u2019t know parliamentary procedure, ask someone; that is the least you can do. Don\u2019t make a fool out of yourself and us, too. That is what you are doing.\u201d Booker asked him to take his seat, and when Moore continued he again informed him that he had been overruled. Moore persisted in saying he had a right to appeal the rulings of the chair, and this resulted in Booker\u2019s repeatedly requesting that he take his seat and that he yield the' floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">\u25a0\u25a0 Booker\u2019s remarks were temperate but firm. When Moore said, \u201cI am asking the chairman to disqualify himself for being mentally incompetent to sit in the chair as chairman,\u201d Booker replied, \u201cWe are going on. You are ruled out of order. You will have your opportunity to speak,\u201d and \u201cSir, if the chair is wrong, you will have your recourse. We have ruled that you are out of order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">: Finally, the chairman asked that the microphone be cleared so that the meeting could proceed, a request three times repeated. When Moore did not relinquish the microphone, the chairman called a brief recess. Following the recess Moore resumed from where he had left off. When Booker again asked him to leave the microphone and ruled him out of order, Moore replied, \u201cI would suggest that you are going. \u25a0 to. have to order that policeman, the police department to remove me.\u201d The minutes of the meeting show that a disturbance ensued, and Moore was led from the council chamber by a police officer who placed him under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The episode just described consumed from 12 to 15 minutes of the meeting, with Miss Taylor and a Harry Wheeler standing; at the microphone- and occasionally interposing remarks. -</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">\u25a0 - -The policeman who took Moore from the council chamber testified at the municipal court hearing and described much of \u25a0 what has been detailed above. When Moore would not relinquish the microphone, the. officer went up to him and told him that Booker was in charge of the meeting and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>he would have to comply with the chairman\u2019s directions. Moore maintained that he was in the right. The officer then said that he was leaving him with no alternative; if he persisted, he would have to remove him and probably arrest him. When Moore did not leave the microphone the officer said, \u201cThere is nothing else I can do,\u201d and asked Moore to accompany him. Moore offered no resistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">The officer also testified that during the course of the controversy there was noise in the place, the meeting was disrupted, and when he removed Moore there was quite a bit of noise. The aisles had become congested when he went up to the microphone to speak to Moore, and as he was removing him from the council chamber the aisles became very congested. The chairman had at no time instructed him to arrest Moore.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">All the testimony was to the effect that Moore was never noisy. However, the statute speaks of \u201cnoisy <em>or </em>disorderly conduct\u201d which disturbs or interferes with the quiet or good order of an assembly. Moore\u2019s conduct clearly violated the statute; although he was not noisy, he certainly disturbed and interfered with the conduct of the hearing. His disregard of chairman Booker\u2019s repeated rulings and requests that he leave the microphone, his insistence upon his point of order, and the <em>ad hominem </em>remarks he addressed to the chair, disrupted the meeting to the point where the assembly became noisy, Miss Taylor and Wheeler joined in the dispute and, finally, those in the audience took to the aisles.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">Although the facts in <em>State v. Smith et al., </em>46 <em>N. J. </em>510 (1966), <em>certiorari </em>denied 385 <em>U. S. </em>838, 87 <em>S. Ct. </em>85, 17 <em>L. Ed. 2d </em>71 (1966), are distinguishable from those in the present, what was said there points the way to our conclusion. <em>Smith </em>also involved a public hearing on a proposed urban development project, held by the governing body in the municipal council chamber. While a citizen was speaking against the proposal there was a disturbance in the area where defendant Callender was sitting, the second such occurrence. The council president called for quiet so that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>speaker might be heard and warned that otherwise he would have to ask the persons involved- to leave or be removed. Callender answered, \u201cWe haven\u2019t started to disrupt your meeting yet,\u201d or \u201cWe haven\u2019t done anything yet.\u201d The president, understanding that \u201cyet\u201d carried a threat-of further disturbance, directed a police officer to escort Callender from the room, whereupon Callender locked arms with someone seated next to him' and went limp to the floor. He was taken out' of the chamber and, as he lay in the corridor, his five co-defendants sat down around him, arms and legs intertwined. ' Callender was convicted in municipal court of violating <em>N. J. S. 2A </em>:170-28 and 29. His appeal to the County Court resulted in an\u2019affirmance. On further appeal he contended, among other things, that <em>N. J. S. 2A </em>:170-28 did not apply and, in any event, his behavior was protected by the Pirst' Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">\u25a0 The Supreme Court held against him on both counts. True, Callender\u2019s resistance to the efforts to remove him interfered with the meeting in a degree somewhat greater than here. Nonetheless, defendant\u2019s persistence for almost a quarter of an hour in refusing to accept the rulings of the chair, or to leave the microphone and resume his seat, was such conduct as disturbed and interfered with the quiet and good order of the planning board hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Although the Chief Justice spoke in <em>Smith </em>of Callender\u2019s physical resistance, what he said is applicable to this case: the decision of a chairman may not be tested by resisting his repeated rulings to bring order back into the meeting.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-6\">\u201c* * * Government could not govern if its vital processes could thus be brought to halt. Again, no court would tolerate such interference with its proceedings; the need is the same in the legislative chamber, at the State and at the local level. The chair must have the power to suppress a disturbance or the threat of one * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-7\">(at <em>page </em>517)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">. Dealing with Callender\u2019s claim that his behavior was protected by the Pirst Amendment, the Chief Justice said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>\u201cHere there was no denial of an opportunity to protest. On the contrary the meeting was called to the very end of permitting all to have their say, for or against the urban redevelopment proposal. Callender was not denied a chance to be heard. Rather he was denied a right he seemingly claimed to interfere with the right of others to hear and be heard. He was not ordered removed because he expressed views which displeased the presiding officer. He was ordered out because, in response to the president\u2019s call for quiet, he threatened even greater disruption of this public meeting. \u201cWhether the forum be the courtroom or the chamber of the legislature itself or of a political subdivision of the State, there must be order. It is frivolous to suggest the First Amendment stands in the way of that imperative.\u201d (at <em>pages </em>516-517)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Defendant relies on <em>Cox v. State of Louisiana, </em>379 <em>U. S. 536, 85 S. Ct. </em>453, 13 <em>L. Ed. 2d </em>471 (1965). As the Chief Justice observed in <em>Smith, </em>that case is distinguishable on its facts and can give a defendant like ours small comfort. The majority in <em>Cox </em>said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-6\">\u201c* * * The rights of free speech and assembly, while fundamental in our democratic society, still do not mean that everyone with opinions or beliefs to express may address a group at any public place and at any time. The constitutional guarantee of liberty implies the existence of an organized society maintaining public order, without which liberty itself would be lost in the excesses of anarchy. * * *\u201d (379 <em>U. S., </em>at <em>page </em>554, 85 S. <em>Ct., </em>at <em>page </em>464, 13 <em>L. Ed. 2d, </em>at <em>page </em>484)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">Although the facts in <em>United States v. Woodard, </em>376 <em>F. 2d </em>136 (7 <em>Cir. </em>1967), differ from those before us, it may appropriately be quoted as supporting defendant\u2019s conviction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-8\">\u201c* * * Public hearings of every character, executive, legislative, and judicial, are most often \u2018public\u2019 as to physical presence, but not as to participation. As such, they must be conducted with decorum. If each spectator were privileged to shout or even speak at will, pandemonium would likely result. \u201cWhen, as here, activity engaged in by a spectator prevents the orderly continuation of the hearing, it falls within the prohibition of the statute. <em>Cf., State v. Smith, </em>46 <em>N. J. </em>510 * * (at <em>pages </em>139-140)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">Defendant\u2019s conduct violated <em>N. J. S. 2A </em>:170-28. It was not protected under the First Amendment. The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
