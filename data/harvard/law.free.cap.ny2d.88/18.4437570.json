It was per se reversible error to exclude defendant from a sidebar conference concerning a prospective juror\u2019s ability to be fair and impartial, even though the juror was later challenged by the defense, because defendant did not have the opportunity to participate meaningfully in the decision to challenge that juror. <em>(People v Antommarchi, </em>80 NY2d 247; <em>People v Sprowal, </em>84 NY2d 113; <em>People v Williams [Mike], </em>85 NY2d 945; <em>Rosales-Lopez v United States, </em>451 US 182; <em>Lewis v United States, </em>146 US 370; <em>People v Sloan, </em>79 NY2d 386; <em>People v Mitchell, </em>80 NY2d 519; <em>People v Velasco, </em>77 NY2d 469; <em>People v Favor, </em>82 NY2d 254; <em>People v Turaine, </em>78 NY2d 871.) II. By permitting jurors to submit questions to the People\u2019s witnesses, the court relieved the People of their burden of proof, undermined the integrity of the adversary system, and deprived defendant of his right to be tried by a neutral jury that has not engaged in premature deliberations. <em>(People v Patterson, </em>39 NY2d 288; <em>People v Ahmed, </em>66 NY2d 307; <em>Cancemi v People, </em>18 NY 128; <em>Williams v Florida, </em>399 US 78; <em>Offutt v United States, </em>348 US 11; <em>United States v Bush, </em>47 F3d 511; <em>Duncan v Louisiana, </em>391 US 145; <em>Apodaca v Oregon, </em>406 US 404; <em>United States v Sutton, </em>970 F2d 1001; <em>United States v Johnson, </em>914 F2d 136.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b112-6\"><em>Robert M.

Defendant\u2019s unobjected-to absence from the sidebar conference with a prospective juror does not require reversal. <em>(People v Robinson, </em>36 NY2d 224; <em>People v Patterson, </em>39 NY2d 288, 432 US 197; <em>People v Antommarchi, </em>80 NY2d 247; <em>People v Dokes, </em>79 NY2d 656; <em>People v Mehmedi, </em>69 NY2d 759; <em>People v Bonaparte, 78 </em>NY2d 26; <em>People v Ahmed, </em>66 NY2d 307; <em>People </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number><em>v Sprowal, </em>84 NY2d 113; <em>People v Robles, </em>86 NY2d 763; <em>Kentucky v Stincer, </em>482 US 730.) II. Defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court should not have submitted jurors\u2019 questions to two witnesses is unpreserved for this Court\u2019s review; in any event, the trial court acted well within its discretion. <em>(People v Narayan, </em>54 NY2d 106; <em>People v Stewart, </em>81 NY2d 877; <em>People v Gerard, </em>208 AD2d 421; <em>People v Tucker, </em>153 AD2d 164, 77 NY2d 861; <em>United States v Bush, </em>47 F3d 511; <em>United States v Ajmal, </em>67 F3d 12; <em>People v Wilds, </em>141 AD2d 395; <em>People v Knapper, </em>230 App Div 487; <em>People v Bacic, </em>202 AD2d 234; <em>Sitrin Bros. v Deluxe Lines, </em>35 Misc 2d 1041.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b113-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b113-6\">Levine, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">These appeals present heretofore unresolved issues in the application of this Court\u2019s doctrine concerning a criminal defendant\u2019s statutory (CPL 260.20) right to be present at sidebar conferences with prospective jurors concerning their possible inability to fairly and objectively weigh the evidence in the case. In all three cases, the venire members whose sidebar conferences were not attended by the defendants ultimately were not seated on the juries, having been excused for cause, by consent, or by peremptory challenge. Thus, these cases call upon us to determine whether, if at all, or under what circumstances, the fact that a prospective juror did not actually deliberate on defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence obviates any violation of the defendant\u2019s statutory right to be present at the sidebar with that juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">\n<em>People v Roman</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">Jury selection in defendant Roman\u2019s murder trial straddled the handing down of our decision in <em>People v Antommarchi </em>(80 NY2d 247) on October 27, 1992. The record indicates that the impact of <em>Antommarchi </em>on voir dire procedure was discussed by the trial court and counsel prior to the continuance of jury selection on October 28. On that date, during the court\u2019s preliminary instructions to the panel, an unidentified venire member asked to \"come up\u201d, and an unrecorded conversation took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">Jury selection continued into a third round on October 29. At the conclusion of the court\u2019s preliminary instructions to the panel, a prospective juror Wilson announced in open court that she had been a crime victim recently and was especially angered because the crime was committed in the presence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>her child. A sidebar discussion ensued at which defendant\u2019s counsel but not defendant was present. Wilson was not seated as a juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">At the conclusion of the trial, defendant Roman was convicted of murder. Prior to sentencing, he made a motion to vacate the conviction on the ground that the <em>Antommarchi </em>ruling had been violated. At sentencing, the trial court denied the motion. The court made findings that (1) during jury selection on October 28, no sidebar conference with a juror occurred; and (2) after the sidebar conference with prospective juror Wilson on October 29, she indicated that, having recently been a crime victim in the presence of her child, \"she could not be fair\u201d, and she was discharged for cause upon consent of defendant and the People. Defendant\u2019s conviction was affirmed by a divided panel of the Appellate Division, First Department (217 AD2d 473). The majority held that any violation of <em>Antommarchi </em>did not require reversal because no prospective juror interviewed outside defendant\u2019s presence was seated on his jury and, therefore, defendant was not prejudiced by exclusion from the sidebar. Defendant appeals, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">\n<em>People v Feliciano</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">The record of the voir dire in defendant Feliciano\u2019s robbery trial indicates that some 10 members of the venire were party to sidebar conferences concerning possible bias, at which the defendant was not present. None of those prospective jurors was seated on defendant\u2019s trial jury. One was excused on a peremptory challenge by the People, three were excused for cause upon consent and six merely excused \"on consent\u201d. Applying <em>People v Antommarchi (supra), </em>the Appellate Division, Second Department, reversed Feliciano\u2019s robbery convictions (209 AD2d 634). The Court rejected the People\u2019s contention that reversal was not required because none of the prospective jurors interviewed outside the defendant\u2019s presence sat on the jury, concluding that harmless error analysis was not appropriate under the circumstances. The People appeal, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">\n<em>People v Starks</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">Defendant Starks was tried for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. During jury voir dire, a prospective juror Samuels announced in open court that she had some problems in sitting on defendant\u2019s case because she thought she had seen him before. She was asked to approach the Bench <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>and conferred with the trial court and counsel outside the defendant\u2019s presence. At the conclusion of that day of jury selection, as the court was about to excuse the panel, the court asked Samuels to remain \"to put on the record the very brief conversation we had at the bench.\u201d The court then recited in the defendant\u2019s presence that Ms. Samuels thought she recognized him from her neighborhood or in connection with her church activities and said she could be fair and impartial if shown that there was no prior acquaintanceship with defendant. Ms. Samuels confirmed that this was an accurate description of her earlier sidebar conversation with the court and counsel. The court gave the prosecution and defense a further opportunity to ask questions, which both sides declined. The following day, defendant\u2019s attorney exercised a peremptory challenge to excuse Samuels \"after conferring with my client [because] there is no way that I can live with [juror Samuels].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">During the trial, the court permitted the jury to submit questions to be propounded to witnesses by the court, some of which were asked and answered. The defense did not interpose any objection to that procedure. Starks was found guilty of criminal sale of cocaine by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">On appeal from defendant Starks\u2019s conviction, the Appellate Division, First Department, rejected his <em>Antommarchi </em>argument regarding the sidebar conference with Ms. Samuels, holding that no prejudice occurred since Samuels was not seated on the jury. The Court also supported its holding by citing to the trial court\u2019s subsequent replication of the sidebar conference which the court conducted in the defendant\u2019s presence. Defendant appeals, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">Under our case law, the jury selection process is an ancillary proceeding \u2014 not a \"core\u201d proceeding critical to the outcome of a criminal trial <em>(People v Sprowal, </em>84 NY2d 113, 117). Therefore, a defendant\u2019s right to be present at a sidebar conference with a prospective juror exploring possible general or specific bias is governed exclusively by New York statutory law \u2014 CPL 260.20, which gives the defendant a right to be \" 'personally present\u2019 during the trial of an indictment\u201d <em>(id.; see, People v Mitchell, </em>80 NY2d 519, 526-527).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">The right to be present under CPL 260.20 extends to every ancillary proceeding that is a \"material stage\u201d of the trial <em>(People v Favor, </em>82 NY2d 254, 265; <em>People v Dokes, </em>79 NY2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>656, 662), that is, proceedings in which a defendant\u2019s presence \"could have a substantial effect on [his or her] ability to defend against the charges\u201d <em>(People v Sloan, </em>79 NY2d 386, 392; <em>see, People v Favor, </em>82 NY2d, at 264, <em>supra </em>[statutory right to be present extends to \"any proceeding in which the defendant\u2019s presence is substantially and meaningfully related to the ability to defend\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">A defendant\u2019s presence is substantially and materially related to the ability to defend when the defendant \"can potentially contribute to the proceeding\u201d under scrutiny <em>(People v Sprowal, </em>84 NY2d, at 118, <em>supra); </em>or when a defendant\u2019s \"presence would have been useful in ensuring a more reliable determination\u201d of the particular proceeding at issue <em>(People v Morales, </em>80 NY2d 450, 454). A defendant\u2019s presence at sidebar interviews of prospective jurors for bias or hostility during jury selection is generally required because of the potential input the defendant can give defense counsel in making discretionary choices during jury selection, based on impressions gained from seeing and hearing the juror\u2019s responses on voir dire <em>(see, People v Sloan, </em>79 NY2d, at 392, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Invocation of the statutory right to be present will be rejected, however, when the claim that a defendant\u2019s presence would have had an impact on the outcome of the trial is \"speculative\u201d <em>(People v Morales, </em>80 NY2d, at 455, <em>supra), </em>or the violation of the statute is \"de minimis\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 457, n 2). As most directly pertains to the instant appeals, we have also rejected claims under CPL 260.20 when, either because of the nature of the particular proceeding or its ultimate outcome, the defendant\u2019s presence was \" 'useless, or the benefit but a shadow\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v Morales, supra, </em>at 454, quoting <em>Snyder v Massachusetts, </em>291 US 97, 106-107 [Cardozo, J.]). That is, a reversal is not required when, because of the matter then at issue before the court or the practical result of the determination of that matter, the defendant\u2019s presence could not have afforded him or her any meaningful opportunity to affect the outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Thus, in <em>People v Smith, </em>the companion case to <em>People v Favor (supra), </em>reversal was not required because, at the only portion of the <em>Sandoval </em>proceeding from which the defendant Smith was excluded, the outcome was wholly favorable to him. Defendant Smith\u2019s presence was, therefore, \"superfluous\u201d (82 NY2d, at 268), that is, \"it cannot reasonably be said that there was any potential for additional meaningful input by defendant\u201d <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Likewise, because only defense counsel (and not the defendant personally) may argue or choose a stratagem when the proceeding involves a question of law or procedure, hearings on those matters do not involve any potential for meaningful input by a defendant, and presence is not required <em>(People v Rodriguez, </em>85 NY2d 586 [hearing on scope of cross-examination]; <em>People v Williams, </em>85 NY2d 945 [hearing on withdrawal of motion to contest finding of competency to stand trial]; <em>People v Velasco, </em>77 NY2d 469 [precharge conference including hearing on motion to dismiss, argument on legal basis for challenges for cause]; <em>People v Mullen, </em>44 NY2d 1 [hearing on a sworn juror\u2019s disqualification for personal bias]).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">By the same token, a defendant\u2019s absence from a hearing will not deprive him or her of the opportunity to give meaningful input when the court essentially holds a de nova hearing on the same matter at which defendant is present <em>(see, People v Favor, </em>82 NY2d, at 268, supra; <em>People v Velasco, </em>77 NY2d, at 473, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">The foregoing principles derived from our prior cases on a defendant\u2019s statutory right to be present at material ancillary proceedings afford a basis for decision in the instant cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">\n<em>People v Roman</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">Initially, as to the claimed exclusion of defendant Roman from a sidebar conference with an unidentified juror on October 28, 1992, the trial court made an unchallenged finding at defendant\u2019s sentencing that no such event occurred on that date, and the record does not afford a basis for us to overturn that finding. Concededly, however, a sidebar conference at which defendant was not present took place on October 29 with prospective juror Wilson. In affirming defendant Roman\u2019s conviction, the Appellate Division relied upon the fact that Wilson was hot selected to serve on the defendant\u2019s jury, adhering to the rationale of earlier cases from that court holding that a defendant could not have been prejudiced by exclusion from a conference concerning the qualification of a venire member who did not serve on the trial jury (217 AD2d 473, 474-475, citing <em>People v Shabani, </em>203 AD2d 142, <em>lv denied </em>84 NY2d 832; <em>People v Perez, </em>196 AD2d 781, <em>lv denied </em>82 NY2d 900).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\"> Contrary to the conclusion of the Appellate Division, a CPL 260.20 violation is not overcome merely because the venire person who was interviewed outside the defendant\u2019s pres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>ence was not seated on the jury. That alone \"do[es] not negate the possibility that defendant might have made a meaningful contribution to the [proceeding]\u201d <em>(People v Favor, </em>82 NY2d, at 267, <em>supra), </em>by way of advice to counsel on the selection or rejection of that juror. In defendant Roman\u2019s case, however, the sidebar hearing from which defendant was excluded on October 29 concerned juror Wilson\u2019s disqualification for cause, arising out of her bias against the defense which she had expressed in open court in defendant\u2019s presence. Disqualification of Wilson was a decision for the trial court to make after hearing argument, if any, by counsel, at which defendant could not have made any meaningful contribution (see, <em>People v Ganett, </em>68 AD2d 81, 86-87, <em>affd </em>51 NY2d 991; <em>see also, People v Mullen, </em>44 NY2d, at 5-6, <em>supra). </em>When a prospective juror is disqualified by the court for cause, any benefit defendant could possibly claim from his presence at that excuse for cause hearing would have been \"but a shadow\u201d <em>(Snyder v Massachusetts, supra), </em>and purely speculative <em>(People v Morales, supra). </em>Therefore, defendant\u2019s absence from that hearing does not require reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">\n<em>People v Feliciano</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">For the same reasons discussed regarding defendant Roman\u2019s absence from the disqualification for cause hearings, defendant Feliciano\u2019s absence from sidebar conferences with the three venire members excused for cause would not have required reversal. Likewise, defendant\u2019s claim in reliance upon his exclusion from the sidebar with the juror peremptorily challenged by the People must be rejected. His presence \"cannot reasonably be said [to have afforded him] any potential for * * * meaningful input\u201d on the <em>prosecution\u2019s </em>decision to excuse that juror <em>(People v Favor, </em>82 NY2d, at 268, <em>supra). </em>Under both circumstances of challenges for cause and peremptory challenges by the People, the defendant\u2019s meaningful participation to affect the outcome of the hearing was negated.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">However, according to the voir dire minutes, six other members of the panel were excused after sidebar conferences at which the defendant was not present. Thus, the record does not negate the possibility that defendant Feliciano could have provided valuable input on his counsel\u2019s apparently discretionary choice to excuse those venire persons. The Appellate Division, therefore, properly held that defendant\u2019s exclusion from the sidebar conferences with those jurors required reversal on the state of this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>\n<em>People v Starks</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">As the Appellate Division held, the trial court essentially replicated de nova in defendant Starks\u2019 presence the sidebar conference concerning juror Samuel\u2019s misgivings on serving because of a possible prior acquaintance with the defendant, and invited further questioning by the prosecution and defense. Samuels was subsequently excused by defense counsel after conferring with the defendant because the defense \"could not live with\u201d that juror. Thus, the record supports the conclusion by the courts below that defendant Starks was given a full and fair opportunity to give meaningful input regarding the discretionary decision to challenge Samuels peremptorily including the option to conduct extensive additional voir dire where her responses to questions could be observed and heard (see, <em>id., </em>at 267; <em>People v Velasco, supra). </em>Under these circumstances, any violation of CPL 260.20 was de minimis, and the possibility that the defendant\u2019s presence at the initial sidebar with Samuels would have altered the defense\u2019s strongly negative impression of her is so remote and speculative as not to require reversal <em>(see, People v Morales, </em>80 NY2d, at 455, 457, n 2, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">We also agree with the Appellate Division that defendant\u2019s failure to preserve by timely objection any error in the trial court\u2019s submission of jurors\u2019 questions precludes appellate review as a question of law and, hence, does not afford a basis for reversal by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Accordingly, in each case, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Simons, Titone, Bellacosa, Smith and Ciparick concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">In each case: Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
