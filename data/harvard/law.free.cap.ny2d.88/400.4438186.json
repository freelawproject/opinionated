When the Grand Jury is subjected to improper influence and bias, its ability to discharge these essential functions fairly and reliably is necessarily undermined and the integrity of this constitutionally and historically independent institution impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">In order to protect the liberty of all citizens, the Legislature requires that an indictment be dismissed where the Grand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>Jury proceeding is defective <em>(see, </em>CPL 210.20 [c]). Moreover, dismissal of the indictment is specifically compelled by statute when the integrity of the Grand Jury proceeding is impaired \"and prejudice to the defendant may result\u201d (CPL 210.35 [5]).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The issue in this case is whether prosecutorial improprieties during presentation of defendant\u2019s case to the Grand Jury rendered the resultant indictment fatally defective. Because the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct was intentional, usurped the function of the Grand Jury and biased the proceedings against the defendant,, it impaired the integrity of the Grand Jury proceedings and created a substantial risk of prejudice to the defendant. We therefore reverse the order of the Appellate Division and dismiss the indictment, as mandated by CPL 210.35 (5), with leave to the District Attorney to seek resubmission of the charges to another Grand Jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">On the evening of April 14, 1982, defendant\u2019s wife, Mary Huston, and her mother, Allison Brown, were murdered in their home. Defendant and Mary Huston had been married, divorced and remarried. At the time of the murders, defendant was living at the home of his brother, Frank Huston.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">That evening, defendant accompanied the police to the station for questioning and provided them with a statement regarding his whereabouts. Defendant told the police that he had been served with divorce papers that day and went to his wife\u2019s house in the late afternoon to discuss them with her, accompanied by a friend. Later, he made his evening walk past his wife\u2019s house. The police searched the home of Frank Huston with defendant\u2019s consent and also interviewed various family members. Nevertheless, they were unable to link defendant or anyone else to the crime, and no arrests were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">One and one-half years later, the police resumed their investigation, and Grand Jury proceedings against defendant commenced in November 1983. The first civilian witness called by the prosecutor to testify before the Grand Jury was Emma Threats. Threats was a friend of Vickie Pickles, who lived with defendant\u2019s father, Jule Huston. Threats testified that Pickles came to her apartment at 5:00 a.m. on April 15, 1982, the day after the murders. Threats further testified that Pickles had a drink; Pickles told her that defendant had arrived at their apartment the previous evening, covered with blood and carrying a knife; and that Pickles informed her that defendant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>stated to his father, \"I told you I was going to do it and I did it.\u201d According to Threats, Pickles also told her that defendant had left the knife at their apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">The prosecutor informed the Grand Jury that Threats\u2019 testimony constituted hearsay and that \"[i]t is not evidence, that you can use at all against Joshua Samuel Huston.\u201d But he then said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">\"I\u2019m asking you now to perform the task of excluding that from your mind with respect to your ultimate deliberation regarding Joshua Samuel Huston. What we\u2019re going to be doing is calling in Vickie Pickles. I\u2019ll have the subpoena served upon her. She\u2019ll be in probably two week[s] from today. At that time we\u2019ll try and get the truth from her. If she\u2019s cooperative and is willing to tell us the truth, then there\u2019s no problem, you\u2019ll just drop out and forget about the testimony entirely that you\u2019ve heard from Emma Threats. If we have problems and if Vickie Pickles, whether it\u2019s from fear or obstinacy, whatever, is not going to cooperate with us and disclose the truth to us, then I will be bringing up the other witness who has similar testimony as this from Georgia and seek a perjury indictment against Vickie Pickles from you. Okay. That\u2019s the purpose of it. And that\u2019s the admonition that I want the record to reflect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">Two weeks later, Pickles was called before the Grand Jury. She testified that defendant had visited his father earlier in the day on April 14, 1982. Defendant showed up again at 8:00 that evening, with a knife hidden in the sleeve of his blue jacket. Although there was blood on the tip of the knife and on defendant\u2019s hand, she saw no blood on defendant\u2019s clothing. According to Pickles, defendant told his father, \"I think I killed them.\u201d He did not leave the knife at their apartment but took it with him after Pickles refused to get rid of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">Pickles contended that her conversation with Threats the next day took place in the afternoon and in Threats\u2019 van, not her apartment. She further maintained that, while she never informed the police of this incident, she related it to a friend named Charles Jones as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">The grand jurors themselves asked that defendant\u2019s father be subpoenaed to testify, but the prosecutor expressed reluctance, responding that Jule Huston might be implicated in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>commission or facilitation of the crime. Two weeks after Pickles\u2019 testimony, however, Jule Huston testified before the Grand Jury. He maintained that defendant never returned to their apartment after his afternoon visit. According to Jule Huston, Pickles was an alcoholic who suffered from hallucinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">Notwithstanding Jule Huston\u2019s repeated denials that defendant appeared at their apartment the evening of the murders displaying a knife, the prosecutor continued time and again to assume the existence of these repudiated facts during extended questioning of Huston. For instance, the prosecutor prefaced his questions to Huston with statements such as, \"when [defendant] came over to your apartment that night\u201d or \"on that evening, when [defendant] displayed the knife.\u201d Even after Huston had steadfastly maintained that he never saw defendant that evening and that defendant never made any statement to him about the murders, the prosecutor asked questions such as, \"that night, Wednesday, April 14th, 1982, when [defendant] said that he thought that he had killed both of them, did you indicate to him to just throw the knife into the field?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">During Huston\u2019s testimony, the prosecutor ordered him to stop \"running your mouth off without listening.\u201d Huston was examined regarding the fact that, in the past, he had admitted himself to a psychiatric institution and pleaded guilty in a robbery case. He was also asked about his son\u2019s prior drug addiction. Pickles, by contrast, was never questioned about her alleged drinking problem, even though several witnesses before the Grand Jury concurred that she was an alcoholic.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">The prosecutor also asked Huston about a laundry list of personal items belonging to Vickie Pickles that remained in Huston\u2019s apartment although Pickles was no longer living there. The prosecutor informed the Grand Jury that he was issuing a subpoena to Huston requiring him to produce all of these items to the District Attorney\u2019s office, who would forward them to Pickles. When Huston was subsequently recalled to the stand, the prosecutor berated him for not bringing these personal belongings with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">Testimony established that Allison Brown had been stabbed 12 times and Mary Huston 9 times, and the Grand Jury was shown photographs of the victims. The Grand Jury was also shown photographs of a pair of sneakers removed from the home of defendant\u2019s brother and a green jacket that defendant was wearing when questioned by the police on April 14, 1982. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>Both items had human blood on them, in amounts insufficient to allow any grouping or typing.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">During the proceedings, several grand jurors noted that, according to Threats, Pickles had told her defendant was covered with blood. One grand juror thus commented that there \"[s]hould have been more blood on his chest someplace,\u201d and another observed, \"[a]s a matter of fact, just looking at the number of wounds, punctures, he\u2019d have to have more blood.\u201d The prosecutor dismissed the grand jurors\u2019 concerns, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-6\">\"No, that\u2019s not accurate. It\u2019s not necessarily the case, even though you see a lot of blood, you also have to keep in mind that they had been lying there for a long time, so for a sufficient period of time, a lot of that blood would have come from bleeding onto the floor, so there\u2019s nothing to indicate, we\u2019ve got no evidence to indicate and it\u2019s not accurate to assume that by the stab, the blood would splatter out and cover him, that kind of thing is not necessarily so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">A neighbor of Mary Huston further testified that she saw defendant and his wife arguing on the day of her death. She also observed defendant standing in the driveway outside his wife\u2019s home between 7:00 and 7:30 that evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">The Grand Jury charged defendant with two counts of murder in the second degree. Defendant subsequently moved to dismiss the indictment due to prosecutorial misconduct before the Grand Jury. Although the trial court was \"disturbed\u201d by \"the way the prosecutor seemed to testify before the Grand Jury,\u201d it orally denied the motion. Defendant proceeded to trial and was convicted of both murder counts. The Appellate Division affirmed the convictions, concluding that defendant had failed to establish any possibility of prejudice resulting from the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct. We now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">Our State Constitution guarantees that \"[n]o person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime * * * unless on indictment of a grand jury\u201d (NY Const, art I, \u00a7 6; <em>see also, </em>CPL art 190). By acting as a \"buffer between the State and its citizens,\u201d the Grand Jury shields against prosecutorial excesses and protects individuals from unfounded prosecutions <em>(People v Calbud, Inc., </em>49 NY2d 389, 394, 396; <em>see, People v Pelchat, </em>62 NY2d 97, 108). Historically, the Grand Jury has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>performed, the essential function of investigating criminal activity to determine whether sufficient evidence exists to accuse a citizen of a crime <em>(see, People v Lancaster, </em>69 NY2d 20, 26, <em>cert denied </em>480 US 922; <em>People v Calbud, Inc., </em>49 NY2d at 394)</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The Criminal Procedure Law designates both the District Attorney and the court as legal advisors to the Grand Jury <em>(see, </em>CPL 190.25 [6]). Because Grand Jury proceedings are conducted by the prosecutor alone, this function confers upon the prosecutor broad powers and duties, as well as wide discretion in presenting the People\u2019s case <em>(see, People v Di Falco, </em>44 NY2d 482, 487). In addition to providing legal instruction to the Grand Jury, the District Attorney determines what evidence to present to that body and what evidence should be excluded <em>(see, id., </em>at 486-487).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">The prosecutor\u2019s discretion during Grand Jury proceedings, however, is not absolute. As legal advisor to the Grand Jury, the prosecutor performs dual functions: that of public officer and that of advocate. The prosecutor is thus \"charged with the duty not only to secure indictments but also to see that justice is done\u201d <em>(People v Lancaster, </em>69 NY2d at 26, <em>supra; see also, People v Pelchat, </em>62 NY2d at 105, <em>supra). </em>With this potent authority, moreover, comes responsibility, including \"the prosecutor\u2019s duty of fair dealing\u201d <em>(People v Pelchat, </em>62 NY2d at 104, <em>supra). </em>As this Court has explained, \"[tjhese duties and powers, bestowed upon the District Attorney by law, vest that official with substantial control over the Grand Jury proceedings, requiring the exercise of completely impartial judgment and discretion\u201d <em>(People v Di Falco, </em>44 NY2d at 487, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Where, as here, the charges facing the defendant are of the most serious nature, society\u2019s interest in justice is especially great. Nevertheless, the prosecutor who submitted defendant\u2019s case to the Grand Jury disregarded his role as public officer and his \"duty of fair dealing.\u201d The Grand Jury minutes are rife with instances of the prosecutor imparting his personal opinion regarding the proper inferences to draw from the testimony or physical evidence, asking impermissible and inflammatory questions, and conveying \u2014 both directly and indirectly \u2014 his belief in defendant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">An example of such misconduct was the prosecutor\u2019s use of the concededly inadmissible hearsay testimony of Emma Threats, relating Vickie Pickles\u2019 narration to her of defendant\u2019s appearance with a bloody knife and his admission to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>murders. Importantly, the prosecutor openly acknowledged that Threats\u2019 testimony was not offered for any legitimate purpose. Rather, his articulated purpose for introducing Threats\u2019 hearsay testimony before calling Pickles to the stand was to force Pickles to conform her account to the factual rendition already given by Threats and prevent any repudiation or modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Such deliberate tactics to influence a witness\u2019 Grand Jury testimony jeopardize \"the goal of fostering free and truthful testimony\u201d <em>(People v Sayavong, </em>83 NY2d 702, 708). We have, moreover, long condemned any Grand Jury practice that might incline a witness to give an inaccurate account of her knowledge of a crime <em>(see, e.g., People v Minet, </em>296 NY 315 [forbidding the presence of one witness during the Grand Jury testimony of another]).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Even worse, the prosecutor proceeded to use Threats\u2019 inadmissible testimony as a platform to convey to the Grand Jury his personal belief in defendant\u2019s guilt. He repeatedly informed the Grand Jury that the version of events recounted by Threats was \"the truth.\u201d He further vouched for the reliability of Threats\u2019 hearsay testimony by advising the Grand Jury that there was another witness in Georgia with \"similar testimony.\u201d The prosecutor thus became an unsworn witness against defendant, creating the danger that the Grand Jury, \"impressed by the prestige of the office of the District Attorney, [would] accord great weight to [his] beliefs and opinions\u201d <em>(People v Paperno, </em>54 NY2d 294, 301).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">The prosecutor\u2019s comments usurped the function of the Grand Jury, which \"remains the exclusive judge of the facts with respect to any matter before it\u201d <em>(People v Pelchat, </em>62 NY2d at 105, <em>supra; accord, </em>CPL 190.25 [5]). The CPL provides that a Grand Jury may issue an indictment only where there is legally sufficient evidence <em>and </em>\"competent and admissible evidence before it provides reasonable cause to believe that [a] person [has] committed [an] offense\u201d (CPL 190.65 [1] [b]). \"Reasonable cause\u201d exists</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-8\">\"when evidence or information <em>which appears reliable </em>discloses facts or circumstances which are collectively <em>of such weight and persuasiveness </em>as to convince a person of ordinary intelligence, judgment and experience that it is reasonably likely that such offense was committed and that such person committed it\u201d (CPL 70.10 [emphasis added]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>Reasonable cause \"dictates the degree of certitude grand jurors must possess to indict\u201d and, unlike legal sufficiency, is exclusively within the province of the Grand Jury <em>(People v Jennings, </em>69 NY2d 103, 115). Consequently, determination as to whether Pickles or Jule Huston was the more reliable witness and the weight to accord each witness\u2019 testimony was to be made solely by the Grand Jury, uninfluenced by the opinion of the prosecutor <em>(cf., People v Batashure, </em>75 NY2d 306 [prosecutor may not inform the Grand Jury that, as a matter of law, he or she has determined that legally sufficient evidence has been presented]).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Nor was this an isolated instance. To the contrary, the prosecutor\u2019s exploitation of Threats\u2019 inadmissible testimony was part of an over-all pattern of bias and misconduct. The prosecutor again acted as an unsworn witness, usurping the fact-finding function of the Grand Jury, when he informed it of the inference it should draw from the fact that only a small amount of human blood was found on defendant\u2019s sneaker and jacket \u2014 the only physical evidence connecting defendant to the murders. Specifically, he informed questioning grand jurors that it was \"not accurate\u201d that, given the number of stab wounds, more blood should have been found on defendant\u2019s clothing. He further stated, \"we\u2019ve got no evidence to indicate and it\u2019s not accurate to assume that by the stab, the blood would splatter out and cover him.\u201d Whether this physical evidence was sufficiently persuasive to warrant belief that defendant committed the crime, however, was a question reserved exclusively for the grand jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Throughout his questioning of Jule Huston, moreover, the prosecutor communicated his disbelief in Huston\u2019s testimony to the Grand Jury. Although Jule Huston repeatedly denied that the bloody knife incident ever took place, the prosecutor continued to ask questions that assumed defendant did indeed appear at Huston\u2019s apartment with a bloody knife and admit to killing his wife and mother-in-law. While a prosecutor who believes a witness is not being forthright may vigorously question or press that witness, the prosecutor here simply went too far.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Manifestly, the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct was pervasive. Under the CPL, however, the Grand Jury proceeding in a criminal action must be defective to warrant dismissal of the indictment <em>(see, </em>CPL 210.20 [1] [c]). We must therefore next determine whether the prosecutor\u2019s behavior rendered the indictment fatally defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>CPL 210.35 (5) provides that a Grand Jury proceeding is defective when \"the integrity thereof is impaired and prejudice to the defendant may result.\u201d The exceptional remedy of dismissal is thus warranted only where a defect in the indictment created a possibility of prejudice <em>(see, People v Di Falco, </em>44 NY2d at 487, <em>supra). </em>Although this statutory test \"is very precise and very high\u201d <em>(People v Darby, </em>75 NY2d 449, 455), it does not require actual prejudice <em>(see, People v Sayavong, </em>83 NY2d at 709, 711, <em>supra; People v Wilkins, </em>68 NY2d 269, 276). Indeed, two earlier drafts of CPL 210.35 (5) required a showing of actual prejudice before an indictment could be dismissed as the result of defective Grand Jury proceedings. The Legislature, however, rejected a requirement of actual prejudice in favor of the current provision \u2014 requiring only that \"prejudice to the defendant <em>may </em>result\u201d (CPL 210.35 [5] [emphasis added]; <em>see, People v Di Falco, </em>44 NY2d 482, 487, <em>supra; </em>Preiser, Practice Commentary, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 11A, CPL 210.35, at 676).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Dismissal of indictments under CPL 210.35 (5) should thus be limited to those instances where prosecutorial wrongdoing, fraudulent conduct or errors potentially prejudice the ultimate decision reached by the Grand Jury. The likelihood of prejudice turns on the particular facts of each case, including the weight and nature of the admissible proof adduced to support the indictment and the degree of inappropriate prosecutorial influence or bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Certainly, not every improper comment, elicitation of inadmissible testimony, impermissible question or mere mistake renders an indictment defective. Typically, the submission of some inadmissible evidence will be deemed fatal only when the remaining evidence is insufficient to sustain the indictment <em>(see, People v Avant, </em>33 NY2d 265, 271). Likewise, isolated instances of misconduct will not necessarily impair the integrity of the Grand Jury proceedings or lead to the possibility of prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Here, however, the prosecutor did not simply introduce concededly inadmissible hearsay testimony \u2014 he did so with the stated goal of influencing upcoming testimony. The prosecutor then further thwarted the ability of the Grand Jury to uncover the facts accurately and conduct a reliable investigation by repeatedly conveying his personal assessment of critical witnesses and the physical evidence. As a result, the integrity of the Grand Jury proceedings was substantially undermined <em>(see, People v Caracciola, </em>78 NY2d 1021 [misleading legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>instructions to the Grand Jury impaired the integrity of the proceedings and mandated dismissal of the indictment]).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">The risk of prejudice to defendant from the prosecutor\u2019s impermissible tactics is manifest. The two crucial pieces of inculpatory evidence before the Grand Jury were the testimony of Vickie Pickles and the two items of defendant\u2019s clothing containing small amounts of blood. Pickles\u2019 version of events, however, was vigorously contested by Jule Huston. By informing the grand jurors that Vickie Pickles\u2019 account was the truth, while undermining the credibility and character of Jule Huston, the prosecutor made it substantially more likely that the Grand Jury would believe Pickles.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Likewise, defendant\u2019s sneaker and jacket, while circumstantial evidence implicating his guilt, did not irrefutably lead to the conclusion that defendant committed the murders. Indeed, several grand jurors themselves questioned whether the small amount of blood found on these items could be reconciled with the number of stab wounds and amount of blood at the crime scene. The prosecutor\u2019s assurances that these concerns were unfounded surely created at least the possibility of prejudice, since \"the grand jurors and the prosecutor will not invariably see eye to eye about what the evidence establishes, particularly when more inchoate questions such as * * * inferences to be drawn from circumstantial evidence are critical\u201d <em>(People v Batashure, </em>75 NY2d at 311, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">In rarq cases such as this where irregularities in presenting the case to the Grand Jury rise to the level of impairing those proceedings and creating the risk of prejudice, \"the indictment [can]not be permitted to stand even though it is supported by legally sufficient evidence\u201d <em>(People v Calbud, Inc., </em>49 NY2d at 395, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">An important principle at the root of the statute compels this result: the Grand Jury acts as \" 'the shield of innocence * * * and as the guard of the liberties of the people against the encroachments of unfounded accusations from any source\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v Minet, </em>296 NY at 323, <em>supra </em>[citation omitted]). It is thus fundamental that the Grand Jury and those testifying before that body remain insulated from improper influence (see, <em>People v Di Falco, </em>44 NY2d at 488, <em>supra </em>[\"(s)ecrecy is a vital requisite of Grand Jury proceedings\u201d]; <em>see also, </em>CPL 190.25 [4]). Where this tenet is flagrantly violated, society\u2019s interest in the integrity of the criminal process itself is jeopardized.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>To countenance such conduct by a District Attorney that was overwhelmingly likely to influence the proceedings whenever legally sufficient evidence was otherwise adduced would overlook that the CPL requires not only legally sufficient evidence as a prerequisite to indictment but also reasonable cause to believe the person committed an offense. Given \"the crucial nature of the prosecutor\u2019s role . . . vis-\u00e1-vis the Grand Jury,\u201d it would also significantly jeopardize the essential function of the Grand Jury to protect our citizenry <em>(People v Di Falco, 44 </em>NY2d at 485, <em>supra). </em>The statutory remedy of dismissal thus not only protects the defendant but also safeguards the liberty of all citizens by ensuring that improper prosecutorial influence during secret Grand Jury proceedings will not lead to unfounded prosecutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Likewise, conviction after trial does not cure defective Grand Jury proceedings (see, <em>People v Wilkins, </em>68 NY2d at 277, n 7, <em>supra; see, e.g., People v Sayavong, </em>83 NY2d at 702, <em>supra </em>[dismissing indictment of defendant convicted after jury trial, where impairment of Grand Jury proceeding potentially prejudiced defendant]). This is supported by the statutory scheme \u2014 while the Legislature has provided that claims of insufficiency of evidence to support the indictment are barred upon conviction after trial <em>(see, </em>CPL 210.30 [6]), no similar provision exists for claims of defect based upon impairment of the Grand Jury proceedings.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">In sum, in this unusual case, the cumulative impact of the prosecutor\u2019s improper tactics during presentation of defendant\u2019s case to the Grand Jury sufficiently impaired the integrity of the proceedings as to warrant dismissal of the indictment. Because the CPL provides for reindictment of defendant, this remedy will allow another Grand Jury to pass upon defendant\u2019s case after a presentation not tainted by bias and misconduct (see, CPL 210.20 [4]).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">In light of this determination, it is unnecessary to reach defendant\u2019s remaining claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed and the indictment dismissed with leave to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>District Attorney to apply for an order permitting resubmission of the charges to another Grand Jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Judges Simons, Titone, Bellacosa, Smith, Levine and Ciparick concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b501-9\"> We thus reject the People\u2019s similar argument that defendant\u2019s conviction after trial \u2014 where Pickles\u2019 testimony again constituted the primary evidence against him \u2014 demonstrates that no possibility of prejudice arose from the prosecutor\u2019s improper admission of Threats\u2019 testimony before the Grand Jury, since no such error took place at trial. In any event, unlike the Grand Jury proceedings, Pickles\u2019 trial testimony was not challenged by the contrary testimony of Jule Huston, since defendant\u2019s father had previously died and his Grand Jury testimony was precluded at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
