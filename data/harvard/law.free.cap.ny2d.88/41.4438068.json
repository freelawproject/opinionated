By reason of their failure to appeal the revocation of their building permit to the Zoning Board of Appeals, defendants-respondents fail to state a cause of action under 42 USC \u00a7 1983 based upon a denial of substantive due process. <em>(Williamson Planning Commn. v Hamilton Bank, </em>473 US 172; <em>Taylor Inv. v Upper Darby Twp., </em>983 F2d 1285; <em>Southview Assocs. v Bongartz, </em>980 F2d 84; <em>MacDonald, Sommer &amp; Frates v Yolo County, </em>477 US 340, 478 US 1035; <em>Reserve, Ltd. v Town of Longboat Key, </em>17 F3d 1374; <em>Acierno v Mitchell, </em>6 F3d 970; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number><em>Bender v New York City Health &amp; Hosps.

The Town is not liable under section 1983 because defendants-respondents have failed to establish that the building permit was revoked by an official with \"final policymaking authority\u201d under State or local law. <em>(Monell v New York City Dept. of Social Servs., </em>436 US 658; <em>Pembaur v Cincinnati, </em>475 US 469; <em>St. Louis v Praprotnik, </em>485 US 112; <em>Jett v Dallas Ind.

III. The developers did not vest their rights in the limited building permit because after five years they had not poured concrete and their accumulated expenditures were in furtherance of a fill removal business and an anticipated development of the entire 34-acre parcel with multiple buildings. <em>(Matter of Bayswater Health Related Facility v Karagheuzoff, </em>37 NY2d 408; <em>Matter of Temkin v Karagheuzoff, </em>34 NY2d 324.) IV. Because the developers were not entitled as a matter of right to the special permit or use variance required for the building in question, they lack any property interest protectable under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>(RRI Realty Corp. v Incorporated Vil. of Southampton, </em>870 F2d 911.) V. The court made numerous errors in the damage portion of the trial and the Court below failed to scrutinize the damage award on the mistaken belief that the Town had stipulated to the amount thereof. <em>(Gentile v County of Suffolk, </em>926 F2d 142; <em>Corn v City of Lauderdale Lakes, </em>997 F2d 1369; <em>Wheeler v City of Pleasant Grove, </em>833 F2d 267; <em>Greenbriar Ltd. v City of Alabaster, </em>881 F2d 1570, 893 F2d 346; <em>Penn Cent.

Defendants have obtained injunctive relief restoring the building permit and an award of substantial damages on a 42 USC \u00a7 1983 cause of action. We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">Defendant Bradley Industrial Park, Inc. is the owner of 34 acres of land located in the Town of Orangetown. It acquired the property in 1979 to construct a 184,000 square foot industrial building at an estimated cost of $3 million. Defendants John and Patrick Magee are the shareholders of the corporation. In 1980 defendants\u2019 plans for the improvement were approved and the Building Inspector issued a permit. Defendants began clearing and developing the site shortly thereafter. The trial court found that defendants spent over $4 million on the improvements for the land and building before work was halted by the Town.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">Although the permit was limited to \"land clearing, footings and foundations,\u201d the courts below determined that the permit entitled defendants to construct the entire building as long as the subsequent plans for the walls, ceilings and electrical wiring comported with the plans for the building already approved by the Town\u2019s Building Inspector.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">As the work on the project progressed, organized resistance to it developed within the community. Ultimately, the opposition became so intense that the Town Supervisor directed the Building Inspector to revoke the defendants\u2019 permit and on July 25, 1985 he did so. The Town subsequently amended its Zoning Code to preclude construction of commercial buildings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>on defendants\u2019 land.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At trial, the Town offered a number of reasons for the revocation. The court concluded that most were not authorized by the Town\u2019s ordinances and none were supported by the evidence. It found that the permit was revoked solely to satisfy political concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">Defendants had erected a temporary building for use during the preliminary stages of construction and after the permit was revoked, the Town instituted this action to obtain an order compelling its removal. Defendants counterclaimed seeking (1) an order compelling reinstatement of the permit, and (2) damages pursuant to 42 USC \u00a7 1983. After a bifurcated trial, Supreme Court dismissed the complaint and entered a judgment in favor of defendants on their counterclaims ordering reinstatement of the building permit and awarding damages of $5,137,126, costs and attorney\u2019s fees. The Appellate Division modified the judgment by remitting the question of attorney\u2019s fees and otherwise affirmed. It subsequently granted the Town leave to appeal to this Court. Our review is controlled in large part by factual findings of the trial court, affirmed by the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">The CPLR Article 78 Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">In their first counterclaim defendants sought reinstatement of their building permit, alleging they had a \"vested right\u201d in the planned construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">In New York, a vested right can be acquired when, pursuant to a legally issued permit, the landowner demonstrates a commitment to the purpose for which the permit was granted by effecting substantial changes and incurring substantial expenses to further the development (see, <em>Matter of Putnam Armonk v Town of Southeast, </em>52 AD2d 10, 14-15; <em>see also, People ex rel. Ortenberg v Bales, </em>250 NY 598, <em>affg </em>224 App Div 87; <em>City of Buffalo v Chadeayne, </em>134 NY 163, 165; <em>Matter of Caponi v Walsh, </em>228 App Div 86, 89). Neither the issuance of a permit (see, <em>Matter of Sibarco Stas. v Town Bd., </em>24 NY2d 900; <em>Rice v Van Vranken, </em>132 Misc 82, <em>affd </em>225 App Div 179, <em>affd </em>255 NY 541; <em>People ex rel. Ortenberg v Bales, supra) </em>nor the landowner\u2019s substantial improvements and expenditures, standing alone, will establish the right. The landowner\u2019s actions relying on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>valid permit must be so substantial that the municipal action results in serious loss rendering the improvements essentially valueless <em>(see, People v Miller, </em>304 NY 105, 109).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">There is no dispute that defendants\u2019 permit was legally issued. Whether defendants had sufficiently committed the land to the use authorized by the permit prior to revocation is a question of fact and the determination of the courts below that they had is supported by evidence in the record <em>(see, Matter of Caponi v Walsh, supra; see generally, </em>1 Anderson, New York Zoning Law and Practice \u00a7 6.18, at 231 [3d ed]). Inasmuch as the permit was revoked for unlawful reasons, the revocation resulted in an unconstitutional deprivation of defendants\u2019 property rights <em>(see, People v Miller, supra). </em>Accordingly, defendants are entitled to reinstatement of the building permit in conformity with the zoning ordinances in effect at the time of the revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">ra</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">The Civil Rights Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">Defendants\u2019 second counterclaim asserted a cause of action under 42 USC \u00a7 1983 for damages suffered as a result of the Town\u2019s actions. Defendants claimed that plaintiff\u2019s actions resulted in an unconstitutional taking of their property and that the Town denied them substantive and procedural due process guaranteed by the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">Section 1983 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-10\">\"Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom or usage, of any State * * * , subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-11\">Municipalities are \"persons\u201d subject to suit under section 1983 for the deprivation of constitutionally protected rights caused by actions which \"implement! ] or execute! ] a policy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision officially adopted and promulgated by [its] officers\u201d <em>(Monell v New York City Dept. of Social Servs., </em>436 US 658, 690; <em>Pembaur v Cincinnati, </em>475 US 469, 479-480). The municipality may not be held vicari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>ously liable under the doctrine of respondeat superior for employing a careless tortfeasor, however: the injury must arise from acts of municipal officers or employees in the course of executing municipal policy or custom <em>(id). </em>Liability may even be imposed for a single act, as long as it is the act of an official authorized to decide policy in that area <em>(Pembaur, supra, </em>at 480, 482-483; <em>St. Louis v Praprotnik, </em>485 US 112, 123-124; <em>see also, </em>Comer, <em>Municipal Liability Under Section 1983: The Rationale Underlying the Final Authority Doctrine, </em>44 Vand L Rev 341 [1991]).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">In the context of land use, section 1983 provides protection against municipal actions which violate a landowner\u2019s rights under the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment or the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Under the former, the claimant must establish that the governmental action amounts to a taking without just compensation. The Supreme Court has also identified, although not yet recognized, a substantive due process claim under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments based upon a regulatory taking, i.e., regulation of property that goes so far it has effectively destroyed the economic value of the property <em>(see, Williamson Planning Commn. v Hamilton Bank, </em>473 US 172, 185, 197-200).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The trial court rested its decision on a third ground \u2014 that the acts of the Town in revoking defendants\u2019 permit denied them substantive due process of law because the revocation and subsequent zoning change were arbitrary and capricious (156 Misc 2d 881, 893-895, <em>supra; and see, Southview Assocs. v Bongartz, </em>980 F2d 84, 96, 102 [2d Cir 1992], <em>cert denied sub nom. Southview Assocs. v Individual Members of Vt. Envtl. Bd., </em>507 US 987 [1993]; <em>Brady v Town of Colchester, </em>863 F2d 205, 215 [2d Cir 1988]; <em>Wheeler v City of Pleasant Grove, </em>664 F2d 99 [5th Cir 1981]; <em>see generally, </em>Stein, <em>Regulatory Takings and Ripeness in the Federal Courts, </em>48 Vand L Rev 1, 80 [1995]).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This type of claim challenges a particular land-use decision \u2014 here, the revocation of plaintiff\u2019s building permit \u2014 as a single decision with its own consequences, rather than as one in a series of action \u2014 resulting in a taking <em>(see, Harris v County of Riverside, </em>904 F2d 497, 501, <em>supra). </em>The key factor in such cases is not whether the State was justified in depriving the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>dividual of his or her property, but rather whether the State obeyed the strictures of the Constitution in doing so <em>(see, Weissman v Fruchtman, </em>700 F Supp 746, 756 [SD NY]).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s Ripeness Defense</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">In contesting the trial court\u2019s determination, the Town first contends that the revocation was not \"final\u201d and therefore not ripe for judicial review, until reviewed by the Orangetown Zoning Board of Appeals. Defendants, on the other hand, assert that the Building Inspector constitutes a Town official with final policy-making authority and that requiring an appeal to the Town Zoning Board of Appeals would impose an impermissible exhaustion of remedies requirement on their section 1983 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">Civil rights claims are not justiciable until the municipality has \"arrived at a definitive position on the issue that inflicts an actual, concrete injury\u201d <em>(Williamson, supra, </em>at 193; <em>Matter of Ward v Bennett, </em>79 NY2d 394, 400). This requirement reflects the reluctance of the courts to impose liability upon a municipality unless the liability arises from \"acts which the municipality has officially sanctioned or ordered\u201d <em>(Pembaur, supra, </em>at 480; <em>Monell, supra, </em>at 691; <em>de St. Aubin v Flacke, </em>68 NY2d 66, 75).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">The ripeness requirements for just compensation and regulatory \"takings\u201d claims differ from claims based upon arbitrary and capricious conduct. Under takings claims the contention is that the State has taken the property for a governmental purpose or that it has gone \"too far\u201d in exercising its police power to regulate property and thus deprived an owner of all economically beneficial use of the property <em>(Pennsylvania Coal Co. v Mahon, </em>260 US 393, 415; <em>see, Northern Westchester Professional Park Assocs. v Town of Bedford, </em>60 NY2d 492; <em>French Investing Co. v City of New York, </em>39 NY2d 587, <em>cert denied </em>429 US 990). Such claims are not ripe for judicial review until (1) the governmental entity charged with implementing the regulations has rendered a final decision regarding the application of the regulations to the property, and (2) the landowner has availed itself of the procedures provided by State law to obtain just compensation <em>(Williamson, supra, </em>at 194, 200; <em>Southview, supra, </em>at 96). Under this type of claim, a decision does not become ripe for review unless alternative uses of the property have been considered and rejected and it is thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>established that the landowner has been deprived of its property. Until that has been done, it is not clear that a taking has occurred or how \"far\u201d the regulation goes.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">However, a substantive due process claim based on arbitrary and capricious conduct is subject only to the final decision requirement of the <em>Williamson </em>test. The decision must be final to be reviewable (else how could arbitrariness be judged), but it is unnecessary that the landowner pursue administrative remedies to determine how the regulation in question applies to the property or avail itself of State procedures for determining compensation (see, <em>Southview Assocs. v Bongartz, supra, </em>at 96-97). If the action of the municipality is arbitrary and capricious, the remedy for a violation is invalidation of the regulation and actual damages (see, <em>Williamson, supra, </em>at 197).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">There should be no confusion about the requirement that administrative remedies must be exhausted in some cases before judicial review is available and the requirement that an action must be final before it is ripe for judicial review. The finality requirement is concerned with whether an official authorized to make the determination has arrived at a decision that inflicts injury. The requirement that administrative review must be exhausted in some cases relates to the procedure by which a party injured by a decision may seek review and obtain a remedy if the decision is found to be unlawful <em>(Williamson, supra, </em>at 192-193; <em>see also, Church of St. Paul &amp; St. Andrew v Barwick, </em>67 NY2d 510, 521). If the Building Inspector had the authority to make a final decision revoking defendants\u2019 permit, requiring defendants to seek administrative review of his action by taking an appeal to the Zoning Board would impose an exhaustion requirement on their section 1983 action, a condition which is generally impermissible <em>(see, Patsy v Florida Bd. of Regents, </em>457 US 496; <em>Williamson, supra, </em>at 194, n 13; <em>see generally, </em>Stein, <em>Regulatory Takings and Ripeness in the Federal Courts, op. cit, </em>at 15; 1 Schwartz and Kirklin, Section 1983 Litigation: Claims, Defenses, and Fees \u00a7 3.13, at 204-205 [2d ed]).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">\"Whether the Building Inspector\u2019s revocation constituted a \"final decision\u201d of the Town of Orangetown is a matter to be determined by examining the relevant local laws. States have broad discretion to determine the form of local government and the distribution of power in one locality may be quite different from that of another. Whether- an official has final authority to take municipal action in a given case is not a question of fact, but a question of State law <em>(St. Louis v Prapro</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number><em>tnik, supra, </em>at 124; <em>Pembaur, supra, </em>at 483; <em>see generally, </em>Stein, <em>op. cit., </em>at 82).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Under the ordinances of the Town of Orangetown, the Building Inspector had the statutory authority to effect a revocation of defendants\u2019 building permit (Orangetown, N. Y., Zoning Code, ch 43, \u00a7 8.222 [1969]). He was the \"initial decision-maker\u201d vested by law with the exclusive and unfettered authority to decide the question of revocation <em>(see, Williamson, supra, </em>at 193) and he clearly had done so when he revoked defendants\u2019 permit and halted work on the project. The Zoning Board was not authorized to revoke a permit or even participate in the Inspector\u2019s decision to revoke. Its power was restricted to the review of the Inspector\u2019s final decision. Thus, a determination by the Board was not necessary and defendants\u2019 counterclaim for section 1983 relief is ripe for judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">Defendants\u2019 Section 1983 Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">To succeed on their claim for damages pursuant to 42 USC \u00a7 1983, defendants must establish (1) the deprivation of a protectable property interest (2) by one acting under the authority of law <em>(Parratt v Taylor, </em>451 US 527, 535).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">The hallmark of property \"is an individual entitlement grounded in state law, which cannot be removed except 'for cause\u2019 \u201d <em>(Logan v Zimmerman Brush Co., </em>455 US 422, 430; <em>Parratt v Taylor, </em>supra; <em>Matter of Deas v Levitt, </em>73 NY2d 525, 531, <em>cert denied </em>493 US 933). In order to establish a protectable property interest in the building permit, defendants must show more than a mere expectation or hope to retain the permit and continue their improvements; they must show that pursuant to State or local law, they had a \"legitimate claim of entitlement\u201d to continue construction <em>(Board of Regents v Roth, </em>408 US 564, 577; <em>Sullivan v Town of Salem, </em>805 F2d 81, 84-85 [2d Cir 1986]; <em>Yale Auto Parts v Johnson, </em>758 F2d 54, 59 [2d Cir 1985]).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">Defendants did so in this case by establishing that the rights to develop their land had become vested under State law. Moreover, as the courts below found, they unquestionably would have received the limited future authorizations necessary to complete the project. On this evidence, the Town had \"engendered a clear expectation of continued enjoyment\u201d of the permit sufficient to constitute a protectable property inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>est for purposes of a section 1983 claim <em>(Barry v Barchi, </em>443 US 55, 64, n 11); there was a \"certainty or a very strong likelihood\u201d that defendants would have completed the project absent the deprivation of due process <em>(see, Yale Auto Parts, supra, </em>at 59).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">Having acquired a cognizable property interest, due process assures the defendants the right to be free from arbitrary or irrational municipal actions destructive of this interest <em>(see, Arlington Hgts. v Metropolitan Hous. Corp., </em>429 US 252, 267; <em>Southview Assocs., supra, </em>at 96; <em>Brady v Town of Colchester, supra, </em>at 215). The municipality\u2019s authority to regulate zoning rests upon the valid exercise of its police power and a decision regulating a landowner\u2019s use of its property offends due process when the government acts with \"no legitimate reason for its decision\u201d <em>(Shelton v City of Coll. Sta., </em>780 F2d 475, 483 [5th Cir], cert <em>denied </em>479 US 822; <em>see, Euclid v Ambler Co., 272 </em>US 365, 395). The evidence in the record supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the Building Inspector\u2019s revocation of defendants\u2019 permit was arbitrary and capricious in this case because it was without legal justification and motivated entirely by political concerns. The only remaining question is whether his actions may be imputed to the Town of Orangetown.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The Town Zoning Code, which necessarily reflects Town policy, vests the Building Inspector, alone, with the authority to revoke building permits (Town of Orangetown Code, ch 43, \u00a7 8.222). The Building Inspector therefore implements Town policy and the Town, by enacting the legislation, accepted the possibility that he would exercise this authority in an arbitrary and capricious manner. While the municipality might not be liable if the Building Inspector acted in a good faith or mistaken understanding of the law <em>(see, Brady v Town of Colchester, supra, </em>at 216) or if his act was a random act of personal ill will not authorized by the Town <em>(see, Monell, </em>supra; <em>Pembaur, supra), </em>that clearly was not the case here. He exercised his legal authority for political reasons at the direction of the Town Supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Accordingly, defendants successfully established a claim for damages pursuant to 42 USC \u00a7 1983, based on the Building Inspector\u2019s arbitrary and irrational revocation of their building permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Finally, the plaintiff maintains that the damages were incorrectly computed and the award excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Plaintiffs experts conceded during trial that defendants had sustained substantial damages. Moreover, they agreed that the damages could be measured by implementing the so-called <em>Wheeler </em>formula <em>(see, Wheeler v City of Pleasant Grove, </em>833 F2d 267, 271 [11th Cir 1987] <em>[Wheeler </em>III]; see <em>also, </em>664 F2d 99 <em>[Wheeler I], </em>supra; 746 F2d 1437 <em>[Wheeler </em>II]; 896 F2d 1347, 1351 <em>[Wheeler IV]). </em>In fact, the parties stipulated to a number of figures that could be used to compute the damages under that formula.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">In <em>Wheeler, </em>a case remarkably similar to this on the facts, the court established a method for determining the damages sustained by temporary governmental interference with a landowner\u2019s beneficial use of property. It held that the loss takes the form of an injury to the property\u2019s potential for producing income or an expected profit. The compensable interest is the return on the portion of fair market value that is lost as a result of the government\u2019s action. Accordingly, the landowner should be awarded the market rate of return computed over the period of the taking on the difference between the property\u2019s fair value without the restriction and its fair market value with the restriction <em>(see, </em>833 F2d 267, 271, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">The parties to a civil dispute are free to chart their own course and, unless public policy is affronted, they may fashion the way a controversy is to be resolved or how damages are to be computed without interference by the courts <em>(Mitchell v New York Hosp., </em>61 NY2d 208; <em>Matter of Abramovich v Board of Educ., 46 </em>NY2d 450, <em>cert denied 444 </em>US 845). While we express no view on the appropriateness of the <em>Wheeler </em>formula to measure damages in cases such as this, its use does not affront public policy and it was within the court\u2019s discretion to compute the damages on the basis of the formula as the parties agreed it should.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">Implementing that formula, the Town stipulated to values for the building and the land before and after taking, the difference between the two numbers, the equity ratio and the market rate of return. The court determined other values based upon the evidence and directed the parties to compute the damages using the <em>Wheeler </em>formula and submit their determination. It based its final award on those submissions. Inasmuch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>as the figures used were either supported by evidence or agreed upon by the parties, there is no basis to interfere with the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs, and the certified question answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Titone, Bellacosa, Smith, Levine and Ciparick concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Order affirmed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b136-11\">. In addition to the estimated cost of site and building improvements, the trial court found that defendants spent $250,000 on the purchase of the original site, approximately $123,000 purchasing additional acreage to satisfy Town requirements for access to public roads; that in response to community complaints about highway congestion, defendants spent approximately $250,000 developing an alternate route over a railroad crossing; defendants spent $100,000 for water and sewage lines; and in certain easement negotiations with the water company, defendant gave up rights in a self-contained water system on the property worth approximately $1 million.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b137-9\">.
