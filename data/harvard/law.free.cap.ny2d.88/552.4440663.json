The Appellate Division affirmed defendant\u2019s conviction for attempted robbery, after a jury trial, and a Judge of this Court granted leave to appeal. We conclude that the Appellate Division did not err in affirming the trial court\u2019s ruling, which denied the application at trial to reopen the <em>Wade </em>hearing and determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>At approximately 11:00 a.m. on April 20, 1992, victim Ronald Cuocolo was making a delivery at a warehouse in Brooklyn when he was accosted in an interior corridor. The perpetrator demanded money from him and when he refused, a struggle ensued during which Cuocolo was injured. The perpetrator fled the building with Cuocolo and other occupants who had been alerted to the incident in pursuit. During the brief chase, Cuocolo came upon police officers who joined the chase by following Cuocolo. When Cuocolo caught up to the perpetrator outside a vacant lot about two blocks from the attack, he motioned towards his attacker, who was standing on the sidewalk. The police then made the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The People properly notified defendant pursuant to CPL 710.30 (1) (b) that Cuocolo had identified the defendant in a \"corporeal non-lineup.\u201d Defendant by omnibus motion moved for suppression of the victim\u2019s identification and a <em>Wade </em>hearing was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">The arresting officer was the only witness at the hearing. He testified that within 10 minutes after the robbery, the victim pointed out the accused by shouting, \"That\u2019s him. That\u2019s him.\u201d The officer recollected that the victim was in the back seat of the patrol car at that time. The hearing court denied suppression of the victim\u2019s identification, finding no taint of police suggestiveness, and ruled that the victim could testify to the identification at trial. No question is raised concerning the correctness of this determination made after the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">At the close of the People\u2019s opening statement at trial, however, defendant orally renewed the motion to suppress the victim\u2019s identification to be made at trial or, in the alternative, to reopen the <em>Wade </em>hearing. Defense counsel had become aware at that time that the victim had testified to the Grand Jury (as he later did at the trial as well) that he immediately initiated pursuit of the fleeing perpetrator, right after the attempted robbery and assault. He used his own car, with the police joining the uninterrupted chase within minutes and following in their patrol car.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">Defense counsel claimed that the discrepancy between the transcript of the victim\u2019s Grand Jury account of the chase and the arresting officer\u2019s <em>Wade </em>hearing version warranted suppression or a reopened <em>Wade </em>hearing. This variation is the sole basis for the application. Notably, this circumstance and issue are materially distinguishable from <em>People v Geaslen </em>(54 NY2d 510), relied upon by the dissent in its analysis of and application to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion essentially for the reason that the confusion was not \"pertinent\u201d to the issue of suggestiveness. It acknowledged, however, and weighed the differences between the two witnesses\u2019 testimony, developed in procedurally distinct pretrial settings, concerning the location of the victim at the time he caught up to his attacker to make the street identification that led to the accused\u2019s apprehension by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">CPL 710.40 (4) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-6\">\"//\u25a0 after a pre-trial determination and denial of the motion <em>the court is satisfied, </em>upon a showing by the defendant, that <em>additional pertinent facts </em>have been discovered by the defendant which he could not have discovered with reasonable diligence before the determination of the motion, it <em>may </em>permit him to renew the motion before trial or, if such was not possible owing to the time of the discovery of the alleged new facts, during trial\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">The operative phrase, establishing the threshold consideration under this statute for this type of application seeking a <em>Wade </em>revisitation, is \"additional pertinent facts.\u201d In construing and applying this statutory prescription to the record of this case, this Court cannot say as a matter of law \u2014 as the dissent would \u2014 that the victim\u2019s Grand Jury testimony compelled a grant of relief. The statute contains no mandate that such facts must be found to be outcome-determinative or \"essential\u201d nor is any other prescribed template required. To be sure, all such features may be considered within the ambit of the discretionary weighing reposed in the trial court in ruling on a CPL 710.40 (4) application.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">We agree, without promulgating a rigid formula, that the particular standard of \"additional pertinent facts\u201d does not require defendant-movant in such circumstances to introduce facts which on their face establish the suggestiveness of the original street identification. The statutory standard does require, though, at least that the facts asserted be \"pertinent\u201d to the issue of official suggestiveness such that they would materially affect or have affected the earlier <em>Wade </em>determination <em>(see, People v Newball, </em>76 NY2d 587, 590-591; <em>People v Gissendanner, </em>48 NY2d 543, 552). Otherwise, the distinctive statutory standard would be no standard at all. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that such pertinent facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>were not tendered in this case, and the record and the statute do not compel a contrary conclusion and reversal as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">As this Court stated in refusing to disturb the lower courts\u2019 exercise of discretion under this very section in <em>People v Fuentes </em>(53 NY2d 892, <em>supra), </em>a \"trial court <em>may </em>reopen a pretrial hearing if <em>it ris satisfied, </em>upon a showing by the defendant, <em>that additional pertinent facts </em>have been discovered by the defendant * * * with reasonable diligence before the determination\u2019 of his pretrial application\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 894 [emphasis added] [citation omitted]). To suggest here that this standard was met as a matter of law and that the victim-initiated and uninterrupted chase, culminating in the apprehension of this perpetrator was a police-arranged procedure (dissenting opn, at 559), as a matter of law also, compelling a reopening of the <em>Wade </em>hearing, goes well beyond what this record presented to the trial court and Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Thus, the Appellate Division, guided by this Court\u2019s most pertinent and governing precedent, had a proper basis to affirm the trial court\u2019s discretionary ruling as within the statutory range of its authority <em>(People v Fuentes, </em>supra; <em>contrast, People v Dixon, </em>85 NY2d 218, 223-224 [where no <em>Wade </em>hearing whatsoever was initially afforded defendant]).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b646-8\">Titone, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqb\">(dissenting). I cannot join the majority\u2019s conclusion that the application to reopen the <em>Wade </em>hearing was properly denied because defendant failed to raise new facts that were pertinent to <em>suggestiveness. </em>In my view, the obligation of a defendant under CPL 710.40 (4) to raise \"additional pertinent facts\u201d was met here by the Grand Jury testimony which undermined facts that were essential to the denial of the motion to suppress and called into question the outcome of the suppression hearing. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">Defendant was initially granted a <em>Wade </em>hearing to test whether any police suggestiveness tainted the victim\u2019s out-of-court identification of him on the street shortly after the crime had occurred. Testimony provided by a prosecution witness at the hearing established that the police-arranged procedure involved a police-car canvassing of the neighborhood near the crime scene with the victim seated in the back seat of the patrol car. In describing the procedure at length, the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>witness specifically stated that he and his partner placed the complainant in their police car and drove the complainant towards the area where he had been robbed, and that as they were driving the complainant yelled \"There he goes\u201d or \"that\u2019s him.\u201d The officer stated that he then exited his car, stopped the person that the complainant had pointed to, waited for the complainant to exit the car and identify the individual stopped as the perpetrator, and then placed him under arrest. The defense extensively questioned the officer on <em>this </em>specific identification procedure to determine if it was tainted by any improper suggestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The officer\u2019s testimony was fraught with inconsistencies about the victim\u2019s statements to the police in the patrol car and he admitted that he was confusing this case with another. Defense counsel moved to suppress on the ground that the witness was so incredible and unreliable that \"we are not even at the issue of suggestiveness.\u201d The court found that no official suggestiveness tainted the identification and denied the motion to suppress, citing the facts that the complainant rode in the back of the police car and yelled out when he spotted defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Defendant sought to reopen the <em>Wade </em>hearing after he learned during the prosecution\u2019s opening that the complainant had testified in the Grand Jury that he, in fact, had not been riding in the police car, but instead was driving his own car during the canvassing procedure. During the Grand Jury proceedings, the complainant had testified that he was travel-ling in his car, that the police were following in the patrol car, and that he saw defendant \"a short distance from the building.\u201d He then testified: \"I got out of the car, the police exited the car and then the police approached him.\u201d It is not clear whether the complainant spoke before or after the police approached defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">The People contend that the new facts raised in support of defendant\u2019s motion to reopen the <em>Wade </em>hearing were not \"pertinent\u201d within the meaning of CPL 710.40 (4) because \"none * * * revealed even the slightest suggestiveness in the manner in which he was identified and thus did not afford any new basis for the suppression of his identification.\u201d This claim misses the mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">First, I do not believe that the facts brought forth by defendant need on their face establish the suggestiveness of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>actual identification procedure to satisfy CPL 710.40 (4).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 1 also cannot agree with the majority that the defendant seeking to reopen a <em>Wade </em>hearing should be required to show facts that are \"pertinent\u201d to the issue of official suggestiveness.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Whether an identification procedure is tainted by suggestiveness is a determination that can only be made <em>after </em>a <em>Wade </em>hearing \u2014 the specific proceeding designed to elicit such facts \u2014 and not by testimony elicited at other hearings, such as Grand Jury proceedings, that are directed at the resolution of different issues. Thus, by engrafting onto the statute the requirement that the movant allege new facts that relate to police suggestion, the People and the majority here would prematurely place a burden of proof on the moving defendant that is nearly impossible to meet at that point in time.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">In my view, the statutory requirement of \"additional pertinent facts\u201d is met where the newly discovered facts call into question the outcome of the proceeding or significantly undermine any of the facts that are essential or material to the hearing court\u2019s determination on the defendant\u2019s original motion. Defendant has met this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">The Grand Jury testimony did far more than merely cast doubt on the credibility of the officer who testified at the suppression hearing. Rather, the testimony calls into question the outcome of the hearing because it establishes that its focus was on an identification procedure that never occurred. The People attempt to minimize the significance of the new facts revealed by defining the two contradictory versions of the streetside point-out as differing in only \"one detail\u201d \u2014 that two cars were used instead of one. That single detail has great significance to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>defendant, however, because it indicates that he had no opportunity to test at a <em>Wade </em>hearing the identification procedure that was actually employed and which the majority here itself has characterized as \"procedurally distinct\u201d <em>(see, </em>majority opn, at 555).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Additionally, the suppression court\u2019s assessment that no police taint affected the identification was based on the police officer\u2019s testimony concerning conversations that purportedly took place in the police car between the testifying officer and the complainant. However, because the Grand Jury testimony revealed that a two-car canvassing was employed, those conversations could never have taken place and facts essential to the court\u2019s determination of the motion were thereby undermined.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Indeed, there is no doubt that defendant would have been entitled to test the two-car canvassing procedure actually employed at a <em>Wade </em>hearing in the first instance. While it is true that a suppression motion may be summarily denied if the identification procedure was not \"police-arranged\u201d <em>(see, People v Dixon, </em>85 NY2d 218, 222), that rule has no application to this case. The victim\u2019s Grand Jury testimony here established that the police undertook canvassing measures to enable the victim to make an identification. Regardless of whether the victim was travelling in the police car or his own car, the fact remains that the police escorted the complainant to the crime scene and the procedure was orchestrated by police for the purpose of obtaining an identification of the suspect from the victim. Thus, the identification procedure was police arranged <em>(id., </em>at 223). That a canvassing in two cars rather than one presents less of an occasion for police suggestion provides no satisfactory reason to deny a <em>Wade </em>hearing because the two-car procedure is still police sponsored, and still affords an opportunity for official taint that the defendant has a right to test under CPL 710.60.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">Additionally, the suppression motion could not have been summarily denied pursuant to CPL 710.60 (3) in the first instance because of any deficiencies in the factual allegations advanced in support of suppression. A defendant is normally \"not in a position to know whether challengeable identification techniques were employed\u201d <em>(see, </em>Preiser, Practice Commentaries, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 11A, CPL 710.60, at 278-279) and thus is not required to allege such facts in the moving papers <em>(People v Dixon, </em>85 NY2d, at 222, supra; <em>People v Mendoza, </em>82 NY2d 415, 429).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>Accordingly, I believe that defendant has met his burden under CPL 710.40 (4) of showing that \"additional pertinent facts have been discovered * * * which he could not have discovered with reasonable diligence before the determination of the motion.\u201d Because the Grand Jury testimony of the complainant undermined the facts that formed the basis of the court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress and because defendant was never able to exercise his right under CPL 710.60 to subject the actual identification procedure employed to adversarial testing, further inquiry at a <em>Wade </em>hearing is warranted <em>(People v Villanova, </em>179 AD2d 381). Thus, in my view, the trial court abused its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s application to reopen the <em>Wade </em>hearing where it could not be determined without the benefit of a new hearing whether any police taint infected the actual identification procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Simons, Smith and Levine concur with Judge Bellacosa; Judge Titone dissents in a separate opinion in which Judge Ciparick concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b648-7\">. The trial court here erroneously concluded that it was precluded from considering the complainant\u2019s Grand Jury testimony as \"additional pertinent facts.\u201d In fact, in <em>People v Geaslen </em>(54 NY2d 510), this Court relied on a witness\u2019 Grand Jury testimony in ordering a new suppression hearing where that testimony was inconsistent with a parole officer\u2019s suppression hearing testimony which had served as the basis for the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b648-8\">. By holding that the newly discovered facts must be pertinent to the issue of <em>suggestiveness, </em>the Court suggests that the burden can only be met where facts are revealed that indicate improper police conduct \u2014 even though those facts cannot be known without the benefit of a <em>Wade </em>hearing. Such a requirement would preclude reopening of a <em>Wade </em>hearing, for example, where new facts show that an identification procedure previously believed to have been initiated solely by the witness was, in fact, police sponsored, but the defendant did not know at the time of the application to reopen whether any improper police conduct tainted the actual identification. Surely such a restrictive interpretation of CPL 710.40 (4) could not have been intended.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
