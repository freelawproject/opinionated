Ill, \u00a7 2, of the Constitution. The complaint challenged Okla. Stat., Tit. 45, \u00a7\u00a7939 and 939.1 (Supp. 1988) (Act),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which requires Oklahoma coal-fired electric generating plants producing power for sale in Oklahoma to burn a mixture of coal containing at least 10% Oklahoma-mined coal. Wyoming sought a declaration that the Act violates the Commerce Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 3, and an injunction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>permanently enjoining enforcement of the Act. On June 30, 1988, we granted Wyoming leave to file its bill of complaint over Oklahoma\u2019s objections that Wyoming lacked standing to bring this action and, in any event, should not be permitted to invoke this Court\u2019s original jurisdiction. 487 U. S. 1231. Oklahoma next filed a motion to dismiss on August 29, 1988, raising these same arguments. We denied the motion to dismiss on October 31, 1988, and ordered Oklahoma to answer Wyoming\u2019s complaint within 30 days. 488 U. S. 921. We thereafter appointed the Special Master, 489 U. S. 1063 (1989), who ordered the parties to complete discovery and to file a stipulation of uncontested facts, any affidavits believed to be necessary, and a short statement of any disputed issues of material fact that may require a hearing. The parties complied, and each moved for summary judgment. Wyoming argued that the Act is a <em>per se </em>violation of the Commerce Clause. Oklahoma reasserted its arguments on standing and the appropriateness of this Court\u2019s exercise of original jurisdiction, submitting as well that the Act was constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">The Report of the Special Master was received and ordered filed on October 1,1990. 498 U. S. 803. Based on the record before him, the Special Master recommended findings of fact, to which the parties do not object, and conclusions of law generally supporting Wyoming\u2019s motion for summary judgment and rejecting Oklahoma\u2019s motion for summary judgment. More specifically, the Report recommends that we hold, first, that Wyoming has standing to sue and that this case is appropriate to our original jurisdiction; and second, that the Act discriminates against interstate commerce on its face and in practical effect, that this discrimination is not justified by any purpose advanced by Oklahoma, and that the Act therefore violates the Commerce Clause. The Report also recommends that the Court either dismiss the action as it relates to an Oklahoma-owned utility without prejudice to Wyoming to assert its claim in an appropriate forum, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>or, alternatively, find the Act severable to the extent it may constitutionally be applied to that utility.</p>\n<p id=\"AMN5\">Subsequently, the parties requested the Court to enter a stipulated decree adopting the Special Master's Report and containing conclusions of law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If the decree was to rule on the constitutionality of the Act, however, we preferred to have that issue briefed and argued, and the case was set down for oral argument. 501 U. S. 1215 (1991). We now adopt the Special Master's recommended findings of fact, and, with one exception, his recommended conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"AbBu\">I</p>\n<p id=\"AMSJ\">The salient facts, gathered from those recommended by the Special Master and from other materials in the record, are as follows. -</p>\n<p id=\"A0Qj\">Wyoming is a major coal-producing State and in 1988 shipped coal to 19 other States.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While the State of ming does not itself sell coal, it does impose a severance tax upon the privilege of severing or extracting coal from land within its boundaries. Wyo. Stat. to (1990 and Supp. 1991). The tax is assessed against the son or company extracting the coal and is payable when the coal is extracted. The valuation of the coal for severance tax purposes is based on its fair market value. Wyoming has collected severance taxes on coal extracted by eight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>mining companies that sell coal to four Oklahoma electric utilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">The 40th Oklahoma Legislature, at its session in June 1985, adopted a concurrent resolution \u201crequesting Oklahoma utility companies using coal-fired generating plants to consider plans to blend ten percent Oklahoma coal with their present use of Wyoming coal; effecting a result of keeping a portion of ratepayer dollars in Oklahoma and promoting economic development.\u201d Okla. S. Res. 21, 40th Leg., 1985 Okla. Sess. Laws 1694 (hereinafter Res. 21). The recitals and resolutions in relevant part stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-6\">\u201cWHEREAS, the use of Oklahoma coal would save significant freight charges on out-of-state coal from the State of Wyoming; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-7\">\u201cWHEREAS, the savings on such freight charges could offset any possible costs associated with plant adjustments; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-8\">\u201cWHEREAS, the coal-fired electric plants being used by Oklahoma utilities are exclusively using Wyoming coal; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-9\">\u201cWHEREAS, the Oklahoma ratepayers are paying $300 million annually for Wyoming coal; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-10\">\u201cWHEREAS, a 1982 Ozark Council Report states that $9 million of the ratepayers dollars was paid as severance tax to the State of Wyoming ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAh4z\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-11\">\u201cNOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-12\">\u201cTHAT Oklahoma utilities using coal-fired generating plants seriously consider using a blend of at least ten percent Oklahoma coal with Wyoming coal and continue to meet air quality standards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-13\">\u201cTHAT the result of such a blend would assure at least a portion of the ratepayer dollars remaining in Oklahoma and enhancing the economy of the State of Oklahoma.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>The four Oklahoma electric utilities subject to the requirements of the Act are Oklahoma Gas and Electric Company, Public Service Company of Oklahoma, and Western Farmers Electric Cooperative, all privately owned, and the Grand River Dam Authority (GRDA), an agency of the State of Oklahoma. None of these four heeded this precatory resolution. At its second session, the 40th Legislature adopted the Act challenged in this case, thus mandating the 10% minimum purchases that the previous resolution had requested. Fifteen months after the effective date of the Act, facing substantially less than full compliance by any of the utilities,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the next Oklahoma Legislature adopted a concurrent resolution directing the GRDA, Oklahoma\u2019s state-owned public utility, to comply with the Act. Okla. S. Res. 82, 41st Leg., 1988 Okla. Sess. Laws 1915.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Charts set out in the Special Master\u2019s Report show the percentages of each utility\u2019s purchases of Oklahoma-mined coal and Wyoming-mined coal on an annual basis from 1981 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>through the first four months of 1989. See Report of Special Master 7-8. Those charts reveal that during the years 1981 through 1984, the four Oklahoma utilities purchased virtually 100% of their coal requirements from Wyoming sources. These purchases decreased slightly, if at all, in 1985 and 1986 following the adoption of the original concurrent resolution. After January 1, 1987, the effective date of the Act, these utilities reduced their purchases of Wyoming coal in favor of coal mined in Oklahoma.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Unrebutted evidence demonstrates that, since the effective date of the Act, Wyoming has lost severance taxes in the amounts of $535,886 in 1987, $542,352 in 1988, and $87,130 in the first four months of 1989.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> These estimates are based on an equivalence of British Thermal Unit (BTU) ratings, thus accounting for the hotter burning propensities of Oklahoma coal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Other unrebutted submissions confirm that Wyoming has a significant excess mining capacity, such that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>the loss of any market cannot be made up by sales elsewhere, where Wyoming\u2019s supply has already risen to meet demand.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A-b\">hH h-H</p>\n<p id=\"AJW\">In its motion for summary judgment before the Special Master, Oklahoma again challenged Wyoming\u2019s standing, and now excepts to the Special Master\u2019s recommendation that we reject Oklahoma\u2019s submission in this respect. Having granted Wyoming leave to file its complaint over Oklahoma\u2019s objection to standing, and having denied Oklahoma\u2019s motion to dismiss for want of standing, and the parties having submitted the case on cross-motions for summary judgment, we are not at all inclined to dismiss the action at this juncture. Although we have been reluctant to import wholesale law-of-the-case principles into original actions, <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>California, </em>460 U. S. 605, 618-619 (1983), prior rulings in such cases \u201cshould be subject to the general principles of finality and repose, absent changed circumstances or unforeseen issues not previously litigated.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 619. Here, Oklahoma in no way suggests any change of circumstance, whether of fact or law. In each brief submitted on the issue, Oklahoma has recited the same facts, cited the same cases, and constructed the same arguments. Of course, we surely have the power to accede to Oklahoma\u2019s request at this late date, and if convinced, which we are not, that we were clearly wrong in accepting jurisdiction of this case, we would not hesitate to depart from our prior rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>Article III, \u00a7 2, cl. 2, of the United States Constitution provides this Court with original jurisdiction in all cases \u201cin which a State shall be a Party.\u201d Congress has seen fit to designate that this Court \u201cshall have original and exclusive jurisdiction of all controversies between two or more States.\u201d 28' U. S. C. \u00a7 1251(a). \u201cIn order to constitute a proper \u2018controversy\u2019 under our original jurisdiction, \u2018it must appear that the complaining State has suffered a wrong through the action of the other State, furnishing ground for judicial redress, or is asserting a right against the other State which is susceptible of judicial enforcement according to the accepted principles of the common law or equity systems of jurisprudence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>451 U. S. 725, 735-736 (1981) (quoting <em>Massachusetts </em>v. <em>Missouri, </em>308 U. S. 1, 15 (1939)); see also <em>New York </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>274 U. S. 488, 490 (1927).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">We are quite sure that Wyoming\u2019s submission satisfies this test. We agree with the Master\u2019s conclusion, arrived at after consideration of all the facts submitted to him, that Wyoming clearly had standing to bring this action. The Master observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-6\">\u201cThe effect of the Oklahoma statute has been to deprive Wyoming of severance tax revenues. It is undisputed that since January 1, 1987, the effective date of the Act, purchases by Oklahoma electric utilities of Wyoming-mined coal, as a percentage of their total coal purchases, have declined.. .. The decline came when, in response to the adoption of the Act, those utilities began purchasing Oklahoma-mined coal. The coal that, in the absence of the Act, would have been sold to Oklahoma utilities by a Wyoming producer would have been subject to the tax when extracted. Wyoming\u2019s loss of severance tax revenues \u2018fairly can be traced\u2019 to the Act. See <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>451 U. S. 725, 736 (1981) (quoting <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number><em>Organization, </em>426 U. S. 26, 41-42 (1976)).\u201d Report of Special Master 11.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">The Master recognized that Courts of Appeals have denied standing to States where the claim was that actions taken by United States Government agencies had injured a State\u2019s economy and thereby caused a decline in general tax revenues. See, <em>e. g., Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Kleppe, </em>174 U. S. App. D. C. 441, 533 F. 2d 668, cert. denied, 429 U. S. 977 (1976); <em>State of Iowa ex rel. Miller </em>v. <em>Block, </em>771 F. 2d 347 (CA8 1985), cert. denied, 478 U. S. 1012 (1986). He concluded, however, that none of these cases was analogous to this one because none of them involved a direct injury in the form of a loss of specific tax revenues \u2014 an undisputed fact here. See n. 6, <em>supra. </em>In our view, the Master\u2019s conclusion about Wyoming\u2019s standing is sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Oklahoma argues that Wyoming is not itself engaged in the commerce affected, is not affected as a consumer, and thus has not suffered the type of direct injury cognizable in a Commerce Clause action. The authorities relied on by Oklahoma for this argument, <em>Oklahoma </em>v. <em>Atchison, T. &amp; S. F. R. Co., </em>220 U. S. 277, 287-289 (1911), and <em>Louisiana </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>176 U. S. 1, 16-22 (1900), are not helpful, however, for they involved claims of <em>parens patriae </em>standing rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>allegations of direct injury to the State itself. Moreover, we have rejected a similar argument in <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Washington State Apple Advertising Comm\u2019n, </em>432 U. S. 333 (1977). In <em>Hunt, </em>the Washington State Apple Advertising Commission brought suit to declare as violative of the Commerce Clause a North Carolina statute requiring that all apples sold or shipped into North Carolina in closed containers be identified by no grade other than the applicable federal grade or a designation that the apples were not graded. The commission was a statutory agency designed for the promotion and protection of the Washington State apple industry and composed of 13 state growers and dealers chosen from electoral districts by their fellow growers and dealers, all of whom by mandatory assessments financed the commission\u2019s operations. The North Carolina officials named in the suit vigorously contested the commission\u2019s standing, either in its own right or on behalf of the apple industry it represented, arguing that it lacked a \u201cpersonal stake\u201d in the litigation because, as a state agency, it was \u201cnot itself engaged in the production and sale of Washington apples or their shipment into North Carolina.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 341. After addressing the commission\u2019s analogues to associational standing, we turned to the commission\u2019s allegations of direct injury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-5\">\u201cFinally, we note that the interests of the Commission itself may be adversely affected by the outcome of this litigation. The annual assessments paid to the Commission are tied to the volume of apples grown and packaged as Washington Apples.\u2019 In the event the North Carolina statute results in a contraction of the market for Washington apples or prevents any market expansion that might otherwise occur, it could reduce the amount of the assessments due the Commission and used to support its activities. This financial nexus between the interests of the Commission and its constituents coalesces with the other factors noted above to \u2018assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions.\u2019 <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>[369 U. S. 186, 204 (1962)]; see also <em>NAACP </em>v. <em>Alabama ex rel. Patterson, </em>367 U. S. 449, 469-460 (1958).\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 345.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">That the commission was allowed to proceed in <em>Hunt </em>necessarily supports Wyoming\u2019s standing against Oklahoma, where its severance tax revenues are directly linked to the extraction and sale of coal and have been demonstrably affected by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">Over Oklahoma\u2019s objection, which is repeated here, the Special Master also concluded that this case was an appropriate one for the exercise of our original jurisdiction. We agree, and we obviously shared this thought when granting Wyoming leave to file its complaint in the first instance. We have generally observed that the Court\u2019s original jurisdiction should be exercised \u201csparingly,\u201d <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>451 U. S., at 739; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Nevada, </em>412 U. S. 534, 538 (1973), and this Court applies discretion when accepting original cases, even as to actions between States where our jurisdiction is exclusive. As stated not long ago:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-7\">\u201cIn recent years, we have consistently interpreted 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1251(a) as providing us with substantial discretion to make case-by-case judgments as to the practical necessity of an original forum in this Court for particular disputes within our constitutional original jurisdiction. See <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>451 U. S. 725, 743 (1981); <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Wyandotte Chemicals Corp., </em>401 U. S. 493,499 (1971). We exercise that discretion with an eye to promoting the most effective functioning of this Court within the overall federal system.\u201d <em>Texas </em>v. <em>New Mexico, </em>462 U. S. 554, 570 (1983).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">Specifically, we have imposed prudential and equitable limitations upon the exercise of our original jurisdiction, and of these limitations we have said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>\u201c\u2018We construe 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1251(a)(1), as we do Art. Ill, \u00a7 2, cl. 2, to honor our original jurisdiction but to make it obligatory only in appropriate cases. And the question of what is appropriate concerns, of course, the seriousness and dignity of the claim; yet beyond that it necessarily involves the availability of another forum where there is jurisdiction over the named parties, where the issues tendered may be litigated, and where appropriate relief may be had.\u2019 \u201d <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>City of Milwaukee, </em>406 U. S. 91, 93 (1972), quoted in <em>California </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>457 U. S. 164, 168 (1982).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">It is beyond peradventure that Wyoming has raised a claim of sufficient \u201cseriousness and dignity.\u201d Oklahoma, acting in its sovereign capacity, passed the Act, which directly affects Wyoming\u2019s ability to collect severance tax revenues, an action undertaken in its sovereign capacity. As such, Wyoming\u2019s challenge under the Commerce Clause precisely \u201cimplicates serious and important concerns of federalism fully in accord with the purposes and reach of our original jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>451 U. S., at 744. Indeed, we found it not to be a \u201cwaste\u201d of this Court\u2019s time in <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Louisiana </em>to consider the validity of one State\u2019s \u201cfirst-use tax\u201d which served, in effect, as a severance tax on gas extracted from areas belonging to the people at large, to the detriment of other States on to whose consumers the tax passed. <em>Ibid. </em>Wyoming\u2019s claim here is no less substantial, and touches on its direct injury rather than on any interest as <em>parens patriae.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Oklahoma makes much of the fact that the mining companies affected in Wyoming could bring suit raising the Commerce Clause challenge, as private parties aggrieved by state action often do. But cf. <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Washington State Apple Advertising Comm\u2019n, supra. </em>For reasons unknown, however, they have chosen neither to intervene in this action nor to file their own, whether in state or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>federal court.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As such, no pending action exists to which we could defer adjudication on this issue. See, <em>e. g., Illinois </em>v. <em>City of Milwaukee, supra, </em>at 98, 108; <em>Washington </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>406 U. S. 109, 114 (1972). Even if such action were proceeding, however, Wyoming\u2019s interests would not be directly represented. See <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Louisiana, supra, </em>at 743; cf. <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>New Mexico, </em>425 U. S. 794 (1976). Indeed, Wyoming brings suit as a sovereign seeking declaration from this Court that Oklahoma\u2019s Act is unconstitutional. The Constitution provides us original jurisdiction, and Congress has made this provision exclusive as between these parties, two States. It was proper to entertain this case without assurances, notably absent here, that a State\u2019s interests under the Constitution will find a forum for appropriate hearing and full relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Oklahoma points to the general requirement, reflected in the controlling principles explained above, that \u201c[b]efore this court can be moved to exercise its extraordinary power under the Constitution to control the conduct of one State at the suit of another, the threatened invasion of rights must be of serious magnitude and it must be established by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d <em>New York </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>256 U. S. 296, 309 (1921); see also <em>Connecticut </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>282 U. S. 660, 669 (1931); <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>200 U. S. 496, 521 (1906). On this basis Oklahoma suggests that Wyoming\u2019s interest is <em>de minimis </em>solely for the reason that loss in severance tax revenues attributable to the Act has generally been less than 1% of total taxes collected. See Affidavit of Richard J. Marble (Exh. B to Appendix to Motion of Wyo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>ming for Summary Judgment). We decline any invitation to key the exercise of this Court\u2019s original jurisdiction on the amount in controversy.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Oklahoma\u2019s argument is, in fact, no different than the situation we faced in <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>West Virginia, </em>262 U. S. 553 (1923). When Pennsylvania challenged a West Virginia statute designed to keep natural gas within its borders, there was no question but that the issue presented rose to a level suitable to our original jurisdiction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-5\">\u201cThe question is an important one; for what one State may do others may, and there are ten States from which natural gas is exported for consumption in other States. Besides, what may be done with one natural product may be done with others, and there are several States in which the earth yields products of great value which are carried into other States and there used.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 596.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">And so it is here. Wyoming coal is a natural resource of great value primarily carried into other States for use, and Wyoming derives significant revenue from this interstate movement. \u201c[T]he practical effect of [Oklahoma\u2019s] statute must be evaluated not only by considering the consequences of the statute itself, but also by considering how the challenged statute may interact with the legitimate regulatory regimes of the other States and what effect would arise if not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>one, but many or every, State adopted similar legislation.\u201d <em>Healy </em>v. <em>Beer Institute, </em>491 U. S. 324, 336 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"AYQ\">Because of the nature of Wyoming\u2019s claim, and the absence of any other pending litigation involving the same parties or issues, we find the present case appropriate for the exercise of this Court\u2019s original jurisdiction. Accordingly, we accept the recommendation of the Special Master that Wyoming should be permitted to bring this action, and we reject Oklahoma\u2019s exceptions to the Special Master\u2019s Report.</p>\n<p id=\"APX\">III</p>\n<p id=\"Ayk\">We also agree with the Special Master\u2019s ultimate conclusion that the Act is invalid under the Commerce Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"Ae2\">The Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution provides that \u201c[t]he Congress shall have Power ... [t]o regulate Commerce . . . among the several States . . . Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 3. It is long established that, while a literal reading evinces a grant of power to Congress, the Commerce Clause also directly limits the power of the States to discriminate against interstate commerce. See <em>New Energy Co. of Indiana </em>v. <em>Limbach, </em>486 U. S. 269, 273 (1988) (citing <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>441 U. S. 322, 326 (1979); <em>H. P. Hood &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Du Mond, </em>336 U. S. 525, 534-535 (1949); <em>Welton </em>v. <em>Missouri, </em>91 U. S. 275 (1876)). \u201cThis \u2018negative\u2019 aspect of the Commerce Clause prohibits economic protectionism \u2014 that is, regulatory measures designed to benefit in-state economic interests by burdening out-of-state competitors.\u201d <em>New Energy Co., supra, </em>at 273-274; see also <em>Bacchus Imports, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Dias, </em>468 U. S. 263, 270-273 (1984); <em>H. P. Hood &amp; Sons, supra, </em>at 532-533. When a state statute clearly discriminates against interstate commerce, it will be struck down, see, <em>e. g., New Energy Co., supra, </em>unless the discrimination is demonstrably justified by a valid factor unrelated to economic protectionism, see, <em>e. g., Maine </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>477 U. S. 131 (1986). Indeed, when the state statute amounts to simple economic protectionism, a \u201cvirtually <em>per se </em>rule of invalidity\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>has applied. <em>Philadelphia </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>437 U. S. 617, 624 (1978).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">The Special Master correctly found that the Act, on its face and in practical effect, discriminates against interstate commerce. See <em>Bacchus Imports, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Dias, supra, </em>at 270. Section 939 of the Act expressly reserves a segment of the Oklahoma coal market for Oklahoma-mined coal, to the exclusion of coal mined in other States. Such a preference for coal from domestic sources cannot be characterized as anything other than protectionist and discriminatory, for the Act purports to exclude coal mined in other States based solely on its origin. See <em>New Energy Co., supra, </em>at 274; <em>Philadelphia </em>v. <em>New Jersey, supra, </em>at 626-627. The stipulated facts confirm that from 1981 to 1986 Wyoming provided virtually 100% of the coal purchased by Oklahoma utilities. In 1987 and 1988, following the effective date of the Act, the utilities purchased Oklahoma coal in amounts ranging from 3.4% to 7.4% of their annual needs, with a necessarily corresponding reduction in purchases of Wyoming coal.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">As in its jurisdictional arguments, Oklahoma attempts to discount this evidence by emphasizing that the Act sets aside only a \u201csmall portion\u201d of the Oklahoma coal market, without placing an \u201coverall burden\u201d on out-of-state coal producers doing business in Oklahoma. The volume of commerce affected measures only the <em>extent </em>of the discrimination; it is of no relevance to the determination whether a State has discriminated against interstate commerce. <em>Bacchus Im</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number><em>ports, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Dias, supra, </em>at 268-269; <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>451 U. S., at 760; <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>BT Investment Managers, Inc., </em>447 U. S. 27, 39-42 (1980). As we have only recently reaffirmed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-4\">\u201cOur cases . . . indicate that where discrimination is patent, as it is here, neither a widespread advantage to in-state interests nor a widespread disadvantage to out-of-state competitors need be shown.... Varying the strength of the bar against economic protectionism according to the size and number of in-state and out-of-state firms affected would serve no purpose except the creation of new uncertainties in an already complex field.\u201d New <em>Energy Co., supra, </em>at 276-277.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Because the Act discriminates both on its face and in practical effect, the burden falls on Oklahoma \u201c \u2018to justify it both in terms of the local benefits flowing from the statute and the unavailability of nondiscriminatory alternatives adequate to preserve the local interests at stake/\u201d <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, supra, </em>at 336 (quoting <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Washington State Apple Advertising Comm\u2019n, </em>432 U. S., at 353). \u201cAt a minimum such facial discrimination invokes the strictest scrutiny of any purported legitimate local purpose and of the absence of nondiscriminatory alternatives.\u201d <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, supra, </em>at 337. We agree with the Special Master\u2019s recommended conclusions that Oklahoma has not met its burden in this respect. In this Court, Oklahoma argues quite briefly that the Act\u2019s discrimination against out-of-state coal is justified because sustaining the Oklahoma coal-mining industry lessens the State\u2019s reliance on a single source of coal delivered over a single rail line. This justification, as the Special Master noted, is foreclosed by the Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Baldwin </em>v. <em>G. </em>A. <em>F. Seelig, Inc., </em>294 U. S. 511 (1935), and <em>H. P. Hood &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Du Mond, supra, </em>cases that the State\u2019s brief ignores. We have often examined a \u201cpresumably legitimate goal,\u201d only to find that the State at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>tempted to achieve it by \u201cthe illegitimate means of isolating the State from the national economy.\u201d <em>Philadelphia </em>v. <em>New Jersey, supra, </em>at 627.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">The State embellishes this argument somewhat when suggesting that, by requiring the utilities to supply 10% of their needs for fuel from Oklahoma coal, which because of its higher sulfur content cannot be the primary source of supply, the State thereby conserves Wyoming\u2019s cleaner coal for future use. We have no reason to doubt Wyoming\u2019s unre-butted factual response to this argument: Reserves of low sulfur, clean-burning, sub-bituminous coal from the Powder River Basin are estimated to be in excess of 110 billion tons, thus providing Wyoming coal for several hundred years at current rates of extraction. Reply Brief for Wyoming 9, n. 4 (citing Geological Survey of Wyoming, Guidebook of the Coal Geology of the Powder River Basin, Public Information Circular No. 14, p. 126 (1980)). In any event, this contention, which is raised for the first time in Oklahoma\u2019s brief on the merits, finds no support in the records made in this case. See <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>441 U. S., at 337-338, and n. 20; cf. <em>Maine </em>v. <em>Taylor, 477 </em>U. S., at 148-149.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Oklahoma argues more seriously that the \u201csaving clause\u201d of the Federal Power Act, 16 U. S. C. \u00a7 824(b)(1),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> which reserves to the States the regulation of local retail electric rates, makes permissible the Act\u2019s discriminatory impact on the movement of Wyoming coal in interstate commerce. Oklahoma argues that it \u201chas determined that effective and helpful ways of ensuring lower local utility rates include 1) reducing over-dependence on a single source of supply, a single <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>fuel transporter, and 2) conserving needed low-sulfur coal for the future.\u201d Brief for Oklahoma 65. Even if the Act is accepted as part of the State's rate-regulating authority, we cannot accept the submission that it is exempt from scrutiny under the Commerce Clause. Congress must manifest its unambiguous intent before a federal statute will be read to permit or to approve such a violation of the Commerce Clause as Oklahoma here seeks to justify. <em>Maine </em>v. <em>Taylor, supra, </em>at 139; <em>South-Central Timber Development, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wunnicke, </em>467 U. S. 82, 91 (1984). We have already examined \u00a7 824(b)(1) in <em>New England Power Co. </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, </em>455 U. S. 331 (1982), and found nothing in the statute or legislative history \u201cevinc[ing] a congressional intent \u2018to alter the limits of state power otherwise imposed by the Commerce Clause.\u2019\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 341 (quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Comm\u2019n of Cal., </em>345 U. S. 295, 304 (1953)). There is no hint in that opinion, as suggested by Oklahoma, that a <em>partial </em>\u2014 instead of <em>total </em>\u2014 ban would have been permissible, or that in-state purchasing quotas imposed on utilities in an effort to regulate utility rates are within the \u201clawful authority\u201d of the States under \u00a7 824(b)(1). Instead, our decision turned on the recognition that \u201cCongress did no more than leave standing whatever valid state laws then existed relating to the exportation of hydroelectric energy; by its plain terms, [\u00a7 824(b)] simply saves from pre-emption under Part II of the Federal Power Act such state authority as was otherwise \u2018lawful.\u2019\u201d <em>New England Power Co., supra, </em>at 341. Our decisions have uniformly subjected Commerce Clause cases implicating the Federal Power Act to scrutiny on the merits. See, <em>e. g., New England Power Co., supra; Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corp. </em>v. <em>Arkansas Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>461 U. S. 375, 393 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">We need say no more to conclude that Oklahoma has not met its burden of demonstrating a clear and unambiguous intent on behalf of Congress to permit the discrimination against interstate commerce occurring here. In light of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>foregoing, we adopt the Special Master\u2019s conclusion that the Act manifests fatal defects under the Commerce Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Finally, we address a question of severability raised in the exceptions filed by Wyoming to the Special Master\u2019s Report.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">The GRDA is an agency of the State of Oklahoma, and, as such, Oklahoma acts as a market participant in directing its purchases of coal. We have recognized that the Commerce Clause does not restrict the State\u2019s action as a free market participant. <em>Reeves, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stake, </em>447 U. S. 429, 436-437 (1980); <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Alexandria Scrap Corp., </em>426 U. S. 794, 806-810 (1976). The Special Master recommends that the market-participant exception is available to Oklahoma, but only if the application of the Act to the GRDA may be considered separately, or severed, from its application to the three private utilities. As the determination of severability will in this situation be one of state law, <em>Hooper </em>v. <em>Bernalillo County Assessor, </em>472 U. S. 612, 624 (1985), the Special Master recommends that we enter judgment with respect to the three private utilities but dismiss Wyoming\u2019s complaint as it relates to the GRDA without prejudice to the right of Wyoming to reassert the claim in an \u201cappropriate forum.\u201d Report of Special Master 32. We sustain Wyoming\u2019s exception to these recommendations of the Special Master. This action is one between two States presented under our original jurisdiction; this Court is the appropriate forum to decide issues necessary to afford the complaining State complete relief. Cf. <em>Dorchy </em>v. <em>Kansas, </em>264 U. S. 286, 291 (1924). We deem it proper and advisable to address the issue of sever-ability ourselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">In the alternative, the Special Master looked to Oklahoma law and found the Act severable as to the GRDA, a conclusion with which we disagree. It is true that Oklahoma courts have held that valid portions of a .statute are sever-able \u201c\u2018unless it is evident that the Legislature would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>have enacted the valid provisions with the invalid provisions removed, if with the invalid provisions removed the rest of the act is fully operative as a law.\u2019\u201d <em>Englebrecht </em>v. <em>Day, </em>201 Okla. 585, 591, 208 P. 2d 538, 544 (1949) (quoting <em>Sterling Refining Co. </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>165 Okla. 45, 25 P. 2d 312 (1933)). It is also true that under Oklahoma law, a severability clause in a statute creates a presumption that the legislature would have adopted the statute with the unconstitutional portions omitted. 201 Okla., at 591, 208 P. 2d, at 544; see <em>Champlin Refining Co. </em>v. <em>Corporation Comm\u2019n of Oklahoma, </em>286 U. S. 210, 234-235 (1932) (inquiring into severability under Oklahoma law). The Act in this case contains a severability provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-5\">\u201cThe provisions of this act are severable and if any part or provision shall be held void, the decision of the court so holding shall not affect or impair any of the remaining parts or provisions of this act.\u201d Act of Mar. 26, 1986, Ch. 43, \u00a73, 1986 Okla. Sess. Laws 74.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">But there are no parts or separate provisions in the invalid \u00a7 939 of the Act. It applies to \u201c [a]ll entities providing electric power for sale to the consumer in Oklahoma\u201d and commands them to purchase 10% Oklahoma-mined coal. Okla. Stat., Tit. 45, \u00a7939 (Supp. 1988). Nothing remains to be saved once that provision is stricken. Accordingly, the Act must stand or fall as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">We decline Oklahoma\u2019s suggestion that the term \u201call entities\u201d be read to uphold the Act only as to the GRDA, for it is clearly not this Court\u2019s province to rewrite a state statute. If \u201call entities\u201d is to mean \u201cthe GRDA\u201d or \u201cstate-owned utilities,\u201d the Oklahoma Legislature must be the one to decide. Indeed, this argument perceives the nature of the severability clause to be much different than that written by the Oklahoma Legislature. Severability clauses may easily be written to provide that if application of a statute to some classes is found unconstitutional, severance of those classes permits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>application to the acceptable classes.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Moreover, the statute could itself have been written to address explicitly the GRDA.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The legislature here chose neither course.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">The State provides no additional insight into the intent of its legislature on this question. The Act would become a fundamentally different piece of legislation were it construed to apply only to the GRDA. We leave to the Oklahoma Legislature to decide whether it wishes to burden this state-owned utility when private utilities will otherwise be free of the Act\u2019s restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">We deny Oklahoma\u2019s motion for summary judgment and grant that of Wyoming. In sum, we hold that the Act is unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause. No portion is severable as to any entity touched by its mandate. A judgment and decree to that effect and enjoining enforcement of the Act will be entered. Jurisdiction over the case is retained in the event that further proceedings are required to implement the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b602-9\"> Act of Mar. 26, 1986, Ch. 43, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2,1986 Okla.

At best, Oklahoma\u2019s counteraffidavit suggests that the estimate of lost severance tax revenues is a bit too high, pointing to the slight percentages of Oklahoma coal purchased prior to the Act as indicative that Wyoming did not provide 100% of the coal purchased. <em>Id., </em>at 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b607-7\"> A coal\u2019s BTU rating reflects the heat-generating efficiency of the coal when burned.

I would deny Wyoming\u2019s motion for summary judgment and grant Oklahoma\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"Aoj\">I</p>\n<p id=\"AbN\">At the outset, let me address briefly the Court s suggestion that our previous rejections of Oklahoma\u2019s standing objections \u2014 when we granted Wyoming leave to file its complaint and when we denied Oklahoma\u2019s motion to dismiss for want of standing \u2014 somehow impede us from considering that objection today. <em>Ante, </em>at 446. To begin with, the \u201claw-of-the-case principles\u201d which the Court suggests should be persuasive albeit not necessarily binding in original actions, <em>ibid,., </em>have never to my knowledge been applied to jurisdictional issues raised (or reraised) before final judgment. To the contrary, it is a court\u2019s <em>obligation </em>to dismiss a case <em>whenever </em>it becomes convinced that it has no proper jurisdiction, no matter how late that wisdom may arrive. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 12(h)(3) <em>(\u201cWhenever </em>it appears . . . that the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter, the court <em>shall </em>dismiss the action\u201d) (emphasis added). See also <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>McKeithen, 395 </em>U. S. 411, 421 (1969). Of course, this does not mean that a court need let itself be troubled by the same jurisdictional objection raised over and over again, when it has thoroughly considered that issue once and remains convinced that it resolved the issue correctly. But that is quite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>different from \u201claw of the case,\u201d which would give effect even to an erroneous decision, simply because it has already been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">And in the present case, we have <em>not </em>considered the standing issue thoroughly once before. We disposed of Oklahoma\u2019s preliminary standing objections summarily, without oral argument and without opinion. I considered us to be deciding at that time, not, once and for all, that standing existed, but simply that the absence of standing was not so clear that our normal practice of permitting the suit to be filed and of referring all questions <em>(including the standing question) </em>to a special master should be short circuited. The parties apparently understood our action that way, since the standing issue was raised (without \u201claw-of-the-case\u201d objection from Wyoming) before the Special Master. And the Master certainly did not think that we had conclusively decided the point, since he received argument on it and discussed it as the very first of the \u201cthree legal issues that require a recommendation to the Court.\u201d Report of Special Master 10. If the <em>Special Master </em>was not precluded by our prior action, it is hard to understand why we ourselves would be.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">There is no unfairness to Wyoming in this. To be sure, we might have given the standing question full-dress consideration to begin with, and, if we concluded in Oklahoma\u2019s favor, could have spared the parties lengthy proceedings before the Special Master. But the same could be said of the substantive issue whether the Act violated the Commerce Clause. Our choice not to proceed in that fashion was both in accord with ordinary practice and in my view sound. Almost all other litigants must go through at least two other courts before their case receives our attention. It has become our practice in original-jurisdiction cases to require preliminary proceedings before a special master, to evaluate the facts and sharpen the issues. Wyoming has no cause for complaint that we did that here, and we should not distort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>our jurisdictional holding on the basis of some misguided feeling of estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Finally, even if the Court were correct that some \u201cchange of circumstance,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 446, ought to be presented before the jurisdictional objection that we denied so cursorily at the preliminary stage can be reraised, such a change in fact exists. The litigation has reached a <em>new stage, </em>having proceeded from a motion for judgment on the pleadings (which we denied) to cross-motions for summary judgment (which the Special Master recommended resolving in favor of Wyoming). When a district court denies the former, it need feel no compunction of consistency to deny the latter; and the same is true for us. The standing issue is obviously subject to different evaluation, depending upon the stage the litigation has reached. A plaintiff may survive a motion to dismiss for lack of injury in fact by merely alleging that a string of occurrences commencing with the challenged act has caused him injury; at that stage we presume that \u201cgeneral allegations embrace those specific facts that are necessary to support the claim,\u201d <em>Lujan </em>v. <em>National Wildlife Federation, </em>497 U. S. 871, 889 (1990). See also <em>Whitmore </em>v. <em>Arkansas, </em>495 U. S. 149, 158-159 (1990). A plaintiff cannot, however, on the basis of the same generalizations, obtain or avoid summary judgment, where a moving party must \u201cshow that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact,\u201d Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(c), and where a nonmoving party cannot rest on \u201cmere allegations\u201d to counter a properly supported motion, but must set forth \u201cspecific facts\u201d through affidavits or other evidence, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(e). See <em>Lujan, supra, </em>at 884-885. See also <em>Gladstone, Realtors </em>v. <em>Village of Bellwood, </em>441 U. S. 91, 115, and n. 31 (1979). It is the adequacy of <em>these </em>presentations that Oklahoma now asks us to evaluate \u2014 and we have not evaluated them before.</p>\n<p id=\"AJdj\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"A12l\">It is axiomatic that \"a litigant first must clearly demonstrate that he has suffered an `injury in fact\" in order to assert Article III standing to sue. Whitmore, supra, at 155. In assessing a claim to injury, \"{w]e presume that federal courts lack jurisdiction unless the contrary appears affirmatively from the record,\" Renne v. Geary, 501 U. S. 312, 316 (1991) (internal quotation marks omitted). See also Bender v. Williamsport Area School Dist., 475 U. S. 534, 546 (1986); it is accordingly \"the burden of the party who seeks the exercise of jurisdiction in his favor. . . clearly to allege facts demonstrating\" that he has been injured. FW/PBS, Inc. v. Dallas, 493 U. S. 215, 231 (1990) (internal quotation marks omitted). This burden is \"substantially more difficult\" to bear when the asserted injury is \"highly indirect and results from the independent action of some third party not before the court\"-for the simple reason that there are more variables involved. Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 757-759 (1984). See also Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization, 426 U. S. 26, 42, 44-45 (1976); Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, 504-505 (1975). It is incumbent upon the plaintiff to eliminate those variables through \"specific, concrete facts,\" showing that the third party actually acted as he maintains and that the injury actually occurred. Id., at 508.</p>\n<p id=\"ACzT\">As I have mentioned, the plaintiff's success in meeting this burden is to be assessed under the rules governing the-stage the litigation has reached. See Lujan, supra, at 884-885. See also Gladstone, supra, at 115, and n. 31; Simon, supra, at 45, n. 26; Warth, supra, at 527, and n. 6 (Brennan, J., dissenting). Wyoming's motion for summary judgment thus cannot be granted unless Wyoming has demonstrated that \"there is no genuine issue\" as to its injury, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(c), see Adickes v. S. H. Kress &amp; Co., 398 U. S. 144, 157 (1970)-which means that \"[i]f reasonable minds could differ as to the import of the evidence,\" the motion must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>denied, <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U. S. 242, 250-251 (1986). To be entitled to prevail at this stage, therefore, Wyoming must have submitted \u201cspecific, concrete facts,\u201d <em>Warth, supra, </em>at 508, which when \u201cviewed in the light most favorable\u201d to Oklahoma \u201cforeclose\u201d all reasonable inferences that Wyoming was not injured by the Act, <em>Adickes, supra, </em>at 157. Wyoming has not in my view remotely carried that burden, and the Special Master\u2019s recommendation to grant its motion for summary judgment must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">The Special Master apparently thought Wyoming\u2019s injury unquestionable because it is undisputed that, since the Act\u2019s effective date, Oklahoma utilities have bought less Wyoming coal as a percentage of their coal purchases. Report of Special Master 11. Iam willing to assume for the sake of argument that that undisputed fact compels the inference that less Wyoming coal was sold in Oklahoma as a result of the Act. To establish injury, however, Wyoming had to show not merely that the statute caused Oklahoma <em>sales </em>to be lost, but that it prevented Wyoming \u201cseverances\u201d of coal from occurring. Wyoming does not tax sales of coal to Oklahoma utilities; it taxes severances. The loss of a particular Oklahoma sale would not hurt Wyoming\u2019s treasury at all unless (1) the coal that was the subject of that sale was not severed to be sold elsewhere, or (2) if it was severed to be sold elsewhere, that latter sale (and severance) would have occurred even if the Oklahoma sale had been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">The Court o\u2019erleaps this inconvenient obstacle by asserting that \u201ca loss of specific tax revenues [is] an undisputed fact here.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 448. I cannot imagine where this helpful concession comes from. The Special Master listed the undisputed facts, and it is not among them. See Report of Special Master 2-10, 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">The Court also appears to believe that the second of the above described means of connecting sales loss with tax loss is established by the fact that \u201cWyoming has a significant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>excess mining capacity\u201d; this fact, according to the Court, necessarily means that \u201cthe loss of any market cannot be made up by sales elsewhere.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 445, 446. That is not so. Excess capacity <em>can </em>mean the existence of facilities capable of producing additional quantities of goods that can be sold for a profit at current market prices \u2014 in which case the loss of one sale cannot really be \u201creplaced\u201d by the gain of another. But excess capacity <em>need not </em>mean that. It can also mean the existence of facilities that lie fallow because, although they can produce additional quantities of goods, they cannot do so at a cost that will yield a profit at current market prices. Innumerable capped or unexploited oil wells in this country exemplify that phenomenon. If <em>that </em>is the sort of excess capacity the Wyoming coal industry has, it nonetheless has a limited capability of sales at current market prices \u2014 in which case so long as that capability has been fully achieved no tax revenue has been lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">The excess capacity attested to by Wyoming\u2019s experts may well have been of this latter sort, since it was said to have been created in response to 1970\u2019s \u201cforecasts of high demand growth.\u201d Affidavit of Seth Schwartz, Appendix to Response to Motion to Dismiss A-2. Higher demand generally means higher prices, and the coal companies might well have brought new, higher cost production facilities on line (for example, deep-pit mines) that are at current prices not competitive. Even if the entire \u201cexcess capacity\u201d is competitive, since much of it came (according to Wyoming\u2019s expert) from the opening of \u201cnew mines,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>another possibility is that the Wyoming industry responded to less-than-anticipated demand in an efficient manner \u2014 by closing down some of the mines entirely rather than leaving them all in operation at a fraction of capacity. Under these conditions, it might well not pay a particular company to make a particular additional sale, if that additional sale would require the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>reopening of an additional mine, with the incremental cost that entails.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">The speculations Wyoming invites us to engage in are certainly plausible (though one must be given pause by the fact that the Wyoming coal companies themselves \u2014 who if Wyoming is right have lost not just the <em>tax </em>on the severances but the <em>entire profits </em>\u2014 have not chosen to litigate). Were this a trial on the record I might well conclude that it is more likely than not that Wyoming was injured. But \u201cat the summary judgment stage [our] function is not to weigh the evidence.\u201d <em>Anderson, supra, </em>at 249. It has at least not been conclusively established that Wyoming coal producers would have sold coal in addition to that diverted from the (presumably) lost Oklahoma sales. A genuine issue of material fact thus exists, and the Special Master's recommendation that we grant Wyoming\u2019s motion for summary judgment must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Even if Wyoming had fully established, in the manner Rule 56 provides, the \u201cinjury in fact\u201d required by Article III, I would still conclude that it does not have standing to bring this suit, and would grant Oklahoma\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment. \u201cBeyond the constitutional requirements, the federal judiciary has also adhered to a set of prudential principles that bear on the question of standing.\u201d <em>Valley Forge Christian College </em>v. <em>Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc., </em>454 U. S. 464, 474 (1982). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>One of these is the requirement that the plaintiff \u201cestablish that the injury he complains of <em>(his </em>aggrievement, or the adverse effect <em>upon </em>him) falls within the \u2018zone of interests\u2019 sought to be protected by the statut[e] [or constitutional guarantee] whose violation forms the legal basis for his complaint.\u201d <em>Air Courier Conference of America </em>v. <em>Postal Workers, </em>498 U. S. 517, 523-524 (1991) (internal quotation marks omitted). The \u201czone-of-interests\u201d formulation first appeared in cases brought under \u00a7 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S. C. \u00a7 702, see <em>Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. </em>v. <em>Camp, </em>397 U. S. 150, 153 (1970), but we have subsequently made clear that the same test similarly governs claims under the Constitution in general, see, <em>e. g., Valley Forge, supra, </em>at 475, and under the negative Commerce Clause in particular, see <em>Boston Stock Exchange </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>429 U. S. 318, 320-321, n. 3 (1977). Indeed, we have indicated that it is <em>more </em>strictly applied when a plaintiff is proceeding under a \u201cconstitutional . . . provision\u201d instead of the \u201cgenerous review provisions of the APA.\u201d <em>Clarke </em>v. <em>Securities Industry Assn., </em>479 U. S. 388, 400, n. 16 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The zone-of-interests test \u201cdenies a right of review if the plaintiff\u2019s interests are ... marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the [constitutional provision].\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 394, 399. The usual starting point for zone-of-interests analysis is the text of the provision at issue, see <em>Air Courier Conference, </em>498 U. S., at 524-525; since, however, the negative Commerce Clause is an inference rather than a text, the starting point here must be the history and purposes of the inference, see <em>id., </em>at 526-527.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Our negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence grew out of the notion that the Constitution implicitly established a national free market, under which, in Justice Jackson\u2019s words, \u201cevery farmer and every craftsman shall be encouraged to produce by the certainty that he will have free access to every market in the Nation [and] every consumer may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>look to the free competition from every producing area of the Nation to protect him from exploitation.\u201d <em>H. P. Hood &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Du Mond, </em>336 U. S. 525, 539 (1949). Virtually every one of our cases in this area thus begins its analysis with some form of the incantation that \u201cthe very purpose of the Commerce Clause was to create an area of free trade among the several States . . . [and the Clause] by its own force created an area of trade free from interference by the States.\u201d <em>Westinghouse Electric Corp. </em>v. <em>Tully, </em>466 U. S. 388, 402-403 (1984) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also <em>Boston Stock Exchange, supra, </em>at 328; <em>American Trucking Assns., Inc. </em>v. <em>Scheiner, </em>483 U. S. 266, 280 (1987). Just last Term we said that the negative Commerce Clause \u201cconfer[s] a \u2018right\u2019 to engage in interstate trade free from restrictive state regulation,\u201d for it \u201cwas intended to benefit those who ... are engaged in interstate commerce.\u201d <em>Dennis </em>v. <em>Higgins, </em>498 U. S. 439, 448, 449 (1991) (emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">The coal companies, of course, would pass the zone-of-interests test. So would Wyoming if it bought or sold coal, or otherwise directly participated in the coal market. It would then be \u201casserting [its] <em>right . . . to engage in interstate commerce </em>free of discrimination],\u201d <em>Boston Stock Exchange, supra, </em>at 320-321, n. 3 (emphasis added). But Wyoming\u2019s right to collect taxes presents an entirely different category of interest, only marginally related to the national market/free trade foundation of our jurisprudence in this area; indeed, it is in a sense positively antagonistic to that objective, since all state taxes, even perfectly constitutional ones, burden interstate commerce by reducing profit. Thus, when state taxes have been at issue in our prior negative Commerce Clause cases they have been the object of the plaintiff\u2019s challenge rather than the basis for his standing; and we have looked upon the State\u2019s interest in tax collection as a value to be <em>weighed against </em>the purposes of our Commerce Clause jurisprudence. Thus, Wyoming\u2019s interest in this case falls far shorter of meeting the zone-of-interests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>test than did that of the plaintiff postal union in <em>Air Courier Conference, supra, </em>at 528: Whereas the latter\u2019s interest in securing employment for postal workers, although distinct from the statute\u2019s goal of providing postal services to the citizenry, at least coincided with that goal a good amount of the time, here the asserted interest (tax collection) and the constitutional goal invoked to vindicate it (free trade) are antithetical.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">In seeming response to a zone-of-interests argument, the Court quotes, <em>ante, </em>at 449, our statement in <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Washington State Apple Advertising Comm\u2019n, </em>432 U. S. 333, 345 (1977), that \u201cthe interests of the [Washington State Apple Advertising] Commission itself may be\u201d at issue in the litigation, because \u201c[i]n the event the North Carolina statute results in a contraction of the market for Washington apples or prevents any market expansion that might otherwise occur, it could reduce the amount of the assessments due the Commission.\u201d The Court fails to note that this statement was <em>preceded </em>by the square holding that the State Apple Advertising Commission had standing to sue <em>as an association </em>on behalf of its members, the apple growers and dealers (who were in the same position as the coal companies here):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-6\">\u201cIf the Commission were a voluntary membership organization \u2014 a typical trade association \u2014 its standing to bring this action as a representative of its constituents would be clear ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAepT\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-7\">\u201cThe only question presented, therefore, is whether, on this record, the Commission\u2019s status as a state agency, rather than a traditional voluntary membership organization, precludes it from asserting the claims of the Washington apple growers and dealers who form its constituency. We think not.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 342-344.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">Only after finding associational standing did we speculate, in the passage the Court quotes, that the commission itself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>\u201cmay be\u201d adversely affected because its revenue collections \u201ccould [be] reduce[d].\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 345. I hardly think that musings of this sort are grounds for disregarding the obvious application of the zone-of-interests test to the present case\u2014 particularly as the Court in <em>Hunt </em>did not purport to be applying that test. The dicta in <em>Hunt, </em>moreover, were applying a since-repudiated understanding of the purpose of the standing requirement. Compare the last sentence of the passage quoted by the Court (taking the purpose to be \u201cto \u2018assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues <em>ibid., </em>quoting <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>369 U. S. 186, 204 (1962)), with <em>Allen, </em>468 U. S., at 750-752 (asserting that standing performs a separation-of-powers function, restricting the courts to their traditional role).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Of course, if the state interest in collecting severance taxes does fall within the zone of interests of the Commerce Clause, so must every other state taxing interest. The zone-of-interest test, as opposed to the injury-in-fact requirement, turns on the type of interest asserted and not on its speculativeness or its degree of attenuation from its alleged source. The injury-in-fact requirement, of course, will still remain \u2014 but if and when <em>de facto </em>causality can be established, every diminution of state revenue attributable to the allegedly unconstitutional commercial regulation of a sister State will now be the basis for a lawsuit. Suits based on loss of sales tax revenue ought to become a regular phenomenon, since it is no more difficult to show that an automatic sales tax was lost on a particular sale than it is to show that the severance tax was lost here. Further expansions of standing (or irrational distinctions) lurk just around the corner: If a State has a litigable interest in the taxes that would have been paid upon an unconstitutionally obstructed sale, there is no reasonable basis for saying that a company salesman does not have a litigable interest in the commissions that would have been paid, or a union in the wages that would have been earned.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>In abandoning the zone-of-interests test, the Court abandons our chosen means of giving expression, in the field of constitutional litigation, to the principle that \u201cthe judicial remedy cannot encompass every conceivable harm that can be traced to alleged wrongdoing.\u201d <em>Associated General Contractors of Cal., Inc. </em>v. <em>Carpenters, </em>459 U. S. 519, 536 (1983). The \u201czone-of-interests\u201d test performs the same role as many other judge-made rules circumscribing the availability of damages in tort and contract litigation \u2014 doctrines such as foreseeability and proximate cause, see, <em>e. g., Palsgraf </em>v. <em>Long Island R. Co., </em>248 N. Y. 339, 162 N. E. 99 (1928); directness of injury, see, <em>e. g., Associated General Contractors, supra, </em>at 540-541; the limitation on suits by third-party beneficiaries of contracts, see, e. <em>g., </em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7302(1) (1981); and the contemporaneous ownership rule governing shareholders\u2019 derivative actions, see, <em>e. g., </em>Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23.1. When courts abolish such limitations and require, as our opinion does today, nothing more than a showing of <em>defacto </em>causality, exposure to liability becomes immeasurable and the scope of litigation endless. If today\u2019s decision is adhered to, we can expect a sharp increase in state against state Commerce Clause suits; and if its rejection of the zone-of-interests test is applied logically, we can expect a sharp increase in all constitutional litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Of the three points I have discussed in the three portions of this opinion, I must believe that the first is the crucial one: the Court\u2019s reluctance, in an original action, to reconsider our initial denial of a motion to dismiss for lack of standing. I shall consider that to be an essential part of the holding of the case.

We exercise this discretion even with respect to controversies between two or more States, which fall within our original <em>and exclusive </em>jurisdiction.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> See, <em>e. g., Texas </em>v. <em>New Mexico, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>462 U. S. 554, 570 (1983); <em>California </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>457 U. S. 164, 168 (1982) <em>(per curiam); Maryland </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>451 U. S. 725, 739 (1981); <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>New Mexico, </em>425 U. S. 794, 796-798 (1976) <em>(per curiam). </em>I believe that the Court\u2019s decision to accept jurisdiction over this case is a misguided exercise of that discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">\u201cIt has long been this Court\u2019s philosophy that \u2018our original jurisdiction should be invoked sparingly.\u2019\u201d <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>City of Milwaukee, </em>406 U. S. 91, 93 (1972) (quoting <em>Utah </em>v. <em>United States, </em>394 U. S. 89, 95 (1969)). The sound reasons for this approach have been set forth on many occasions, see, <em>e. g., Ohio </em>v. <em>Wyandotte Chemicals Corp., supra, </em>at 498; <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Louisiana, supra, </em>at 761-763 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting), and I need not repeat them here. As Chief Justice Fuller aptly observed almost a century ago, our original jurisdiction \u201cis of so delicate and grave a character that it was not contemplated that it would be exercised save when the necessity was absolute.\u201d <em>Louisiana </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>176 U. S. 1,15 (1900). In determining which cases merit the exercise of original jurisdiction, the Court typically has focused on two considerations: the nature of the claims involved and the availability of alternative forums where they can be addressed. See, <em>e. g., Illinois </em>v. <em>City of Milwaukee, supra, </em>at 93; <em>Massachusetts </em>v. <em>Missouri, </em>308 U. S. 1, 18-19 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">In my view, both factors cut strongly against exercising original jurisdiction here. Wyoming claims to be injured as follows: The Oklahoma statute decreases coal sales by Wyoming mining companies to Oklahoma buyers, which supposedly decreases the amount of coal those companies extract in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>Wyoming, which in turn supposedly decreases the tax revenues Wyoming collects from the companies when they extract the coal. Plainly, the primary dispute here is <em>not </em>between the States of Wyoming and Oklahoma, but between the private Wyoming mining companies and the State of Oklahoma, whose statute reduced the companies\u2019 sales to Oklahoma utilities. It is true, as the Court notes, <em>ante, </em>at 451, that Oklahoma passed the statute in its sovereign capacity and that Wyoming collects taxes in its sovereign capacity. That States act <em>qua </em>States is certainly very relevant in assessing the \u201cseriousness and dignity\u201d of a claim. See <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Louisiana, supra, </em>at 764-766 (Rehnqutst, J., dissenting). But it is also critical to examine the extent to which the sovereigns actually have clashed. Cf. <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>New Mexico, supra, </em>at 797-798 (\u201cIn denying the State of Arizona leave to file, we are not unmindful that the legal incidence of [the challenged action by New Mexico] is upon the utilities\u201d). In my view, an entirely derivative injury of the type alleged by Wyoming here \u2014 even if it met minimal standing requirements \u2014 would not justify the exercise of discretionary original jurisdiction. Additionally, of course, Wyoming has advanced no reason why the affected mining companies (hardly bashful litigants) did not or could not themselves challenge the Oklahoma statute in another, more convenient, forum. The lower federal courts and the state courts are readily available as appropriate forums \u201cin which the <em>issues </em>tendered here may be litigated.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 797 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">The implications of the Court\u2019s novel theory that tax-collection injury alone justifies exercise of original jurisdiction are, in my view, both sweeping and troubling. An economic burden imposed by one State on another State\u2019s taxpayers will frequently affect the other State\u2019s fisc. (That will virtually always be the case, for example, with respect to income taxes; if State A takes actions that reduce the income of the taxpayers of State B, State B will collect less <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>income-tax revenue.) Under today\u2019s opinion, a State that can show <em>any </em>loss in tax revenue \u2014 even a <em>de minimis </em>loss, see <em>ante, </em>at 452-453, and n. 11 \u2014 that can be traced (albeit loosely) to the action of another State can apparently proceed directly to this Court to challenge that action. Perhaps the Court is not concerned about that possibility because of its \u201cdiscretion\u201d in managing its original docket. But, having extended the original jurisdiction to one State\u2019s claim based on its tax-collector status, the Court cannot, in the exercise of discretion, refuse to entertain future disputes based on the same theory. That would be the exercise not of discretion, but of caprice.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b636-6\"> Justice Stevens has stated that the Court\u2019s explanations for declining to exercise its <em>nonexclusive </em>original jurisdiction are \u201cinapplicable\u201d where, as here, its original jurisdiction is <em>exclusive </em>under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1251(a). <em>California </em>v. <em>West Virginia, </em>454 U. S. 1027, 1027-1028 (1981) (opinion dissenting from denial of motion to file bill of complaint). Similarly, commentators have suggested that the Court\u2019s statement that \u201c \u2018the congressional grant of exclusive jurisdiction under \u00a7 1251(a). . . requir[es] resort to our obligatory jurisdiction only in appropriate cases\u2019\u201d is \u201can oxymoron.\u201d P. Bator, D. Meltzer, P. Mishkin, &amp; D. Shapiro, Hart and Wechsler\u2019s The Federal Courts and the Federal System 344 (3d ed. 1988) (quoting <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>451 U. S. 725, 739 (1981) (internal quotation marks omitted)). See also Shapiro, Jurisdiction and Discretion, 60 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>N. Y. U. L. Rev. 543, 561 (1985) (calling \u201cunanswerable\u201d criticism of the Court\u2019s discretionary approach to cases within its exclusive original jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">As noted in text, the Court has held otherwise and those precedents have not been challenged here. The exercise of discretion is probably inevitable as long as the Court\u2019s approach to standing is as relaxed as it is today.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
