For a number of years he had lived alone in a small three-room cottage at Pamplin. Shortly after his death, his son and only surviving child, John Chappell Hamlet, his nephew, John M. Hamlet, Jr., and Earl Mattox, who had married one of the decedent\u2019s nieces, found an envelope in a black satchel in a closet of the room in which Dr. Hamlet died. On the front of this envelope, in the handwriting of the decedent, are these notations: \u201cMy last Will is enclosed here, written with Pencil, on Nov. 13th\u20141941.' My Will is in grip in closet.\u201d \u201cWill, On the back of the envelope, and likewise in the handwriting of the decedent, the words \u201cMy Will\u201d are written four times.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">The envelope contained a single-page typewritten document, dated October 7, 1929, and purporting to be the will of the decedent, and two holographic writings dated November 13, 1941, and July 11, 1943, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-12\">The first paragraph of the typewritten instrument reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-13\">\u201cI, Dr. Robert Edward Hamlet of Farmville, Virginia, being of sound and disposing mind do hereby make, publish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>and declare this to be my last will and testament, hereby revoking any other will by me at any time made.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Then follow six paragraphs directing the payment of the decedent\u2019s debts, disposing of his estate, and appointing executors. Some of these items bear pencil notations indicating that they had been stricken out in whole or in part or considerably altered.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">The paper concludes thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-7\">\u201cGiven under my hand this the 7 day of October, 1929.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-8\">(Signed) \u201cDr. Robert Edward Hamlet\u201d.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-9\">(Signed) \u201cMrs. Garland Wilkinson \u201cGordon Paulett \u201cA. C. Paulette\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">The probate of this writing was refused because the usual attestation clause is lacking, and it appeared from the testimony of the two surviving attesting witnesses that the instrument had not been signed or acknowledged by Dr. Hamlet in the presence of two witnesses, all being \u201cpresent, at the same time,\u201d as required by the statute. Code, sec. 5229. All of the parties agree that this ruling of the trial court was correct..</p>\n<p id=\"b526-11\">The main controversy concerns the action of the trial court in declining to admit to probate the two-page holographic writing, dated November 13* 1941, and likewise found in the envelope. We quote so much of the instrument as is material to the issue before us. The first two paragraphs read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-12\">\u201cHaving had my other Wills examined by a Lawyer who stated that they contained some flaws, &amp; at his suggestion &amp; advice I am hereby writing this one in my own handwriting, that is my wish and Will to be carried out, on this Thirteenth (13th) day of November 1941.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>\u201cI, Dr. Robert, Edward Hamlet, now of Pamplin, Va. being of sound &amp; disposing mind do hereby make, Publish &amp; declare this to be my last Will &amp; Testament, hereby Revoking any other Will, by me at any time made.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">After directing the payment of his \u201cjust debts,\u201d the writer disposes of his real and personal estate between his brother, Dr. J. M. Hamlet, his son, John Chappell Hamlet, his nephew, John M. Hamlet, Jr., and other nieces and nephews. Also included among the beneficiaries are certain members of the Cumbey family and others.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">The writing closes with this paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-8\">\u201cThis Will is in my own handwriting, done by me of Good &amp; Sound mind, on this 13th day of November 1941. I appoint John Hamlet Jr. as Administrator without Bond.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">On the back of the second page is this notation: \u201cMy last Will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">This document is not signed at the end in the usual manner, and unless the insertion of th\u00e9 name at the beginning of the second paragraph was intended as a signature, it is unsigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-11\">The third paper found in the envelope is on a single sheet of paper, is likewise written with pencil in the handwriting of Dr. Hamlet, and is unsigned. On one side of the sheet are these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-12\">\u201cAs stated elsewhere I want the Cumbey to have full &amp; unencumbered right to the Home in which they now live, as my last Will &amp; Wish regardless of how stated in my Will, but with boundries as stated in my Will, &amp; as stated in my Will, also, in regard the Well, but not to be sold, rented, or given away.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-13\">\u201cI appoint John Hamlet Jr. of Charlottesville as administrator without Bond, &amp; John don\u2019t fail to give the Cumbeys full possession as stated above.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-14\">\u201cJuly nth 1943.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>On the reverse side of this sheet are these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-5\">\u201cIn regard the Cumbey Home, They have been so good to me. My Will is in Grip in Closet &amp; $100.00 in Cabinet iii the other room.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">The evidence relating to the probate of the document^ just described was heard <em>ore teams </em>by the trial court on December 15, 1943, at the conclusion of which it ruled, for the reasons stated, that the typewritten instrument* should not be probated. The court took under consideration whether the other two writings, dated November 13, 1941, and July 11, 1943, respectively, should be admitted to probate. Pending the court\u2019s consideration of the matter, certain other writings came into the possession of John M. Hamlet, Jr., who was named in the instrument of November 13, 1941, as \u201cAdministrator.\u201d Each of these is written with pencil, wholly in the handwriting of Dr. Hamlet. The first of these writings is on a single sheet of paper, and reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-7\">\n<em>\u201cThis must' be carried out,</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-8\">\u201cJohn without fail</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-9\">\u201cRegardless of <em>anything </em>contained in my last Will, it is my wish &amp; Will that Mrs. Sidney Spencer of Buckingham Co., is to receive, or get, first of all,, a $500.00, hundred Dollar Government Bond $500.00 or its equivalent, without fail, for she is the only one who has .offered me a place to stay, or a Home, regardless of how humble, &amp; to do what she can, in her feeble way, for me. Something no one else has done, &amp; I truly appreciate it, for I am Sure that very few, or <em>anyone, </em>ever lived, or died, a more miserable life, or death, without any one near them, to do a single thing for them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-10\">\u201c(Signed) Dr. R. E. Hamlet</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-11\">\u201cJune 1st 1943.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-12\">On the back of this sheet are these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>\u201cThis is no good, (Void) unless attached to the Original Will.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-5\">\u201c(Signed) Dr. R. E. Hamlet</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-6\">\u201cSept. 4th 1943.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">This paper was found by Mrs. John Chappell Hamlet on November 28, 1943, among some Christmas cards and letters, in a small filing case in the back room. Mrs. Hamlet showed the paper to her husband, and both of them testified that it was called to the attention of John M. Hamlet, Jr., prior to the hearing on December 15. John M. Hamlet, Jr., testified that the paper was not called to his attention until after the hearing. In any event, it was not offered for probate until the second hearing which took place on January 28, 1944.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">In the meantime John M. Hamlet, Jr., had found, in an appointment book on top of Dr. Hamlet\u2019s desk, the last of the purported testamentary writings. It is unsigned, written with pencil in the handwriting of Dr. Hamlet, and reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-9\">\u201cI want the Cumbeys to have the Home in which they now live in fee simple, with full right &amp; uncumbered, regardless of how stated in my last Will,, but with boundries as described in Will &amp; with perfect right given' to parties living in houses across the road to the Water in the Well at any &amp; all times, as also stated in my last Will</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-10\">\u201cJuly 8th 1943\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-11\">After the interested parties had been convened and the further evidence heard <em>ore </em>tenus, the trial court took the view that none of the papers offered should be admitted to probate. This holding was- based upon the view that the instruments dated November 13, 1941, July 8, 1943, and July 11, 1943, were not \u201csigned\u201d as required by the statute. Code, section 5229.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-12\">The court also ruled that while the instrument dated June 1, 1943, was signed by Dr. Hamlet, the notation on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>reverse side, dated September 4, 1943,' and likewise signed, expressly provided that this writing was void \u201cunless attached to the Original Will,\u201d and that according to the uncontradicted evidence it was not attached to the instrument dated November 13, 1941, which the appellants contended is the \u201cOriginal Will\u201d referred to, or to any other purported will.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">The material part of Code, section 5229, is as follows: \u201cNo will shall be valid unless it be in writing and signed by the testator, or by some other person in his presence and by his direction, in such manner as to make it manifest that the name is intended as a signature; * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">This statute has been before this court in numerous cases. Minor on Real Property, 2d Ed., section 1160, pp. \u25a01548, 1549, correctly states the rule deducible from our decisions: \u201cUnder the statute it is essential that a holograph will, like any other, be signed by the testator \u2018in such a manner as to make it <em>manifest </em>that the name is <em>intended as a signaturef </em>and therefore, in the absence of any affirmative evidence on the face of the paper that it is intended as a. signature, the testator\u2019s name appearing at the commencement or in the body of the will is not a sufficient signature.\u201d See <em>Ramsey </em>v. Ramsey, 13 Gratt (54 Va.) 664, 670, 70 Am. Dec. 438; <em>Warwick </em>v. <em>Warwick, </em>86 Va. 596, 603, 10 S. E. 843, 6 L. R. A. 775.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">In <em>Ramsey </em>v. <em>Ramsey, supra, </em>the holographic paper commenced: \u201cI, Thomas Ramsey of Charlotte, do hereby make my last will and testament in manner and form following:\u201d After directing the payment of his debts, and disposing of his est\u00e1te, the paper concluded by appointing an executor and stating the intention of \u201chereby revoking all other and former wills or testaments by me heretofore made, this sixteenth of July, 1855.\u201d It was held that the insertion of the author\u2019s name in the opening paragraph was not a proper signature, and hence the writing should not have been admitted to probate 'by the lower court.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">In Warwick v. <em>Warwick, supra, </em>the holographic writing began, \u201cI, Abraham Warwick, Jr., of the county of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>Henrico, declare this to be my last will and testament,\u201d and undertook to dispose of the author\u2019s estate. The paper was not otherwise signed, and was folded and enclosed in an envelope marked \u201cMy Will\u2014Abraham Warwick, Jr.\u201d We held that neither the insertion of the name at the beginning of the instrument, which was denominated \u201can equivocal act,\u201d nor the signature on the back of the envelope-, complied with the statute. It was there said (86 Va., at page 603): \u201cThe signing required by the statute must manifestly appear to be intended as a signature from the face of the instrument, which must appear, by internal evidence, equally convincing as the signing at the foot or end; that it must be manifest. The finality of the testamentary intent must be ascertained from the face of the paper, and extrinsic evidence is not admissible either to prove or disprove it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\"> It is true that we have held that the signature need-not appear at the foot or end of the instrument, provided the paper shows on its face that the name placed in the writing was intended as a signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">In <em>Dinning </em>v. <em>Dinning, </em>102 Va. 467, 46 S. E. 473, the concluding sentence was: \u201cI, William Dinning, say this is</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">my last will and testament.\u201d It was held that the name was intended as a signature and that this intent was not destroyed by the addition of the last eight words.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">In <em>Murguiondo </em>v. <em>Nowlan, </em>115 Va. 160, 78 S. E. 600, a typewritten will, consisting of several sheets of paper, was not signed at the end in the usual place, opposite the word \u201cSeal\u201d and intended for the signature. The testator affixed her signature to the margin of the last page, \u201cnearly opposite the end of the will,\u201d in the presence of the attesting witnesses. It was held that the instrument had been properly signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">In <em>Forrest </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>146 Va. 734, 133 S. E. 69, a will was written on one side of a single sheet of note paper and filled the entire page, leaving no room for the signature. It bore the testator\u2019s signature on the reverse side, which was held to be sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">In <em>Presbyterian Orphans\u2019 Home </em>v. <em>Bowman, </em>165 Va. 484, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>182 S. E. 551, a non-holographic will was signed by the testator at the end of the attestation clause and just ahead of the signatures of the attesting witnesses. This was held to be- a sufficient signature.</p>\n<p id=\"A_X\">But, as was said in <em>Forrest </em>v. <em>Turner, supra (146 </em>Va., at page 745), there must be a concurrence of the <em>animus iestandi </em>and the <em>animus signandi\u2014th.2.t </em>is, the intention to make a will and the intention to sign the instrument as and for a will. And as Judge Prentis pointed out in <em>Meany </em>v. <em>Priddy, </em>127 Va. 84, 85, 102 S. E. 470: \u201cNo mere intention or effort to dispose of property by will, however clearly and definitely expressed in writing, is sufficient; such purpose must be executed in the only manner authorized by the statute, that is, the writing itself must be authenticated by the signature of the decedent. It is not sufficient to raise \u2022a doubt as to whether his name is intended to authenticate the paper which is propounded as a will, for, to use the explicit language of the statute, it must, be signed \u2018in such manner as to make it manifest that the name is intended' as his signature,\u2019 and unless so signed it is not valid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">The appellants do not dispute these principles, but their contention is that the writing of November. 13, 1941, shows on its face that the name \u201cDr. Robert Edward Hamlet\u201d was' placed at the beginning of the second paragraph as a signature to the' instrument. They stress the fact that the name is in the second and not in the opening paragraph. We are not impressed with this argument. The first paragraph is merely the author\u2019s explanation for rewriting his will. The second paragraph, in which the name is inserted, is that usually employed in the commencement of a will, and we have several times held that the placing of the name there does not of itself indicate that it was intended.as a signature. <em>Ramsey </em>v. <em>Ramsey, supra; Warwick </em>v. <em>Warwick, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">It is next said that the insertion of the name in the second paragraph was intended as a signature because the writing consumes the entire second page, leaving insufficient space for a signature. This argument would have been more ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>propriate if there had been a signature on the back of the second page, or on a third detached page. Compare, <em>Forrest </em>v. <em>Turner, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">The next to the last sentence of the writing is: \u201cThis Will is in my own handwriting, done by me of Good &amp; Sound mind, on this 13 th day of November 1941-\u201d It is argued that the word \u201cdone\u201d means concluded or ended, and denotes a finality to the writing even though there be no signature at the end. In our opinion it is more likely that what the author meant was that the act of reducing his testamentary wishes to writing was \u201cdone\u201d\u2014that is, carried out or performed by him\u2014while he was in \u201cGood &amp; Sound mind.\u201d In other words, his purpose was to declare his soundness of mind rather than his intent to authenticate or sign the instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">We find nothing on the face of the paper to indicate that the insertion of the author\u2019s name at the beginning of the second paragraph takes it out of the rule laid down in <em>Ramsey </em>v. <em>Ramsey, supra, </em>and <em>Warwick </em>v. <em>Warwick, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">On the contrary, we think there are indications in the paper that the name was not placed there for his signature. Except for the change of his place of residence from Farm-ville to Pamplin, the language used in the second paragraph, in which the appellants say the name was intended as a signature, is the same as that employed in the opening paragraph of the typewritten will, which Dr. Hamlet knew must be signed and which he in fact did sign at the end.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">Again, in the opening paragraph he states that his \u201cother Wills\u201d had been \u201cexamined by a Lawyer who stated that they contained some flaws, &amp; at his suggestion &amp; advice I am hereby writing this one in my own handwriting, * * * .\u201d As the trial court, in its written opinion, aptly said: \u201cCertainly no attorney would advise him to sign a will in that manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">Then, too, the fact that he was careful to sign the writings of June 1 and September 4, 1943, although they were in his own handwriting, would indicate that he appreciated the necessity for his signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>Furthermore, the writing indicates that the author was a man of business experience, and one who had accumulated considerable real and personal property. He disposes of his \u201cfarms in Prince Edward County,\u201d his \u201ctwo houses &amp; lots on Pine Street\u201d in Farmville, and his \u201cReal Estate at Pamplin, Va.\u201d He is bound to have known that the instruments by which he 'acquired these various properties were signed at the end in each instance by the former owner. It is hardly -likely that he would have thought that an instrument such as a will, in which he was disposing of all of these properties, should have been executed in a less formal and entirely dissimilar manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">In our opinion, the trial court correctly held that the instrument of November 13, 1941, was not signed in the manner required by the statute. Code, sec. 5229. While the <em>animus, testandi </em>(the intention to make a will) is clear, the necessary <em>animus signandi </em>(the intention to sign) the instrument relied on is lacking. See <em>Forrest </em>v. <em>Turner, supra; Meany </em>v. <em>Priddy, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">It is next contended that even though the paper of November 13, 1941,-was not properly signed in the manner required by the-statute, yet the writing dated June 1, 1943, which was properly signed, \u201cconstituted or effected [a]republication\u201d of-the earlier instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">It is, of course, true that a duly executed codicil may have the' effect of establishing a will which has not been duly executed. <em>Hatcher </em>v. <em>Hatcher, </em>80 Va. 169; Graves on Real Property, sec. 86. But, in order to accomplish this, the will sought to be \u201crepublished\u201d must be clearly identified, and, if. the codicil is to be effective upon a condition, .such condition must be met.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">In the case at bar there is nothing to indicate that the writing of Nov-ember 13, 1941, is the \u201cOriginal Will\u201d referred to in the writing of June 1, 1943. Moreover, on the reverse side of the sheet bearing the writing of June 1, 1943, there is the plain and unequivocal direction and condition, signed by Dr. Hamlet and dated September 4, 1943, that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>\u201cThis is no good, (Void) unless attached to the Original Will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">As has been pointed out, when found, the writing of June 1, 1943, was not attached to that of November 13, 1941. It was not in the envelope or \u201cgrip\u201d which contained the instrument of the earlier date. It was even found in another room.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">The appellants lay much emphasis on the fact that there are marks on the two papers which, they say, indicate that the writings had been attached by a clip and. folded together. But the trial court who saw and heard the witnesses testify, and itself examined the documents, found fhis issue of fact against the appellants. From our inspection of the papers we cannot say that this finding is wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">But even if it be assumed that the writing of November 13, 1941, is the \u201cOriginal Will\u201d referred to in the later instrument, and that the two were at one time- attach\u00e9d and folded together, they were not so at the time of Dr. Hamlet\u2019s death, which alone would have satisfied the condition upon which the efficacy of the codicil was based.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">On the whole we find no error in tfie judgment complained of, and it is</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">Browning, J., dissenting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
