Cruz, an employee of Alphonse Custodis Chimney Construction Company, was killed at Hampton, Virginia, as the result of an accident which arose out of and in the course of his employment. A claim for partial dependency was filed with the Industrial Commission by Juan Cruz Molina, the father of the decedent, who was at the time of the accident a resident and citizen of Puerto Rico, where he was born in 1896, and where, except <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>for. a period of several months in 1918, he has continuously resided.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">Section 39 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Michie\u2019s Code of 1942, sec. 1887(39) ) provides: \u201cIf the employee does not leave dependent, citizens of and residing at the time of the accident in the United States or Dominion of Canada, the amount of compensation shall not in any case exceed one thousand dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">After a hearing the Industrial Commission found that at the time of the accident the claimant was a citizen of and resided \u201cin the United States\u201d within the meaning of this section, and made an award on the ground of partial dependency in excess of $1,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">The employer and insurance carrier, who prosecute this appeal, admit that .at the time of the accident the claimant, by reason of an act of Congress to which we will later refer, was a citizen of the United States, but they contend that he was not then \u201cresiding # # # in the United States\u201d within the meaning of section 39 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. Hence, they say, the award to him should not have been in excess of $i,ooo.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">Code, sec. 5, provides: <em>\u201cRules of Construction.\u2014Itl </em>the construction of this Code, and of all statutes, the following rules shall be observed, unless such construction would be inconsistent with the manifest intent of the legislature:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-8\">\u201cFirst, \u2018State,\u2019 \u2018United States.\u2019\u2014The word \u2018State,\u2019 when applied tQ a part of the United' States, shall be construed to extend to and include the District of Columbia and the several territories so-called, and the words \u2018United States\u2019 shall be construed to include the said district and territories; <em>* * * \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">While this statutory\" definition antedates the enact<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>ment of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, it in terms applies to \u201call statutes.\u201d Moreover, it is a familiar rule of statutory construction that subsequent legislation is enacted in light and with knowledge of such interpretive statutes, and hence the latter control unless there be a clear legislative intent to substitute a different interpretation. Sutherland on Statutory Construction, 3d Ed., Vol. 2, sec. 3003, pp. 224, 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">Therefore, if Puerto Rico is one of the \u201cterritories\u201d referred to in Code, sec. 5, it is a part of the \u201cUnited States\u201d as defined by that section, and its citizens and residents are citizens and residents of the United States within the meaning of section 39 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">The island of Puerto Rico (then called Porto Rico) was ceded to the United States by Spain by the Treaty of December 10, 1898 (30 Stat. 1754), which terminated the Spanish-American War. By Act of April 12, 1900, ch. 191 (31 Stat. 77; U. S. Comp. Stats., sec. 3747 <em>ff.), </em>and by the later Act of March 2, 1917, ch. 145 (39 Stat. 951; 48 U. S. C. A., sec. 731 ff.), Congress set up for the island a government \u201csimilar to that of the States and Territories.\u201d <em>Gromer </em>v. <em>Standard Dredging Co., </em>224 U. S. 362, 370, 32 S. Ct. 499, 56 L. Ed. 801. It has a governor appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate' of the United States, and various executive departments; a Senate and House of Representatives elected by the people; and a Supreme Court whose members are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate of the United States. There is a \u201cResident Commissioner to the United States,\u201d elected by popular vote, who represents the island in the United States House of Representatives, with a voice, but no vote therein. The island has a United States District Court and is in the First Judicial Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Under section 5 of the Act of March 2, 1917 (39 Stat. 953; 8 U. S. C. A., sec. 5), \u201cAll citizens of Puerto Rico, * * * are declared, and shall be deemed and held to be, citizens of the United States; # * * .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">The status of Puerto Rico and the applicability thereto of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>certain provisions of the Constitution and statutes of the United States have been before the Supreme Court in a number of cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">In <em>De Dima </em>v. <em>Bidwell, </em>182 U. S. 1, 21 S. Ct. 743, 45 L. Ed. 1041 (decided in 1901), it was held that with the ratification of the Treaty of Peace between the United States and Spain, the island ceased to be ,a \u201cforeign country\u201d within the meaning of the tariff laws of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">In <em>Downes </em>v. <em>Bidwell, </em>182 U. S. 244, 21 S. Ct. 770, 45 L. Ed. 1088 (likewise decided in 1901), it was held that the island was not a part of the United States within Article I, sec. 8, of the Constitution requiring duties, imposts and excises to be uniform \u201cthroughout the United States.\u201d In the latter case, in a concurring opinion written by Mr. Justice White, and in which two' of the other Justices joined, the view was advanced that while the island was territory \u201cbelonging to the United States,\u201d it had not been \u201cincorporated into\u201d the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">In <em>Balzac </em>v. <em>People of Porto Rico, </em>258 U. S. 298, 304, 305, 42 S. Ct. 343, 66 L. Ed. 627 (decided in 1922), the view advanced by Mr. Justice White was adopted as the unanimous view<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the members of the court. In this case it was held that since the island was territory, \u201cbelonging to the United States,\u201d but not incorporated into the Union, the provisions of the Sixth and Seventh Amendments to the Federal Constitution, securing the right of trial by jury, did not apply to judicial proceedings therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">In the later case of <em>People of Puerto Rico </em>v. <em>Shell Co., </em>302 U. S. 253, 257, 58 S. Ct. 167, 169, 82 L. Ed. 235, while the court adhered to the view that Puerto Rico was territory which had not been incorporated into the Union, it was held \u25a0 that it was a \u201cterritory of the United States\u201d within the meaning of section 3 of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act (15 U. S. C. A., sec. 3). In reaching that conclusion the-court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>quoted-with approval (302 U. S., at page 258) its former holding in <em>Kopel </em>v. <em>Bingham, 211 </em>U. S. <em>468, </em>476, 29 S. Ct. 190, 53 L. Ed. 286, \u201cthat Porto Rico i's a completely organized territory, although not a territory incorporated into the United States, # * * .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">In <em>Kopel </em>v. <em>Bingham, supra, </em>it was held that Puerto Rico was a territory within the meaning of section 5278 of the Revised Statutes (18 U. S. C. A., sec. 662),- which provides for the demand and surrender of fugitive criminals by the governor of \u201cany State or Territory.\u201d There it was also held (211 U. S., at pages 474, 475) that the island came within this definition of a territory: \u201cA portion of the country not included within the limits of any State, and not yet admitted as a State into the Union, but organized under the laws of Congress with a separate legislature, under a territorial governor and other officers appointed by the President and Senate of the\" United States.\u201d This holding was approved in' <em>People of Puerto Rico </em>v. <em>Shell Co., supra </em>(302 U. S., at pages 258, 259).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">While the Supreme Court has distinguished between a \u201cterritory\u201d which has been incorporated into the United States and one which merely belongs thereto, there is no indication that the word' is used in a restricted sense in section 5 of the Code of Virginia. \u2022 Indeed, the reference in that section to \u201cthe several'territories so-called\u201d would indicate that the word is not to be given a limited or technical meaning. According to Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, \u201cso-called\u201d means, \u201cCommonly named; thus termed; \u2014 implying doubt as to the correctness or propriety of so designating the person or thing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\"> In our opinion, since Puerto Rico is \u201ca completely organized territory,\u201d whose citizens \u00e1re citizens of the United States, it is one of the \u201cterritories\u201d referred to as being embraced within the words \u201cUnited States,\u201d as defined in Code, sec. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">It, therefore, follows that the Industrial Commission was correct in the view that the claimant was a citizen and resi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>dent of the \u201cUnited States\u201d within the meaning of section 39 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">The award compl\u00e1ined of provides that, \u201cIn addition to the award of dependency, the defendant will pay the burial expenses as well as all court costs.\u201d It is assigned as error that the award failed to limit the amount of the \u201cburial expenses\u201d to $150.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Section 39 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act provides that in addition to benefits paid dependents, the employer shall pay, or cause to be paid, \u201cburial expenses not exceeding one hundred and fifty dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">From, the scant treatment of this assignment of error in both briefs, we take it that the point at issue is whether the cost of transporting the decedent\u2019s body to the place of interment is a part of the \u201cburial expenses\u201d which by the statute are limited to $150. In our opinion it is. In 21 Am. Jur., sec. 334, p. 571, the author says: \u201cThe cost of transporting the body from the place of death to the'place of burial is ordinarily regarded as an essential part of the funeral expense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">Moreover, there is nothing in the statute to indicate that the employer shall be liable for the cost of shch transportation if it be not included as a part of the \u201cburial expenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">Accordingly, the award should be modified to limit the amount of burial expenses, including the cost of transportation, to the amount fixed in the statute. With this modification the award is affirmed. The appellee, having substantially prevailed on this appeal, will recover his costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">\n<em>Modified and affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b584-10\">Acts 1918, ch. 400, p. 637, as amended by Acts 1920, ch. 176, p. 256; Acts 1922, ch. 427, p. 745; Acts 1924, ch. 318, p. 478; Acts 1926, ch. 7, p. 7; Acts 1930, ch. 54, p. 57; Acts 1938, ch. 249, p. 386; Acts 1942, ch. 66, p. 61.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b584-11\"> While the workmen\u2019s compensation statutes of several of the States contain similar provisions, a diligent search reveals no reported case on the precise question here involved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b586-8\"> For an interesting recital of -the various steps by which the Supreme Court arrived at this view, see \u201cThe Evolution o\u00a3 the Doctrine of Territorial Incorporation,\u201d 26 Columbia Law Review, p. 823, by Frederick R.
