He was charged jointly in one indictment, with Francis U. Wright, with robbery through the use of firearms, and in the other indictment he was charged jointly with Wright with an attempted murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-13\">The following is disclosed by the record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-14\">\u201cCommonwealth of Virginia vs. Granville Lee Harmon &amp; Francis U. Wright.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-16\">\u201c(Indictment for a felony\u2014A True Bill, G. W. Sanders, Foreman).\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>\u201cCommonwealth of Virginia vs. Granville Lee Harmon &amp; Francis U. Wright.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-6\">\u201c(Indictment for a felony\u2014A True Bill, G. W. Sanders, Foreman).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">On December 10, 1936, the order of the court discloses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-8\">. * The prisoners were led to the bar * * and being arraigned, tendered in person, in open court, a plea of guilty to the indictment. * * Therefore, it is considered by the court that said Granville Lee Harmon and Francis U. Wright, prisoners aforesaid, be confined in the penitentiary for their respective lives # * .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-10\">The last order was entered at the January, 1937, term of the court, in which a <em>nolle prosequi </em>was entered as to one of the indictments. The record discloses this memorandum:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-11\">\u201cCom. of Virginia vs. (Felony\u2014Nolle Pros.) Granville Lee Harmon &amp; Francis U. Wright.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-14\">The contention of the petitioner is that there were two indictments charging separate and distinct offenses against him; that the penalties for each were different; the maximum penalty for the robbery indictment being death, and the maximum penalty for the attempted murder indictment being ten years in the penitentiary; that the record fads to disclose upon which of the indictments the petitioner was sentenced and upon which was entered the <em>nolleoprosequi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b486-15\">The Attorney General in his brief has made this clear statement of the case, in which we concur:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-16\">\u201cTwo indictments were returned in the present case:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-17\">\u201c(1) Robbery through the use of firearms; and (2) Attempted Murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-18\">\u201cThe offense of robbery through the use of firearms was punishable in 1936 and still is by \u2018death, or by confinement in the penitentiary for life, or for any term not less than eight years.\u2019 (Section 4405 of the Code of Virginia.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>\u201cThe offense of attempted murder was punishable in 1936, and still is, as follows: \u2018If the offense attempted be punishable with death, the person making such attempt shall be confined in the penitentiary not less than one nor more than ten years; * * * .\u2019 (Section 4767 of the Code of Virginia.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-5\">\u201cIn the final order in the present case (Exhibit F), the punishment was fixed at fife imprisonment. This punishment is responsive to the indictment for robbery and is not responsive to the indictment for attempted murder, therefore it is submitted that the order, when read in connection with the entire record, is not void and that the court had jurisdiction to enter it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-6\">\u201cIn 39 C. J. S., p. 485, title \u2018Habeas Corpus\u2019, sec. 26 (2), it is stated:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-7\"> \u201c \u2018Where sentence is imposed on conviction under several indictments or counts, habeas corpus will not lie if the sentence is authorized under any indictment or any count or counts, * * * .\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">\u201cAs has been submitted before, the order is not void on its face simply because it fails to designate the offense. Under the circumstances, viz., that two indictments were pending, it would have been better practice for the order to have designated the offense, e. g., robbery, but a mere omission to do so will not render the judgment void. Mere irregularities or omissions in the judgment will not render it void.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\"> \u201c t# # # The writ does not lie where the judgment is merely voidable by reason of errors of law or of fact, omissions, or other irregularities, no matter how numerous or flagrant they may be, at least where the law provides a remedy by appeal or writ of error to obtain their correction. The sole question involved is that of jurisdiction\u2014that is, the question as to whether the court had jurisdiction of the person of the petitioner and of the subject matter and, according to the prevailing view, power to render the particular judgment.\" A judgment rendered by a court without jurisdiction in either of these particulars may be assailed by a writ of habeas corpus, and the prisoner may be either discharged or remanded to custody for a proper sentence. Conversely, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>it seems well settled that where the court has jurisdiction of the person and the subject matter of a prosecution, and the punishment is of the character prescribed by law, habeas corpus will not lie for the release of a prisoner because of mere errors, irregularities, and defects in the sentence. <em>* </em>* *\u2019 (25 Am. Jur. pp. 185-186, Habeas Corpus, sec. 55.)\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">The judgment in the case at bar recites that the accused entered a plea of guilty <em>to the indictment. </em>There were only two indictments to which this plea could have referred. As we have seen, the punishment actually imposed was life imprisonment. This punishment could not have been meted out upon the indictment for attempted murder. The punishment inflicted was responsive only to the indictment for robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\"> No objection was made to the sentence and no writ of error was prosecuted. \u2022 Eight years have elapsed since the sentence was imposed, and it would seem, in the absence of a showing to the contrary, that a conclusive presumption may be indulged against the petitioner to the effect that he knew that he was tried and punished on the robbery indictment and is now in custody for that offense. It is too late to assert that the judgment is invalid and void. The court had jurisdiction of the person and of the offense at the time the judgment was entered. An inspection of the entire record will force one to conclude that the accused plead guilty to the indictment for robbery, and that it was the intent of the court to sentence him upon that indictment, and not to sentence him upon the indictment for attempted murder. The burden was upon the petitioner to show that the court lacked jurisdiction to enter the order. This burden he has failed to carry. Before an order of this nature may be taken advantage of by habeas corpus proce\u00e9ding it must be void upon its face. To be voidable alone is not sufficient. If it were only voidable it' could have been corrected upon a writ of error. Habeas corpus is not to be substituted for a writ of error. <em>Hanson </em>v. <em>Smyth, ante, </em>p. 384, 32 S. E. (2d) 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">No prejudice or injustice has been done the petitioner. The death penalty might have been inflicted for his offense. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>He will not be permitted \u201cto acquiesce in the error of the court, if it were error,\u201d for eight years and then free himself from the balance of his sentence on an irregularity. <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>Youell, </em>179 Va. 442, 19 S. E. (2d) 705.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">The discharge from custody is denied and the petitioner remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">\n<em>Discharge denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
