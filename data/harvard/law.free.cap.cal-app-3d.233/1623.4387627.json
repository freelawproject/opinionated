Judgment was entered after defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment were granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-6\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-7\">Plaintiff, a minor, suffered serious injury to her left hand, which was crushed when the vehicle in which she was a passenger rolled over after striking the berm on the right-hand shoulder of Desert Front Road.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1068-8\">Plaintiff sued County, CSA70, the Oaks Spring Valley Road Commission and several individual advisory road commissioners for \u201cNegligent Road Maintenance,\u201d negligence, and dangerous condition of public property to recover for injuries she sustained in the motor vehicle accident which took place on October 15, 1987, on Desert Front Road in an unincorporated area of County near Victorville. Plaintiff alleged that County \u201cso negligently owned, leased, operated, controlled, designed, maintained, repaired, graded, supervised and managed Desert Front Road as to create and maintain it in a dangerous and hazardous condition that when said roadway was used as it was intended to be used it was dangerous, hazardous and unsafe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-9\">County and CSA70 answered, denying generally the allegations of the complaint and raising numerous affirmative defenses, including public entity immunities pursuant to numerous Government Code sections.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Particularly relevant to this appeal was defendants\u2019 reliance on the immunity provision in Government Code section 831.3, as to which they specifically alleged that Nplaintiff\u2019s injuries \u201coccurred on account of the grading or the performance of other maintenance or repair on or reconstruction or replacement of roads <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number>which had not officially been accepted as part of the road system under the jurisdiction of the County, and such work was performed with reasonable care and left the roads in no more dangerous or unsafe condition than they were before the work commenced; and that by reason of the premises defendants are immune from liability herein under the provision of Government Code Section 831.3.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-4\">Defendants also raised as an affirmative defense an exemption from liability under Streets and Highways Code section 941, alleging that the road in question, at the time of plaintiff\u2019s injury, had not been accepted into the county-maintained road system by a resolution of the board of supervisors \u201cor otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-5\">In April, 1989, about six months after filing its answer, County moved for summary judgment on the grounds that \u201cthe moving party did not own, possess, or control Desert Front Road, including that portion of Desert Front Road which is approximately 1.3 miles north of State Route (SR) 2, as of the date of the alleged accident, nor had defendant at any time accepted Desert Front Road into i[t]s maintained road system as defined by Streets and Highways Code section 941.\u201d In support of its motion, County filed a separate statement of undisputed material facts, which it contended included \u201cevery essential element to entitle this defendant to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d The facts alleged as undisputed were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1069-6\">\u201cUndisputed Fact No. 1:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1069-7\">\u201cThat plaintiff, . . . suffered bodily injuries as a result of a single-vehicle accident which occurred on October 15, 1987, at 1897 Desert Front Road, which is located approximately 1.3 miles north of State Route (SR) 2, near the community of Wrightwood, and in an unincorporated area of the County of San Bernardino.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1069-8\">\u201cProof:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1069-9\">\u201cUndisputed Fact No. 2:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1069-10\">\u201cThat Desert Front Road, including that portion of Desert Front Road which is located approximately 1.3 miles north of State Route (SR) 2, is not, and at all times relevant to this motion was not, owned or controlled by the County of San Bernardino.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1069-11\">\u201cProof:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1044\">*1044</page-number>\u201cDeclaration of Fred V.

Contaoi.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1070-8\">County\u2019s memorandum of points and authorities in support of its motion pointed out that under government tort law, its liability was strictly statutory; that under Government Code section 830, it could be held liable for a dangerous condition of public property only if it owned or controlled the property in question; that Fred V. Contaoi, Assistant Director of the Transportation Department for San Bernardino County, had declared that County did not possess, own, control, design, maintain or repair the road in question; and that the road in question had never been accepted into County\u2019s system of roads. Therefore, because of lack of ownership or control, County could not be liable to plaintiff. In addition, even if County did own or control the subject portion of Desert Front Road, it was not liable to plaintiff on the theory of dangerous condition or negligent maintenance, because the road had never been accepted into its road system, and, therefore, it was exempt under Streets and Highways Code section 941.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-9\">County\u2019s motion for summary judgment was initially set for hearing in June 1989. Apparently no hearing was then held, nor did plaintiff file opposition to the motion at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-10\">In October 1989, CSA70 filed its own motion for summary judgment, on the grounds that (1) the road in question had never been accepted into the system of county roads, and therefore CSA70 and County were both immune from liability under Streets and Highways Code section 941; and (2) CSA70 is a part of County and not a legal entity capable of being sued.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-11\">CSA70 filed a separate statement of undisputed material facts in support of its motion. In addition to reiterating some of the facts set forth in County\u2019s separate statement of undisputed facts, CSA70\u2019s statement of undisputed facts stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-12\">\u201cUndisputed Fact No. 3:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1071-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1045\">*1045</page-number>\u201cThat [CSA70] was formed in 1971 by the Board of Supervisors of the County of San Bernardino to provide road services within the Improvement Zone Area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1071-4\">\u201cProof:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1071-5\">\u201cAttached Resolution of the Board of Supervisors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1071-6\">\u201cUndisputed Fact No. 4:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1071-7\">\u201cThat [CSA70] is a part of the County of San Bernardino and is not a separate entity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1071-8\">\u201cProof:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1071-9\">\u201cExhibit \u2018D,\u2019 p. 8, lines 16-19.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1071-10\">Exhibit \u201cD\u201d was pages from the deposition of Jeffrey Rigney, the supervisor of administrative services for County.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-11\">CSA70\u2019s motion for summary judgment was set for hearing on December 20, 1989. On December 20, 1989, plaintiff filed her opposition to County\u2019s and CSA70\u2019s motions for summary judgment and a separate statement in opposition to County\u2019s and CSA70\u2019s statements of undisputed material facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-12\">Plaintiff, via her separate statement, agreed that she had been injured on the road in question, but disputed the contention that the road had never been admitted into the system of county roads, citing as proof the declarations of Frank Goossen, Anne Nolan and Eugene W. Comroe, a resolution of the board of supervisors, the deposition of Peter Sherburne, and the deposition of Jeffrey Rigney. She agreed that CSA70 had been created in 1971 to provide road services in the improvement zone area, but disputed the contention that CSA70 was not a legal entity separate from the county, citing as proof the same evidence noted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-13\">The evidence presented by plaintiff in opposition to both motions, when summarized, showed that (1) in 1971, the board of supervisors passed a resolution approving the formation of CSA70 with the intention to provide road services within such area and to assess the cost of such services against the property owners in that zone; (2) CSA70 was given the power to maintain the road by the county board of supervisors; (3) County, through its office of special districts, hires contractors to grade or maintain such roads; (4) CSA70 received about $3,000 in taxes every year; and (5) Mike Spies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1046\">*1046</page-number>Construction Company (Spies) had been hired in 1987 for $7,000, to maintain the road in question and, as of May 9, 1989 (the date of Anne Nolan\u2019s declaration) had, in fact, graded it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1072-4\">Plaintiff presented no evidence of a resolution by the County accepting Desert Front Road or the subject portion into the county road system.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-5\">Also on December 20, both defendants filed a joint reply to plaintiff\u2019s opposition. The minute order for December 20 shows that both defendants\u2019 motions were heard and granted. The formal order for entry of summary judgment in favor of CSA70 and County notes that the trial court fully considered the moving and responding papers, that \u201cthe action has no merit,\u201d that plaintiff \u201chas presented no triable issues of fact,\u201d and that judgment is ordered to be entered in favor of defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-7\">A. <em>County\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1072-8\">Although County\u2019s motion for summary judgment was based in part on its contention that it neither owned nor controlled the road in question, and, consequently, was not liable to plaintiff on the theory of dangerous condition of public property, plaintiff clearly produced sufficient evidence to create a triable issue of fact as to County\u2019s control of the relevant portion of the subject road on October 15, 1987.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is therefore apparent that County\u2019s motion was granted because the trial court concluded that, even assuming County did exercise control over the road, (1) the road had never been accepted into the county road system, and (2) Streets and Highways Code section 941 absolutely immunized County from liability for injuries and damages caused by its failure to maintain any road which has not been officially accepted into the county road system.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-9\">Streets and Highways Code section 941 now provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1072-10\">\u201c(a) Boards of supervisors shall, by proper order, cause those highways which are necessary to public convenience to be established, recorded, constructed, and maintained in the manner provided in this division.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1073-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1047\">*1047</page-number>\u201c(b) No public or private road shall become a county highway until and unless the board of supervisors, or its designee, by appropriate action, has caused the road to be accepted into the county road system. <em>No county shall be held liable for failure to maintain any road unless and until it has been accepted into the county road system by action of the board of supervisors or its designee.\" </em>(Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1073-4\">Section 941 of the Streets and Highways Code was amended, effective January 1, 1989, by Statutes 1988, chapter 132, section 1.5, page 509. This amendment allowed a road to be accepted into the county road system by the board of supervisors <em>or </em>the board\u2019s designee, and also provided, in keeping with that change, that the road could be accepted by appropriate <em>action, </em>as opposed to only by way of a resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-5\">But, in 1987, at the time of plaintiff\u2019s accident, the road in question could only have been accepted into the county\u2019s road system by the board of supervisors, and only by way of a resolution. County contends, having established that no such resolution of acceptance was ever passed, that the road was never accepted and that it can never be liable for injuries occurring on an unaccepted road.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-6\">However, County\u2019s reliance on Streets and Highways Code section 941, which simply precludes liability for <em>failure to maintain </em>unaccepted roads, does not consider the effect of Government Code section 831.3, which specifically excludes from immunity any act of grading, reconstruction, replacement, maintenance or repair to unaccepted roads <em>if </em>such work was <em>not </em>done with reasonable care and <em>if </em>such work left the road in a more dangerous or unsafe condition than it was in before the work commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-7\">Section 831.3 is found in chapter 2, \u201cDangerous Conditions of Public Property\u201d of division 3.6, \u201cClaims and Actions Against Public Entities and Public Employees\u201d of the Government Code. It was added by Statutes 1981, chapter 260, section 1, page 1337, and amended again in 1986 (with language not relevant here), and it provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1073-8\">\u201cNeither a public entity nor a public employee is liable for any injury occurring on account of the grading or the performance of other maintenance or repair on or reconstruction or replacement of any road which has not officially been accepted as a part of the road system under the jurisdiction of the public entity <em>if </em>the grading, maintenance, repair, or reconstruction or replacement is performed with reasonable care <em>and </em>leaves the road in no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1048\">*1048</page-number>more dangerous or unsafe condition than it was before the work commenced. . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1074-4\">In California Government Tort Liability Practice (Cont.Ed.Bar 1980) Professor Arvo Van Alstyne, after discussing the general principle that a public entity may be held liable for the dangerous condition of property which it either owns or controls (see <em>id. </em>at pp. 181-186), comments that \u201cIf the entity assumes actual responsibility for maintenance of an unaccepted street, it might be deemed \u2018public property\u2019 under the California Tort Claims Act, on the theory that the public entity has \u2018control\u2019 over it. [Citation.] However, the doctrine of acceptance by conduct (see . . . <em>Union Transp. Co. </em>v. <em>Sacramento </em>(1954) 42 Cal.2d 235, . . .) appears to have been abolished by statute. <em>(Benitez </em>v. <em>[City and County of] San Francisco </em>[(1978) 77 Cal.App.3d 918 (144 Cal.Rptr. 15)]. See 47 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 191 (1966).)\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 186-187.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-5\">Notably, County here cites <em>Benitez </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>(1978) 77 Cal.App.3d 918 [144 Cal.Rptr. 15] and 47 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 191 in support of its position that it is absolutely immune from liability for injuries and damages resulting from accidents occurring on unaccepted roads. However, in the October 1990 supplement to California Government Tort Liability Practice (Cont.Ed.Bar Supp. 1990) (hereafter Supp.), the Honorable Jeffrey T. Miller, the supplement\u2019s author, notes, as to this particular issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1074-6\">\u201cIn 1981, [Government Code section] 831.3 was enacted to provide for immunity from liability for injuries \u2018occurring on account of the grading or the performance of other maintenance or repair\u2019 work performed by a public entity on any road that has not been officially accepted as part of the entity\u2019s road system. The immunity, which extends to both public entities and public employees, is not absolute; it applies only if (1) the road work in question \u2018is performed with reasonable care,\u2019 and (2) the work leaves the road \u2018in no more dangerous or unsafe condition than it was before the work commenced.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1074-7\">\u201cWhile the wording of [Government Code section] 831.3 is broad enough to encompass injuries not arising out of dangerous conditions, its location in the Tort Claims Act and manifest intent is to restrict its application to cases under the Act. However, the qualifications attached to the immunity provided in this section appear to assume, without expressly so providing, that liability may properly be imposed when road work in question, although performed on private rights of way <em>(i.e., </em>roads not accepted as part of the public road system), is performed negligently or makes the road more dangerous than before. In this respect, [Government Code section] 831.3 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1049\">*1049</page-number>appears to be at least partially inconsistent with [Streets and Highways Code sections] 941 and 1806 . . . (Supp., <em>supra, </em>at p. 78.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1075-4\">Actually, however, Government Code section 831.3 is not inconsistent with Streets and Highways Code section 941. Section 941 states that a county is not liable for <em>failure to maintain </em>unaccepted roads, while section 831.3 merely states that <em>if </em>public entities perform an act of maintaining, grading or repairing unaccepted roads, they may be liable <em>if </em>the work is not done with reasonable care and <em>if </em>the work leaves the road in a more dangerous or unsafe condition than it was in before the work began. Simply stated, section 941 immunizes a county from any claimed nonfeasance regarding its lack of maintaining unaccepted roads. Section 831.3 addresses in part a public entity\u2019s misfeasance in its action of maintaining, grading or repairing an unaccepted road. Sections 941 and 831.3 are distinct. Each addresses different circumstances regarding the county\u2019s liability if it maintains or does not maintain unaccepted roads in the county. It is also noteworthy that section 941 is limited to counties, while section 831.3 includes all public entities as described in Government Code section 811.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-5\">Having concluded that County is not entitled to absolute immunity as a matter of law merely because the road in question was not officially accepted into the county road system, without regard to whether County graded or maintained such unaccepted road, we also conclude that County has not established sufficient nontriable issues of material fact to entitle it to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1050\">*1050</page-number>As the moving party, County was required either to show, based on nontriable issues of material fact, that plaintiff could not prevail as to any element of any cause of action properly presented by the pleadings, or to establish every element of an affirmative defense or defenses that would bar every cause of action in the complaint. <em>(DeRosa </em>v. <em>Transamerica Title Ins. Co. </em>(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1390, 1397 [144 Cal.Rptr. 15]; <em>Brejcha </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>Machinery, <em>Inc. </em>(1984) 160 Cal.App.3d 630 [206 Cal.Rptr. 688].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-4\">Here, County attempted to proceed on two grounds: (1) the affirmative defense of nonliability as to the allegation of dangerous condition of public property based on its lack of ownership and control of the subject road portion, pursuant to Government Code sections 835 and 830, subdivision (c), and (2) the affirmative defense of nonliability for damages and injuries incurred by users of unaccepted roads, based on Streets and Highways Code section 941.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-5\">As to County\u2019s affirmative defense to the dangerous condition allegations based on Government Code sections 835 and 830, subdivision (c), plaintiff produced evidence in opposition which was sufficient to raise a triable issue of material fact as to County\u2019s control of the road, thus preventing County from establishing as undisputed those facts necessary for a defense based on lack of ownership or control of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-6\">As to County\u2019s affirmative defense to the negligent maintenance and repair and dangerous condition allegations based on Streets and Highways Code section 941, <em>County </em>did not meet its <em>initial </em>burden of establishing all the undisputed facts necessary for such a defense. County produced uncontroverted evidence that the road had never been accepted into its road system so as to meet one requirement of the section 941 exemption from liability. However, County failed to produce any evidence that it had <em>failed </em>to maintain the road in question,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> so as to establish a complete defense pursuant to Streets and Highways Code section 941.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-7\">In light of plaintiff\u2019s uncontradicted evidence that County had maintained the subject portion of the road prior to the accident, County failed to produce any evidence that, to the extent it did maintain the road, \u201csuch work was performed with reasonable care and left the roads in \u00f1o more dangerous or unsafe condition than they were before the work commenced,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> so as to establish a defense pursuant to Government Code section 831.3 regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1051\">*1051</page-number>the complaint\u2019s allegation that it negligently repaired, graded and maintained the subject portion of Desert Front Road. Because County failed to meet its <em>initial </em>burden of producing evidence to support an affirmative defense under either Streets and Highways Code section 941 or Government Code section 831.3, plaintiff did not need to produce any evidence in opposition so as to be entitled to an order denying County\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-4\">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the trial court erred in granting County\u2019s summary judgment motion because there are triable issues of material fact whether the County\u2019s maintenance, repair or grading work on the subject road before October 15, 1987, was done with reasonable care and left the road in no more dangerous or unsafe condition than before the work began.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-5\">B. <em>CSA70\u2019s Motion for Summary </em>Judgment<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1077-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-7\">The judgment in favor of defendant County is reversed.

The court in <em>Benitez </em>concluded that by enacting Streets and Highways Code sections 941 and 1806, the Legislature intended to immunize cities and counties from liability for roads the dedication of which had never been <em>explicitly </em>accepted. (77 Cal.App.3d at pp. 920-922.) It also held that plaintiff, having failed to plead or prove equitable estoppel below, could not on appeal use the fact that the city had erected a street sign as a basis upon which to argue that the city was estopped from claiming it had not accepted the dedication of the road. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 922-923.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-8\">It is clear that nothing in Government Code section 831.3 undercuts either the holding that dedications may only be accepted expressly, not implicitly, or the holding that estoppel is a theory which must be pleaded and proved at the trial level, and may not be raised for the first time on appeal. Section 831.3 does not deal with methods or limitations regarding the acceptance of roadway dedications, nor with estoppel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1076-8\">Notably, County even alleged in one of its affirmative defenses that plaintiff\u2019s injuries \u201coccurred on account of the grading or the performance of other maintenance or repair on or reconstruction or replacement of roads which had not officially been accepted as part of the road system under the jurisdiction of the County, . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1076-9\">As <em>alleged </em>in defendants\u2019 affirmative defense based on Government Code section 831.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1077-9\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1623.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b1077-10\">Retired Associate Justice of the Court of Appeal, Fourth District, sitting under assignment by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
