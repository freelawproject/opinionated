On appeal, Nelson argues that his wages from a private sector job are not subject to federal taxation. Nelson also asserts that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to file a second amended complaint. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-18\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b704-19\">From 2002 to 2007, Nelson worked as an airline pilot for Northwest Airlines (\u201cNorthwest\u201d), a private sector company. Each year from 2002 to 2007, Northwest reported Nelson\u2019s pay as \u201cwages\u201d to the IRS on a W-2 form and withheld federal income and Federal Insurance Contribution Act (\u201cFICA\u201d) taxes. Nelson filed federal income tax returns or amended returns for 2002 to 2007. In his 2002 to 2007 returns, Nelson did not report any of the Northwest income as taxable and claimed refunds of $176,979.62, representing the federal income and FICA taxes that Northwest had withheld from his wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-20\">After receiving a tax refund from the IRS only for the year 2005, Nelson brought this 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7422 action in federal court seeking a refund of the taxes on his earnings from Northwest for the years 2002 to 2004, 2006, and 2007.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-21\">The district court denied Nelson\u2019s summary judgment motion on all of his tax refund claims and granted summary judgment in favor of the United States on Nelson\u2019s claims for 2003, 2004, and 2007, The district court dismissed Nelson\u2019s claims for 2002 and 2006 for lack of jurisdiction, and, in the alternative, granted summary judgment in favor of the United States on those claims. The court denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>Nelson\u2019s motion to file a second amended complaint, reasoning that his proposed second amended complaint merely re-asserted the claims in his first amended complaint and would be futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"ANh\">A. Taxable Income</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">On appeal, Nelson challenges the district court\u2019s ruling as to his 2003, 2004, and 2007 tax rend claims but not his 2002 and 2006 claims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, Nelson argues that private sector income is not taxable by the federal government because the definition of \u201cwages\u201d in the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3401(a), does not apply to income from private sector jobs that are unconnected to the federal government.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">Section 1 of the Internal Revenue Code imposes a tax on the \u201ctaxable income\u201d of every individual. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1(a) \u2014 (d); <em>see also </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101 (imposing FICA taxes on \u201cevery individual\u201d). \u201cTaxable income\u201d is defined as \u201cgross income minus the deductions allowed by this chapter.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 63(a). \u201c[G]ross income means all income from whatever source derived, including ... [cjompensation for services....\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 61(a)(1). In his amended complaint, Nelson concedes that Northwest paid him in exchange for his work as a pilot from 2002 to 2007 and reported that pay as \u201cwages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b705-11\">We have repeatedly rejected arguments, such as Nelson\u2019s, asserting that private sector employment income is not subject to federal taxation. <em>E.g., United States v. Morse, </em>532 F.3d 1130, 1132-33 (11th Cir.2008) (concluding that argument that individual\u2019s income is not subject to federal taxation because his income \u201cwas derived from employment in the private sector\u201d is \u201cutterly without merit\u201d and \u201cfrivolous\u201d) (quotation marks omitted); <em>Motes v. United States, </em>785 F.2d 928, 928 (11th Cir.1986) (rejecting argument that \u201conly public servants are subject to tax liability\u201d). Indeed, courts have imposed sanctions, even on <em>pro se </em>litigants, for raising such arguments. <em>See, e.g., Morse, </em>532 F.3d at 1133 (upholding sanctions against <em>pro se </em>defendant who raised defense that private sector income is not subject to federal taxation). Thus, Nelson\u2019s non-taxable-income argument is foreclosed by our precedent, and the district court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of the United States on Nelson\u2019s 2003, 2004, and 2007 refund claims.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-12\">Nelson\u2019s reliance on 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6051 does not help him because \u00a7 6051 does not impose a tax on Nelson, but instead provides only reporting requirements for his employer. In addition, courts consistently have rejected arguments like Nelson\u2019s that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3401(c) excludes private sector employees from federal taxation. <em>See, e.g., Sullivan v. United States, </em>788 F.2d 813, 815 (1st Cir.1986) (rejecting plaintiffs argument that he received no \u201cwages\u201d because he was not an \u201cemployee\u201d under \u00a7 3401(c), reasoning that \u00a7 3401(c) \u201cdoes not purport to limit withholding to the persons listed therein,\u201d and noting that \u00a7 3401(c) concerns income tax withholding); <em>United States v. Latham, </em>754 F.2d 747, 750 (7th Cir.1985) (upholding district court\u2019s refusal to give jury instruction that \u201cunder 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3401(c) the category of \u2018employee\u2019 does not include privately employed wage earners,\u201d noting this instruction was \u201cinane ... [and] a preposterous reading of the statute,\u201d and stating, \u201c[i]t is obvious that within the context of [\u00a7 3401(c) ] the word \u2018includes\u2019 is a term of enlargement not of limitation, and the reference to certain entities or categories is not intended to exclude all others\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">B. Motion to File Second Amended Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Nelson also argues that the district court should have granted his motion to file a second amended complaint.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Nelson\u2019s motion because it properly concluded Nelson\u2019s proposed second amendment would have been futile. Nelson\u2019s proposed second amended complaint contained no new claims for relief, merely restated the relevant facts as to the claims presented in Nelson\u2019s first amended complaint, and reiterated the legal arguments he already had presented in his motion for summary judgment. As such, the proposed second amended complaint contained nothing that would have altered the district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment in favor of the United States. <em>See Sibley v. Lando, </em>437 F.3d 1067, 1074 (11th Cir.2005) (concluding that proposed amended complaint, which added a transcript, would not change the fact that defendant was immune from suit, and thus amendment would be futile). And Nelson had already been given the opportunity to amend his original complaint once.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-11\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b706-12\">For all these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b704-14\">. For tax year 2005, the IRS initially issued Nelson a full refund but now contends that refund was issued in error. The IRS has now reversed its decision to refund Nelson for the 2005 tax year and determined Nelson owes $10,490.39 for that year.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b705-8\">. As to Nelson's 2002 and 2006 tax refund claims, the district court concluded it lacked jurisdiction. Because Nelson does not challenge the district court\u2019s ruling, he has waived his 2002 and 2006 claims. <em>See Horsley v. Feldt, </em>304 F.3d 1125, 1131 n. 1 (11th Cir.2002) (concluding issues not briefed on appeal by a <em>pro se </em>litigant are deemed abandoned).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">Nelson also raised a variety of arguments before the district court that he does not raise on appeal, including challenges to the constitutionality of the tax laws and of the particular taxes imposed on his pay. Because Nelson does not raise these arguments on appeal, he has waived them as well. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b705-14\">. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Martin v. Brevard Cray. Pub. Sch., </em>543 F.3d 1261, 1265 (11th Cir.2008). In doing so, \u201d[w]e draw all factual inferences in a light most favorable to the non-moving party,\u201d here, Nelson. <em>Shiver v. Chertoff, </em>549 F.3d 1342, 1343 (11th Cir.2008). Summary judgment should be granted if \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.RXiv.P. 56(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b706-6\">. This Court \"review[s] the denial of a motion to amend a complaint for abuse of discretion. The underlying legal conclusion of whether a particular amendment to the complaint would have been futile is review <em>de novo.\" Corsello v. Lineare, Inc., </em>428 F.3d 1008, 1012 (11th Cir.2005) (citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
