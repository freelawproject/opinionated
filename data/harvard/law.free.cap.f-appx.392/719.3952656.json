James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). Section 3582(c)(2) allows a district court to reduce the term of imprisonment of \u201ca defendant who has been sentenced ... based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines lowered the offense levels in \u00a7 2D1.1 for most crack cocaine offenses. <em>See United States v. Douglas, </em>576 F.3d 1216, 1218 (11th Cir.2009); <em>see also United States v. Smith, </em>568 F.3d 923, 926 (11th Cir.2009) (observing that \u201cAmendment 706 ... reduced by two levels the base offense level for crack cocaine sentences calculated pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)\u201d); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1339 (11th Cir.2008) (noting that \u201ca defendant whose original sentencing range was based on something other than \u00a7 2D1.1 is precluded from receiving a sentence reduction\u201d based on Amendment 706).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-14\">The district court concluded that Lyons was not eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because he qualified as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1, and therefore Amendment 706 did not lower the applicable guideline range. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327-28 (11th Cir.2008) (denying reduction for a defendant who was sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. (nl.(A)) (prohibiting reduction where \u201camendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline\u201d). Lyons contends that was error. He argues that his sentence was based on \u00a7 2D1.1 rather than \u00a7 4B1.1. Lyons asserts that the career offender enhancement applies only if the enhanced offense level is greater than the offense level that is otherwise applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>ble. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). Because his offense level was 32 under both \u00a7 4B1.1 and \u00a7 2D1.1, he argues that his sentence was based on the crack cocaine guidelines rather than the career offender guideline.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">The district court did not err in denying Lyon\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Even if Lyons\u2019 sentence was based on \u00a7 2D1.1 and Amendment 706 had reduced his offense level by two levels to 30, <em>see Smith, </em>568 F.3d.at 926, his guideline range would not change. Lyons would still face an offense level of 32 under the career offender guideline. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b) (providing that \u201cif the offense level for a career offender ... is greater than the offense level otherwise applicable, the [career offender] offense level ... shall apply\u201d). The district court lacked authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce Lyons\u2019 sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b743-15\">. Lyons also asks us to overturn <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008), but that decision can be overruled only by the en banc court or the Supreme Court. <em>See United States v. Hogan, </em>986 F.2d 1364, 1369 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
