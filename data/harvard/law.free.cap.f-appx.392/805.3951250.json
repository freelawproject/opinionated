California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Our independent review of the entire record reveals that counsel\u2019s assessment of the relative merit of the appeal is correct. The final judgment, however, contains a clerical error, in that it specifies that Holsey\u2019s conviction on Count Eleven is for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine, instead of cocaine base. Therefore, we REMAND IN PART WITH INSTRUCTIONS to correct the clerical error on the final judgment. In all other respects, however, independent examination of the entire record reveals no arguable issues of merit. Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is therefore GRANTED, and Holsey\u2019s convictions and sentences are AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
