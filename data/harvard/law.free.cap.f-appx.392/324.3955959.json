He contends that the sentence was greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and was therefore substantively unreasonable. Contreras-Agui-naga argues that his illegal reentry offense was not a crime of violence and was \u201cat bottom, an international trespass.\u201d Contreras-Aguinaga also maintains that his sentence fails to reflect his personal history and characteristics, including his motive for reentering the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">This court reviews the \u201csubstantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abdse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Contreras-Aguinaga\u2019s 46-month sentence, within the guidelines range, is presumed reasonable on appeal. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 530 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-16\">The district court considered Contreras-Aguinaga\u2019s request for a downward variance, and it ultimately determined that a sentence at the top of the guidelines range was appropriate based on the circumstances of the case and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Contreras-Aguinaga essentially seeks to have his sentence vacated based on a reweighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by this court. However, the fact that we \u201cmight reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. We have also rejected Contreras-Aguina-ga\u2019s \u201cinternational trespass\u201d argument. <em>See United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-17\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the 46-month within-guidelines sentence. <em>See id. </em>We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b347-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
