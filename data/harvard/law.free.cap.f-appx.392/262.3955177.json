Eysselinck, committed suicide while home on a leave of absence from his civilian job as a Task Leader for de-mining operations in Iraq. She sought death benefits under the Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, but her claim was denied at each administrative level. The district court also denied relief. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-19\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b285-20\">The decedent was responsible for the overall administration and training of certain personnel who would perform de-min-ing operation tasks in Iraq. This included defusing or rendering inoperable unexploded ordinance such as cluster bombs and improvised explosive devices. He re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>turned home on February 21, 2004 on a three-month leave of absence. On April 23, 2004, he committed suicide. Eyssel-inck claims entitlement to death benefits because the work-related stress and dangerous nature of the decedent\u2019s work caused him to suffer Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d) leading to an irresistible impulse to commit suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">These claims are brought under the procedures of the Longshore and. Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (\u201cLHWCA\u201d), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-50, as extended by the Defense Base Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1651-54. An Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) heard competing experts. Each expert reviewed records and witness interviews. Neither had interviewed the decedent, nor were there any contemporaneous medical treatment notes or records by a mental health care professional. Thus, each expert was making a retrospective diagnosis of whether the decedent suffered PTSD. The expert for the claimant stated the opinion that the decedent must have suffered from PTSD related to his working conditions because he could find no other cause. The other expert believed the available evidence failed to establish that the decedent suffered from PTSD. Rather, the decedent\u2019s act was due to a combination of non-work related stressors, including alcohol consumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The ALJ concluded that the expert who found insufficient support for a diagnosis of PTSD was more persuasive. The decedent was found to have willfully committed suicide, and benefits were denied. The Benefits Review Board (\u201cBRB\u201d) affirmed. The district court subsequently denied the petition for review of the BRB decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">Our review is of the BRB decision, not that of the district court. \u201c[A]ppellate court review need accord no particular deference to the district court\u2019s conclusion as to whether the identical administrative record does or does not support the administrative determination.... \u201d <em>H.B. Zachry Co. v. Quinones, </em>206 F.3d 474, 477 (5th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>La. Envtl. Soc\u2019y, Inc. v. Dole, </em>707 F.2d 116, 119 (5th Cir.1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">We examine the BRB decision \u201cto determine whether it has adhered to its proper scope of <em>review </em>\u2014 i.e., whether the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence and are consistent with the law.\u201d <em>Gulf Best Elec., Inc. v. Methe, </em>396 F.3d 601, 603 (5th Cir.2004) (citing <em>H.B. Zachry, </em>206 F.3d at 477).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">\u201cSubstantial evidence is that relevant evidence \u2014 more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance \u2014 that would cause a reasonable person to accept the fact finding.\u201d <em>Dir., Office of Worker\u2019s Comp. Programs, U.S. Dep\u2019t of Labor v. Ingalls Shipbuilding, Inc., </em>125 F.3d 303, 305 (5th Cir.1997). It is \u201cevidence that \u2018a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hall v. Consol. Emp\u2019t Sys., Inc., </em>139 F.3d 1025, 1029 (5th Cir.1998) (quoting <em>Pierce v. Underwood, </em>487 U.S. 552, 565, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-11\">Civilian contractor employees working overseas are entitled to benefits under the LHWCA. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(c). Even so, \u201c[n]o compensation shall be payable if the injury was occasioned solely by the intoxication of the employee or by the willful intention of the employee to injure or kill himself or another.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 903(c). Eysselinck has the burden of proving the decedent\u2019s suicide was the result of an irresistible impulse to kill himself. To prove an irresistible impulse, the claimant must produce expert opinion that the decedent suffered from a mental disease or impairment that created the impulse leading to the suicide. <em>Voris v. Tex. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number><em>Emp\u2019rs Ins. Ass\u2019n, </em>190 F.2d 929, 931 (5th Cir.1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">On appeal, Eysselinck argues there is substantial evidence in the record to prove that the decedent suffered from PTSD<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> causing an irresistible impulse to commit suicide, and the ALJ erred in finding the doctor it relied upon was more credible. Extensive testimony was offered about the decedent\u2019s work and activities before his death. The ALJ found that the decedent had not been exposed to life threatening situations in Iraq. After weighing both experts\u2019 testimony, the ALJ concluded one was more credible than the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">A court may not reweigh or reevaluate the evidence considered by the ALJ. <em>La. Ins. Guar. Ass\u2019n v. Bunol, </em>211 F.3d 294, 296 (5th Cir.2000). \u201cThat the facts may permit diverse inferences is immaterial. The [ALJ] alone is charged with the duty of selecting the inference which seems most reasonable and his choice, if supported by the evidence, may not be disturbed.\u201d <em>Presley v. Tinsley Maint. Serv., </em>529 F.2d 433, 436 (5th Cir.1976) (citation omitted). We accept the eviden-tiary choices made by the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">Eysselinck also argues she was not granted the statutory presumption that the decedent\u2019s death was not willful. There is such a presumption, but it applies only \u201cin the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary....\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 920(d). This presumption\u2019s \u201conly office is to control the result where there is an entire lack of competent evidence.\u201d <em>Del Vecchio v. Bowers, </em>296 U.S. 280, 286, 56 S.Ct. 190, 80 L.Ed. 229 (1935). The ALJ was presented with a voluminous record and thoroughly reviewed all of the testimony and expert opinions. The presumption does not control. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b285-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b287-8\">. In the alternative, Eysselinck argues that the decedent \"at the least ... suffered from depression which could only have resulted from his service in Iraq. The ALJ and the [BRB] did not formally consider this fact.\u201d Although Eysselinck averred the'decedent suffered from depression, the issue before the ALJ was whether PTSD, not depression, could overcome the voluntary intentions of the decedent\u2019s suicide such that it could be described as involuntary. She did not argue depression caused the suicide. There was substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
