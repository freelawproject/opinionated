Gonsalez-Juarez was sentenced to 60 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release, which constituted an upward variance from his advisory guidelines range of 24 to 30 months of imprisonment. Gonsalez-Juarez contends that his sentence should be vacated as substantively unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to satisfy the requirements of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-16\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a sentence is reviewed for reasonableness. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). This court first examines whether the district court committed any significant procedural error. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. If the district court\u2019s decision is procedurally sound, this court will then \u201cconsider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because Gonsalez-Juarez does not contend that the district court committed procedural error, the only issue on appeal is the substantive reasonableness of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-17\">In pronouncing Gonsalez-Juarez\u2019s sentence, the district court noted that Gonsa-lez-Juarez had not been deterred by the 33-month sentence imposed for his prior illegal reentry conviction; Gonsalez-Jua-rez had been engaged in criminal conduct constantly from 1983 to 2009; and many of Gonsalez-Juarez\u2019s past convictions, includ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>ing twenty theft convictions, were not counted in his criminal history score. It stated that an upward variance to 60 months of imprisonment was a reasonable sentence when considering Gonsalez-Jua-rez\u2019s history of criminal conduct, the fact that his instant illegal reentry charge arose following another arrest for theft, and his multiple illegal reentries into the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"Avx\">Gonsalez-Juarez argues that the district court should have proceeded cautiously in determining the extent of his upward variance because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, the guideline governing his illegal reentry conviction, produces relatively high guidelines ranges, as its application results in the counting of a defendant\u2019s criminal history both in increasing the defendant\u2019s offense level and in calculating his criminal history score. He also contends that the district court failed to consider that Gonsalez-Jua-rez returned to the United States based on a benign motive, namely to respond to his daughters\u2019 request for his help. Noting that Gonsalez-Juarez\u2019s advisory guidelines range would have been 33 to 41 months of imprisonment had all of his prior convictions been scored, he contends that a 41-month sentence would have been sufficient under \u00a7 3553(a) and that the district court gave no reason why a 60-month sentence was more appropriate than a 41-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Gonsalez-Juarez\u2019s lengthy criminal history, which included 24 convictions that were not counted in his criminal history score, was one of the factors that the district court was permitted to consider in imposing an upward variance. <em>See United States v. Herrera-Garduno, </em>519 F.3d 526, 531 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 709 (5th Cir.2006). The district court\u2019s consideration of Gonsa-lez-Juarez\u2019s criminal history; continuing commission of theft, including in relation to his instant arrest; multiple illegal reentry offenses; and commission of the instant offense despite the 33-month sentence imposed for his prior illegal reentry conviction reflects consideration of Gonsa-lez-Juarez\u2019s .history and characteristics, the nature and circumstances of his offense, and the need to promote respect for the law, afford adequate deterrence, and protect the public from further crimes by Gonsalez-Juarez. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a). The district court listened at sentencing to the statements from Gonsalez-Juarez\u2019s daughter, as well as Gonsalez-Juarez\u2019s explanation that he reentered the United States in response to his daughters\u2019 request for his help.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">\u201c[I]n applying abuse-of-discretion review, [this court] \u2018must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Herrera-Garduno, </em>519 F.3d at 530 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586). \u201c[T]he sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008). \u201cThe fact that the appellate court might reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. The district court provided individualized, case-specific reasons for imposing the 60-month sentence, and Gonsalez-Juarez has not shown that the sentence constituted an abuse of discretion. See <em>Herrera-Garduno, </em>519 F.3d at 530-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b325-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
