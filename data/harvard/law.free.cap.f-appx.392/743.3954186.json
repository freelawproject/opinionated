Fernandez first argues that the district court\u2019s admission into evidence at trial of an exhibit containing electronic medicare claims data, and any summaries and extracts of that exhibit, was error because the exhibit was not properly authenticated, it was not admissible under the business records exception to the hearsay rule, and the admission violated the Sixth Amendment. Next, Fernandez argues that the district court erred by allowing a witness to testify about statements she overheard from an unidentified speaker while she was conducting an on-site governmental inspection of Fernandez\u2019s business. Fernandez contends that this evidence was inadmissible hearsay and that its admission violated his rights under the Sixth Amendment. Fernandez further argues that even if the court determines that no one evidentiary error requires reversal of his convictions, the cumulative effect of the district court\u2019s evidentiary errors deprived him of his right to a fair trial and requires reversal. Finally, Fernandez argues that his sentence, which was at the top of his applicable guideline range, is unreasonable because the district court failed to consider adequately the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings only for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Kennard, </em>472 F.3d 851, 854 (11th Cir.2006). We also \u201creview the district court\u2019s authentication rulings for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Siddiqui, </em>235 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.2000). In the absence of abuse, we do not disturb the district court\u2019s broad discretion in determining the admissibility of business record evidence. <em>United States v. Garnett, </em>122 F.3d 1016, 1018 (11th Cir.1997). \u201cWe review questions of constitutional law <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Underwood, </em>446 F.3d 1340, 1345 (11th Cir.2006). However, in the absence of an objection at trial, we review Confrontation Clause violations for plain error only. <em>United States v. Brazel, </em>102 F.3d 1120, 1141 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-8\">To demonstrate plain error, the defendant must show that there is (1) error, (2) that is plain and (3) that affects substantial rights. If all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-9\"><em>United States v. Turner, </em>474 F.3d 1265, 1276 (11th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-10\">The Federal Rules of Evidence provide that, in general, evidence is properly authenticated when there is \u201cevidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 901(a). Authentication under Fed.R.Evid. 901 only requires the presentation of \u201csufficient evidence to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case that the proffered evidence is what it purports to be.\u201d <em>United States v. Caldwell, </em>776 F.2d 989, 1001-02 (11th Cir.1985). \u201cA district court has discretion to determine authenticity, and that determination should not be disturbed on appeal absent a showing that there is no competent evidence in the record to support it.\u201d <em>Siddiqui, </em>235 F.3d at 1322.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-11\">A party lays the proper foundation for the trustworthiness of computer generated business records and the records are admissible, in the following circumstances: \u201c(1) The records must be kept pursuant to some routine <em>procedure </em>designed to assure their accuracy, (2) they must be created for motives that would tend to assure accuracy (preparation for litigation, for example, is not such a motive), and (3) they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>must not themselves be mere accumulations of hearsay or uninformed opinion.\u201d <em>United States v. Glasser, </em>778 F.2d 1558, 1559 (11th Cir.1985) (quoting <em>Rosenberg v. Collins, </em>624 F.2d 659, 665 (5th Cir.1980)). <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 901(b)(4) (providing that a document can be authenticated by \u201c[a]p-pearance, contents, substance, internal patterns, or other distinctive characteristics, taken in conjunction with circumstances\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">\u201c\u2018Hearsay\u2019 is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted,\u201d and hearsay is generally not admissible Fed.R.Evid. 801(c), 802. Business records, however, are admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule under Fed.R.Evid. 803(6). Business records include data compilations of a business \u201cif kept in the course of a regularly conducted business activity, and if it was the regular practice of that business activity to make the ... data compilation.... \u201d Fed.R.Evid. 803(6). Rule 803(6) \u201crequires the testimony of a custodian or other qualified witness who can explain the record-keeping procedure utilized. It is not necessary for the person who actually prepared the documents to testify so long as there is other circumstantial evidence and testimony to suggest the trustworthiness of the documents.\u201d <em>Garnett, </em>122 F.3d at 1018-19. <em>See Allen v. Safeco Ins. Co. of Am., </em>782 F.2d 1517, 1519 (11th Cir.1986) (holding that there was sufficient foundation to admit a business record when the witness did not prepare the report, but the witness\u2019s testimony established that \u201c[t]he report and the test results in the report were issued by a state agency in the regular course of its business, and there was no indication that they lacked trustworthiness\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">The admission of non-testimonial hearsay evidence does not violate the Sixth Amendment\u2019s right to confront witnesses if it bears an \u201cindicia of reliability,\u201d which can be inferred if the evidence \u201cfalls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception.\u201d <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 2539, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">We conclude from the record that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the electronic compilation of medicare claims data, and the summaries and extracts of this data. The custodian\u2019s testimony at trial showed that the data was kept by a routine procedure supervised by a federal governmental agency which designed safeguards for the security and accuracy of the data. The custodian\u2019s testimony also showed that the exhibit was a business record generated by government-supervised procedures in the regular course of business, and there was no evidence to question the trustworthiness of the electronic information. Since Fernandez did not contemporaneously object to the introduction of the exhibits on Sixth Amendment grounds, we review this issue for plain error. Because the claims data exhibits were properly admitted as an exception to the hearsay rule, there was no error, much less plain error, under the Sixth Amendment in the admission of the exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">[4] Under the evidentiary hearsay rules, certain out-of-court statements can be admitted as non-hearsay evidence if they are offered, not for the truth of the assertions therein, but to explain a witness\u2019s state of mind and subsequent actions. <em>See United States v. Jiminez, </em>564 F.3d 1280, 1288 (11th Cir.2009) (recogniz<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>ing that \u201c[statements by out of court witnesses to law enforcement officials may be admitted as non-hearsay if they are relevant to explain the course of the officials\u2019 subsequent investigative actions, and the probative value of the evidence\u2019s non-hearsay purpose is not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice caused by the impermissible hearsay use of the statement\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>United States v. Hawkins, </em>905 F.2d 1489, 1495-96 (11th Cir.1990) (holding that statements were admissible to explain why an investigation was started). \u201c[Ejvidentiary and other non-constitutional errors do not constitute grounds for reversal unless there is a reasonable likelihood that they affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights; where an error had no substantial influence on the outcome, and sufficient evidence uninfected by error supports the verdict, reversal is not warranted.\u201d <em>Hawkins, </em>905 F.2d at 1493.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">The Sixth Amendment only prohibits statements that are impermissible hearsay. <em>Jiminez, </em>564 F.3d at 1286. If statements are testimonial hearsay, the Sixth Amendment requires the declarant to be unavailable and the defendant to have a previous opportunity for cross-examination of the declarant in order for the statements to be admitted. <em>Underwood, </em>446 F.3d at 1346. If statements are non-testimonial, they are admissible if they fall within an established hearsay exception or otherwise bear indi-cia of reliability. <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. at 66, 100 S.Ct. at 2539. Testimonial statements are generally \u201cstatements made under circumstances which would lead the declarant to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.\u201d <em>Underwood, </em>446 F.3d at 1347. A Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause error is not ground for reversal if the error is \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Hunerlach, </em>197 F.3d 1059, 1067 (11th Cir.1999). As this court noted in <em>Hunerlach,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-7\">Factors that determine whether such an error is harmless include: the importance of the witness\u2019 testimony in the prosecution\u2019s case, whether the testimony was cumulative, the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and, of course, the overall strength of the prosecution\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 1067 n. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">We need not determine if an evi-dentiary or a constitutional error occurred in the admission of the out-of-court statements of the unidentified speaker because, even if any such error did occur, we conclude that the error does not dictate reversal. As to any possible evidentiary error, a review of the record reveals that such error was harmless because the statement of the unidentified speaker did not substantially affect the outcome of the trial. Also, any possible constitutional error in admitting the statement was \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d when considered in the context of the entire trial. The government presented much evidence to support the verdict, including witness testimony, documentary evidence, and recorded evidence, and the statements of the unidentified speaker were not significant in the context of all the other evidence of guilt. Thus, reversal is not warranted on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-11\">\u201cThe cumulative error doctrine provides that an aggregation of non-reversible errors (i.e., plain errors failing to necessitate reversal and harmless errors) can yield a denial of the constitutional right to a fair trial, which calls for rever<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>sal.\u201d <em>United States v. Baker, </em>432 F.3d 1189, 1223 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">As stated above, even if there was error, it did not affect Fernandez\u2019s substantial rights and did not deny him a fair trial. Thus, there was no cumulative error and Fernandez\u2019s argument has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">We review sentencing decisions on appeal for reasonableness. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201c[A] sentence may be reviewed for procedural or substantive unreasonableness.\u201d <em>United States v. Ellisor, </em>522 F.3d 1255, 1273 (11th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cOnce an appellate court has satisfied itself that the district court followed proper sentencing procedure, the court then evaluates the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). The party challenging the sentence has the burden to establish that the sentence is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">We must consider several factors to determine if a sentence is procedurally sound, such as whether the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors and whether the court adequately explained the chosen sentence. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. A district court is not required \u201cto state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). When the parties\u2019 arguments discuss the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, it is sufficient for the court to acknowledge that it considered the factors and the- parties\u2019 arguments. <em>Id. </em>at 1329-30. Further, even if the district court fails to articulate explicitly that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the sentence is reasonable if the record indicates that the court did, in fact, consider the sentencing factors. <em>United States v. Dorman, </em>488 F.3d 936, 944 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-10\">The highly deferential review for substantive reasonableness does not involve the consideration of each decision made during sentencing. <em>Id. </em>at 938. Instead, it requires a review of only the final sentence for reasonableness in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id. </em>Section 3553(a) first states that \u201c[t]he court shall impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary,\u201d to comply with the purposes of sentencing. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The section continues with the following list of factors that a court must consider in imposing a sentence: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment, adequately deter criminal conduct, protect the public, and provide the defendant with needed correctional treatment; (3) the kinds of available sentences; (4) the sentencing guideline range, including policy statements of the Guidelines in the case of probation or supervised release violations; (5) any other pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities; and (7) the need for restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3353(a); <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786. The weight given to each factor is \u201ca matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). Ordinarily, this court expects a sentence within the guidelines range to be reasonable. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>A review of the record demonstrates that Fernandez\u2019s sentence is procedurally sound. The record reveals that the court did weigh and consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Further, Fernandez\u2019s sentence, which is within the guidelines range, is also substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Based on a review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm Fernandez\u2019s convictions and total sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
