Valdez is serving a 252-month sentence following his guilty plea to possession with intent to distribute at least 500 grams of methamphetamine and possession of a firearm during the commission of a drug trafficking crime. As part of his plea agreement, Valdez waived the right to appeal his sentence either directly or collaterally.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">In his \u00a7 2255 motion, Valdez argued that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to file a notice of appeal as instructed. The failure to file a requested notice of appeal is ineffective assistance of counsel, even without a showing that the appeal would have merit. <em>See Roe v. Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. 470, 477, 483-86, 120 S.Ct. 1029, 145 L.Ed.2d 985 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-11\">Valdez has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); <em>United States v. Tapp, </em>491 F.3d 263, 266 (5th Cir.2007). The record does not conclusively show that Valdez did not ask counsel to file a notice of appeal, making an evidentiary hearing on that issue necessary. <em>See Tapp, </em>491 F.3d at 266. A COA is granted, the district court\u2019s judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded for further development on that issue. Valdez\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-15\">COA AND IFP GRANTED; VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b297-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
