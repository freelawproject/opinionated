The district court sentenced him to serve 140 months in prison and a three-year term of supervised release. In the sole issue presented in this appeal, he argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>that the district court committed clear error by concluding that an allegedly inoperable firearm found in his garage, which was used to unload and store illegal drugs, was possessed in connection with his offense and by imposing the corresponding sentencing enhancement found in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Our review of the record does not show that a connection between the firearm found in Trevino\u2019s garage and his drug-related offense was \u201cclearly improbable.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment, (n.3). To the contrary, this review shows \u201cthat a temporal and spatial relation existed between the weapon, the drug trafficking activity, and the defendant.\u201d <em>See United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764-65 (5th Cir.2008). Consequently, the district court did not clearly err by imposing the disputed adjustment. <em>See id. </em>at 765. We reject Trevino\u2019s contention that application of the adjustment was improper due to the firearm\u2019s inoperable status because this factor is not dispositive. <em>See United States v. Paulk, </em>917 F.2d 879, 882 (5th Cir.1990); <em>see also United States v. Jacquinot, </em>258 F.3d 423, 431 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b344-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
