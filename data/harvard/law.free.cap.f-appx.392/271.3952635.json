Hernandez brought suit against his former defense counsel for actions taken by counsel during his representation of Hernandez on criminal charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-27\">Hernandez\u2019s motion is construed as a challenge to the district court\u2019s determination that the appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). This court\u2019s inquiry into whether the appeal is taken in good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves \u2018legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number><em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1988) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">To succeed in a \u00a7 1988 action, the plaintiff must establish a violation of the laws or constitution of the United States and that this deprivation of rights was caused by a person acting under color of state law. <em>Leffall v. Dallas Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>28 F.3d 521, 525 (5th Cir.1994). An attorney does not act under color of state law when he \u201cperform[s] a lawyer\u2019s traditional functions\u201d as defense counsel in a criminal proceeding. <em>Polk County v. Dodson, </em>454 U.S. 312, 325, 102 S.Ct. 445, 70 L.Ed.2d 509 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Hernandez\u2019s allegations against his counsel were based on the traditional functions of an attorney in a criminal proceeding. His appeal of the district court\u2019s determination that he failed to show state action is thus without merit. <em>See Polk, </em>454 U.S. at 325, 102 S.Ct. 445. Accordingly, Hernandez\u2019s motion for IFP is denied and the appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Hernandez\u2019s complaint and our dismissal of this appeal as frivolous each count as strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). We caution Hernandez that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be permitted to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTIONS WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b293-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
