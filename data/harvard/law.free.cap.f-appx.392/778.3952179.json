Wall moved to alter or amend on the ground that he had not received a copy of the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge that the district court had adopted. The district court denied Wall\u2019s motion, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-25\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Wall\u2019s motion to alter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>or amend. The magistrate judge directed the clerk to serve Wall a copy of the report and recommendation, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(b)(1), and that \u201cservice [was] complete upon mailing,\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 5(b)(2)(C). There is a presumption that an item mailed has been received, <em>Barnett v. Okeechobee Hosp., </em>283 F.3d 1232, 1239 (11th Cir.2002), and Wall failed to submit sufficient evidence to rebut that presumption. Although Wall alleged that he did not receive the report and recommendation, he offered nothing more than his bare assertion to overcome the presumption. <em>See id. </em>at 1241. The clerk mailed the report and recommendation to the address provided by Wall, and the report was not returned as undeliverable by postal officials. Wall also had received documents mailed previously to that same address. Wall also failed to explain what objections, if any, he would have filed had he received the report earlier, nor has Wall offered any explanation on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">We AFFIRM the denial of Wall\u2019s motion to alter or amend.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
