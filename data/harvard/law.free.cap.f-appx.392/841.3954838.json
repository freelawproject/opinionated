BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b864-13\">Steven G. Miles, M.D., was a practicing interventional radiologist. In early 2006, Miles was diagnosed with a disease that affected his ability to work. In June 2006, he submitted a claim for total disability benefits to his occupational disability insurer, Provident Life and Accident Insurance Company (\u201cProvident\u201d). Provident acknowledged Miles\u2019s claim and undertook an investigation of the claim that lasted about six months. During the investigation, Miles responded to Provident\u2019s requests for information and provided claim documentation. On December 1, 2006, Provident denied Miles\u2019s claim for total disability benefits. When Miles disputed the denial of his claim, Provident undertook a review of the decision. Despite communications from Provident to Miles in both May 2007 and July 2007 saying that the company would conclude the review process within thirty days, Provident made no decision on its review of Miles\u2019s claim in 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-15\">At the end of November 2007, one year after his claim was denied, Miles filed suit against Provident in a Florida state court, seeking total disability benefits under the policy and attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to section 627.428, Florida Statutes. Provident removed the case to federal court. Provident\u2019s answer to the complaint denied (among other things) that Miles was totally disabled and denied that he was entitled to attorney\u2019s fees. On February 8, 2008, while the lawsuit was still pending, Provident sent Miles a letter reversing its earlier denial of his claim and acknowledging that Miles was totally disabled under the policy. Thereafter, Provident paid Miles total disability benefits under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-16\">Miles moved for summary judgment on his attorney\u2019s fees claim. Provident opposed Miles\u2019s motion and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. The district court denied Miles\u2019s motion and granted Provident\u2019s motion, finding that Miles was not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees because Provident\u2019s initial denial of his claim was not wrongful. Miles appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-17\">II. ISSUES ON APPEAL AND CONTENTIONS OF THE PARTIES</p>\n<p id=\"b864-18\">We review the district court\u2019s decision that Miles is not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>Miles argues that the district court erred because, where an insured brings suit to challenge an insurer\u2019s denial of his claim and then the insurance company pays the claim, the insured is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under section 627.428(1), Florida Statutes. Miles also argues that the district court erred in relying on inadmissible documents submitted by Provident in support of its motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">Provident defends the district court\u2019s ruling and argues, as it did in the district court, that an insurer is not hable for an insured\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees unless it denied the insured\u2019s claim unreasonably or in bad faith. Provident argues that the documents attached to its motion were admissible and that, in any event, the district court did not rely on those documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">III. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment by applying the same legal standards used by the district court. <em>See, e.g., Hilburn v. Muraba Elecs. N. Am., Inc., </em>181 F.3d 1220, 1225 (11th Cir.1999). Summary judgment is appropriate where \u201c \u2018there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wooden v. Bd. of Regents of the Univ. Sys. of Ga., </em>247 F.3d 1262, 1271 (11th Cir.2001) (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-9\">IV. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b865-10\">The Florida statute at issue in this appeal states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-11\">Upon the rendition of a judgment or decree by any of the courts of this state against an insurer and in favor of any named or omnibus insured or the named beneficiary under a policy or contract executed by the insurer, the trial court or, in the event of an appeal in which the insured or beneficiary prevails, the appellate court shall adjudge or decree against the insurer and in favor of the insured or beneficiary a reasonable sum as fees or compensation for the insured\u2019s or beneficiary\u2019s attorney prosecuting the suit in which the recovery is had.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b865-13\">Fla. Stat. \u00a7 627.428(1). It is well settled in Florida law that no actual judgment or decree is necessary if, when an insured must sue an insurance company on a disputed claim, the insurance company subsequently agrees to pay the claim. <em>Wollard v. Lloyd\u2019s &amp; Cos. of Lloyd\u2019s, </em>439 So.2d 217, 218 (Fla.1983). \u201c[T]he payment of the claim is, indeed, the functional equivalent of a confession of judgment or a verdict in favor of the insured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under those circumstances, the insured is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 218-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-14\">Provident argues that the district court did not err in entering judgment for Provident because, in order for an insured to be entitled to attorney\u2019s fees, he must show that the insurance company\u2019s denial of the claim was unreasonable or in bad faith. Provident bases this argument on language in Florida appellate court opinions saying that attorney\u2019s fees are recoverable only when the insurer has \u201cwrongfully\u201d withheld payment on the claim. <em>See </em>Appellee\u2019s Br. at 28-29. The plain language of the statute, however, imposes no requirement that an insured demonstrate that the insurer\u2019s denial of the claim was unreasonable or in bad faith. And, Provident cites no case law that clearly states these things must be proven. We also disagree with Provident\u2019s interpretation of the word \u201cwrongful\u201d in the state court opinions. As we understand the cases, an insurance company \u201cwrongfully\u201d denies the claim if it does so incorrectly, meaning in spite of its duty to do otherwise under the insurance contract. <em>See Cincinnati Ins. Co. v. Palmer, </em>297 So.2d 96, 98 (Fla.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>App.1974) (\u201cThe fact that the insurer\u2019s refusal to pay the amount owed by it under the terms of the policy was in good faith and on reasonable grounds does not relieve the insurer from liability for payment of attorney\u2019s fees where it is subsequently found liable on the policy.\u201d (citation omitted)); <em>see also Wollard, </em>439 So.2d at 219 and n. 2 (stating that, even if it were the case that the insured had been dilatory in its prosecution of the claim and the insurance company had been the impetus for settlement, the insured would be entitled to reasonable attorney\u2019s fees if the legal services were necessary).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">An award of attorney\u2019s fees to an insured may be warranted under Florida law even if an insurer did not act in an unreasonable manner in denying a claim. But, an insured must show that he or she needed to resort to litigation to receive benefits. <em>Gov\u2019t Employees Ins. Co. v. Battaglia, </em>503 So.2d 358, 360 (Fla. 5th DCA 1987) (\u201cThe purpose of section 627.428 is to penalize a carrier for wrongfully causing its insured to resort to litigation to resolve a conflict when it was reasonably within the carrier\u2019s power to do so.\u201d) (citing <em>Crotts v. Bankers &amp; Shippers Ins. Co. of New York, </em>476 So.2d 1357, 1358 (Fla. 2d DCA 1985); <em>Vermont Mutual Ins. Co. v. Bolding, </em>381 So.2d 320 (Fla. 5th DCA 1980)). In their summary judgment papers, the parties presented arguments and evidence relevant to the issue of whether litigation was necessary for Miles to receive benefits. The district court made no findings on that issue. Instead, the court based its decisions on the lack of evidence showing a genuine issue of material fact that Provident acted in an unreasonable manner. Because there is no requirement for such a showing, we vacate the district court\u2019s decision and judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We remand the case for further proceedings, during which the district court should decide whether the legal services were necessary to the favorable resolution of Miles\u2019s previously-denied claim. <em>See Wollard, </em>439 So.2d at 219, n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-8\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b866-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the judgment for fees and remand the case to the district court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b866-10\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b866-5\">. In light of our decision, we do not consider whether the district court improperly relied on the evidence submitted by Provident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b866-6\">. Miles\u2019s motion for this court to grant him attorney\u2019s fees is denied. However, if the district court determines that Miles's lawsuit was necessary, it should award fees and expenses for the handling of Ms appeal and determine the amount to be awarded.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
