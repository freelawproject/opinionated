West argues that, in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court was authorized to reduce his sentence based on the new advisory guidelines range and consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. He also contends that his career offender status did not preclude the court from reducing his sentence. These issues are foreclosed. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2692, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010); <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 790-91 (5th Cir.2009), and <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 236-39 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b360-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
