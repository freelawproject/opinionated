He argues that the evidence will show that the defendants intentionally destroyed the property in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-24\">We review the dismissal as frivolous for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Norton v. Dimazana, </em>122 F.3d 286, 291 (5th Cir.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00a9 and 1915A(b)(1). To the extent that Jackson may have raised claims based upon negligence or failure to comply with prison procedures in his complaint, he has abandoned them on appeal. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). He does not argue that the district court erred by finding (1) that the defendants\u2019 actions, at most, constituted a random and unauthorized deprivation or (2) that the Texas tort of conversion provides an adequate post-deprivation remedy. <em>See Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 533, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984); <em>Parrott v. Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527, 541-44, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 68 L.Ed.2d 420 (1981), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Daniels v. Williams, </em>474 U.S. 327, 330-31, 106 S.Ct. 662, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986); <em>Murphy v. Collins, </em>26 F.3d 541, 543-44 (5th Cir.1994). The <em>Parratt/Hudson </em>doctrine applies even when a prisoner alleges that the deprivation of property by prison officials was intentional. <em>Hudson, </em>468 U.S. at 533, 104 S.Ct. 3194. Accordingly, Jackson\u2019s suit is foreclosed by the <em>Parratt/Hudson </em>doctrine, and the district court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing it as frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Jackson\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). The district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint and this court\u2019s dismissal of this appeal as frivolous combined count as two strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Jackson is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will no longer be allowed to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">Jackson\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b339-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47., the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R.5 47.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
