Guzman-Hernandez argues for the first time on appeal that his rights under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), were violated and that the district court violated Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 by failing to inquire whether Guzman-Hernandez was interrogated in violation of <em>Miranda.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">By pleading guilty, Guzman-Hernandez waived his argument regarding any violation of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>See United States v. Bell, </em>966 F.2d 914, 915 (5th Cir.1992). Rule 11 has no requirement that the district court inquire about possible <em>Miranda </em>violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">He also argues that his counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to \u201chold the government to its burden of proof [regarding compliance with <em>Miranda </em>] or raise the issue of admissibility to the court.\u201d The record is insufficiently developed to allow consideration at this time of Guzman-Hernandez\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel; such claims generally \u201ccannot be resolved on direct appeal when [they have] not been raised before the district court since no opportunity existed to develop the record on the merits of the allegations.\u201d <em>United States v. Cantwell, </em>470 F.3d 1087, 1091 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b343-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
