Stringer, a <em>pro se </em>prisoner, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint for failure to state a claim for relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). On appeal, Stringer argues that the district court abused its discretion when it denied his request to amend his complaint to include retaliation facts because such an amendment would not have been futile. After careful review, we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">We review the denial of a motion to amend a complaint for abuse of discretion, but review the underlying legal conclusion of whether a particular amendment to the complaint would have been futile <em>de novo. Corsello v. Lincare, Inc., </em>428 F.3d 1008, 1012 (11th Cir.2005). We hold <em>pro se </em>pleadings to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and, therefore, will liberally construe those pleadings. <em>Miller v. Donald, </em>541 F.3d 1091, 1100 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-11\">A district court may dismiss a complaint if the facts as pled do not state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face. <em>Sinaltrainal v. Coca-Cola Co., </em>578 F.3d 1252, 1260 (11th Cir.2009) (citing <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1950, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009)). Although a complaint need not contain detailed factual allegations, it must contain \u201cmore than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1261 (quoting <em>Iqbal, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-13\">A party may amend its pleading as a matter of course within 21 days after serving it, or 21 days after service of a responsive pleading. Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a)(l)(A)r-(B). \u201cIn all other cases, a party may amend its pleading only with the opposing party\u2019s written consent or the court\u2019s leave. The court should freely give leave when justice so requires.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a)(2). If the underlying facts or circumstances relied on by plaintiff may be a proper subject of relief, leave to amend \u201cshould be freely given.\u201d <em>Hall v. United Ins. Co. of Am., </em>367 F.3d 1255, 1262 (11th Cir.2004). However, a district court may properly deny leave to amend under Rule 15(a) if such amendment \u201cwould be futile.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1262-63. Denial of leave to amend \u201cis justified by futility when the complaint as amended is still subject to dismissal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1263. Additionally, the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915, does not preclude a district court from granting a motion to amend under Rule 15(a). <em>Brown v. Johnson, </em>387 F.3d 1344, 1349 (11th Cir.2004). In <em>Brown, </em>we held that Brown had the right to amend his complaint under Rule 15(a) because he had filed his motion to amend before the district court had dismissed his complaint and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>before any responsive pleadings had been filed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Section 1983 of Title 42 of the U.S.Code provides a cause of action against any person acting under the color of state law for deprivations of any right secured by the Constitution. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. We have held that \u201cFirst Amendment rights to free speech and to petition the government for a redress of grievances are violated when a prisoner is punished for filing a grievance concerning the conditions of his imprisonment.\u201d <em>Boxer X v. Harris, </em>437 F.3d 1107, 1112 (11th Cir.2006). In <em>Boxer X, </em>the district court dismissed the appellant\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint, in part, for failure to state a claim. <em>Id. </em>at 1109. We held that the appellant had expressly claimed that he had been punished for complaining through the established grievance system about his treatment by one of the prison guards. <em>Id. </em>at 1112. We noted that the appellant had first presented these facts in his objections to the magistrate\u2019s R &amp; R. <em>Id. </em>at 1112 n. 4. We held that the district court should have allowed the appellant to incorporate his retaliation claim because the assertion was sufficient to state a claim under \u00a7 1983, based on a liberal construction. <em>Id. </em>at 1112.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">In this case, the district court had not yet dismissed his case and no responsive pleading had been filed. Thus, Stringer had the right to amend his complaint under Rule 15(a). <em>See Brown, </em>387 F.3d at 1349.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">Moreover, as the record shows, the magistrate judge recommended that the district court dismiss Stringer\u2019s retaliation claim because Stringer had raised no facts to state a claim for retaliation; indeed, Stringer had merely noted \u201cretaliation\u201d in his complaint. However, after the magistrate judge found that Stringer failed to raise facts for retaliation, Stringer raised those facts in his objections to the R &amp; R. Specifically, Stringer asserted that, after filing a grievance with the prison concerning the loss of money from an incorrect commissary order, the defendants retaliated against him by \u201cimproperly transferring him to another \u2018much harsher condition\u2019 jail, without due process, without any incident or disciplinary reasons\u201d and continued to deprive him of food, legal access, and materials. Based on a liberal construction of Stringer\u2019s assertions, he did allege a claim of First Amendment retaliation in connection with the grievances he filed. <em>See Boxer X, </em>437 F.3d at 1112.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">Therefore, the district court should have allowed Stringer to amend his complaint as a matter of course <em>and </em>because such an amendment would not have been futile. <em>See id.; see Hall, </em>367 F.3d at 1262-63; <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a); <em>Brown, </em>387 F.3d at 1349. Accordingly, the district court abused its discretion by denying Stringer leave to amend his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-10\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
