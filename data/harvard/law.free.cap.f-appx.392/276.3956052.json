A native and citizen of Nicaragua, Flores entered the United States without inspection, and deportation proceedings were initiated against him on April 10, 1995, by issuance of an order to show cause. Additional charges of inadmissibility/deportability were lodged on November 21, 2007, because Flores was convicted twice in Arkansas of possession of a controlled substance and of shoplifting and third degree battery. At a hearing before the IJ, Flores admitted the fact of his prior convictions. Flores also admitted that he had been convicted, after entry, of two crimes involving moral turpitude not arising out of a single scheme or criminal misconduct, and that he had been convicted, after entry, of a controlled substance offense. The IJ determined that the two misdemeanor drug possession convictions qualified as an aggravated felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Flores applied for asylum, withholding of deportation under Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) \u00a7 241(b)(3), and withholding of removal under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). The IJ determined that Flores was not eligible for asylum because of his aggravated felony conviction, and that he was not entitled to withholding of deportation or relief under the CAT because he had not carried his burden with respect to the likelihood of future persecution. The BIA affirmed IJ\u2019s decision, and it denied Flores\u2019s requests for reconsideration, to reopen deportation proceedings, and for reconsideration of the decision denying the request to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Flores concedes that he is deportable under former Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) \u00a7 241(a)(1)(B) because he entered the United States without inspection, and that he is ineligible for asylum. Flores contends nevertheless that he is not deportable under former INA \u00a7 241 (a)(2)(A)(ii) and (iii) on the basis of his status as an alien who was convicted following entry of two crimes involving moral turpitude and as an aggravated felon.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">This court has jurisdiction to review constitutional claims and questions of law raised upon a petition for review. <em>See Brieva-Perez v. Gonzales, </em>482 F.3d 356, 359 (5th Cir.2007); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). We review questions of law de novo but defer \u201cto the BIA\u2019s interpretation of immigration statutes unless the record reveals compelling evidence that the BIA\u2019s interpretation is incorrect.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Cantur-Delgadillo v. Holder, </em>584 F.3d 682, 686 (5th Cir.2009) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-11\">Flores has not exhausted his administrative remedies as to the question whether he was deportable under former INA \u00a7 241 (a)(2)(A)(ii), as an alien who, after entry, was convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1252(d) (\u201cA court may review a final order of removal only if \u2014 (1) the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\u201d). Therefore, this court does not have jurisdiction to consider the issue. <em>See Toledo-Hernandez v. Mukasey, </em>521 F.3d 332, 335-36 (5th Cir.2008). In any event, Flores\u2019s arguments with regard to that ground of deportability and the other grounds of deportability are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-12\">Flores contends that he is not deporta-ble under former INA \u00a7 241 (a)(2)(A)(ii) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>and (iii) on the basis of his status as an alien who was convicted following entry of two crimes involving moral turpitude and as an aggravated felon because his'convictions did not occur \u201cafter entry\u201d or \u201cafter admission.\u201d Flores contends that he should have been charged in removal proceedings under INA \u00a7 237, and that he could not be removed under \u00a7 237 because he was never \u201cadmitted\u201d to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Flores\u2019s arguments conflate the concepts of \u201centry\u201d and \u201cadmission.\u201d The term \u201centry\u201d was formerly defined as \u201c\u2018any coming of an alien into the United States, from a foreign port or place or from an outlying possession, whether voluntarily or otherwise.\u2019 \u201d <em>London v. Plasencia, </em>459 U.S. 21, 25 n. 3, 103 S.Ct. 321, 74 L.Ed.2d 21 (1982) (quoting former 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(13)). \u201cThe terms \u2018admission\u2019 and \u2018admitted\u2019 mean, with respect to an alien, the lawful entry of the alien into the United States after inspection and authorization by an immigration officer.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(A); <em>see also In re Rosas-Ramirez, </em>22 I &amp; N Dec. 616, 620 (BIA 1999);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>see generally </em>1 Charles Gordon, Stanley Mailman, and Stephen Yale-Loehr, Immigration Law and Procedure, \u00a7 1.03[l][b] (Matthew-Bender, Rev. Ed., through June 2010) (discussing distinction between \u201centry\u201d and \u201cadmission\u201d). Under former INA \u00a7 241(a)(2)(A)(ii) &amp; (iii) and (B)(i), aliens were \u201cdeportable\u201d upon commission following \u201centry\u201d of two or more crimes of moral turpitude, of an aggravated felony, and of a controlled substance offense, respectively. Under INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A) &amp; (B), an alien is \u201cremovable\u201d upon the commission of such crimes following \u201cadmission.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">Under \u00a7 301(c)(1)(B) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (1996) (IIRIRA), deportation proceedings that were pending on the IIRIRA enactment date were continued. IIRIRA \u00a7 301(c)(1)(B). Under IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(3), the Attorney General could elect to terminate deportation cases pending on the IIRIRA enactment date and to reinstate such cases as removal proceedings, a procedure known as \u201crepapering.\u201d <em>Rojas-Reyes v. INS, </em>235 F.3d 115, 125-26 (2d Cir.2000). In this case, the Attorney General exercised his discretion to continue the deportation proceedings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Flores has not shown that the Attorney General committed an error of law in exercising his discretion to continue the deportation proceedings under the charges asserted in the order to show cause, or that his constitutional rights were violated. <em>See Rojas-Reyes, </em>235 F.3d at 125-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">Flores admitted in 1995 that he was deportable under former INA \u00a7 241(a)(1)(B) because he entered the United States without inspection. In 2008, Flores admitted that he was convicted, after entry, of two crimes involving moral turpitude not arising out of a single scheme or criminal misconduct, and that he had been convicted, after entry, of a controlled substance offense. Flores has not shown that the BIA committed an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>error of law in determining that he was deportable under former INA \u00a7 241(a)(1)(A)(ii) &amp; (iii) and (B)(i) because he was convicted after entry of two crimes of moral turpitude, an aggravated felony, and a controlled substance offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Flores argues that his attorney rendered ineffective assistance in conceding that he was admitted to the United States. This issue was first asserted in Flores\u2019s request to reopen. The BIA\u2019s denial of a request to reopen is reviewed \u201cunder a highly deferential abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>Manzano-Garcia v. Gonzales, </em>413 F.3d 462, 469 (5th Cir.2005). Ordinarily, a request to reopen must be filed within 90 days of entry of \u201cthe final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i). Flores raises no issue with respect to the BIA\u2019s conclusion that his request to reopen was untimely. Accordingly, this court lacks jurisdiction over his petition for review of the order denying the request to reopen. <em>See Enriquez-Alvarado v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 246, 248-50 (5th Cir.2004). Moreover, because Flores\u2019s ineffective assistance arguments are based on his meritless contention that he did not commit his various criminal offenses after entry, he has not shown that the proceedings were fundamentally unfair because he received ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See Mai v. Gonzales, </em>473 F.3d 162, 165 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Flores argues that he is eligible for adjustment of status under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i) because he has been physically present in the United States since 1995, and because he \u201cpetitioned for classification and labor certification\u201d prior to April 30, 2001. This issue is unexhausted. <em>See Toledo-Hernandez, </em>521 F.3d at 335-36. The petitions for review are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b299-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b300-6\">. We note that Flores does not challenge the BIA's determination that he is deportable as an aggravated felon. <em>But see Carachuri-Rosendo </em>v. <em>Holder, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2577, 2589-90, 177 L.Ed.2d 68 (2010). Although Flores is pro se, we will not raise the issue sua sponte. <em>See Garcia v. Reno, </em>234 F.3d 257, 258 n. 2 (5th Cir.2000); <em>Grant v. Cuellar, </em>59 F.3d 523, 524 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b301-6\">. In <em>Rosas-Ramirez, </em>22 I &amp; N Dec. at 617, cited by Flores, the BIA held that the alien\u2019s adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident, under INA \u00a7 245A(b), constituted an \"admission\u201d under \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(iii). 22 I &amp; N Dec. at 623. Because Flores\u2019s status was never adjusted to lawful permanent resident, <em>Rosas-Ramirez </em>is inapposite.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b301-11\">. The Attorney General points out that, if he had exercised his discretion to reinstate removal proceedings against Flores, the charges would have been brought under INA \u00a7 212(a), which pertains to inadmissible aliens, and not under INA \u00a7 237. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
