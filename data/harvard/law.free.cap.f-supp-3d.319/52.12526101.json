Mr. Richardson claims that Defendants violated his constitutional rights by taking various improper actions related to his job, personnel records, and complaints of discrimination, leading to his termination and undermining his subsequent attempts to challenge that termination. Defendants move to dismiss on the grounds that the claims have already been litigated or are barred by Defendants' qualified immunity, among other arguments. Because Counts One through Eight in Mr. Richardson's Amended Complaint have been litigated fully in a related case, they are barred by the principles of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   and collateral estoppel and will be dismissed. Counts Nine and Ten will be dismissed because they are untimely. Count Eleven will be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be\n   granted.

Count One charges that Defendants Jones, Coble, Dublin, May, Sauls, Bakale, and O'Malley violated Mr. Richardson's Fourth Amendment rights when they allegedly \"conspired with one another to remove protected medical records from Plaintiff's personnel file that ... should not have been in the defendants['] possession.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 168.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Counts Two and Five allege violations of Mr. Richardson's rights under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, respectively, based on the claim that Messrs. Sauls and Pleasant illegally obtained Mr. Richardson's cell phone records \"knowing the information used to obtain those records to be falsified and [a] misrepresentation of facts,\" and that they \"willfully released\" his phone records to other people.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 83-84, 92, 178, 214-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Counts Three and Six allege that Mr. May violated the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, respectively, when he \"searched Plaintiff's personnel file[,] retrieving only documents that would be most character damaging to Plaintiff,\" and \"searched through Plaintiff's ongoing EEO activity file, removing specific documents, including his own EEO affidavit and converted those documents to his personal use\" by improperly mailing them to JaCina Stanton of the Maryland Attorney Grievance Commission.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 188-89, 229-30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Count Four alleges that Ms. Shanks and Messrs. Sauls, Bakale, Coble, Jones, Dublin,\n   and O'Malley violated Mr. Richardson's Fifth Amendment rights and are liable for wrongful termination because they \"intentionally and callously remov[ed] 22 medical documents\" from Mr. Richardson's personnel file; the absence of these medical records allegedly deprived Mr. Richardson of the ability to document his medical \"call-offs\" when requested; and his termination resulted.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Count Seven alleges that Messrs. Bakale, Dublin, Jones, May, Sauls, Coble, and O'Malley violated Mr. Richardson's First Amendment rights by retaliating against him due to his protected speech and, specifically, that Mr. Bakale \"harass[ed]\" Mr. Richardson when confronted about the alleged removal of medical documents and asked Mr. Richardson why he planned to \"tak[e] the illegal removal of medical documents public and to the U.S. Dept. of Veterans Affairs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 238-240.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Count Eight alleges that Messrs.

Sauls and Pleasant \"attempted to establish a falsified investigation against Plaintiff and further attempt[ed] [to] have Plaintiff wrongfully prosecuted by 4 separate law enforcement agencies,\" in retaliation for Mr. Richardson's \"public disclosures\" concerning the removal of his medical documents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 247-49. Also in Count Eight, Mr. Pleasant is alleged to have investigated another employee for wrongful behavior, who had not engaged in protected activities and who received a lesser discipline than Mr. Richardson.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 250-52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Count Nine alleges that Mses. Hargo and Shanks and Messrs. Jones, Sauls, O'Malley, Bakale, Dublin, Coble, and May violated Mr. Richardson's rights under the First and Fifth Amendments by conspiring to retaliate against him and to deny his appeal of his termination. The crux of count's allegations is that Ms. Shanks's purported reason for upholding Mr. Richardson's termination-that he had accumulated too many \"tardies\"-was pretextual and a \"malicious fabrication of evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 259-60. Mr. Richardson contends that Mr. May had informed him that he was being terminated for failing to provide supporting documentation for medical call-offs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 262.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In Count Ten, Mr. Richardson complains of unequal treatment in violation of his Fifth Amendment due process rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 280. Count Ten alleges that Mses. Shanks and Hargo and Messrs. O'Malley, Jones, Sauls, Bakale, Dublin, Coble, and May failed to consider prior misconduct of two white employees, Rocco Christoff and Darren Harris, when terminating Mr. Richardson for comparable reasons in June 2010.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 273-78.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Finally, Count Eleven charges Mr. Smith, a senior EEO specialist with the Board, with violations of Mr. Richardson's rights under the First and Fifth Amendments for allegedly failing to provide EEO counseling when Mr. Richardson submitted an administrative complaint of discrimination in 2016, several years after his discharge.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 284-90. Specifically, Mr. Smith allegedly deprived Mr. Richardson of his \"right to free speech\" by denying him adequate investigation of his EEO claims and related counseling.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 286-87. Mr. Richardson also contends that Mr. Smith violated the Fifth Amendment by denying him the opportunity \"to be heard and to bring his claims before an administrative judge or this Court.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 288. He asserts that Mr. Smith improperly forwarded new EEO charges filed by Mr. Richardson to Board senior counsel Joshua Chadwick and that Messrs. Smith and Chadwick together \"prevented Plaintiff's\n   newly filed claims from moving forward\" in the EEO process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 156. Mr. Richardson contends that Mr. Chadwick presented a \"fabricated\" EEO form to Mr. Richardson's EEO investigator, thus undermining his claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 162. He alleges that the failure to \"conduct EEO counseling ... and a limited inquiry into Plaintiff's new claims of discrimination\" violated his constitutional rights to due process and free speech.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 157. Related to this claim, Defendants filed with the Court an exhibit, of which they ask the Court to take judicial notice, which is a letter dated February 2, 2017, in which Mr. Smith informed Mr. Richardson that his complaint was dismissed in accord with EEO regulations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. to Dismiss, Ex. 1, 2/2/2017 Letter to Mr. Richardson (2017 Letter) [Dkt. 34-1] (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201614.107\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), (3) );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Am.

Rather, they contend, Mr. Smith was following EEO regulations when he determined that Mr. Richardson's claim should be denied and, moreover, that failure properly to process an EEO complaint cannot amount to a constitutional violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. at 30.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   As to the first point, the Court agrees in part with Defendants. Mr. Richardson filed his new EEO claim via email to Mr. Smith on December 4, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2017 Letter at 1 (describing Mr. Richardson's emailed claim). Approximately 2 months later, on February 2, 2017, Mr. Smith issued a letter to Mr. Richardson denying the claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679212\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/223/#p235\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In his letter, Mr. Smith cited EEO regulations that provide for the dismissal of an entire complaint under certain circumstances, including where the complainant has a pending EEO complaint raising the same issues,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201614.107\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), or where there is a pending case in United States District Court raising the same issues, provided that at least 180 days have passed since the filing of the administrative complaint.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201614.107\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3). Mr. Smith's application of \u00a7 1614.107(a)(3), however, appears to have been premature, because at the time of the denial less than 180 days had passed since Mr. Richardson filed his December 4, 2016 complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201614.107\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3) (permitting denial if the claim is pending or has been litigated in district court, but only if 180 days have passed since the administrative complaint was filed).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Regardless, accepting all of Mr. Richardson's allegations as true and\n   construing his claims liberally,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2), (f), Mr. Richardson has not plausibly alleged any constitutional violation. As Defendants argue, other Judges in this Court have found that alleged improper handling of an EEO complaint does not give rise to a constitutional violation. Defendants cite a line of cases that stand for the proposition that a district court does not sit to review the administrative handling of EEO complaints.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coulibaly v.

If an employee believes a claim has been mishandled he must first exhaust his administrative appeal remedies and then proceed to a court for review of the substantive discrimination claim, not its administrative processing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coulibaly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271591\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/213/93/#p143\">\n    213 F.Supp.3d at 143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Mr. Richardson has already pursued, in\n   <em>\n    Richardson I\n   </em>\n   , the discrimination claims at issue in the administrative complaint denied by Mr. Smith.
