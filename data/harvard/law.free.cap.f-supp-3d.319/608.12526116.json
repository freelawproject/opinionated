(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Moreover, Defendant argues that the Second Circuit has itself recognized the abrogation of its pre-\n   <em>\n    2010 Johnson\n   </em>\n   decisions, including specifically as to third-degree robberies, albeit in the context of crimes of violence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7 (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In addition, the Government argues that the Second Circuit has \"repeatedly\" held second-degree robberies to be violent felonies under New York law based on the same element of forcible stealing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Government also contends that the examples Defendant provides are unpersuasive, arguing that they inherently involve either\n   <em>\n    threatened\n   </em>\n   use of violent force or sufficient quantum of force\n   <em>\n    capable\n   </em>\n   of causing physical pain or injury.

The Government had argued that because section 924(e)(2)(B)(i), unlike section 922(g)(8)(C)(ii), did not specify that \"physical injury\" must reasonably be expected to cause \"bodily injury,\" the Supreme Court should draw an inference that the merest touch sufficed. Finding the Government's argument to be without merit, but without deciding the issue, the Supreme Court explained that the absence of the term \"bodily injury\" from 924(e)(2)(B)(i) could also logically be construed as requiring \"only that degree of force necessary to inflict pain-a slap in the face, for example.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581927,12446767\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/176/1/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Despite recognizing that a slap may carry with it the \"degree of force necessary to inflict pain,\" the Supreme Court did not find that slaps are examples of violent force.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581927,12446767\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/176/1/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    The Supreme Court appears to have used the slap example primarily to point out the logical fallacy of the Government's argument, and not as an endorsement that slaps constitute violent force.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581927,12446767\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/176/1/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Indeed, in\n    <em>\n     Castleman\n    </em>\n    , Justice Scalia, the author of\n    <em>\n     2010 Johnson\n    </em>\n    , acknowledged in a concurrence that\n    <em>\n     2010 Johnson\n    </em>\n    had only held that a slap\n    <em>\n     might\n    </em>\n    be violent force.\n    <em>\n     United States v.
