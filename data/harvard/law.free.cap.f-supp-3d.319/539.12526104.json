Trump issued a statement via Twitter announcing that \"the United States Government will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military.\" This lawsuit followed. On October 30, 2017, the Court issued a preliminary injunction, the effect of which was to revert to the\n     <em>\n      status quo ante\n     </em>\n     with regard to military policy on transgender service.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-9\">\n     Defendants have filed several motions which are currently pending before the Court, including Defendants' [89] Motion for a Protective Order and [90] Partial Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings and Unopposed Motion to Partially Dissolve the Preliminary Injunction, both of which relate only to the status of President Donald J. Trump as a party in this litigation. In summary form, Defendants move for the dismissal of the President as a party in this case. In addition, Defendants move to dissolve the preliminary injunction as it applies to the President only. Finally, Defendants also move for an order that the President himself does not have to respond to certain discovery requests that Plaintiffs have issued to him as a party in this case.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-10\">\n     Upon consideration of the pleadings,\n     <footnotemark>\n      1\n     </footnotemark>\n     the relevant legal authorities, and the record as a whole, the Court will GRANT Defendant's Partial Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings and to Partially Dissolve the Preliminary Injunction only as to President Trump as a Defendant in this case. The President will be dismissed as a party and the Court's preliminary injunction will be dissolved only as it applies to the President. The Court shall not grant injunctive or declaratory relief directly against the President with respect to his discretionary acts that are the focus of this lawsuit. Because no relief will be granted directly against the President in this case, the Court will dismiss him as a party to avoid unnecessary constitutional confrontations. The Court emphasizes that, regardless of this decision, the Court is still able to review the legality of the President's actions, and Plaintiffs-if successful-can\n     still obtain\n     <em>\n      all\n     </em>\n     of the relief that they seek. Given that the President is no longer a party to the case, the Court will DENY as MOOT Defendants' Motion for a Protective Order. That motion sought to prevent discovery that Plaintiffs had requested from the President as a party to this case. The President is no longer a party.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-11\">\n     <strong>\n      I.

Confrontation can be easily avoided here, because dismissing the President will have little or no substantive effect on this litigation. Plaintiffs argue that the acts of the President himself are central to this case, and the Court agrees. But dismissing the President as a Defendant does not mean that those acts will not be subject to judicial review. The Court can still review those acts and, if Plaintiffs are successful in proving that they are unconstitutional, Plaintiffs can still obtain all of the relief that they seek from the other Defendants.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Defs.' Mot. at 7 (conceding that \"Plaintiffs could obtain full relief for their alleged injuries through injunctive relief against\" the Defendants other than the President);\n     <em>\n      see also\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Swan\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3696667,11942173\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/100/973/\">\n      100 F.3d at 978\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (\"In most cases, any conflict between the desire to avoid confronting the elected head of a coequal branch of government and to ensure the rule of law can be successfully bypassed, because the injury at issue can be rectified by injunctive relief against subordinate officials.\").\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-18\">\n     Plaintiffs raise a number of arguments against dismissal of the President, but none of them are persuasive. First, Plaintiffs argue that the case law cited above addresses whether injunctive and declaratory relief is available against the President, not whether the President must be dismissed from a civil lawsuit altogether. This is true. However, the Court's decision, informed by this case law, that it will not grant relief against the President still counsels in favor of dismissing him as a party from this case. It makes little sense to retain a party in a case from whom no relief will be granted under ordinary circumstances, and especially little sense when retaining that party risks unnecessary constitutional confrontations. By this ruling the Court does not, as Plaintiffs suggest, announce a new rule of \"absolute immunity\" for the President from civil suits for equitable relief. The Court merely holds that on the particular facts of this case-where no relief is available from the President himself, the Court can review the policy at issue without the President as a party, and Plaintiffs can obtain all of the relief that they seek from other Defendants-there is no sound reason for risking\n     constitutional confrontations by retaining the President as a Defendant.\n     <footnotemark>\n      3\n     </footnotemark>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-19\">\n     Second, Plaintiffs point out that Defendants did not move to dismiss the President earlier, and suggest that Defendants are only now seeking to do so now in order to avoid the President having to respond to pending discovery requests. Defendants' motion was technically timely. A party may move for judgment on the pleadings \"[a]fter the pleadings are closed-but early enough not to delay trial.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c). More importantly, even assuming that Plaintiffs are correct about Defendants' motive in moving to dismiss the President, the Court would hesitate to deny the motion on that basis. Regardless of the motivation for filing it, Defendants' motion presents sound reasons for dismissing the President based on well-established separation of power principles set forth in United States Supreme Court and D.C. Circuit precedent. Plaintiffs argue that if the President is dismissed, seeking discovery from him will be more difficult. Pls.' Opp'n at 1-2. But it would not be appropriate to retain the President as a party to this case simply because it will be more complicated to seek discovery from him if he is dismissed. To the extent that there exists relevant and appropriate discovery related to the President, Plaintiffs will still be able to obtain that discovery despite the President not being a party to the case.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-20\">\n     Third, Plaintiffs cite\n     <em>\n      Nat'l Treasury Employees Union v.

Defendants' motion is accordingly MOOT and will be DENIED on that basis. However, the Court reiterates that dismissing the President as a party to this case does not mean that Plaintiffs are prevented from pursuing discovery related to the President.

After all of those opinions have been issued, if necessary, the Court will give the parties further guidance on the resolution of the discovery disputes in this case.\n     <footnotemark>\n      5\n     </footnotemark>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-24\">\n     <strong>\n      III. CONCLUSION\n     </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-25\">\n     For the foregoing reasons, the Court will GRANT Defendants' Partial Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings and to Partially Dissolve the Preliminary Injunction, and DENY as MOOT Defendants' Motion for a Protective Order. An appropriate Order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-28\">\n     The Court's consideration has focused on the following documents:\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-29\">\n     \u2022 Defs.'

Reply\").\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-35\">\n     In an exercise of its discretion, the Court finds that holding oral argument in this action would not be of assistance in rendering a decision.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     LCvR 7(f).\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-36\">\n     Indeed, Plaintiffs themselves appear to recognize that at least the injunctive relief they originally sought in this case should not be entered against the President, as they have now amended their complaint to exempt the President from their prayer for that relief.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Compl. at 20.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-37\">\n     Plaintiffs point to a number of cases where the President has been a named party.\n     <em>\n      See, e.g.\n     </em>\n     , Pls.' Opp'n at 4. But in those cases, the issue of dismissing the President as a party does not appear to have been raised or analyzed. The Court is unwilling to interpret those Courts' silence as an implicit holding on whether retaining the President under the present circumstances is appropriate.\n     <em>\n      Cf.\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Arizona Christian Sch.
