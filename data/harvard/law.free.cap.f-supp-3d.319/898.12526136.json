LAWSON, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Court filed an opinion and order on March 27, 2018 denying in part the defendants' motion to dismiss. Defendants Southfield Schools and the Southfield Board of Education moved for reconsideration of that part of the opinion finding that certain provisions of the Michigan Revised School Code create a property interest in teachers' annual effectiveness ratings, which is protected by the Due Process Clause. The defendants also moved to stay the case, and asked the Court to certify the question for interlocutory appeal or refer it to the Michigan Supreme Court. Finding no merit in any of these motions, the Court will deny them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The grounds for reconsideration motions are (or should be) well known to the defendants.

Compl. \u00b6 35. As discussed in the Court's earlier opinion, in determining a teacher's effectiveness rating pursuant to the policy, the defendants' discretion is substantively constrained by the factors spelled out in section 1248 and the system prescribed in section 1249.

The court of appeals initially concluded that the trial court erred by dismissing Count III for lack of jurisdiction because the plaintiffs' argument was more appropriately construed as a claim under the Revised School Code, sections 1248 and 1249, which does not fall within the State Tenure Commission's administrative jurisdiction.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12554960\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/909/1/\">\n    320 Mich.

Nor did it discuss (let alone decide) a teacher's entitlement to the benefit of that rating under the Due Process Clause when a school district makes employment decisions. Instead, the defendants conflate the court of appeals's analyses on Count III and Count IV of the complaint in\n   <em>\n    Southfield III\n   </em>\n   to reach a holding that is much broader than what is actually announced in that case. The defendants, it appears, initially misunderstand the court's characterization of Count III-statutory claims under the Revised School Code-to somehow affect the court's treatment of the plaintiffs' separate due process claim in Count IV. But when discussing Count III, the court merely clarified what it believed to be the true grounds for the plaintiffs' claim, which apparently were identical to the allegations in Count I (violation of section 1248) and Count II (violation of section 1249) of the complaint in that case. The court affirmed dismissal of those statutory claims in earlier sections of the opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The defendants here misrepresent the holding in\n   <em>\n    Southfield III\n   </em>\n   , contending that the court \"plainly\" rejected a due process claim that teachers have a right to continuous employment as a tenured teacher based on effectiveness status. According to the defendants, the court of appeals's characterization of the Teacher Tenure Act claim in Count III meant that the due process claim in Count IV, also sourced in the Teacher Tenure Act, somehow transformed into a due process claim sourced in the Revised School Code. But that argument is not supported by a plain reading of the opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   When the court of appeals addressed the plaintiffs' due process claim, it did not mince words when it constrained its analysis to the Teacher Tenure Act. The present defendants admit as much, noting that the court's property interest analysis focused on the Teacher Tenure Act. The court began its discussion with the relevant statutory provision, Michigan Compiled Laws \u00a7 38.91(1), and went on to describe the scope of the property interest sourced in that provision and recognized under Michigan law. The court clarified that the elimination of Smith's position\n   constituted a layoff due to a necessary reduction in personnel, not a dismissal or demotion covered by the Teacher Tenure Act. In announcing that \"the right of continuous employment for tenured teachers simply does not apply\n   <em>\n    in this case\n   </em>\n   ,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12554960\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/909/1/\">\n    320 Mich.

The court made no pronouncement on the viability of a due process claim based on the Revised School Code, noting only that layoffs are now governed by that statute. The defendants contend that by not recognizing a property interest sourced in the Revised School Code, the court of appeals foreclosed future litigants from bringing such a claim. But that argument stretches an otherwise narrow holding well beyond its intended bounds. Borrowing the defendants' language, \"to say that something is so does not make it so.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The defendants' corollary argument-that if a due process right existed here, the court of appeals would have reversed the trial court's ruling as to Count IV-fails for the same reason. Count IV plainly addressed a property interest sourced in the Teacher Tenure Act, whereas the instant plaintiffs are arguing that they have a property interest in continuous employment sourced in the Revised School Code. Moreover, the defendants' reliance on the\n   <em>\n    Southfield III\n   </em>\n   court's reasoning in Section I of the opinion is misplaced, as that section disposed of the plaintiffs' claim under section 1248. The court found no statutory violation based on Smith's particular circumstances where she held no effectiveness rating for the job for which she applied but was not hired into.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12554960\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/909/1/\">\n    320 Mich.

Once again, the defendants conflate distinct portions of the court's opinion to substantiate a position this Court rejected previously.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Finally, the defendants argue that this Court's decision, in recognizing a federal tort, undoes\n   <em>\n    Southfield III.\n   </em>\n   The defendants assert that based on this Court's holding, plaintiff Smith now is entitled to a pre-deprivation hearing for each position which the District denied her as well as money damages, an outcome at odds with\n   <em>\n    Southfield III.\n   </em>\n   The defendants apparently reach this conclusion by focusing on what\n   <em>\n    Southfield III\n   </em>\n   did not say, rather than on what that court made clear. The court found that there is no section 1248 violation where a teacher is denied a position for which she has no effectiveness rating. The court also found that plaintiff Smith could not state a claim for a due process violation where she sourced her property interest in the Teacher Tenure Act, and was laid off rather than dismissed or demoted. This Court, on the other hand, concluded that an effectiveness rating sourced in the Revised School Code, once earned, is a property interest entitled to protection under the Due Process Clause. Because \"a state law that creates the interest can define the scope of the interest,\"\n   <em>\n    Southfield III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12554960\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/909/1/\">\n    320 Mich.
