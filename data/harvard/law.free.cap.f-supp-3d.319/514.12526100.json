MCFADDEN, U.S.D.J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reimburses hospitals for certain costs they incur in providing healthcare to Medicare beneficiaries. To pay the hospitals, the Department uses a Prospective Payment System (\"PPS\") to establish predetermined rates for each treatment type. The PPS features a \"wage index,\" a multiplier that adjusts reimbursements to reflect regional variations in labor costs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ww. Hospitals submit annual cost reports to the Department, which are used to determine regional urban and rural wage rates. For each state, the rural rate acts as a \"floor\" ensuring that state hospitals receive at least that rate for their labor costs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pub. L. No. 105-33, \u00a7 4410 (1997).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Massachusetts-based Baystate Franklin Medical Center and its affiliates (\"Baystate\" or \"Plaintiffs\") challenge the Department's calculation of the wage index. The Department raised Baystate's 2017 index to the state's rural floor, as Plaintiffs' own labor costs were lower. Pl.'s Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. (\"Pl.'s MSJ Mem.\") 7, ECF No. 23-1. Remarkably, Nantucket Cottage Hospital (\"Nantucket\") is Massachusetts' only \"rural\" hospital as defined by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ww, and thus it sets the state's PPS reimbursement floor. Compl. 6, ECF No. 1. Nantucket erroneously reported some of its labor costs in 2015, causing its average hourly wage to be understated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It failed to seek corrections to its data until more than seven months after a nationwide deadline for such requests. Def.'s Mem. in Supp. of Def.'s Cross Mot. for Summ. J. (\"Def.'s Cross-MSJ. Mem.\") 9, ECF No. 25-1. The Department denied Nantucket's untimely request and used the earlier submitted\n   data to calculate the index.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. As a result, Baystate received $19,907,000 less in 2017 reimbursements than it would have if Nantucket had timely submitted accurate data.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Baystate asserts that, as applied to Plaintiffs, the decision to use Nantucket's uncorrected data was arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion. Compl. 8. Baystate also challenges the Department's interpretation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395oo, the statute that establishes the Provider Reimbursement Review Board (\"Board\"). Plaintiffs contend that the Board must have the authority to grant relief when one hospital's claim is based on the inaccuracy of another's data.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Department Secretary Alex Azar\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (the \"Secretary\") disagrees. He alleges that using the uncorrected data was a reasonable exercise of the agency's discretion, as Nantucket missed a clearly articulated deadline and because of the Department's interests in finality and efficiency. Def.'s Cross-MSJ. Mem. 9, 16. The Secretary further argues that the Board's grant of expedited review and the instant case validate the Department's interpretation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Both parties seek summary judgment on the undisputed administrative record. I find that the Department's decision to require hospitals to correct their own wage data within program deadlines was reasonable, that Baystate's reimbursement was increased to reflect the region's labor costs as contemplated by the wage index statute, and that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395oo does not obligate the Board to grant relief based on the inaccuracy of another hospital's data. I will therefore grant summary judgment for the Secretary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Medicare is a federally funded program that provides health insurance for the elderly, the disabled, and for people with end-stage renal disease.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201395\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   A \"complex statutory and regulatory regime governs [the] reimbursement\" of healthcare providers who treat Medicare beneficiaries.\n   <em>\n    Good Samaritan Hosp. v.

Even without the proposed correction, Baystate received a higher wage index and thus greater remuneration than it would have received had the Secretary relied on Plaintiffs' labor costs alone. Baystate thus received the benefit of a reimbursement \"reflecting the relative hospital wage level in the geographic area of the hospital\" as 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ww requires. The appeals process accorded to Baystate by the Department was also based on a permissible reading of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395oo, as that statute does not require that one hospital be allowed to contest the factual submissions of others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As Baystate admits, Congress has not directly spoken to the precise question at issue here. Pl.'s MSJ Mem. 13 n.8. In fact, the Medicare Act \"expressly affords the Secretary flexibility and discretion in compiling data and calculating the wage index.\"\n   <em>\n    Anna Jacques Hosp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6772208,4331167\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/797/1155/\">\n    797 F.3d at 1164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The statute notes that the Secretary \"shall update the [wage index] ... on the basis of a survey conducted by the Secretary (and updated as appropriate) of the wages and wage-related costs\" borne by participating hospitals. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ww(d)(3)(E). Analyzing this language, the D.C. Circuit has concluded that the statute \"merely requires the Secretary to develop a mechanism to remove the effects of local wage differences [and] does not specify how the Secretary should construct the index.\"\n   <em>\n    Anna Jacques Hosp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6772208,4331167\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/797/1155/\">\n    797 F.3d at 1164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is silent about how the survey must be conducted, the deadlines to be employed, and the extent to which hospitals should be allowed to submit corrected data responses. And Baystate concedes that the Secretary \"undoubtedly enjoys broad discretion in developing the wage index calculation process.\" Pl.'s Mem. in Opp. to Def.'s Cross-Mot. 2, ECF No. 27. Thus, the only\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   issue is whether the Secretary's exercise of his broad discretion was reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Secretary's explanations for rejecting Nantucket's corrected data demonstrate the reasonableness of his decision. The proposed corrections fell \"outside the scope of the FY 2017 Wage Index Development Timetable.\" J.A. 22. The Department has an interest in \"maintaining the integrity and fairness of the wage index calculation\" and has \"consistently\" emphasized the importance of meeting the deadlines in each year's promulgation of the PPS program rules. J.A. 161. Because of the lengthy and complex index development process, and because each hospital's data impacts the calculations for both its regional index and the national index, it is not unreasonable for CMS to place the burden on individual hospitals to correct their errors in a timely manner. Needless to say, hospitals have a strong financial motivation to ensure they are submitting timely, accurate data. Moreover, were the\n   Secretary to allow Nantucket to correct its data after the deadline, he would presumably need to allow other hospitals to make similar corrections. Allowing untimely revisions from hospitals across the country without a firm deadline could result in substantial delays to the Secretary's administration of the PPS program. Creating and strictly adhering to a timetable for the annual wage index thus represents a permissible implementation of the statutory language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Secretary's refusal to allow other hospitals, like Baystate, to correct Nantucket's data was also reasonable and fully in accord with controlling precedent. In\n   <em>\n    Methodist Hospital\n   </em>\n   , a Sacramento-area hospital submitted inaccurate wage data eventually used to calculate the 1984 wage index.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3614630,1852487\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/38/1225/\">\n    38 F.3d at 1228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The error caused the hospital's actual labor costs to be understated, and thus lowered the area's index. Other Sacramento hospitals recognized the error once the index was published, and appealed to the Board, concerned that the error would lower their remuneration too.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3614630,1852487\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/38/1225/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, the Department \"refused to apply the recalculated wage index retroactively.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3614630,1852487\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/38/1225/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The D.C. Circuit upheld the Department's decision and granted summary judgment to the Secretary. It noted that \"a change in a single wage index could affect the payment rates applicable for each hospital\" and that under such circumstances \"retroactive corrections would cause a significant, if not debilitating disruption to the Secretary's administration of the already-complex Medicare program.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3614630,1852487\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/38/1225/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3614630,1852487\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/38/1225/\">\n    at 1233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court concluded that it was simply \"not arbitrary and capricious of the Secretary to decide that the administrative burden of recalculating the reimbursement rate for every hospital in a metropolitan area every time any hospital in that area makes an error in reporting wage data outweighs the increase in accuracy that would result.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3614630,1852487\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/38/1225/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   So too here. Baystate's attempts to distinguish its claims from those raised in\n   <em>\n    Methodist Hospital\n   </em>\n   are unpersuasive. First, Plaintiffs argue that the wage index assigned to Baystate was required to reflect a comparison of Massachusetts' rural wage level to the national average and that it \"reflect[ed] nothing of the sort because it harbors a significant and uncorrected error.\" Pl.'s MSJ Mem. 12. However, Baystate did receive an index reflecting not their lower labor costs, but the higher costs claimed by Nantucket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Switching from indices to dollars and cents shows what is at stake. Nantucket's uncorrected average hourly wage for 2017 was $43.78. Pl.'s MSJ Mem. 8. Even without the correction Baystate seeks, this average reflects regional trends. Springfield, Massachusetts, had an average hourly wage of $41.84, Pittsfield's average was $44.58, and Worcester's average was $47.83.\n   <em>\n    Wage Index Table by CBSA - FY 2016\n   </em>\n   , CENTERS FOR MEDICARE &amp; MEDICAID SERVICES (\"CMS Wage Index Table\") (last visited July 30, 2018), https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/AcuteInpatientPPS/Downloads/FY2016-CMS-1632-FR-Table-2-3.zip. Baystate's request to be compensated at Nantucket's proposed correction would result in a reimbursement rate of $60.50 per labor hour. Pl.'s MSJ Mem. 8. This would be a substantial windfall, implying that Baystate's average hourly labor costs were greater than those in Boston ($54.88), New York City ($53.67), and Los Angeles ($51.77).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CMS Wage Index Table. Thus, the assertion that Baystate's actual reimbursements failed to reflect regional wage rates is undermined by the region's labor cost data.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Next, Baystate argues that, even if the Secretary's decision was reasonable as applied\n   to Nantucket, it was arbitrary and capricious with respect to Plaintiffs because \"Baystate and other hospitals had no control over or ability to identify errors in [Nantucket's] cost report.\" Pl.'s MSJ Mem. 15. Moreover, the Secretary's explanation, Plaintiffs argue, \"contains no indication that the Secretary even considered the impact that [Nantucket's] errors would have on other hospitals and whether fairness was served by subjecting them to [Nantucket's] error.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3614630,1852487\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/38/1225/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, the administrative record belies this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   While it is true enough that Baystate had no control over Nantucket's cost reporting, the Secretary weighed the potential unfairness of Baystate's lack of control against the consequences of allowing data corrections after the deadline. The Secretary considered the positions of Baystate, the Massachusetts Health and Hospital Association, and hospitals and associations from around the country. J.A. 161. He weighed the Massachusetts area hospitals' interests in allowing the correction and obtaining a higher reimbursement against the \"further lower wage index values for hospitals nationwide\" that would result from raising the state's rural floor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3614630,1852487\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/38/1225/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He also considered the fairness of allowing untimely corrections given the program's well-documented and consequential deadlines.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3614630,1852487\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/38/1225/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, the Secretary's proffered explanations do address the soundness of his decision with respect to third parties like Baystate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Finally, Baystate contends that the Secretary must use \"the most reliable evidence available\" to ensure calculations that are \"reasonably accurate.\" Pl.'s Mem. in Opp. to Def.'s Cross-Mot. 5 (citing\n   <em>\n    Baystate Med.

The Secretary was therefore justified in relying on the reports provided by Nantucket and other hospitals within the window for submitting and correcting labor cost data.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In summary, the Secretary reasonably exercised his considerable discretion in enforcing the wage index's annual deadlines against Nantucket. Moreover, the resulting reimbursement Baystate received was reasonable given regional labor costs and the Secretary's interests in efficiently and fairly administering the PPS program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Baystate contends that the Secretary \"flouted the statutory right conferred on providers to obtain wage index relief from the [Board]\" because of his position that a hospital \"is entitled to no relief where [a challenge before the Board] is based on inaccuracies in another hospital's data.\" Pl.'s MSJ Mem. 18-19. However, nothing in the Medicare statute obligates the Board to provide such relief, and the Secretary's interpretation of the statute is reasonable. Section 1395oo(a) of the Medicare Act states that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Any provider of services\n   <em>\n    which has filed a required cost report\n   </em>\n   within the time specified in regulations may obtain a hearing\n   <em>\n    with respect to such cost report\n   </em>\n   by a Provider Reimbursement Review Board (hereinafter referred to as the \"Board\") which shall be established by the Secretary in accordance with subsection (h) and (except as provided in subsection (g)(2)) any hospital which receives payments in amounts computed under subsection (b) or (d) of section 1395ww of this title and which has submitted such reports within such time as the Secretary may require in order to make payment under such section may obtain a hearing with respect to such payment by the Board, if such provider ... is dissatisfied with a final determination of the Secretary as to the amount of the payment ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395oo(a) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The statute does not mention a hospital's right to seek relief from the Board based on erroneous cost reports submitted by another hospital. To the contrary, the statute appears to allow a hospital to obtain a hearing before the Board only to challenge the cost reports that it filed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11213835\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/102/654/#p659\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dignity Health\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274608\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/243/43/#p46\">\n    243 F.Supp.3d at 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that the Department's 2004 Final Rule \"described the process for hospitals to review and revise\n   <em>\n    their\n   </em>\n   ... wage data\" and the Board's \"focus on a hospital's ability to challenge\n   <em>\n    its own\n   </em>\n   wage data\") (emphasis in original). The Secretary's determination that the Board cannot grant relief where providers challenge other hospitals' data is at least permissible under, if not required by, the plain language of \u00a7 1395oo(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Secretary's decision was also reasonable. As discussed above, a change in one hospital's data impacts the wage index for every other hospital in its region and, indeed, for every hospital nationwide.
