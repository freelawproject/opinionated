INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Charles Turpin brings suit against Metropolitan Police Department Officers Anthony Rowley and Sharon Strange, the District of Columbia, and landlord Darnell Ray. Mr. Turpin asserts individual and municipal liability claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   against Officers Rowley and Strange and the District of Columbia for violations of his Fourth Amendment right to freedom from unreasonable seizures. He has also brought common law claims for trespass, false arrest, wrongful eviction, and malicious prosecution against Officers Rowley and Strange, and the common law claim of malicious prosecution against the District of Columbia. He further asserts individual common law claims against Darnell Ray for wrongful eviction, false arrest, and malicious prosecution. For the forthcoming reasons, the Court grants Officers Rowley and Strange's motion to dismiss the \u00a7 1983\n   claims of illegal entry, false arrest, and malicious prosecution. Furthermore, the Court grants the District of Columbia's motion to dismiss the \u00a7 1983 municipal liability claim. Finally, the Court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Mr. Turpin's remaining state law claims. Thus, the common law claims of false arrest, trespass, wrongful eviction, and malicious prosecution against Officers Rowley and Strange; of malicious prosecution against the District of Columbia; and of wrongful eviction, false arrest, and malicious prosecution against Darnell Ray will be remanded to the D.C. Superior Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Mr. Turpin maintained that the Writ of Restitution against him had expired and that he had a right to remain in the apartment.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Following this conversation, Officers Rowley and Strange entered the apartment, arrested Mr. Turpin, and forcibly removed him from the premises.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26-30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Following his arrest, Mr. Turpin was charged with destruction of property and resisting arrest and was prosecuted fully.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.

Furthermore, discovery in this case has not yet begun, and the case has not progressed in federal court past Defendants' motions to dismiss. Additionally, because Mr. Turpin originally filed his case in D.C. Superior Court, he will not be prejudiced by a return to his preferred forum.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Turner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4067300\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/56/32/#p37\">\n    56 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   37 ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schuler v.

Extensive federal judicial resources have not been expended on this case yet, and as a D.C. resident, Mr. Turpin will not be inconvenienced or disadvantaged by pursuing his case in Superior Court. Because no clear unfairness will result from a decision not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Mr. Turpin's remaining claims, the common law claims against Officers Rowley and Strange, the District of Columbia, and Mr. Ray are remanded to D.C. Superior Court where Mr. Turpin may continue to prosecute his local causes of action under\n   D.C. law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Floyd v.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court grants Officers Rowley and Strange's motion to dismiss the \u00a7 1983 claims of illegal entry, false arrest, and malicious prosecution. The Court additionally grants the District of Columbia's motion to dismiss the \u00a7 1983 municipal liability claim. As to the remaining claims, the Court remands the case to the D.C. Superior Court for adjudication of the state law claims against Officers Rowley and Strange for trespass, illegal entry, false arrest, and wrongful eviction; against the District of Columbia for malicious prosecution; and against Darnell Ray for wrongful eviction, false arrest, and malicious prosecution.
