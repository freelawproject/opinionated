INCT is an abbreviation for incentive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stokes Dep. at 67. This ensures Wal-Mart is in compliance with California Labor Code \u00a7 510(a), which requires employers to factor in an employee's non-discretionary remuneration when calculating that employee's overtime pay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marin v.

According to Todd Stokes, Wal-Mart's \"Regional HR Director,\" as a matter of Wal-Mart's policy and practice, none of Wal-Mart's Statements of Final Pay from December 2015 onwards included pay period start or end dates.

Wal-Mart contests the underlying \u00a7 226(a)(6) and \u00a7 226(a)(9) violations. Wal-Mart also advances the threshold arguments that Plaintiff's summary judgment motion is barred by the one-way intervention rule, that Plaintiff can only claim limited damages under\n   California Labor Code \u00a7 226(e), and that Plaintiff failed to administratively exhaust his PAGA claim before filing this action. The Court first addresses Wal-Mart's threshold arguments, and then turns to the alleged \u00a7 226(a)(6) and \u00a7 226(a)(9) violations that undergird Plaintiff's PAGA claim. The Court finds that Wal-Mart's threshold arguments are unpersuasive, and agrees with Plaintiff's \u00a7 226(a)(6) and \u00a7 226(a)(9) arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

One-Way Intervention Rule\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Wal-Mart argues that the Court should refuse to rule on Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment under the one-way intervention rule. This is unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(c)(2) seeks \"to ensure that the plaintiff class receives notice of the action well\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the merits of the case are adjudicated.\"\n   <em>\n    Schwarzschild v.

Instead, Plaintiff argues that the Court should excuse the premature filing because the LWDA has not acted on Plaintiff's notice in the 17 months since Plaintiff originally provided it.

Second, Plaintiff argues that Wal-Mart violated \u00a7 226(a)(6) by failing to include the start and end dates of the pay period in employees' Statements of Final Pay.

Stokes Dep. at 67 (\"[OVERTIME/INCT] is not an incentive, this is additional overtime pay that was granted because the incentive was received by the associate.\"). Despite this, the OVERTIME/INCT item does not list a rate of overtime pay. Wal-Mart's wage statement therefore does not comply with the text of \u00a7 226(a)(9) because it does not list an hourly rate for the OVERTIME/INCT item and therefore does not list \"all applicable hourly rates.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Nor do the wage statements allow employees to determine the overtime rate through application of simple math. Absent any indication as to what OVERTIME/INCT is, employees have no idea how it relates to regular overtime pay and how to use the OVERTIME/INCT sum to calculate the new overtime rate. Underscoring the point, Todd Stokes, Wal-Mart's Regional Human Resources Director and Rule 30(b)(6) witness, testified that the formula used to determine the OVERTIME/INCT sum did not appear on wage statements because it was \"too complex.\" Stokes Dep. at 69, 77. Indeed, there is no guarantee that an employee would think to apply a calculation at all. Nor can Wal-Mart\n   fall back on the usual rule that overtime is simply 1.5 times base pay-that calculation is no longer simple math when the wage statement lists two different overtime payments and only provides a rate for one of them.\n   <em>\n    McKenzie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4191294\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/765/1222/#p1232\">\n    765 F.Supp.2d at 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding \u00a7 226(a)(9) violation because \"FedEx's wage statement does not provide an accurate overtime rate because instead of multiplying the regular rate of pay by one and one-half, the pay stubs provide two overtime rate categories and they each provide corresponding rates that are either the same or half of the regular rate.\"). The bottom line is that math cannot be simple if the employee does not know what math to apply. The OVERTIME/INCT item therefore does not satisfy \u00a7 226(a)(9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Wal-Mart contends that this is not dispositive because \u00a7 226(a)(9) does not apply to the OVERTIME/INCT item. Specifically, Wal-Mart argues that because a MyShare award is not based on an hourly rate or hours worked, the OVERTIME/INCT that derives from the MyShare award is not based on an hourly rate or hours worked. It follows that the OVERTIME/INCT item is not subject to \u00a7 226(a)(9) because the statute requires wage statements to include \"hourly rates\" and \"hours worked.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Wal-Mart's premise is flawed. Wal-Mart's designated Rule 30(b)(6) witness admitted that OVERTIME/INCT is overtime pay. Indeed, the reason the OVERTIME/INCT item exists is to account for the increase in an employee's overtime pay that stems from an employee's receipt of an incentive award. Stokes Dep. at 67-68 (\"If an associate received an incentive at the end of the quarter and worked overtime during that quarter, that incentive is, then, calculated into their overtime rate and given to them on that line item, OVERTIME/INCENTIVE.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 69-70 (\"[T]he fact that ...

Stokes Decl. \u00b6 9. In line with this practice, Wal-Mart provides employees with biweekly wage statements corresponding to the pay period.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=113%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%2010\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   These wage statements list the start and end dates of the pay period.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 67-1 at 34 (one of Plaintiff's wage statements for \"Pay Period Beginning Date: 12-26-2015 through Ending Date: 01-08-2016\"). When an employee is terminated, Wal-Mart pays all wages earned through the date of termination by check. Stokes Decl. \u00b6 9. On the date of termination, the employee also receives a \"Statement of Final Pay\" that lists the wages being paid to the employee at the end of employment. Stokes Dep. at 82; Stokes Decl. \u00b6 9. These Statements of Final Pay do not specify pay period start or end dates. Stokes Dep. at 89-91; ECF No. 67-1 at 36 (Statement of Final Pay for Plaintiff's last day on September 12, 2016). However, Wal-Mart also generates a final wage statement at the close of the normal biweekly pay period that does contain pay period start and end dates. Stokes Decl. \u00b6 9; ECF No. 86-2 (Plaintiff's final wage statement for biweekly pay period from September 3, 2016 to September 16, 2016). Wal-Mart tells a terminated employee how to access this final wage statement during the employee's exit interview.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=113%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%2010\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Wal-Mart does not dispute that the Statement of Final Pay omits the start and end dates for the pay period. Wal-Mart's position instead is that a terminated employee's subsequent receipt of a final wage statement-which contains the pay period dates-cures the dates' absence from the Statement of Final Pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   This argument is unpersuasive. Wal-Mart points to\n   <em>\n    Derum v.

Cal. 2015).\n   <em>\n    Derum\n   </em>\n   considered whether an employer complied with \u00a7 226(a)(6) where the employer gave employees a pay stub that lacked a pay period start date, but also at the same time provided employees with an electronic wage statement that had the start date and was therefore compliant.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4336415\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/95/1221/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4336415\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/95/1221/\">\n    at 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Wal-Mart's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Derum\n   </em>\n   is tenuous from the start because the district court there denied the employer summary judgment on the plaintiff's \u00a7 226(a)(6) claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4336415\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/95/1221/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4336415\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/95/1221/\">\n    at 1228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

By contrast, Wal-Mart here provides the final on-cycle pay statement up to two weeks after the employee receives their check and Statement of Final Pay. That matters because\n   <em>\n    Derum\n   </em>\n   's finding that a compliant wage statement could cure a noncompliant one was premised on the compliant wage statement being provided at the same time that the employee's wages were paid.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4336415\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/95/1221/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4336415\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/95/1221/\">\n    at 1226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Consequently, a wage statement can only be compliant-and thus can only cure a noncompliant wage statement-if it was provided when wages were paid.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4336415\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/95/1221/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Wal-Mart's compliant wage statement was not provided when the wages at issue were paid, which means it cannot cure the noncompliant Statement of Final Pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   On the other hand, Plaintiff's leading case lends strong support to Plaintiff's claim that the Statement of Final Pay violated \u00a7 226(a)(6).\n   <em>\n    McKenzie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4191294\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/765/1222/#p1232\">\n    765 F.Supp.2d 1222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
