Second, Plaintiff has established\n   a good faith basis for believing that Doe Defendant is a District of Columbia resident. In Plaintiff's [1] Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that it \"used IP address geolocation technology by Maxmind Inc. ('Maxmind'), an industry-leading provider of IP address intelligence and online fraud detection tools, to determine that Defendant's IP address traced to a physical address in this District.\" Compl. \u00b6 9.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    AF Holdings, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4280120,4307507\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/752/990/\">\n    752 F.3d at 996\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that plaintiff-appellee's \"refusal to cabin its suit and corresponding discovery requests to individuals whom it has some realistic chance of successfully suing in this district demonstrates that it has not 'sought the information because of its relevance to the issues' that might actually be litigated here\" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Oppenheimer Fund, Inc. v.

Accordingly, in an exercise of this Court's broad discretion under Rule 26, the Court shall grant Plaintiff leave to serve a Rule 45 subpoena on the ISP identified in Exhibit A of the [1] Complaint, Verizon Fios, for the purpose of identifying Doe Defendant's true identity prior to a Rule 26(f) conference.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., Ex. A (containing file hashes associated with IP address 72.66.118.205).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff is permitted to engage in limited, expedited discovery in order to obtain the identity of Doe Defendant by serving a Rule 45 subpoena on the ISP Verizon Fios that seeks the true name and address of Doe Defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. at 2. Any information disclosed to Plaintiff in response to the Rule 45 subpoena may be used by Plaintiff solely for the purpose of protecting Plaintiff's rights as set forth in the [1] Complaint. If and when the ISP is served with the subpoena, the ISP shall give written notice, which may include e-mail notice, to the subscriber in question within ten (10) business days. This notice shall take place prior to releasing the subscriber's identifying information to Plaintiff. If the ISP and/or Doe Defendant want to move to quash the subpoena, the party must do so before the return date of the subpoena, which shall be no earlier than thirty (30) days from the date of service. The ISP shall preserve any subpoenaed information pending the resolution of any timely filed motion to quash. Plaintiff shall provide the ISP with a copy of this Memorandum Opinion and the accompanying Order with its subpoena. On or before\n   <strong>\n    OCTOBER 8, 2018\n   </strong>\n   , Plaintiff shall file a Status Report with the Court briefly outlining its progress, including providing an expected completion date for the discovery allowed by the accompanying Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff suggests that issuance of a protective order may be appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. at 8 (citing\n   <em>\n    Malibu Media, LLC v.

Aug. 23, 2016) ). The \"protective order\" that the magistrate judge issued earlier in the\n   <em>\n    Malibu Media\n   </em>\n   litigation appears to have consisted in pertinent part of procedures for notice and contestation of the subpoena.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204444799\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court has already provided above for Doe Defendant's (and the ISP's) opportunity to challenge the subpoena in this case, and the accompanying Order shall reiterate those protections. It seems that the\n   <em>\n    Malibu Media\n   </em>\n   order also expressly provided that the defendant could use the window available for moving to quash the subpoena to also, or instead, request to litigate that subpoena anonymously.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204444799\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court finds that such an express provision is not necessary here. The Court shall reevaluate whether any further order protecting Doe Defendant's identity is appropriate if Doe Defendant raises this issue after Plaintiff serves the subpoena on the ISP. The Court finds, in the meantime, that the opportunity for the ISP and/or Doe Defendant to move to quash the subpoena provides Doe Defendant with comparable protectio\n   n that is more appropriate at this stage in the proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that Plaintiff has made a showing of \"good cause\" for the expedited discovery it seeks.
