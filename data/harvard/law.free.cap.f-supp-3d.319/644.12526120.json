SULLIVAN, District Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Petitioner Karim Poonjani, who is currently in immigration custody, brings this petition for a writ of habeas corpus seeking relief in the form of an immediate bond hearing before an immigration judge. (Doc. No. 1.) For the reasons set forth below, the petition is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Petitioner, a native of Pakistan, arrived in the United States through O'Hare International Airport on or about September 12, 2000, at which time he attempted to pass through Customs with a fake passport. (Pet. \u00b6 6.) Although Petitioner was detained and charged with being an arriving alien \"subject to removal from the United States,\" an asylum officer determined that Petitioner had a credible fear that he would be persecuted if he returned to Pakistan. (Doc. No. 1-1.) Accordingly, Petitioner was placed into administrative proceedings so that he could pursue an asylum claim and was eventually released on parole, at which point he moved to Belleville, New York. (Pet. \u00b6\u00b6 6-8.) Nevertheless, although Petitioner's immigration proceedings were transferred from Illinois to New York to accommodate his move, Petitioner did not appear for his asylum hearing and was ordered removed\n   <em>\n    in absentia\n   </em>\n   by an immigration judge on July 12, 2001. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Although Petitioner remained in the United States for nearly fifteen years, on December 3, 2015, he was arrested and charged in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York for failing to report cash income to the Internal Revenue Service. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10);\n   <em>\n    see also United States v. Poonjani\n   </em>\n   , 16-cr-792 (VB). On January 11, 2017, Petitioner pleaded guilty before Judge Briccetti, who sentenced him on April 17, 2017 to time served (of one day) followed by one year of supervised release; Judge Briccetti also ordered Petitioner to pay restitution in the amount of $51,698 to the Internal Revenue Service. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11, 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On January 17, 2017, after his guilty plea but before his sentencing, Petitioner was arrested and detained by immigration authorities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.) Petitioner filed a motion to reopen his removal proceedings and an application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture on March 30, 2017, based on the risk of persecution and violence that he faced in Pakistan as a result of his Ismaili Shia faith. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.) Although an immigration judge\n   granted Petitioner's motion to reopen his immigration proceedings for the purpose of evaluating Petitioner's application (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), the immigration judge ultimately denied Petitioner's application on November 27, 2017, and ordered him removed to Pakistan (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 26-2). On December 5, 2017, Petitioner appealed that decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. No 26-3), which granted his appeal on May 3, 2018, and remanded his application to an immigration judge for further proceedings (Doc. No. 38-1). Petitioner's application currently remains pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Meanwhile, on July 17, 2017, Petitioner filed a motion for a bond hearing with the New York Immigration Court. (Pet. \u00b6 15.) The immigration judge denied the motion on July 25, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Shortly thereafter, on August 11, 2017, Petitioner filed the instant Petition, seeking a bond hearing under the Second Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Lora v. Shanahan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4356006\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/804/601/\">\n    804 F.3d 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2015), on the ground that he had been detained for more than six months. (Pet. \u00b6 17.) On August 15, 2017, the Court ordered the government to show cause why the Petition should not be granted (Doc. No. 3), and on September 11, 2017, the government responded with a motion to dismiss the petition, asserting that Petitioner's argument that he had been detained for six months without a bond hearing was premature and would not ripen until October 25, 2017. (Doc. No. 11.) Petitioner submitted a reply brief, which also served as his brief in opposition to the government's motion to dismiss, on September 18, 2017. (Doc. No. 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On December 4, 2017, following the issuance of the subsequently-reversed order of removal and the government's concession that its motion to dismiss the Petition was likely moot because Petitioner had clearly been detained for longer than six months, the Court directed the government to respond to the Petition and scheduled a hearing for January 5, 2017. (Doc. No. 25.) The government submitted its response on December 8, 2017 (Doc. Nos. 26-27), and Petitioner tiled his reply on December 15, 2017 (Doc. No. 28). On January 5, 2018, the Court heard oral argument from both parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   During oral argument, and throughout the first round of briefing on the Petition, both parties devoted substantial attention to the application of the Second Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Lora\n   </em>\n   to this case. In\n   <em>\n    Lora\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit held that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201226\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), which requires the detention of aliens living in the United States who have committed certain criminal offenses, includes an implicit six-month limitation on the amount of time an alien may be detained without an individualized bond hearing.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4356006\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/804/601/\">\n    804 F.3d at 616\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In doing so, the Circuit relied upon the canon of constitutional avoidance, \"concluding that in order to avoid serious constitutional concerns,\" it was proper to read into the statute a six-month limit on detention without a bond hearing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4356006\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/804/601/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 614 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4356006\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/804/601/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4356006\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/804/601/\">\n    at 616\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]e hold that, in order to avoid the constitutional concerns raised by indefinite detention, an immigrant detained pursuant to section 1226(c) must be afforded a bail hearing before an immigration judge within six months of his or her detention.\"). Petitioner, unsurprisingly, maintained that\n   <em>\n    Lora\n   </em>\n   applied to his detention pursuant to Section 1225(b) and required that he receive a bond hearing, while the government argued that the case did not extend to Section 1225(b) detainees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In February, however, the Supreme Court effectively overturned\n   <em>\n    Lora\n   </em>\n   when it rejected a similar application of the canon of constitutional avoidance in\n   <em>\n    Jennings v. Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616906\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/830/\">\n    138 S.Ct. 830\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616906\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/830/\">\n    200 L.Ed.2d 122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018). There, considering\n   habeas petitions brought by aliens detained pursuant to Section 1225(b) and 1226(c), the Court held that those provisions are not ambiguous, and that, in the absence of ambiguity, courts may not apply the canon of constitutional avoidance \"to rewrite a statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616906\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/830/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Consequently, the Supreme Court found that neither Section 1225(b) nor 1226(c) could fairly be read to include a six-month limit on detention.\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616906\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/830/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 842-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court did not, however, address whether the denial of individualized bond hearings for aliens detained pursuant to Section 1225(b) or Section 1226(c) violates the Due Process Clause of Constitution; instead, it remanded to the Ninth Circuit to allow that court to consider the parties' constitutional arguments \"in the first instance.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616906\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/830/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616906\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/830/\">\n    at 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court subsequently vacated the Second Circuit's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Lora\n   </em>\n   and remanded for similar proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Shanahan v. Lora\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610656,12610657,12610652,12610653,12610654,12610655\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1260/\">\n    138 S.Ct. 1260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610752,12610753,12610654,12610652,12610750,12610751\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/200/415/\">\n    200 L.Ed.2d 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018). On remand, the Second Circuit dismissed\n   <em>\n    Lora\n   </em>\n   as moot, as the removal order in that case had been withdrawn.\n   <em>\n    Lora v. Shanahan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=719%20F.%20App%27x%2079\">\n    719 F.

No. 32.) Thereafter, Petitioner filed his supplemental brief on April 6, 2018 (Doc. No. 33); the government responded on April 20, 2018 (Doc. No. 34); and Petitioner's reply was filed on April 27, 2018 (Doc. No. 35). On May 11, 2018, the Court heard further oral argument from the parties. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 39 (\"Tr.\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In light of\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   , which acknowledged that the plain language of immigration statutes do not permit a bond hearing for Petitioner, the central question in this case is whether Petitioner's detention pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201225\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) pending the completion of his administrative proceedings violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Petitioner contends that it does, arguing that, notwithstanding\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   , the prospect of \"indefinite and prolonged detention poses serious constitutional problems\" that compel relief in the form of a bond hearing. (Supp. Br. at 9.) For its part, the government asserts that because Petitioner \"remains an alien seeking initial entry\" for immigration purposes, his constitutional due process rights are defined by the immigration statutes, which do not permit bond hearings for applicants detained during the pendency of their applications for relief from removal. (Supp. Opp'n at 15.) The government argues that, given the unique interests implicated by the government's need to secure the nation's borders, the statutes in question comport with due process. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Supp. Opp'n at 10.) As it turns out, the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"372544\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/345/206/\">\n    345 U.S. 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"372544\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/345/206/\">\n    73 S.Ct. 625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=97%20L.%20Ed.%20956\">\n    97 L.Ed. 956\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1953) (\"\n   <em>\n    Mezei\n   </em>\n   \"), is directly on point and controls this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Mezei\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court considered a habeas petition filed by an immigrant, Ignatz Mezei, who, after residing in the United States for twenty-five years, traveled to eastern Europe for two years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 208,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"372544\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/345/206/\">\n    73 S.Ct. 625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nevertheless, when he arrived at Ellis Island and attempted to reenter the United States, he was refused\n   admission \"for security reasons.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"372544\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/345/206/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"372544\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/345/206/\">\n    at 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"372544\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/345/206/\">\n    73 S.Ct. 625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the United States would not allow him to enter - and because no other country would accept him - Mezei remained in detention on Ellis Island.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"372544\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/345/206/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"372544\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/345/206/\">\n    at 208-09\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"372544\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/345/206/\">\n    73 S.Ct. 625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(Tr. at 11:24-12:1.)
