Wright, United States District Judge\n  This matter is before the Court on Plaintiffs' motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. (Dkt. 6.) Plaintiffs seek to enjoin Defendant Emily Johnson Piper, in her official capacity as Commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Human Services (DHS), from taking any action that reverses, circumvents, ignores, violates, avoids, or bypasses certain payment rate increases provided for under Minnesota law. For the reasons addressed below, the Court denies the motion.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-9\">\n  <strong>\n   BACKGROUND\n  </strong>\n </opinion>\n <attorneys id=\"p-10\">\n  This case involves anticipated funding reductions to Minnesota's \"waiver services\" payment rates. Waiver services are services for which the federal government agrees, in limited circumstances, to waive certain statutory and regulatory requirements that ordinarily would govern Medicaid assistance funding.\n  <em>\n   See\n  </em>\n  <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20430.25\">\n   42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.25\n  </extracted-citation>\n  , 441.300. The state agency that administers a state's Medicaid program may apply to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for authorization to establish home and community-based waiver services, which are designed to enhance the ability of persons with disabilities to live in the community rather than in an institutional setting. Waiver services are administered by states but jointly funded by state and federal governments.\n </attorneys>\n <opinion id=\"p-11\">\n  In Minnesota, DHS is the state agency responsible for licensing, certifying, and enrolling providers of waiver services. Acting through the Commissioner, DHS also computes and approves waiver service payment rates according to Minnesota law. The Minnesota Disability Waiver Rate System (DWRS) provides a mathematical framework for establishing provider payment rates for approved waiver services.\n  <em>\n   See\n  </em>\n  Minn. Stat. \u00a7 256B.4914. Enacted by the Minnesota Legislature, DWRS went into effect on January 1, 2014. Pursuant to DWRS, waiver service payment rates adjust automatically every five years to account for inflation. The first automatic inflationary adjustment occurred on July 1, 2017.\n </opinion>\n <attorneys id=\"p-12\">\n  In addition to the DWRS automatic inflationary adjustments, the Minnesota Legislature separately enacted three session laws that increased waiver service payment rates, with effective dates in 2014 and 2015.\n  <em>\n   See\n  </em>\n  2014 Minn. Laws, Ch. 312, Art. 27, \u00a7 75; 2013 Minn. Laws, Ch. 108, Art. 7, \u00a7\u00a7 34, 60. These session laws, which cumulatively increased waiver service payment rates by 7%, affected all payment rates for Minnesota waiver service recipients without regard for the type of waiver services received or whether the payment rates had been set by DWRS.\n </attorneys>\n <opinion id=\"p-13\">\n  During the 2018 legislative session, the Minnesota Legislature passed an omnibus bill that, as relevant here, would have repealed the cumulative 7% waiver service payment rate increase and replaced it with different appropriations. However, Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton vetoed that omnibus bill in May 2018. Consequently, the three session laws that provide for the 7% waiver service payment rate increases remain in effect. Shortly thereafter, the Commissioner announced that DHS nonetheless intends to eliminate the 7% waiver service payment rate increase. The elimination of this rate increase will occur in multiple stages, with the first funding reduction scheduled to occur on July 1, 2018, and the final funding reduction scheduled to occur December 31, 2019.\n </opinion>\n <attorneys id=\"p-14\">\n  Plaintiffs ARRM and Minnesota Organization for Habilitation and Rehabilitation (MOHR) (collectively, \"Organizational Plaintiffs\") are nonprofit associations incorporated under Minnesota law. ARRM advances Minnesota's home and community-based service programs that support people living with disabilities, and its members include more than 200 service providers, businesses, and stakeholders, including nonprofit and for-profit entities that are certified to provide such services. MOHR is an association with more than 100 members that provide services to persons with disabilities. Plaintiffs Karla Dee Marder, Robert Clapper, Kathryn Smith, and Cara Pedrille, through their respective guardians (collectively, \"Individual Plaintiffs\"), receive waiver services subject to DWRS. Plaintiffs commenced this action to enjoin the Commissioner from implementing the anticipated 7% funding reduction to Minnesota's waiver service payment rates.\n </attorneys>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs now seek a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. The Commissioner opposes Plaintiffs' motion, arguing that the Individual Plaintiffs lack standing and that Plaintiffs have not established that they are entitled to preliminary injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Commissioner argues that the Individual Plaintiffs lack standing to seek injunctive relief because they have not alleged an imminent injury in fact.

Several factors demonstrate that the Individual Plaintiffs have not satisfied this burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As an initial matter, it is undisputed that the waiver services received by Plaintiffs Marder and Smith will not be affected by the Commissioner's anticipated funding reductions-if at all-until December 31, 2019. Because these possible future injuries will not occur for more than 18 months, they are not \"imminent\" as is required to establish Article III standing. Moreover, these injuries are highly speculative given that one or more events could occur in the next 18 months that might prevent these alleged injuries from ever arising-including, but not limited to, administrative, legislative, or judicial action. For these reasons, Plaintiffs Marder and Smith have not alleged an injury in fact as is necessary to establish Article III standing to obtain injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiffs Clapper and Pedrille have alleged that the Commissioner's anticipated funding reductions will affect the waiver services they receive beginning on October 1, 2018, and July 1, 2018, respectively. The timing of these alleged injuries is relatively sooner than the injuries alleged by Plaintiffs Marder and Smith. However, as in\n   <em>\n    Clapper\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs Clapper and Pedrille allege possible future injuries that depend on a \"speculative chain of possibilities\" that may or may not occur.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/#p409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/#p409\">\n    at 414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/#p409\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . First, the Commissioner's funding reductions would have to occur as anticipated, without any administrative or legislative intervention. Second, the providers of the waiver services received by Plaintiffs Clapper and Pedrille would have to choose to discontinue or otherwise limit waiver services rather than seeking alternative funding or seeking to account for the Commissioner's funding reductions in some other manner that would not materially affect waiver services. Third, those service providers would have to discontinue or otherwise limit the\n   <em>\n    particular\n   </em>\n   waiver services that Plaintiffs Clapper and Pedrille receive, as opposed to\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   waiver\n   services.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fourth, Plaintiffs Clapper and Pedrille would have to seek,\n   <em>\n    and be denied\n   </em>\n   , individualized waiver services payment rate increases by submitting \"exception requests\" as provided under DWRS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minn. Stat. \u00a7 256B.4914, subd. 14. Fifth, the entities that provide waiver services to Plaintiffs Clapper and Pedrille also would have to appeal-unsuccessfully-the Commissioner's waiver service payment rate determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The foregoing series of events that would have to occur for an injury to befall Plaintiffs Clapper and Pedrille requires an attenuated and speculative chain of inferences. \"Plaintiffs cannot rely on speculation about 'the unfettered choices made by independent actors not before the court' \" to establish standing based on a possible future injury.\n   <em>\n    Clapper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/#p409\">\n    568 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   414 n.5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/#p409\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p561\">\n    504 U.S. at 562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p561\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The chain of events described above depends, at least in part, on future choices made by independent actors not before this Court, including waiver service providers, administrative agencies, and the Minnesota Legislature.
