Due to the pain, Schmidt had been unable to run for the prior two and a half years, AR 80, and according to his commanding officer, Schmidt's injuries \"ke[pt] him from participating in physical fitness tests, field duty, troop marches, any prolonged walking or standing and other activities required of the basic Marine,\" AR 83. The physical evaluation board concluded that Schmidt was unfit for full duty and would not be fit for full duty within a reasonable period of time. AR 76, 81. The board also rated Schmidt's lower back condition as 10% disabling. AR 76. After receiving counseling on the board's findings from a Disability Evaluation System counselor, Schmidt signed a certification stating that he accepted the findings of the physical evaluation board. AR 78.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The next month, after the Navy Judge Advocate General performed a legal review, the physical evaluation board notified the Commandant of the Marine Corps of its finding that Schmidt was unfit for duty and recommended that Schmidt be separated from the Marine Corps under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201203\">\n    10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The application requested that the Board for Correction increase his 10% disability rating because the physical evaluation board's rating was \"unjust\" and his \"medical evaluations were incomplete and unjust.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=32%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20723.2\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In support, the application noted that the Department of Veterans Affairs\n   (VA) had assigned him a 34% disability rating, \"with an upgrade pending, effective date 04-01-89.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Board for Correction ultimately denied Schmidt's application in 1992, explaining that the higher VA rating was \"insufficient to demonstrate that [Schmidt's] discharge from the Marine Corps was erroneous, because the VA, unlike the military departments, may assign disability ratings without regard to the issue of fitness for military service.\" AR 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Sixteen years later, in 2008, Schmidt asked the Board for Correction to reconsider its 1992 decision. AR 11-41;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 3 n.1, Dkt. 33. Schmidt again challenged the physical evaluation board's 10% separations disability rating by pointing to the higher rating assigned by the VA. AR 14-16. He attached a 2007 VA letter showing that his total VA rating had increased to 100%, including a 70% disability rating for \"major depressive disorder /PTSD,\" 40% for \"degenerative arthritis of the spine,\" 30% for \"hypertensive heart disease,\" and 10% for both clavicle/scapula impairment and \"residuals of foot injury.\" AR 17. According to Schmidt, \"[t]o go from a 10% service-connected military medical discharge to a 100% service-connected VA disability evaluation offends common sense.\" AR 15. The Board for Correction's Acting Executive Director rejected Schmidt's request for reconsideration, AR 7, but this decision was later set aside voluntarily and the request was remanded to the Correction Board for further consideration, AR 9-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On remand, the Board for Correction denied Schmidt's request for reconsideration in 2011. AR 1-4.

The Board for Correction responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   The Board found your new argument to be little more than a reiteration of your previous argument,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that the conditions rated by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) after you were discharged from the Marine Corps rendered you unfit for military duty prior to your discharge, and that the Department of the Navy should have assigned the same disability ratings assigned by the VA. The Board concluded that in view of your unexplained fifteen-year delay in submitting your request for further consideration of your application, and your failure to submit significant new evidence or argument in support of that request, you have not demonstrated that it would be in the interest of justice for the Board to excuse your failure to submit the request in a timely manner.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   AR 1-2. Schmidt submitted some new information, the Board continued, but the information was not material:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Although you contend that you were unfit for duty by reason of physical disability in 1989 due to a mental disorder, cardiovascular disease, and conditions of a toe, ankle and shoulder, in addition to the unfitting back condition, you did not submit any new material evidence in support of that contention.... The [new] documents ... mostly pertain to your condition after you were separated from the Navy and/or contain recitations of subjective reports concerning your military and medical history that you presented to the authors of those documents. There is no credible evidence that the findings made by the Physical Evaluation Board in your case represent anything other than fair and impartial assessments of your fitness for duty and determination of an appropriate disability rating for the condition that it determined was unfitting.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   AR 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Board's conclusion was reasonable. When requesting reconsideration, Schmidt offered evidence of VA rating upgrades that occurred after his 1989 discharge. In particular, he attached a 2007 VA letter showing that his total VA rating had increased to 100%. AR 17. He also attached letters describing his conditions,\n   sent from private physicians to the VA in 1991, 1992, 1993, 1996, 1998, and 1999. AR 21-38. While acknowledging that the submissions were new, the Board reasonably concluded that it was not material. In other words, the new material was unlikely to substantially affect the Board's 1992 decision that the Navy did not err or inflict injustice when assigning Schmidt's separations disability rating in 1989.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201552\">\n    10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=32%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20723.2\">\n    32 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 723.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), 723.9.

The physical evaluation board specifically considered how back pain affected Schmidt's fitness for military duty and assigned a disability rating accordingly. Moreover, some of Schmidt's new submissions actually undercut his request. A 1992 letter noted that Schmidt suffered injuries in the Marine Corps, but the letter was prompted by neck, hand, back, and hip pain experienced by Schmidt \"since a work accident suffered on February 28, 1992,\" three years\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   Schmidt's discharge from the Marine Corps. AR 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The new submissions also document that Schmidt experienced conditions in addition to back pain in the decades after separation, specifically clavicle/scapula impairment, residuals of a foot injury, a degenerative spine condition, hypertensive heart disease, depressive disorder, and PTSD. AR 2, 17. As to the first two conditions, the physical evaluation board specifically considered shoulder and foot issues, but found that they \"do not contribute to the unfitting conditions.\" AR 76. And Schmidt offers no evidence that the physical evaluation board should have found any of the conditions unfitting in 1989. As the Board for Correction explained to Schmidt, \"[t]hat you now suffer from a degenerative condition of your spine which severely limits its range of motion is not material evidence of the severity of your back condition\" at separation. AR 2. At that time, rather, the physical evaluation board \"found that you were able to flex forward to a point where your fingertips were within six inches from the floor before producing low back pain, which indicates you had a range of motion in excess of ninety degrees of forward flexion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4284689\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/fed-cl/92/776/#p795\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted). The Board for Correction acknowledged that Schmidt's VA rating of 10% for hypertension increased to a 30% rating for hypertensive heart disease, and that Schmidt was \"entitled to VA disability ratings for major depressive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder on 26 April 2007.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4284689\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/fed-cl/92/776/#p795\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But as the Board for Correction explained to Schmidt, these facts \"do not even suggest that you suffered from heart disease and/or a ratable mental disorder in 1989, or that the hypertension rendered you unfit for duty at the time of your discharge.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4284689\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/fed-cl/92/776/#p795\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4284689\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/fed-cl/92/776/#p795\">\n    92 Fed.Cl. at 795\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that it \"would be erroneous\" to equate a Navy rating of 10% for major depressive disorder and anxiety disorder-the two conditions found unfitting-with a VA rating of 70% for anxiety disorder/major depressive disorder /PTSD, which was assigned in part for conditions not found unfitting).
