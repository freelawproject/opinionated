For the reasons stated below, the Court grants summary judgment of non-infringement in favor of Schutt regarding claims 11 and 50 of the '818 patent with respect to three specific models of the accused helmets but denies the rest of Schutt's motion for summary judgment. The Court grants summary judgment in favor of Riddell with respect to infringement on all '818 patent claims,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   but denies summary judgment of infringement on claim 6 of the '118 patent and otherwise denies Riddell's cross-motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Riddell manufactures and sells football helmets, among other types of sports equipment. It owns the '118 and '818 patents at issue in the present litigation. Both\n   patents are for protective sports helmets. The '118 patent, which was originally issued in September 2013, was reexamined and amended in September 2014. The '818 patent, which was filed as a continuation of the '118 patent, was issued in January 2015. Both patent applications claimed entitlement to the May 1, 2002 filing date of a provisional application filed with the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Schutt also manufactures and sells sports helmets. Riddell filed suit against Schutt in April 2016, alleging that Schutt's \"Vengeance\" line of football helmets infringes a number of claims of the '118 and '818 patents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In August 2016, Schutt filed petitions with the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (the Board) for\n   <em>\n    inter partes\n   </em>\n   review (IPR) of all of the patent claims asserted by Riddell. Specifically, Schutt sought review of claims 1-7, 11-13, 25-28, 30, and 32-37 of the '118 patent and claims 1-3, 5-6, 8-12, 14-16, 18-19, 21-25, 27, 29-32, 34, 36-52, 56-58, and 60-65 of the '818 patent. The Board instituted review with respect to claims 1, 2, 5, 11, 12, 25, 27, 28, 30, 32-35, and 37 of the '118 patent and claims 41, 42, 49, 51, 56-58, and 62-65 of the '818 patent. In February 2018, the Board issued final written decisions with respect to each of the two proceedings. With respect to the '118 patent, the Board concluded that Schutt had shown, by a preponderance of the evidence, that claims 1, 11, 12, 25, 28, 33-35, and 37 were unpatentable as obvious under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20103\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , but had failed to prove that claims 2, 5, 27, 30, and 32 were unpatentable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   dkt. no. 220, Def.'s Notice of Suppl.

As for the '818 patent, the Board determined that Schutt proved by a preponderance of the evidence that claims 41, 49, 51, 56, 57, 62, 63, and 65 were unpatentable as obvious, but failed to prove claims 42, 58, and 64 unpatentable.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20103\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 2 (PTAB Decision on '818 Patent ) at 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Following the Board's issuance of these decisions, Riddell stipulated to the dismissal of all claims of infringement regarding any of the claims of the '118 patent except for those based on claim 6 and all claims of infringement regarding any of the claims of the '818 patent except for those based on claims 1, 2, 5, 6, 11, 40, 50, and 58.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   dkt. no. 201, Joint Notice of Stipulation Regarding Dismissal of Certain Claims of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%208%2C528%2C118\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 8,528,118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; dkt. no. 203, Joint Notice of Stipulation Regarding Dismissal of Certain Claims of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%208%2C938%2C818\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 8,938,818\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Schutt first contends that the asserted claims of the patents-in-suit are not entitled to the claimed priority date of May 1, 2002 and are therefore invalid as anticipated by Riddell's own helmets pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20102\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Alternatively, Schutt argues that even if the patents-in-suit are afforded a 2002 priority date, all of the asserted claims are invalid as anticipated or obvious under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20102\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   or 103. Schutt further contends that summary\n   judgment of non-infringement is warranted on all asserted claims because the accused helmets lack the following limitations: (1) a raised central band; (2) a raised central band having a width defined by a pair of opposed side walls; (3) a plurality of vent openings aligned along the side of the raised central band, and; (4) a side wall that has a curvilinear configuration as it extends between the crown region and the rear region of the shell. Schutt also argues that three specific models of Vengeance helmets do not infringe claims 11 and 50 of the '818 patent because they are not sold with inflatable crown pads. Lastly, Schutt contends that summary judgment is warranted on the issue of Riddell's entitlement to lost profits because Riddell cannot prove the absence of acceptable non-infringing substitutes for its helmets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   For its part, Riddell contends that disputed issues of material fact preclude a grant of summary judgment to Schutt with respect to the priority date and the validity of all the asserted claims of the '818 patent, as well as the issue of lost profits. Riddell has moved for summary judgment of infringement on the ground that at least some of Schutt's Vengeance helmets meet all of the limitations of the asserted claims. It has also moved for summary judgment regarding the validity of claim 6 of the '118 patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In reviewing cross-motions for summary judgment, the Court takes the motions one at a time, construing all facts and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party.\n   <em>\n    Advance Cable Co., LLC v.

(Def.'s Mem.) at 34;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Riddell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202264347\">\n    2017 WL 2264347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (the phrase \"raised central band\" should be given its plain and ordinary meaning). The saw-tooth offset feature is pictured at three different angles below:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Def.'s Mem. at 34. Schutt does not appear to dispute (nor could it) that this feature is raised and in the center of the helmet. Rather, Schutt's argument rests largely on the proposition that it cannot be considered a band. Citing a number of online dictionaries that define \"band\" as \"a thin, flat strip of some material,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"a stripe, as of color or decorative work,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and \"something that confines or constricts while allowing a degree of movement,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   among other definitions, Schutt contends that no reasonable jury could conclude that the saw-tooth offset feature is a band because it does not confine or constrict and it \"is not a thin, flat strip of material\" or \"a decorative stripe or strip.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Court is unpersuaded by this selective comparison of the saw-tooth offset feature to dictionary definitions of the word \"band.\" Although the feature may not be a flat strip that confines or constricts, it fits comfortably within several of the other definitions provided by Schutt. For example, it could easily be considered \"a strip...or a stripe...differentiable (as by color, texture, or structure) from the adjacent material or area.\"\n   <em>\n    Band\n   </em>\n   , Merriam-Webster. The offset feature, which runs as a stripe from the front of the helmet to the back, is differentiable from the adjacent areas of the helmet because it is raised. It could also be considered \"a stripe, as of color or decorative work.\"\n   <em>\n    Band\n   </em>\n   , Dictionary.com.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Schutt also argues that no reasonable jury would consider the saw-tooth offset\n   feature to be a band because, rather than being continuous and substantially parallel, the feature's sides have a zig-zag, saw-tooth design. According to Schutt, because the side walls of the saw-tooth offset feature are neither continuous nor substantially parallel, it would not be recognized as a band by a person skilled in the art.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lukas Decl. in Supp. of Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J (Lukas Decl.), Ex. 92 (Posner Rebuttal Report) \u00b6\u00b6 59-60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Despite Schutt's assertions that the dictionary definitions discussed above provide support for its argument, none of the definitions describe a band as necessarily or even generally having \"continuous\" and/or \"substantially parallel\" sides. More importantly, although Schutt's expert, Jonathan Posner, has opined that a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand a band to have \"boundaries defined by substantially parallel side walls or sides; or, at a minimum, by side walls or sides that have a continuous geometry,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56, this Court has already rejected Schutt's proposed construction of a raised central band as having \"a width defined by a pair of opposed side walls,\" as well as Schutt's contention that the walls of the band must be parallel and \"continuous and uninterrupted-that is, without zigs and zags.\"\n   <em>\n    Riddell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202264347\">\n    2017 WL 2264347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5, 7-8. In any case, even if the side walls of the saw-tooth offset feature are not continuous, the raised surface offset by the saw-tooth design extends continuously from the crown to the rear of the helmet.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Lukas Decl., Ex. 83 (Shewchenko Infringement Report), App. B at 5-6. No reasonable jury could conclude that Schutt's saw-tooth offset feature is not a \"raised central band\" within the plain and ordinary meaning of that term-and thus find that the Vengeance helmets lack a raised central band-simply because of the feature's saw-tooth configuration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Riddell has cross-moved for summary judgment on the issue of infringement. Riddell asserts that \"[a]pplying plain meaning, the accused products unquestionably include an integrally formed raised central band extending across the crown region to the rear region.\" Pl.'s Mem. in Supp. of Cross-Mot. for Summ. J. (Pl.'s Mem.) at 7. In support, it cites Schutt's schematic drawings of the accused helmets, a physical sample of one of the accused helmet models, and claim charts in which Riddell's expert, Nicholas Shewchenko, labels the saw-tooth offset feature as a \"raised central band integrally formed as part of the shell.\" Shewchenko Infringement Report, App. A at 8-9;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202264347\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , App. B at 5-6. It is apparent even from this limited evidence that no reasonable jury could find that the Schutt helmets at issue lack a raised central band, even when the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to Schutt. It is evident from the pictures of the helmets as well as the physical model that the saw-tooth offset feature is not only \"raised\" and \"central\" with respect to the rest of the shell, but also a \"band\" within the plain and ordinary meaning of that term. The Court therefore finds, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(g), that the accused helmets contain a \"raised central band\" as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Def.'s Mem. at 36. Schutt's expert identifies the areas lacking a side wall as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Posner Rebuttal Report \u00b6 73;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 71-72, 74. Schutt also contends that this limitation is not met because the saw-tooth offset feature has more than a single pair of side walls, divided by the gaps where there are no side walls at all. Lastly, Schutt asserts that to the extent the feature has side walls, they are not \"opposed\" because they do not always face away from each other (the direction of the walls being defined by a line that is perpendicular to their surface).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   As Riddell notes, however, Schutt's suggestion that a side wall must be \"a separate discernable surface that connects two different surfaces\" in all places in order to define the width of the raised central band,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 36, appears to ignore the fact that the raised central band must also be \"integrally formed as part of the shell,\" which this Court has construed to mean \"not including a separate element attached to the shell.\"\n   <em>\n    Riddell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202264347\">\n    2017 WL 2264347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9. The fact that Schutt's expert has identified certain regions of the saw-tooth offset feature where \"the outer surface of the saw-tooth offset feature bends towards and directly interfaces with the outer shell surface\" instead of creating a \"definable visual or tactile distinguishing boundar[y] such that all three surfaces can be separately discerned,\" in no way precludes a reasonable factfinder from concluding that the saw-tooth offset feature has a width defined by a pair of opposed side walls, within the plain meaning of that phrase.

As previously noted, the Court has already rejected the notion that to have a width defined by a pair of opposed side walls, the side walls of the raised central band must be oriented in a straight line, without zigs and zags.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Riddell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202264347\">\n    2017 WL 2264347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7. Riddell's expert has identified the relevant \"pair\" of side walls as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Shewchenko Infringement Report, App. B at 9;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202264347\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , App. A at 9; Lukas Decl., Ex. 85.

Webster's Third New International Dictionary defines \"opposed\" as \"opposite to each other.\"\n   <em>\n    Opposed,\n   </em>\n   Webster's Third New Int'l Dictionary 1583 (1993). To the extent that the side walls identified by Riddell's expert define the outer limits of the raised band on either side, they are \"opposite to each other.\" There is no question that a reasonable jury could therefore find that the Vengeance helmets' saw-tooth offset feature has a width defined by a pair of opposed side walls. Indeed, it is evident merely from looking at the accused helmets that the saw-tooth offset feature\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   have a width defined by a pair of opposed side walls, in the way that a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand the plain and ordinary meaning of that phrase. After Schutt's previously rejected and overly narrow claim constructions are set aside, even when the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to Schutt, no reasonable factfinder could conclude otherwise. The Court therefore finds that the accused helmets meet the \"width defined by a pair of opposed side walls\" limitation as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Vent openings aligned along the sides of the raised central band (all asserted claims)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Schutt further contends that the accused products do not infringe any of the asserted claims because they lack two or more vent openings \"aligned along\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   or \"aligned, and positioned along\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   a side of\n   the saw-tooth offset feature. According to Schutt's expert, these vent opening limitations are not met because (1) the major axes of the vent openings in the accused helmets are not parallel to the path connecting them, such that the vent openings are not aligned with respect to each other, and (2) no plurality of vent openings in the accused products can possibly be \"aligned along\" or \"aligned, and positioned\" along a side wall because the side wall of the saw-tooth offset feature would need to be continuous and substantially straight in order for at least two vent openings to be aligned with it.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Lukas Decl., Ex. 84 (Dec. 6, 2017 Posner Dep.) 48:8-45:11; Posner Rebuttal Report \u00b6\u00b6 94-95. Riddell responds that not only do these arguments contradict the position taken by Schutt at the claim construction hearing, but they also rely on out-of-context statements by Riddell and its expert to improperly restrict the scope of the vent opening limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In the claim construction decision, the Court observed that \"Schutt appear[ed] to agree\" that the claim construction language relating to the positioning and alignment of vent openings \"simply discloses that any vent openings are located completely outside the raised central band.\"\n   <em>\n    Riddell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202264347\">\n    2017 WL 2264347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10. It is also true that Schutt did not argue in its claim construction briefs that a plurality of vent openings had to be aligned with respect to each other, and Schutt makes no attempt in its briefs to explain why such an interpretation of the claim language is appropriate. As previously discussed, Schutt did argue, in the context of the raised central band side wall limitation, that the sides of the raised central band would have to be continuous and substantially straight, but the Court rejected that proposed construction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7. Riddell has presented evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that two or more vent openings in the Vengeance helmets are indeed aligned along the sides of the saw-tooth offset feature, as each vent is aligned with the portion of the wall to which it is adjacent:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Shewchenko Infringement Report, App. A at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%208%2C813%2C269\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , App. A at 11. Although Schutt points to various statements by Riddell and its expert Shewchenko that it contends establish that a line between vent holes must always be parallel to a side wall in order to be considered aligned with it, those statements were made in context of specific discussions about certain other helmets and they do not suggest that is necessarily the case with respect to raised central bands that have zig-zag side walls.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s Corrected Statement of Material Facts \u00b6\u00b6 11, 14-18, 21, 153;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Lukas Decl., Ex. 15 (Nov. 28, 2017 Shewchenko Dep.) 13:21-14:1 (\"[T]he term parallel is not forcing the alignment of the vent holes with the wall. The vent holes are following the sidewall. So the sidewall is always the reference.\"). A reasonable jury could conclude from the above image that the vent openings are, in fact, aligned along the side walls of the saw-tooth offset feature Schutt is therefore not entitled to summary judgment on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   With regard to Riddell's cross-motion, the question is whether a reasonable jury could find that two or more vent openings in the Vengeance helmets are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   aligned along the sides of the saw-tooth offset feature. Schutt's expert's explanation for why a person of ordinary skill in the art would not consider this limitation met by the accused helmets appears to rely in large part on the unwarranted assumption that the sides of the raised central band simply cannot have a zig-zag configuration.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Posner Rebuttal Report \u00b6\u00b6 94, 98-100. Schutt's expert also asserts that the vent openings cannot be considered aligned with the sides of the saw-tooth offset feature specifically because, as demonstrated below, \"any line that connects two vent holes [shown in blue] ...cannot be aligned with any side or side wall boundary [shown in red]\":\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 95. But the problem with this line of argument is that it is wholly unsupported by the claim language, which only specifies that a plurality of vent openings are \"aligned along\" or \"aligned, and positioned along\" a side of the raised central band and gives no indication that the lines connecting the vent holes must always be parallel to the side walls themselves. The Court concludes that there is no genuine dispute that the vent openings of the accused helmets are \"aligned along\" or \"aligned, and positioned along\" a side of the saw-tooth offset feature; even when the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to Schutt, it would not be reasonable for a factfinder to conclude otherwise. The accused helmets therefore meet the vent opening limitations as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Curvilinear configuration of side wall (claim 6 of the '118 patent )\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Schutt next argues that the Vengeance helmets do not infringe claim 6 of the '118 patent because the saw-tooth offset feature does not have a side wall with a \"curvilinear configuration as it extends between the crown region and the rear region of the shell.\" '118 Patent 14:45-14:47. Curvilinear is defined in Webster's Third New International Dictionary as \"consisting of or bounded by curved lines\" or \"following a curve.\"\n   <em>\n    Curvilinear,\n   </em>\n   Webster's Third New Int'l Dictionary 558. The phrase \"curvilinear configuration\" was defined during claim construction as describing \"walls that curve in the horizontal plane as they extend from the front to the rear of the shell.\"\n   <em>\n    Riddell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202264347\">\n    2017 WL 2264347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *15. As the Court noted in the claim construction order, this construction is consistent with the Patent Trial and Appeal Board's description of the side wall highlighted in the following figure as having a \"curvilinear shape\" in that the wall curves outward as it crosses the shell:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Dkt. no. 117 (Pl.'s Resp. to Xenith) at 24-25;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Riddell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202264347\">\n    2017 WL 2264347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *14-15 (citing Pl.'s Resp. to Xenith at 24-25). Schutt contends that because the alleged side walls of the saw-tooth offset feature are discontinuous and travel in a zig-zag path, they would not be considered curvilinear or curving in the horizontal plane by a person of ordinary skill in the art, but it does not explain\n   <em>\n    why\n   </em>\n   a discontinuous, zig-zag wall could not be considered to curve overall in the horizontal plane. Riddell, for its part, contends that the zig-zag configuration of the saw-tooth offset feature \"plainly meets\" the curvilinear configuration limitation, Pl.'s Mem. at 13, but once again, the only evidence it cites in support of that contention are Schutt's schematic drawings of the accused helmets, a physical sample of one of the accused helmet models, and a claim chart in which its expert has labeled a side wall of the saw-tooth offset feature as a \"side wall having [a] curvilinear configuration.\" Shewchenko Infringement Report, App. B at 10. Although Riddell did not need to point to more evidence than that to establish that the raised central band, side wall, and vent opening limitations are met by Schutt's helmets, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Schutt, it is not entirely clear from the schematic drawings, the physical sample, or the cited claim chart that this particular \"curvilinear configuration\" limitation is met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Because neither party makes any attempt to actually explain\n   <em>\n    why\n   </em>\n   the side walls of the saw-tooth offset feature would or would not be considered curvilinear, neither party has met its burden to establish that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on this issue.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Estate of Moreland v.

Accordingly, the Court denies both parties' motions for summary judgment regarding whether the accused products infringe claim 6 of the '118 patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Inflatable crown pads (claims 11 and 50 of the '818 patent )\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Lastly, Schutt contends that three specific models of Vengeance helmets-the\n   Adult Vengeance Z10, Youth Vengeance A3, and the Youth Vengeance Hybrid-cannot infringe claims 11 and 50 of the '818 patent because they are not sold with inflatable crown pads.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Riddell concedes that those three particular models do not infringe claims 11 and 50 of the '818 patent for lack of an inflatable crown pad. Instead, it asserts that, with the exception of those three helmet models, the accused products do infringe all of the asserted claims. Accordingly, the Court grants summary judgment of non-infringement of claims 11 and 50 with respect to the Adult Vengeance Z10, Youth Vengeance A3, and the Youth Vengeance Hybrid helmets only (Schutt does not dispute that the other Vengeance helmets are sold with an inflatable crown pad).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    6. Remaining claim limitations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Riddell contends that, in addition to meeting the previously discussed limitations, the accused helmets meet all of the remaining limitations of the '818 patent claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. at 11-15. Schutt has forfeited any argument to the contrary by failing to respond to Riddell on this point.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Potts v.

Schutt does dispute that the accused helmets feature a \"first vent opening aligned along a first side of the raised central band, and a second vent opening aligned along a second side of the raised central band,\" but the Court has already rejected its argument on that point. It is clear from the picture below\n   that the accused helmets meet this limitation:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Pl.'s Mem. at 15. It is also clear from the picture that the accused helmets meet the additional limitation of claim 40 that the \"first and second vent openings are substantially adjacent a respective one of the pair of opposed sidewalls defining the central band.\" '818 Patent 18:14-18:16. Accordingly, there is no genuine dispute that the accused helmets meet all the limitations of asserted dependent claim 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Claim 58 of the '818 patent recites the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   The football helmet of claim 41, wherein the shell has a frontal face guard connection component for securement of an upper, frontal portion of the face guard, wherein the first and second plurality of vent openings include a first vent opening, and wherein the distance between an outer edge of the first vent openings exceeds a width of the frontal face guard connection component.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   19:33-19:39.

Accordingly, although summary judgment of infringement or non-infringement regarding the \"curvilinear configuration\" limitation of claim 6 of the '118 patent is not warranted, the Court finds, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(g), that the accused helmets contain all the other remaining limitations of that claim and unasserted claims 5 and 1 from which it depends as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    7.

But even when the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to Schutt, no reasonable jury could find that the accused helmets do not meet every limitation recited in the asserted '818 patent claims. The Court therefore denies Schutt's motion for summary judgment of non-infringement in its entirety and denies Riddell's cross-motion for summary judgment of infringement on claim 6 of the '118 patent.

Schutt contends that Riddell cannot now argue that the figures in the provisional application meet the written description requirement for the integrally formed raised central band limitation because Riddell and its expert, Shewchenko, repeatedly asserted during IPR proceedings that a person of ordinary skill in the art cannot discern whether a band is \"integrally formed\" as part of the shell from a drawing or figure without a detailed cross-sectional view and accompanying description. For example, during the prosecution of a related patent, Riddell asserted that this limitation could not be clearly discerned from the Ispas design patent because there was \"absolutely no disclosure in Ispas as to how the alleged raised band is formed with respect to the helmet shell.\" Lukas Decl., Ex. 56 at 11-12. Riddell has also stated during IPR proceedings that \"whether a raised central band is '\n   <em>\n    integrally formed as part of the shell\n   </em>\n   ' is not a structural/visual feature that can be discerned from a drawing. Nothing in the photographs of Sears, or the drawings of Rappleyea or Ispas, provides any indication or information regarding\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   the alleged raised central bands are formed or attached.\" Lukas Decl., Ex. 10 at 38 (emphasis in original). When asked during his deposition to read Riddell's aforementioned assertion that \"whether a raised central band is '\n   <em>\n    integrally formed as part of the shell\n   </em>\n   ' is not a structural/visual feature that can be discerned from a drawing\" and state whether he agreed with it, Shewchenko stated that he did.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lukas Decl., Ex. 16, 44:7-44:19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Riddell responds that although it has argued that drawings in certain prior art references did not disclose an integrally formed raised central band, neither it nor Shewchenko have taken the position that a drawing could\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   disclose to a person of ordinary skill in the art that a particular feature is integrally formed. In his October 2017 report, Shewchenko stated the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   While Dr. Posner points to snippets of my deposition testimony from the IPR proceedings, these comments are taken out of context, and were part of a discussion of particular asserted prior art references. It is not my belief that a patent drawing, figure, or photograph can\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   provide evidence regarding whether a particular feature is integrally formed with respect to the shell. Nor would it be necessary to obtain a cross-section of a shell of a helmet to determine if it is integrally formed in all cases.

Shewchenko further opined that a person of ordinary skill in the art would, in fact, understand the following figures as depicting a raised central band integrally formed as part of the shell because the band \"clearly blends into the shell at its starting and ending points\":\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 446-447. Schutt vaguely asserts that the doctrines of prosecution disclaimer and estoppel preclude a genuine dispute of material fact on the issue of whether the above figures constitute a written description of an integrally formed raised central band based on the positions Riddell has previously taken. As Riddell notes, however, Schutt \"neither acknowledges nor attempts to satisfy the legal factors to be considered with respect to such doctrines (and may not raise them for the first time in reply).\" Pl.'s Mem. at 39. The Court agrees.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Chavez v. Ill.

In any case, because the prior statements cited by Schutt were made in reference to photographs and figures of specific prior art and not in reference to the figures in the provisional application at issue here, the Court is not persuaded that Riddell's and Shewchenko's statements are necessarily inconsistent with the assertion that the figures of the provisional application would convey an integrally formed raised central band with reasonable clarity to those skilled in the art. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Riddell, the Court concludes that Shewchenko's opinion creates a genuine dispute regarding whether the integrally formed raised central band claims were disclosed by the provisional application and thus entitled to a priority date of May 1, 2002; accordingly, it is a question of fact for the jury that may not be resolved on summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Riddell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202349714\">\n    2017 WL 2349714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (same conclusion with respect to the offset band claims).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Shewchenko has opined, however, that \"it is not possible to tell for certain whether the black and gold helmet stamped as 'Sears 2425-003' corresponds to the '6 C 2425F' model listed in the catalog\" because only a small portion of the Sears 2425 helmet advertised in the catalog is visible. Shewchenko Validity Report \u00b6 94.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   The Court's review of the references in question reveals that the white JOFA helmet pictured in Exhibit H does display a model number-395-that corresponds with one of the model numbers in shown in the relevant catalog excerpt, but the model number of the black JOFA helmet included in the same exhibit is not visible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem., Ex.

The pictures of the other references do not reveal model numbers and do not appear to be otherwise authenticated. Although Schutt may well be able to establish that such references were on the market prior to the relevant priority date, it has not done so here. For that reason, the Court concludes that Schutt may not rely on these references-aside from the white JOFA helmet-for purposes of summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Even if Schutt had established that all of the above references constitute prior art, however, summary judgment would not be warranted because there are genuine factual disputes with respect to the content of this prior art. For example, although Schutt contends that the Halstead patent and Bike embodiment lack only the raised central band limitation of the independent claims from which the asserted claims depend, Shewchenko has opined that they also fail to disclose any of the relevant vent opening limitations\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   as well as the angled transition walls of the offset band limitation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Shewchenko Validity\n   Report \u00b6\u00b6 54-62, 71-76. Likewise, whereas Schutt asserts that the Sears and Wilson helmets fail to disclose only elongated vent openings and the offset band, Shewchenko has opined that neither the Sears 2425 nor Wilson F2000 discloses the additional limitations that such vent openings be aligned or positioned along a side of a raised central band.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 95-96, 114-117. These disputes regarding the content of the Halstead, Bike, Sears 2425, and Wilson prior art are material because Schutt relies heavily on them to argue not only that the independent claims from which the asserted claims depend are obvious and/or anticipated but also that the dependent claims themselves are invalid.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 15-17, 21-22, 24-25, 26, 28, 30-31. In light of these factual disputes regarding the content of the prior art referenced by Schutt, summary judgment of invalidity based on either anticipation or obviousness is not warranted with respect to any of the asserted claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Riddell has cross-moved for summary judgment of validity with respect to claim 6 of the '118 patent on the ground that Schutt has not presented evidence or argument to support its contention that claim 6 is invalid beyond the unsupported\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   assertion that the Sears 2442 helmet and Ispas patent disclose the limitation of a side wall (of the raised central band) having a curvilinear configuration.

But although Posner explains that the front region of the helmet-which is one of the most commonly impacted regions-will maintain its structural rigidity because the front set of vent openings are left outside the saw-tooth offset feature, he does not go on to specifically explain why the placement of the remaining vents\n   <em>\n    inside\n   </em>\n   the saw-tooth offset feature would not affect the structural rigidity of other portions of the helmet.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 122.
