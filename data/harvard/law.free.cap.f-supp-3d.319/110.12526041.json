INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Every day, individuals fleeing persecution and violence in their home countries seek asylum within our borders. And every day, United States immigration officials must determine whether to admit these individuals or reject them. This case concerns what happens to these individuals while their requests for asylum are considered. Plaintiffs undertook perilous journeys to reach our borders, submitted asylum petitions, and were detained in what they claim to be prison-like conditions for an extended period of time while their petitions were evaluated. They contend that their detention without access to a bond hearing before an immigration judge violated their constitutional rights. They also contend that immigration officials routinely and systematically failed to abide by a binding, official agency directive governing parole determinations, and instead applied an unwritten, unconstitutional policy promulgated by top policy makers. In the absence of this unwritten policy, Plaintiffs argue, they would have been conditionally paroled into the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Presently before the Court are two preliminary motions. First, Defendants seek to transfer this litigation's venue from the District of Columbia to the Southern District of Texas. Second, Plaintiffs seek preliminary injunctive relief granting them bond hearings before immigration judges, and compelling Defendants to comply with the official directive and halt the alleged unwritten policy. For the reasons explained below, the Court denies Defendants' motion, and grants Plaintiffs' motion in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

While Plaintiffs have not filed a new memorandum of law and facts in support of the SAA, they clearly state that they rely on their previously filed, and fully briefed, memorandum to support it. Pls.' Mot. Supp. \u00b6 6. If that memorandum does not justify the requested relief, the Court will deny it. Further, the SAA has had no impact on the timing of the Court's determination of whether the case should be transferred, which should be clear from the fact that the Court is disposing of both motions simultaneously. Next, Defendants' argument that the SAA seeks the ultimate relief sought in this case will be addressed in the Courts' evaluation of the SAA's merits. Finally, as discussed above, Plaintiffs need not bring their claims by way of habeas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The Court now turns to Defendants' contention that Plaintiffs do not have authority to supplement their preliminary injunction application. Defendants correctly note that a motion is not, under normal circumstances, considered a pleading, which means that Federal Rule 15, addressing pleading amendments, is inapplicable here. Def.'s Opp'n Supp. at 4-5;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marsh v.

This Court's discretion in granting preliminary injunctive relief is therefore not constrained by the relief Plaintiffs explicitly seek, and the SAA does not allow the Court to impose relief that it could not already impose under Plaintiffs' previous application.

Plaintiffs seek preliminary injunctive relief in the form of an order (1) requiring that they be provided bond hearings before immigration judges if their detention continues; (2) enjoining ICE officials from considering deterrence as a factor in their parole decisions going forward; and (3) mandating that ICE officials follow the Morton Directive in their parole decisions.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Second Am. Appl. Prelim. Inj. Defendants argue that even if Plaintiffs' motion overcomes certain threshold obstacles, they have not shown that they are entitled to preliminary injunctive relief. The Court first considers Defendants' justiciability and jurisdictional arguments, then it addresses Plaintiffs' merits arguments. As explained below, the Court concludes that it may review the merits of Plaintiffs' arguments, and it holds that Plaintiffs have met their burden of establishing that, as a preliminary matter,\n   they are entitled to parole determinations in compliance with the Morton Directive, but not that they are entitled to bond hearings before immigration judges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Hernandez v.

Finally, in\n   <em>\n    Jafarzadeh v.

Plaintiffs note that, applying this framework, courts in other jurisdictions have interpreted 1225(b) to authorize detention for what they view as a constitutionally reasonable amount of time, after which the government must make an individualized inquiry into whether detention is still necessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Abdi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277829\" index=\"270\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/280/373/#p381\">\n    280 F.Supp.3d at 391-93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (collecting cases);\n   <em>\n    Ahad v.

In Plaintiffs' amended complaint, this claim finds voice in three distinct theories under the APA: (1) the policy contradicts the Morton Directive, rendering it arbitrary and capricious, TAC \u00b6 137(D); (2) the policy \"impacts substantive rights but has not passed through any required rule-making procedures,\" also rendering it arbitrary and capricious, TAC \u00b6 137(A); and (3) the policy violates the INA and the Constitution, and is thus contrary to law, TAC \u00b6\u00b6 137(B)-(C). Plaintiffs also challenge the policy by way of a freestanding Fifth Amendment claim. TAC \u00b6 115. Because the Court concludes that Plaintiffs' first APA theory, standing alone, warrants preliminary injunctive relief with respect to Plaintiffs' parole determinations, it need not reach Plaintiffs' other theories.

For instance, Eleanor Acer, the Senior Director for Refugee Protection at Human Rights First, stated that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n   \"[t]hese practices of preventing release or severely restricting options for release of individuals who meet the criteria for parole, despite the clear directions provided in the 2009 asylum parole directive, are part of a policy to deter individuals from coming to the United States to seek asylum, and to in effect punish those who already have done so.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Acer Decl. \u00b6 1, 23. Similarly, Bethany Carson, an immigration researcher at Grassroots Leadership, stated that she has observed a trend \"that the majority of detained individuals who ... came through ports of entry are not assigned a bond by ICE and are not paroled.\" Decl. of Bethany Carson (\"Carson Decl.\") \u00b6 1, 22, Pls.' Am. Mem. Ex. 8, ECF No. 74-11. And in a Human Rights First survey of immigration attorneys who had been in the field for more than ten years, 90 percent stated that \"ICE denied parole despite asylum seekers providing ample evidence to establish their identities and prove that they did not pose a flight risk or security risk.\" Acer Decl. \u00b6 18. In a similar survey, nearly half of the participants agreed that Secretary Johnson's 2014 policy memorandum caused an increase in parole denials.\n   <em>\n    Lifeline on Lockdown\n   </em>\n   at 20. According to Human Rights First, the research indicates that \"many asylum seekers have been denied parole even when they meet [the Morton Directive] criteria.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. Finally, according to a different Human Rights First report, ICE \"largely refused to release asylum seekers from detention on parole\" in the first eight months following the issuance of President Trump's 2017 Executive Order.

A Human Rights First report indicates that in 2010, ICE detained, without parole, 49 percent of asylum seekers with positive credible fear determinations, while in 2014 ICE detained 84 percent of these individuals. Acer Decl. \u00b6 19. Eunice Lee, the Co-Legal Director of the Center for Gender &amp; Refugee Studies at the University of California Hastings College of Law, provided more detailed statistics indicating a marked drop in the parole grant rate of certain ICE detention centers from 2016 to 2017.

According to Sadat I., when he was first detained at a United States port of entry, the guards told him and the other detainees that they were being punished for entering the United States \"without legal documents.\" Sadat I. Decl. \u00b6 6. He also claims to have been held in a cold cell called the \"Ice Box\" as a form of punishment because-he was allegedly told by the guards-the detainees should not have come to the United States, and the Ice Box experience would convince them to tell their friends not to come.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And he claims that at one point he was told that he would be released on parole, but in November 2017 he was abruptly told that this was no longer possible because of \"[the] election.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. Finally, ICE officials allegedly initially determined that Aracely R. was deemed eligible for parole, but this determination was abruptly cancelled and her parole request was denied, purportedly because of the deterrence policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Am. Mem. at 18 n.19;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ex. 23, ECF No. 74-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Defendants put forth three rebuttal arguments. First, they provide the declaration of Deborah Achim, the Deputy Field Office Director in ICE's San Antonio Field Office, who states, without elaborating, that \"ICE does not have a policy of relying on deterrence as a factor in parole determinations.\" Achim Decl. \u00b6 1, 4. Second, they argue that the fact that Plaintiff Hatim B. was granted asylum and Plaintiff Aracely R. was granted parole \"is significant evidence that there is no policy of deterrence.\" Defs.' Am. Opp'n at 21. Third, they point out that Plaintiffs assert that the alleged deterrence policy was formulated in 2014, but the data they rely upon shows a decline in parole grant rates beginning as far back as 2010, before the alleged policy was hatched.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   They argue that \"Plaintiffs' faulty timeline cuts into the essential inference undergirding the entire case.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   None of these arguments is sufficient to rebut Plaintiffs' evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   First, Ms. Achim's self-serving declaration is not sufficient to discredit Plaintiffs' substantial volume of evidence indicating the existence of a deterrence policy outside the scope of the Morton Directive influencing parole determinations. Her conclusory denial of a policy, without elaboration, fails to acknowledge that Defendants have conceded that a deterrence policy existed in the past.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    R.I.L-R\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4267791\" index=\"282\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/80/164/#p186\">\n    80 F.Supp.3d at 175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendants fail to explain when such a policy ceased to exist and why, despite the policy's alleged discontinuation, parole numbers continue to plummet. While it is true that Plaintiffs have not supplied a statement from an individual with firsthand knowledge of the alleged policy, they have supplied sufficient circumstantial evidence to suggest that they are likely to establish the existence of a deterrence policy as the litigation progresses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Second, the changed circumstances of Hatim B. and Aracely R., if anything, support rather than discredit Plaintiffs' contentions because they were repeatedly denied\n   parole under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"283\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20212.5\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(5), despite apparently falling within the Morton Directive's scope. Hatim B. requested asylum in early 2017, he presented affidavits and a birth certificate, he presented a letter of sponsorship from a local shelter for asylum seekers, he presented a background check indicating no criminal history, and he was still denied parole twice before his asylum was granted by an immigration judge.

Aracely R. was denied parole under \u00a7 212.5(b)(5) until her medical condition became so severe that she required emergency surgery, warranting parole under \u00a7 212.5(b)(1).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aracely Decl. \u00b6 6; Decl. of Dr. Marsha Griffin, Pls.'

Their circumstances suggest that ICE denied their parole pursuant to the alleged deterrence policy until it was forced to release them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Third, the mere fact that ICE officials may have been disregarding the Morton Directive before Plaintiffs can pinpoint evidence of a deterrence policy, in 2014, does not undercut Plaintiffs' argument that such a policy existed. The fact that a policy was \"openly announced and recognized\" in 2014 does not establish that it did not exist before then. TAC \u00b6 43. Furthermore, Plaintiffs have put forth evidence that the alleged policy was re-emphasized after the 2016 Presidential election, resulting in an additional drop in the parole grant rate. As the litigation progresses, Plaintiffs will have the opportunity to further refine the period during which Defendants' alleged deterrence policy has been in place, and Defendants will have the opportunity to rebut Plaintiffs' evidence. At this stage, Plaintiffs' unrebutted statistical evidence of a significant decline in parole grants is sufficient to outweigh Defendants' weak challenge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Damus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525491\" index=\"284\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/313/317/#p326\">\n    313 F.Supp.3d at 339-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"285\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203232515\">\n    2018 WL 3232515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Having considered the evidence presented by both parties, the Court is satisfied that Plaintiffs are likely to show that Defendants have implemented a policy of taking immigration deterrence into account when making individual parole determinations for POE asylum seekers, and that this policy likely played a significant role in the repeated denials of Plaintiffs' parole requests. Discovery may show otherwise, but Plaintiffs have met the threshold required to obtain a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   <em>\n    Likelihood of Success\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Having determined that Plaintiffs are likely to show that ICE officials considered immigration deterrence when making parole determinations, the Court will determine whether Plaintiffs are likely to successfully challenge that policy under the APA. Plaintiffs assert that the policy is inconsistent with the parole factors established by the Morton Directive, and is therefore arbitrary and capricious under the APA. Pls.' Am. Mem. at 29-32. Defendants, on the other hand, argue that \"[b]ecause the [Morton Directive] is not a regulation, it lacks the force of law and cannot sustain either a constitutional claim or claim based on a question of law.\" Defs.' Am. Opp'n at 20. The Court is unconvinced by Defendants' arguments. It concludes that Plaintiffs have demonstrated that they are likely to succeed in showing that Defendants' failure to comply with the Morton Directive in declining their parole requests was arbitrary and capricious, in violation of the APA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   An agency is bound to adhere to its own regulations.

It establishes a quality assurance procedure, including nationwide monthly compliance analyses, and it states that \"[a]ny significant or recurring deficiencies identified during this monthly analysis should be explained to the affected Field Office, which will take appropriate corrective action.\" Morton Directive \u00b6 8.11. Second, the government represented to the Supreme Court in February 2017, in support of its position that bond hearings are not required for detained POE asylum seekers, that \"the existing framework provides more than sufficient process\" because the Morton Directive \"provides for notice to the alien, an interview, the opportunity to respond and present\n   evidence, a custody determination ... supervisory review, and further parole consideration based upon changed circumstances or new evidence.\" Supplemental Reply Brief for Petitioners at 6-7,\n   <em>\n    Jennings v.

Third, in his 2017 memorandum implementing Executive Order No. 13767, described above, Secretary Kelly stated that \"the Ice [Directive] ... shall remain in full force and effect,\" and that it \"shall be implemented in a manner consistent with its plain language.\" Pls.' Am. Mem. Ex. 15 at 9-10. Fourth, in declining a public interest group's request for rulemaking regarding POE asylum seekers' custody determinations, ICE's General Counsel stated that \"DHS's parole decisions are governed by [the Morton Directive], which establish extensive procedural safeguards.\" Pls.'

In\n   <em>\n    Schweiker\n   </em>\n   , the Court held that a government employee's \"minor breach\" of an agency's internal agency guidelines did not justify the Court estopping the agency's denial of certain benefits to the plaintiff, where that denial likely would not have occurred without the breach.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190256\" index=\"323\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/785/#p789\">\n    450 U.S. 785\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 789-90,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190256\" index=\"324\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/785/#p789\">\n    101 S.Ct. 1468\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190256\" index=\"325\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/785/#p789\">\n    67 L.Ed.2d 685\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1981),\n   <em>\n    superseded by statute on other grounds\n   </em>\n   , Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989, Pub.

Similarly, in a case not cited by Defendants, the D.C.

Here, however, the Morton Directive identifies specific factors and procedural requirements governing the deprivation of Plaintiffs' liberty, a decision over which they have very little control. And in both\n   <em>\n    Schweiker\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Judith Miller\n   </em>\n   , there was no evidence that the agency relied upon the relevant internal guidelines in litigation, nor that it otherwise intended to be bound by them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Abdi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277829\" index=\"333\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/280/373/#p381\">\n    280 F.Supp.3d at 389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"In short, Respondents cite no case law that would compel the conclusion that agencies can avoid application of\n   <em>\n    Accardi\n   </em>\n   by simply disclaiming any binding effect in the directive itself.\").

The Directive mandates that an alien's \"continued detention is not in the public interest,\" and therefore that the alien\n   <em>\n    should be paroled\n   </em>\n   if the alien's identity can be established and he or she presents \"neither a flight risk nor danger to the community.\" Morton Directive \u00b6 6.2. Immigration deterrence, which is directed at third parties that have not yet travelled to this country, does not relate to an\n   <em>\n    individual\n   </em>\n   parole applicant's flight risk or danger to the community. And while the Directive allows officials to consider \"exceptional, overriding factors,\" including \"serious adverse foreign policy consequences that may result if the alien is released or overriding law enforcement interests,\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.3(4), Defendants have not characterized their denial of Plaintiffs' parole requests as addressing a \"serious foreign policy consequence\" or an \"overriding law enforcement interest.\" In considering deterrence as a factor in parole determinations, ICE officials are therefore circumventing the factors laid out in the binding Directive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Because Plaintiffs have demonstrated the incompatibility of the deterrence policy and the Directive, they have met their burden of showing a likelihood of success on the merits of their APA challenge to Defendants' deterrence policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Venetian Casino Resort,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054372,3572724\" index=\"334\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/530/925/\">\n    530 F.3d at 934-35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"To maintain two irreconcilable policies, one of which ... apparently enables the agency ... to circumvent the other ... is arbitrary and capricious agency action.\") (citation omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

First, it is true that some district courts in this Circuit apply a rule under which \"where an injunction is mandatory-that is, where its terms would alter, rather than preserve, the status quo by commanding some positive act-the moving party must meet a higher standard than in the ordinary case by showing clearly that he or she is entitled to relief or that extreme or very serious damage will result from the denial of the injunction.\"\n   <em>\n    Columbia Hosp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11681785\" index=\"374\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/15/1/#p4\">\n    15 F.Supp.2d at 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Assuming such a rule applies, in this Court's estimation, Plaintiffs have carried their burden. Continued detention, where Plaintiffs might otherwise be eligible for conditional parole, constitutes serious potential damage that merits an injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   Second, Defendants correctly state that the public has an interest in the enforcement of immigration laws, but that interest does not favor denying Plaintiffs' motion. While DHS surely has substantial discretion in the area of immigration,\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arizona v.

The public interest surely does not cut in favor of permitting an agency to fail to comply with its own binding policies impacting the rights of individuals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jacksonville Port Auth. v.

Plaintiffs have shown that it is likely that they will succeed on the merits of their claims because they have supplied evidence tending to show that Defendants have considered immigration deterrence when making parole determinations, in contravention of binding agency policy. Plaintiffs have also shown that they would suffer irreparable harm in the absence of a preliminary injunction, and that a balancing of the equities and public interest considerations favor granting their requested relief. Accordingly, the Court orders Defendants to re-evaluate Plaintiff Mikailu J. for parole in strict compliance with the Morton Directive, including its procedural requirements, and without considering immigration deterrence, within two weeks of the date of the order accompanying this Opinion.
