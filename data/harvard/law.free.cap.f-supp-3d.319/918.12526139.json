CRENSHAW, JR., CHIEF UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The Court makes the following rulings on two pending motions in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Motion to Exclude References to Gang Activity and Affiliation in Government's Case in Chief\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant moves to exclude any reference to his alleged gang activities as irrelevant under Federal Rule of Evidence 401. Defendant contends that there is nothing regarding his alleged gang activities that makes any fact more or less probable at trial. (Doc. No. 66 at 1.) Defendant also contends that evidence of his alleged gang activity would be more prejudicial than probative under Federal Rules of Evidence 403 and 404. Under Rule 403, Defendant argues that \"today's climate regarding gang activity in the media and in society\" dictates that evidence that Defendant is a member of the gang MS-13 must be excluded. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) Defendant further argues that membership in a criminal gang would not be sufficiently probative of \"motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident\" under Rule 404(b)(2) to outweigh that prejudice. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In sum, Defendant argues that there insufficient connection between the allegation that he is a member of MS-13 and the alleged criminal conduct in the Superseding Indictment to risk the harm such references might cause him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Government responds that evidence of Defendant's MS-13 gang affiliation is directly relevant to the charge that he tampered with a witness as alleged in Count Three of the Superseding Indictment. (Doc. No. 81 at 4.) The Government maintains that Defendant assaulted a victim (\"Victim A\") because of Defendant's belief that Victim A was cooperating with law enforcement against him and his MS-13 gang, and thus Defendant's MS-13 gang affiliation makes a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence and is a fact of consequence in determining whether the defendant is guilty of tampering with the victim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Government further argues that any prejudicial effect is outweighed by the central nature of this evidence to the Government's case and can be cured by a cautionary instruction at trial. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) Finally, the Government contends that evidence of Defendant's MS-13 gang affiliation is admissible because it establishes motive under Rule 404(b)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Under Federal Rule of Evidence 401, evidence is relevant if: (a) it has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence; and (b) the fact is of consequence in determining the action. However, \"[t]he court may exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of one or more of the following: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.\" F.R.E. 403. Evidence of crimes, wrongs, or \"other acts\" is generally inadmissible, but \"may be admissible for another purpose, such as proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident,\" F.R.E. 404(b)(2), as long as it is also (1) sufficient and (2) not outweighed by its prejudicial effect.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In\n   <em>\n    Woodley\n   </em>\n   , there was an alleged shooting. The defendant was, in the end, charged with being a felon in knowing possession of ammunition on the date of the shooting.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=727%20Fed.%20Appx.%20136\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=727%20Fed.%20Appx.%20136\">\n    at 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court admitted gang-related evidence for the purpose of demonstrating Defendant's motive for the shooting. The Court of Appeals found no abuse of discretion on the ground that the \"gang affiliation was probative of the deteriorating relationship between [the defendant and the shooting victim], and furthered the government's theory that this incident with [the defendant], where he confronted [the shooting victim] about allegedly speaking to a member of another gang, initiated a shift in the relationship and contributed to [the defendant's] motive for shooting [the victim].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=727%20Fed.%20Appx.%20136\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=727%20Fed.%20Appx.%20136\">\n    at 140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In making this determination, the Court specifically cited that a key factor was testimony from the victim about a conversation between the defendant and the victim regarding gang affiliation that \"sparked a disagreement between the two.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=727%20Fed.%20Appx.%20136\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Government represents that the theory of the case against Defendant on Count Three is as follows. On July 25, 2017, Defendant and Victim A were in Defendant's residence. Victim A told Defendant that his gang and drug activity at a local nightclub was affecting the nightclub's business. Defendant became upset with Victim A and told him that he could not tell him or his gang how to conduct their business. Defendant then\n   accused Victim A of cooperating with law enforcement about the gang's activities. Defendant physically assaulted Victim A by pointing a rifle at Victim A, striking him with the rifle, choking him with the strap of a rifle, spraying bleach in his eyes, and damaging one of his fingers. According to the Government, Defendant committed these acts because he believed they would prevent Victim A from cooperating with law enforcement about the gang's activities. Eventually the assault ended, Defendant allowed Victim A to leave the residence, Victim A immediately sought medical assistance, and Victim A subsequently informed law enforcement of the assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On November 16, 2017, Defendant was indicted. (Doc. No. 29.) A grand jury charged the defendant with being an alien in possession of a firearm (Count One); being an alien unlawfully present in the United States (Count Two); witness tampering (Count Three); distributing and possessing with the intent to distribute cocaine (Count Four); brandishing a firearm during a drug trafficking crime and a crime of violence (Count Five); possessing cocaine with the intent to distribute (Count Six); possessing a firearm during a drug trafficking crime (Count Seven); maintaining drug-involved premises (Count Eight); and possessing a firearm during a drug trafficking crime (Count Nine). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 29.) Count Three expressly alleges that Defendant's purpose was \"to hinder, delay, and prevent the communication to a law enforcement officer of the United States of information relating to the commission and possible commission of a federal offense, including information about drug trafficking ... and the criminal racketeering activity of the Mara Salvatrucha street gang, also known as 'MS-13,' and its sub-unit and clique known as the Thompson Place Locos Salvatrucha or 'TPLS....' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Understanding why Defendant \"did what he did\" is at the heart of the witness tampering charge that comprises Count Three. Put simply, the Government charged Defendant with Count Three because it believes that Victim A confronted Defendant about the effect of his gang-based drug distribution activities and Defendant took him for an informant. As discussed above, evidence of Defendant's gang affiliation is relevant to understanding the \"interrelationship between people\" and a party's motivation. Therefore, in this case such evidence is relevant to the relationship between Defendant and Victim A and the motive for Defendant's alleged attack on Victim A. As in\n   <em>\n    Woodley\n   </em>\n   , the evidence suggests a scenario in which the Defendant and the alleged victim had a specific conversation involving gang affiliation that led to a violent disagreement. Without evidence of Defendant's alleged involvement with MS-13, the Government's theory of Count Three would make little sense and Defendant's conduct would amount to no more than an unexplained, spontaneous gratuitous beating. While evidence of Defendant's gang membership may be somewhat prejudicial, that can be controlled through a limiting jury instruction. The Government's evidence (i.e., the direct testimony of Victim A and corroborative photographs) is sufficient, is probative of the deteriorating relationship between Defendant and Victim A, and helps to explain the purported motive for Defendant's assault upon Victim A.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Woodley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=727%20Fed.%20Appx.%20136\">\n    727 Fed.Appx. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   140 ;\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

To avoid undue prejudice to Defendant that might develop, the Court will give a\n   limiting instruction after the testimony of witnesses concerning Defendant's gang membership.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

No. 81) will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Motion to Sever Offenses\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant moves under Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 8 and 14 to sever the case against him into three trials - one on Counts One, Six, Seven, and Nine; another on Counts Three, Four, and Five, and a third trial on Counts Two and Eight. Defendant's primary rationale is that the first group of counts concern events that took place on August 8, 2017 (assault, weapons possession, drug dealing), the second group concerns events that took place on July 25, 2017 (violent witness tampering, drug dealing, weapons possession) and the third group contains conduct that took place between June, July and August 2017 (unlawful presence by an alien, maintaining drug-involved premises). Defendant argues that the events that underlie these charges are impermissibly linked and that he will be unfairly prejudiced by the \"spillover\" of evidence advanced to prove them. (Doc. No. 75 at 6-9.) Defendant is particularly offended by the inclusion of Count Eight - maintaining drug-involved premises - contending that the Government included it in the Superseding Indictment \"for the sole purpose of circumventing\" the relevant federal rules. (Doc. No. 75 at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Government responds that, aside from the unlawful presence of an alien charge in Count Two, the charged offenses all revolve around Defendant's ongoing core criminal enterprise-namely, possession with intent to distribute drugs, actual drug distribution, possession of firearms to protect drug distribution, and acts of violence to further drug distribution and his gang's drug distribution (including witness tampering). (Doc. No. 80 at 4-5.) In other words, the Government contends that the dates of the actual offenses (although not that far apart) are less important, and what is more important is the Defendant's pattern of charged conduct and the common scheme that runs throughout the alleged offenses.

On the other hand, joinder is not appropriate simply because the terms \"drugs\" and \"guns\" are invoked; there must still be logical and temporal connections drawn between the alleged offenses.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chavis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9403705\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/296/450/#p456\">\n    296 F.3d at 458\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding joinder of alleged drug and firearms offenses was not proper where they occurred two years apart and were not connected by any thread);\n   <em>\n    Hubbard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11322535\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/61/1261/#p1270\">\n    61 F.3d at 1270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding joinder of drug and weapons charges was improper where they were based on unrelated events that occurred seventeen months apart).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Here, aside from Count Two, the charged offenses are of the same character and reflect Defendant's alleged underlying criminal scheme to distribute drugs and utilize his residence and the tools of the trade, including firearms, in that effort. The Government alleges that the events surrounding the July 25-related charges were part of Defendant's drug distribution and related gang activity. The Government further alleges that the events on August 7-8, 2017 (including witness tampering) were part of Defendant's plan to perpetuate that drug distribution scheme. Finally, the Government alleges that Defendant utilized his residence in this illegal plan. Evidence of Defendant's drug distribution thus girds all the charges. Furthermore, the alleged crimes are directly related to the Government's asserted reason for Defendant's alleged intimidation attack on Victim A. The Government represents that it will prove (and it is logical to understand why it would be so) that Defendant's use of his residence (where weapons, drugs, and\n   contraband were found) was significant and important to his drug distribution on July 25, 2017 and possession on August 8, 2017, providing him a safe place to store and sell drugs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Accordingly, to say the Superseding Indictment is a collection of separate and unrelated transactions is both an impermissibly narrow reading of the charges and a na\u00efve understanding of the Government's anticipated case. The Court concludes that all of the counts, aside from Count Two, spring from the same factual background, are logically related, encompass interrelated offenses tied to the underlying alleged scheme of Defendant's alleged drug distribution, and require a fair amount of overlapping proof. As charged, this case offers significant advantages in terms of judicial efficiency, which the Sixth Circuit has identified as \"the predominant consideration\" in assessing the propriety of joinder. Defendant has not met his burden of establishing that Counts One, Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven, Eight, and Nine of the Superseding Indictment were improperly joined under Rule 8(a). To the extent there may be any prejudicial effect from the \"spillover\" of evidence adduced in support of different counts of the Superseding Indictment, the Court will consider an appropriate cautionary instruction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chavis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9403705\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/296/450/#p456\">\n    296 F.3d at 461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (affirming use of proper curative instructions);\n   <em>\n    United States v. Frost\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"910731\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/125/346/#p389\">\n    125 F.3d 346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 391 (6th Cir. 1997) (\"The District Court further minimized any prejudice by instructing the jury to consider only the evidence against each defendant on each charge ... without regard to the other charges or defendants.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   There remains Count Two of the Superseding Indictment, which charges Defendant with being an alien unlawfully present in the United States. While on first blush this charge does not necessarily appear to \"fit\" with the drug distribution and firearms charges, on closer examination it requires the same proof as Count One, which charges Defendant with being an alien unlawfully in possession of a firearm. Specifically, both Counts One and Two require that the Government prove that Defendant is unlawfully present in the United States. Thus, including Count Two (1) makes sense from the standpoint of efficiency and judicial economy, and (2) will not prejudice Defendant because proof of his unlawful presence in the United States will be part of the Government's case in any event. Again, the Court will consider an appropriate limiting instruction to the jury to consider each count individually, and that guilt on one count (e.g., Count One) does not necessarily mean guilt on another (e.g., Count Two).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   This is not the end of the analysis. Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 14(a), a district court may order separate trials for a defendant facing a multi-count indictment if the \"joinder of offenses ... appears to prejudice a defendant....\" Rule 14 is \"permissive, not mandatory.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The charges flow logically from gang-related drug distribution, in particular the witness tampering and firearms allegations. The Government represents that it has a strong evidentiary case that is supported by video surveillance and photographic evidence, the direct testimony of witnesses and victims, and evidence of contraband seized at Defendant's home. Nevertheless, Defendant is not charged with so many counts that the jury will be overwhelmed with evidence. While the nature of Defendant's alleged activities, if proven, certainly has the potential to arouse a desire for justice in the jury, the Court does not find that \"spillover\" evidence would incite the jury to disregard its instructions and convict Defendant on other charges. This is particularly so because the Government's case, while supported by evidence of an ongoing drug distribution scheme, is in significant part built around two discrete incidents/time frames (July 25 and August 7 and 8) that are easily distinguishable. Defendant does not have the right to individual trials based on individual weapons possessed or individual drug transactions simply because he asserts that each will \"prejudice\" the jury's consideration of the other; rather, Defendant must show \"substantial prejudice.\" He has not done so. \"[A]bsent a showing of substantial prejudice, spillover of evidence from one [count] to another does not require severance [under Rule 14 ].\"\n   <em>\n    Hang Le-Thy Tran\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"881074\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/433/472/#p477\">\n    433 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   478 (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v.
