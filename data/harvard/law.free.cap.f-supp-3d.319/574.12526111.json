Docket No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 3, 13. Tham has two daughters who are legal permanent residents of the United States, as well as two grandchildren who are United States citizens. Docket No. 1 \u00b6 12. She first entered the United States on a six-month\n   visa in 2000 or early 2001. Docket No. 1 \u00b6 6; Docket No. 21-1 \u00b6 5. She overstayed that visa and has resided in New Hampshire for many years. Docket No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 3, 6. According to ICE Assistant Field Office Director, Alan Greenbaum, Tham received a final order of removal in October 2004. Docket No. 21-1 \u00b6 6. Greenbaum also states that Tham has filed two motions to reopen her immigration proceedings -- one in 2008 and one in 2012. Docket No. 21-1 \u00b6\u00b6 7, 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   When ICE instituted Operation Indonesian Surrender in New Hampshire in 2010, Tham voluntarily surrendered to ICE and received an Order of Supervision (\"OSUP\"). Docket No. 1 \u00b6 8. She filed a Form I-246 application seeking a stay of her removal, but the application was denied more than a year later. Docket No. 1 \u00b6 9. However, Tham did not leave the United States when her application for stay of removal was denied. Docket No. 1 \u00b6 10. Although she departed from Boston on February 9, 2012, she did not take her flight from Anchorage, Alaska, to Indonesia. Docket No. 21-1 \u00b6 13. Because Tham did not return to Indonesia, ICE revoked her OSUP in March 2012. Docket No. 21-1 \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On May 27, 2018, during an operation on Interstate 93, a Border Patrol officer stopped Tham at a checkpoint near Lincoln, New Hampshire, while she was in a car with her daughter. Docket No. 1 \u00b6 11; Docket No. 21-1 \u00b6 16. Lincoln is about 90 miles south of the Canadian border.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 1 \u00b6 11. Border Patrol contacted ICE, and ICE then took Tham into custody on May 28, 2018. Docket No. 21-1 \u00b6 17. She has been detained at the Strafford County House of Corrections in New Hampshire since that date.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 1 \u00b6 11; Docket No. 21-1 \u00b6 18. The record does not indicate that Tham has ever been convicted of a crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The government argues that this Court does not have jurisdiction over Tham's habeas petition because the only proper respondent is the warden of the New Hampshire facility where she is detained.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 21 at 4-6. In support, the government cites to the \"immediate custodian\" rule, which states that \"in habeas challenges to present physical confinement -- 'core challenges' -- the default rule is that the proper respondent is the warden of the facility where the prisoner is being held, not the Attorney General or some other remote supervisory official.\"\n   <em>\n    Rumsfeld v. Padilla\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2527700\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/426/#p435\">\n    542 U.S. 426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 435,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2527700\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/426/#p435\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2711\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2527700\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/426/#p435\">\n    159 L.Ed.2d 513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004). Tham opposes, maintaining that because ICE has \"total control\" over her, the Field Office Director Rebecca Adducci is a proper respondent. Docket No. 23 at 1-4. She also claims that the government has waived any arguments regarding personal jurisdiction or venue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Docket No. 23 at 4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   First, the government did not waive any jurisdictional arguments in the\n   <em>\n    Devitri\n   </em>\n   litigation. In that case, the Court held that the petitioners were \"in custody\" because they were challenging a condition of their OSUPs.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523418\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/290/86/\">\n    290 F.Supp.3d at 90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Devitri\n   </em>\n   petitioners, save one, were not in actual physical custody.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523278\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/289/287/\">\n    289 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   292 ;\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523418\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/290/86/\">\n    290 F.Supp.3d at 90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The immediate custodian rule was never at issue in that litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2527700\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/426/#p435\">\n    542 U.S. at 437-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2527700\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/426/#p435\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2711\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he immediate physical custodian rule, by its terms, does not apply when a habeas petitioner challenges something other than his present physical confinement.\"). The government will not be precluded from raising the issue here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Second, Petitioner's argument that Adducci is a proper respondent because ICE's New England Field Office exercises control over her is unavailing. In\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court stated: \"In challenges to present physical confinement, we reaffirm that the immediate custodian, not a supervisory official who exercises legal control, is the proper respondent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2527700\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/426/#p435\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2527700\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/426/#p435\">\n    at 439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2527700\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/426/#p435\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2711\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vasquez v.

Tham seeks to be released from her present detention at the Strafford County House of Corrections. And, there are no extraordinary facts in this case that would warrant deviating from the immediate custodian rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vasquez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11177202\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/233/688/#p696\">\n    233 F.3d at 696\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (listing \"extraordinary circumstances\" when supervisory immigration official may be named as respondent, including where there are \"facts suggesting furtiveness\" or \"bad faith\"). Thus, the correct respondent in this action is Christopher Brackett, the Superintendent of the Strafford County House of Corrections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As Adducci is no longer a respondent, the Court finds that it does not have jurisdiction over Tham's petition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2527700\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/426/#p435\">\n    542 U.S. at 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2527700\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/426/#p435\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2711\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (confirming \"general rule that for core habeas petitions challenging present physical confinement, jurisdiction lies in only one district: the district of confinement\").
