Thus, based on the matching page counts, a reasonable jury could conclude that the 13 pages not accounted for were not police reports or other police material created or gathered during the Valentin investigation. Three of these pages may be accounted for by the index and the photocopies of the front and back of the file folder.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    <strong>\n     F. Facts at Summary Judgment\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    While Rivera advances three distinct due process theories and related federal and state law claims, they all revolve around a closely related body of summary judgment evidence. Defendants challenge the sufficiency of the summary judgment record to support several of Rivera's key factual positions on what happened during the Valentin investigation through trial. The court considers many of those challenges in the following paragraphs to establish what the jury could reasonably find on this record viewed in the light most favorable to Rivera.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Rivera Was Pre-Selected as the Investigation's Target\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    First, a reasonable jury could find that Rivera was selected as the investigation's target before the police interviewed Lopez. Whether this dispute is genuine largely depends on exactly when Lopez was first interviewed and picked Rivera from a book of suspected gang members. The RD file, but not Wadas' file, includes a copy of Rivera's criminal history report stamped as \"issued on inquiry\" the day Valentin was shot (\"August 27 criminal history report\"). Pl. Ex. 4 at Wron 55. If Lopez initially identified Rivera on the day of the Valentin shooting, the criminal inquiry might be explainable as the product of Lopez's identification earlier that day, but if the police had no suspects yet, the jury could reasonably view the report as marking the first step in framing Rivera.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    Though defendants point to evidence that Lopez was first interviewed on the night of the shooting,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Pl. Ex. 4 at Wron 53, a report submitted by Guevara and Gawrys summarizing the Valentin investigation (\"the September 16 report\") states that Lopez was interviewed and picked Rivera from a gang book two days later on August 29, 1988.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at Wron 9-10. With inferences favorable to Rivera, another report, this one prepared by Leonard and McLaughlin on August 29, 1988, corroborates the date of Lopez's first interview and gang book identification as two days after the Valentin shooting.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl. Ex. 4 at Wron 29-30 (recounting investigation conducted since August 27 and transitioning to description of Lopez's gang book identification by stating \"in continuation of the investigation of the above captioned incident,\" which can be reasonably read as implying a break between August 27 and Lopez's interview and gang book identifications). To be sure, the timeline just described conflicts with other evidence in the record, including some of Lopez's post-recantation testimony, but defendants point to no evidence explaining the dates given in the two reports just discussed.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Resp. to SAF \u00b6 23 and material cited therein. Because the jury could believe Rivera or the defendants' timeline, the dispute here must be deemed genuine, and Rivera's version receives credence at summary judgment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Valentin Never Identified a Photo of Rivera, and the Police Report Stating that He Did is False\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    A reasonable jury could also find that, despite statements of police reports to the contrary,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Pl. Ex. 4 at Wron 10, Valentin, the victim, never identified Rivera as the shooter from a photograph. Defendants point to evidence that on the day of the shooting, Valentin, while in the hospital, told police officers that the person who shot him was a 16-18-year-old Hispanic male believed to be a member of the Latin Kings. Officers SMF \u00b6 6;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Resp. to Officers SMF \u00b6 6 (citing McLaughlin Dep. 167:5-19, Pl.

Resp. to Officers SMF \u00b6 12 (responding by pointing to evidence that Valentin stated that a member of the Imperial Gangsters shot him).

A reasonable jury could find that the next two Valentin identifications never happened.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    Some police records and other evidence state that Leonard and McLaughlin attempted to show Valentin photos of Rodriguez and Rivera the next day (August 31, 1988).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 16;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Officer Defs.

According to defendants' evidence, Valentin's eyes were tearing, he could not focus because was heavily medicated, and Leonard and McLaughlin left.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Resp. to Officers SOF \u00b6 17. But Rivera also points to Leonard's deposition testimony that he recalled meeting only once with Valentin on August 27, 1988, and the testimony of three of the people who participated in the first lineup that, viewed favorably to Rivera, no photos were taken.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6 16 (citing Leonard Dep. 54:13-15, Pl. Ex. 26) (citations to other depositions omitted). For summary judgment purposes, drawing the most favorable inferences in Rivera's favor compels the finding that the documented August 31, 1988, photo array shown to Valentin never happened.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    It is also undisputed that a portion of the September 16, 1988, report prepared by Gawrys and Guevara is false.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Resp. to SAF \u00b6 46. The report states that Valentin identified Lopez in what could be a third photo review on September 10, 1988. Pl. Ex. 4 at Wron 10. Defendants do not dispute that by September 9, 1988, \"Valentin was in effect in a comatose condition-among other things, he could not breathe on his own and was fully intubated ....\" Resp. to Pl. SAF \u00b6 46. Valentin could not have reviewed a photo album or spoken to another person, so the September 16 report's statement that Valentin identified Rivera is false.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Lopez Picked a Filler at the First Lineup\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    The jury could also reasonably find that Lopez picked a filler at the first lineup on August 31, 1988. Three basic narratives of the first lineup emerge from the summary judgment record. The first derives from\n    Lopez's testimony that he picked Rivera at the first lineup.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Officers SMF \u00b6 24 (citing Lopez's post-conviction hearing and deposition testimony).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    In the second, no lineup occurred. This version comes from police reports and forms in the RD file. They confirm that Rivera and Rodriguez were arrested on August 30, 1988, for a lineup, but they say the lineup ultimately never happened because Lopez could not be located and because Valentin was unable to view a photo array.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Resp. to Officers SMF \u00b6\u00b6 11, 13, 21. The documents state that Lopez could not be located or, more specifically, was asleep when police officers went to his home in the early morning of August 31, 1988, and Lopez's family told the officers to return later. But later that day, the documents say, Lopez could not be located (family members told police officers that Lopez might be at his father's home), so Rivera and Rodriguez had to be released.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    The third, the one of which Rivera is a proponent, derives from most of the same evidence and inferences from how the investigation later unfolded. Again, it is undisputed that Rivera was released after the first lineup. Resp. to Officers SMF \u00b6 25. Rivera submits that Lopez's testimony that the first lineup occurred should be credited, but Lopez does not accurately remember who he picked.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Officers SMF \u00b6 26 (citing Lopez's deposition testimony that he saw the real shooter about a week after the shooting and realized he identified the wrong person).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    Defendants argue that Rivera cannot pick and choose from Lopez's testimony about the August 31, 1988, lineup; it is all or nothing. Officers Mem. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 7-8 (no citation for proposition). But the jury will be free to believe all, some, or none of Lopez's and the other witnesses' testimony, so Rivera may select as much of Lopez's testimony as he wishes to be regarded as true at summary judgment.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Kadia v.

The jury's prerogative partially to disbelieve Lopez's testimony that he picked Rivera at the first lineup does not by itself furnish a basis for the jury to find that Lopez picked a filler, however; it just leaves a hole in the proof.

SAF \u00b6\u00b6 39-41. To reiterate, that the first lineup occurred must be accepted as true at summary judgment; the question is who Lopez\n    picked. If Lopez picked Rivera, why not arrest him within twenty-four hours as happened on September 15, 1988? And if Lopez picked Rivera at the first lineup, falsifying a police report saying Valentin identified Rivera could reasonably be seen by the jury as taking an unnecessary risk. Seen favorably to Rivera, his release and the two-week delay in rearresting him for the second lineup can be reasonably explained by Lopez's selection of a filler. Indeed, once the fact that the first lineup occurred is deemed true, the second lineup seems unnecessary unless the first one resulted in something other than Rivera's selection. Defendants point to testimony that not every positive identification leads immediately to arrest. That may be so, but the jury could reasonably wonder why approving charges would take two weeks and why someone thought a second lineup was a good idea. Again, the jury could decide that the answer can be found in Lopez picking a filler on August 31, 1988.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    4.\n    <em>\n     Lopez Told Guevara and Leonard that Rivera Was the \"Wrong Guy\"\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    Rivera relies on Lopez's post-recantation testimony to establish that he tried, but failed, to recant to a man and woman conducting the September 15, 1988, lineup.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.

Together, the questions Guevara exercised his right not to answer cover virtually every aspect of the Valentin investigation, prosecution, and trial, and if the adverse inference that they would be answered in a way admitting culpability were to be drawn, those answers implicate Guevara and many, if not all, of the other officer defendants in egregious violations of Rivera's constitutional rights at every stage of the Valentin investigation and prosecution.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Pl. SAF \u00b6\u00b6 22, 26-27, 40-41, 46, 52, 61, 65, 79.

At the heart of Rivera's theory of the case lies his contention that the police officers involved decided to railroad him on the day of the shooting and set about building a case against him by feeding a story to Lopez to make his planted identification seem plausible, fabricating a paper trail corroborating the identification, manipulating the lineup process, and burying inconsistent and exculpatory evidence. In his response to defendants' motions for summary judgment, Rivera maintains that his due process right to a fair trial was violated in three, distinct ways. ECF No. 321 at 9. First, Rivera claims that evidence fabricated by the police, including knowingly false testimony by Guevara, was used at his trial to convict him.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Avery v.

Defendant Gawrys took notes as a gang crimes officer, keeping the[m] in his own personal street file, and then shredding his street file at the end of each investigation. He also wrote notes to the next shift related to ongoing investigations, and at the end of an investigation would take those out of his files and destroy them. Defendant Guzman kept his own notes, would not transfer everything from his notes into his reports, and then would shred his notes. Defendant Fallon took notes in his own personal spiral notebook, and then threw away the notes. Defendant Zacharias would take notes on a piece of paper that was not an official police form of any kind, and then discard his notes. Defendant Mingey, a sergeant overseeing the gang crimes officers that investigated the Valentin homicide, testified that there was no centralized file for an investigation and the specialists instead kept files in their own lockers or elsewhere, and destroyed their notes.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-252\">\n    Resp. to SAF \u00b6 113 (citations omitted). Defendants' only response to these facts, aside from the claim that they are not material, is to argue (improperly in a Local Rule 56.1 response) that the general orders applied to detectives, not gang crimes investigators.\n    <em>\n     See id.\n    </em>\n    That does not create a genuine dispute, and it seems to imply that the practice of keeping and destroying personal notes remained unabated, at least in 1988 (and perhaps today, for the record does not say anything about whether non-detectives are bound by CPD record policies today), among gang officers working gang crimes and there is evidence that Area Four (the defendants here worked in Area Five) utilized a practice of leaving notes about something needing follow up for the next shift; the notes never made it into investigative files.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 114 (citing Rinaldi Dep. 28:1-30:10, Pl.

Ex. 12, ECF No. 313-15, of plaintiff's expert on police practices, Michael Brasfield (\"Brasfield\"), lends further support to this\n    <em>\n     Monell\n    </em>\n    theory.\n    <em>\n     See also\n    </em>\n    Report of Jeff Nobel at 14, City Tab 24, ECF No. 307-2 (creating fact dispute with contrary opinion). Brasfield identifies several defects in the City's general and special orders issued in the wake of\n    <em>\n     Palmer\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Jones\n    </em>\n    which in his opinion left the risk of nondisclosure unacceptably high.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Brasfield Report at 56-59. Those deficiencies include not keeping investigative records in a central place, not covering gang crimes officers even though they participated substantially in investigations, leaving too much discretion on what goes in the file, and insufficient training and auditing, even after General Order 86-3's formal auditing requirement.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"492\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%20477394\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    The City does not challenge the admissibility of those opinions.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Resp. to SAF \u00b6\u00b6 121-22.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-257\">\n    The City does claim that Brasfield's analysis of several files produced in discovery is unreliable. Brasfield based his opinion on a comparison of files for homicide investigations for the three years surrounding the Valentin investigation.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Brasfield Report 41. The files came from three sources: (1) 38 \"criminal defense files\" produced by the Cook County Public Defender's Office;\n    <footnotemark>\n     20\n    </footnotemark>\n    (2) corresponding \"permanent retention files\" maintained at the CPD's warehouse; and (3) \"investigative files\" kept in filing cabinets at Gang Crimes North.\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation index=\"493\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%20477394\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n     <extracted-citation index=\"494\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%20477394\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Attachment F (summarizing files reviewed). Brasfield concluded that the criminal defense files were missing documents in the investigative files: (a) 74% were missing handwritten notes; (b) 10% were missing General Progress Reports; (c) 17% were missing memoranda. Brasfield Report 43;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Brasfield Report Ex. F (summarizing files reviewed).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-258\">\n    According to the City, Brasfield's analysis ignores the fact that permanent retention files were never supposed to contain GPRs, so their absence signifies nothing of evidentiary value. City Mem. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 15;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Resp. to City SMF \u00b6 25. This seems to get the direction of comparison backwards. As the court understands Brasfield's comparison,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Report 41-49, some permanent retention files did contain handwritten notes, GPRs, and other documents not required by the governing general orders. Yet despite their sometimes gratuitous inclusion in the file in the CPD warehouse, they do not appear in the corresponding criminal defense attorney's file.\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation index=\"495\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%20477394\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     see also, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Brasfield Attachment F at 5, 6, 8 (C. Lee, supplemental report (\"SR\") present in RD file but not in defense file; M. Green, SR, criminal history report, statements, handwritten notes not in defense file but in RD file; E. Madrid, same for SRs and lineup SRs). If anything, this seems to help plaintiff, not hurt him.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-259\">\n    Nor is the age of the defense files and the lack of evidence of a full chain of custody for them fatal to Brasfield's methodology. Perhaps the documents were removed from the defense files later; perhaps they were lost or stolen; Brasfield cannot say for sure.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Resp. to City SMF \u00b6 59 (statement of Brasfield that he could not confirm that the defense attorneys' files were in the same condition as they were when documents were produced to the defense attorney). Brasfield also\n    reviewed only 6 Cook County State's Attorney's Office (\"CCSAO\") files when conducting his comparison, so the police might have given everything to the CCSAO, making it responsible for the gaps.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Beaman v. Freesmeyer\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6888301\" index=\"496\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/776/500/#p512\">\n     776 F.3d 500\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 512 (7th Cir. 2015). Those possibilities provide ammunition on cross examination. Were Brasfield to just say that documents were withheld because he is an expert, his opinion would need to be excluded. But looking across all the files, Brasfield opines that he detects a pattern of excluding certain categories of documents. Brasfield Report 43-44. Systematic exclusion of certain categories of documents weakens the inference that the absences are the result of the files' age or something else equally innocuous, and that is what will aid the jury in weighing the facts.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Fields\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"497\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204553411\">\n     2017 WL 4553411\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *3 n.8 (overruling similar objections to analogous methodology to opinion that same widespread practice existed).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-260\">\n    Finally, the City faults Brasfield's analysis because he did not determine whether any of the withheld documents were material in the\n    <em>\n     Brady\n    </em>\n    sense.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    City SMF \u00b6 63. Brasfield did not have to perform a materiality analysis. As the City observes, Mot. Sum. J. 17, Rivera must \"demonstrate that a municipal decision reflects deliberate indifference to\n    <em>\n     the risk\n    </em>\n    that a violation of a particular constitutional or statutory right will follow the decision.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Bd. of the Cty.
