Because I find that such an exception has no basis in law, and would contravene the public policies undergirding the FLSA, I find that the parties' joint motion for settlement approval must be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff David S. Jones (\"plaintiff\") brought this action against defendants Trevor Tahiem Smith, Jr. and Starbus LLC (\"defendants\") on May 3, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint, dated May 3, 2016 (\"Compl.\"), Dkt. No. 1.) Plaintiff alleged that, while employed by defendants as defendant Smith's personal chauffeur, defendants illegally failed to pay him required overtime compensation and subjected him to verbal harassment and discrimination based on his age. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 19-53, 61-64). Plaintiff further alleged that on the day his employment was terminated, defendant Smith physically assaulted him. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20201\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20201\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 65-75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) He asserted five causes of action for: (1) unpaid overtime under the FLSA; (2) unpaid wages under the New York Labor Law (\"NYLL\"); (3) damages for age discrimination under the New York City Human Rights Law (\"NYCHRL\"); (4) damages for assault; and (5) damages for battery. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 78-111.) Defendants answered on August 15, 2016, denying all of plaintiff's allegations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Answer to Complaint, dated Aug. 15, 2016, Dkt. No. 14.) The parties conducted nearly a year of discovery and settlement negotiations before arriving at a settlement in principle in November 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion for Extension of Time to File, dated Nov. 2, 2017, Dkt. No. 27.) The Honorable Pamela K. Chen, United States District Judge, subsequently directed the parties to file a motion for\n   settlement approval. (Order, dated Nov. 6, 2017.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The parties then filed a letter seeking the court's guidance on how to submit their agreement for approval. In the letter, defendants' counsel insisted that the settlement could not be filed publicly, advancing two lines of argument to support this contention. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Joint Letter, dated Dec. 11, 2017 (\"Joint Ltr.\"), Dkt. No. 29, at 1-2.) First, the parties stated that because four out of the five claims were non-FLSA claims that did not require judicial approval, \"the rationale that 'the public has an independent interest in assuring that employees [sic] wages are fair and thus do not endanger the national health and well-being' is inapplicable to Plaintiff's claim.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Joint Ltr. at 1-2.) Second, the parties stated that the settlement agreement itself contained a confidentiality provision because defendant was \"both a public figure (a well-known recording artist) and private individual\" and that requiring him to submit the agreement via ECF \"would make it publicly available in contravention of the confidentiality provision.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) They concluded by asking for \"the Court's guidance on how to submit [the agreement] for approval.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Shortly thereafter, the parties consented to magistrate judge jurisdiction. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Consent to Jurisdiction by U.S. Magistrate Judge, dated Dec. 13, 2017, Dkt. No. 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I held a telephone conference with the parties on April 5, 2018 to discuss these issues. During the conference, the parties suggested an alternative rationale for avoiding\n   <em>\n    Cheeks\n   </em>\n   review and public disclosure of the settlement. They offered that if they were to stipulate to the plaintiff being deemed an independent contractor for settlement purposes only they could avoid the need for court approval. While I was skeptical of this argument, I instructed the parties to submit an executed version of the settlement agreement to chambers for my review. (Minute Entry, dated Apr. 5, 2018.) Counsel submitted an executed copy of the parties' proposed settlement agreement to my chambers on May 1, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Avoiding\n    <em>\n     Cheeks\n    </em>\n    Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Second Circuit held in\n   <em>\n    Cheeks\n   </em>\n   that court approval is required for all stipulated dismissals of FLSA actions with prejudice pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(1)(A)(ii).\n   <em>\n    Cheeks v. Freeport Pancake House\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5769120\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/796/199/#p206\">\n    796 F.3d 199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 206 (2d Cir. 2015). Since then, wage and hour litigators have employed several approaches in attempting to avoid judicial review of their settlement agreements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As far as I can tell, however, the parties' argument that stipulating to plaintiff's independent\n   contractor status allows them to avoid all of the constraints attendant with\n   <em>\n    Cheeks\n   </em>\n   review is a novel one. The parties here do not elaborate their argument at any length or cite any precedents in support of their position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs seem to be relying on the idea that the FLSA is inapplicable to independent contractors.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ethelberth v. Choice Sec. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325867\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/91/339/#p350\">\n    91 F.Supp.3d 339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 350 (E.D.N.Y. 2015) (\"the FLSA's overtime provision applies only to 'employees' and not independent contractors....\") (internal citation omitted). Their contention is that if they stipulate to independent contractor status for the purpose of the settlement, the court may ignore the usual prohibition on confidentiality provisions in FLSA settlements. The executed proposed agreement submitted to chambers contains the following language:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    WHEREAS,\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff agrees and consents to be classified and treated as an independent contractor hired by the Defendants and not as Defendants' employee for the purposes of the settlement of his claims in this Action, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    WHEREAS,\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff expressly reserves the right to contend that he was in fact an employee of Defendants for the purposes of said claims in the event that this Agreement is not approved or this Action is otherwise not settled....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   ... 6.\n   <strong>\n    Confidentiality\n   </strong>\n   . Given that Plaintiff agrees and consents to be classified and treated as an independent contractor, as aforesaid, solely for the purposes of settling his claims, Plaintiff further consents to this Agreement remaining confidential in its entirety.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff acknowledges and agrees that because of Defendants' public persona the confidentiality of this Agreement is\n   <em>\n    of the essence\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Thus, while the parties are still seeking the court's approval of the settlement agreement, they are attempting to stipulate for settlement purposes only that the FLSA is inapplicable to the plaintiff. The agreement as written further provides that in the event plaintiff breaches the confidentiality provision, \"Defendants shall be entitled to an award of its costs spent enforcing the provision, including all reasonable attorneys' fees associated with the enforcement action, without regard to whether the Defendants can establish actual damages from Plaintiff's breach.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Having carefully considered the issue, I conclude that I am not empowered to permit the parties to make this sort of end-run around\n   <em>\n    Cheeks\n   </em>\n   . The rights protected by the FLSA (and by judicial review of FLSA settlements) are not merely private ones. In fact, \"although employees, through counsel, often voluntarily consent to dismissal of FLSA claims and, in some instances, are resistant to judicial review of settlement, the purposes of [the FLSA] require that it be applied\n   <em>\n    even to those who would decline its protections.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Socias v. Vornado Realty L.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4077797\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/297/38/#p40\">\n    297 F.R.D. 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 40 (E.D.N.Y. 2014) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The Second Circuit has long held that \"an employer's self-serving label of workers as independent contractors is not controlling.\"\n   <em>\n    Brock v. Superior Care, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10548996\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/840/1054/#p1059\">\n    840 F.2d 1054\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1059 (2d Cir. 1988). Instead, courts in this circuit apply the \"economic realities\" test to determine whether an individual is an employee or an independent contractor for FLSA purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hart v. Rick's Cabaret Int'l, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3820617\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/967/901/#p911\">\n    967 F.Supp.2d 901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 911-12 (S.D.N.Y. 2013). I see no basis, therefore, for the court to credit what the parties have simply decided to label their relationship in this context, particularly given plaintiff's express reservation of his right to contest this issue if the settlement were not approved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The potential for abuse by allowing an exception like this to\n   <em>\n    Cheeks\n   </em>\n   review extends far beyond the parties in this case. Disputes about the applicability of the FLSA to particular employees are central to scores of FLSA cases, and the independent contractor exemption has been one of the most fiercely contested issues in FLSA cases for the past few decades. Simply allowing the parties to stipulate that the statute is no longer applicable for settlement purposes would re-open the door to the kind of employer abuses in FLSA settlement negotiations that drove the Second Circuit to clarify the need for settlement review in\n   <em>\n    Cheeks\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cheeks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5769120\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/796/199/#p206\">\n    796 F.3d at 206-07\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Examining the basis on which district courts recently rejected several proposed FLSA settlements highlights the potential for abuse in such settlements, and underscores why judicial approval in the FLSA setting is necessary.... [T]he FLSA is a uniquely protective statute. The burdens [of settlement review] must be balanced against the FLSA's primary remedial purpose: to prevent abuses by unscrupulous employers, and remedy the disparate bargaining power between employers and employees. As the cases described above illustrate, the need for such employee protections, even where the employees are represented by counsel, remains.\") (internal citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

That is, an agreement settling an FLSA claim that is submitted for court approval is indisputably a document that is 'relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process,' and thus a 'judicial document' subject to the presumption of access.\"\n   <em>\n    Wolinsky v.

Apr. 28, 2017) (citing cases). The presumption of public access here is only bolstered by the public policies undergirding the FLSA. \"Shielding FLSA settlement agreements from the public prevents public scrutiny that otherwise attends\n   to judicial documents and contributes to our collective understanding and safeguarding of justice.

Again, however, the parties have cited no case law to support this argument. Generally, though, district courts in this circuit have applied the same body of law regarding the presumption of public access to cases involving other celebrity employers, without giving their notoriety any weight against the presumption of public access.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Olano v.
