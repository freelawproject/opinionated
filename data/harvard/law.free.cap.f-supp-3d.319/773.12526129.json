The ordinance has two parts. First, it prohibits an employer from inquiring about a prospective employee's wage history (\"the Inquiry Provision\"); and second, it makes it illegal for an employer to rely on wage history \"at any stage in the employment process\" to determine a salary for an employee (\"the Reliance Provision\"). The basic premise of the law's prohibitions is that allowing employers to formulate job offers based on prior salaries that are historically lower for women and minorities perpetuates the wage inequity problem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff, the Chamber of Commerce for Greater Philadelphia (\"the Chamber\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   on behalf of itself and several of its members including Comcast Corporation, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and Bittender Construction, seeks a preliminary injunction, arguing that both the Inquiry and Reliance Provisions violate the First Amendment's free speech clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   While the City of Philadelphia's efforts in passing the ordinance are certainly laudable, I conclude that the Inquiry Provision violates the First Amendment's free speech clause. Consequently the Chamber's Motion for a Preliminary Injunction as to that portion of the Ordinance will be granted. Because I conclude that the Reliance Provision does not implicate speech, and thus the First Amendment, the Chamber's Motion as to that portion of the ordinance will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As of 2015, women in Pennsylvania earn 79 cents for every dollar a man earns, and African American women earn 68 cents for every dollar a man earns.

After the Committee reported the bill favorably, it was unanimously passed on December 8, 2016. The Ordinance was signed into law by the Mayor of Philadelphia on January 23, 2017 and was scheduled to take effect on May 23, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Ordinance relies on the following findings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (a) In Pennsylvania, women are paid 79 cents for every dollar a man makes, according to a United States Census Bureau 2015 report. Women of color are paid even less.

I dismissed the Chamber's original Complaint for lack of standing on May 1, 2017, allowing the Chamber to file an amended complaint. On June 13, 2017, the Chamber filed the Amended Complaint and refiled its Motion for a Preliminary Injunction (\"Motion\").

For example, acquisition of wage history is allowed in other contexts such as for gathering market information or identifying applicants whom employers can or cannot afford. And, unlike discrimination, the existence of a wage history is not in and of itself illegal. In\n   <em>\n    Pittsburgh Press\n   </em>\n   , the aiding of a discriminatory employment practice necessarily pertained to illegal discriminatory employment practice. Simply because wage history could be relied upon in fashioning a salary in violation of the Reliance Provision does not render all other legal activity related to wage history illegal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dunagin v.

Additionally, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Pittsburgh Press\n   </em>\n   where the provision rendering discriminatory employment\n   practices was unchallenged, here, the Reliance Provision is challenged.\n   <em>\n    Pittsburgh Press\n   </em>\n   is therefore distinguishable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The City's reliance upon\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Ass'n of Tobacco Outlets, Inc. v.

The underlying commercial transaction is not illegal like the sale of tobacco products through coupons or multi-pack discounts was in\n   <em>\n    Tobacco Outlets\n   </em>\n   . Rather, the underlying commercial transaction here, hiring employees, is lawful.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Katt v.

If the City's position were correct, City Council could pass any law with two provisions, one of which impermissibly regulates commercial speech, so long as the other provision renders one use of the underlying commercial speech unlawful. For all of the forgoing reasons, I find that the Inquiry Provision does not concern unlawful activity nor is it misleading, and will thus proceed to the next step of the\n   <em>\n    Central Hudson\n   </em>\n   test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Is the City's Interest Substantial?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The parties agree that the City has a substantial interest in promoting wage equity and reducing discriminatory wage disparities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    Does the Inquiry Provision Directly Advance the City's Asserted Interest?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The City maintains that the Inquiry Provision satisfies this prong of the analysis, insisting there is sufficient evidence to establish that the wage gap is the result of discrimination and that City Council's decision to prohibit inquiries into wage history will promote wage equality. The City first points to the testimony before City Council of Terry L. Fromson, Managing Attorney for the Women's Law Project, for the proposition that the wage gap begins with a woman's first job and grows over time because raises after an employee is hired are calculated based on current salary. Relying on the testimony of Rue Landau, Executive Director of the PCHR, the City\n   then asserts that based on this initial wage gap, common sense suggests that asking about wage history during the hiring process propagates wage inequality. The City also points to the affidavit of a labor economics expert, Dr. Janice Madden, and an article published quoting Dr. Victoria Budson, Executive Director of the Women and Public Policy Program at Harvard University's Kennedy School, which I address in greater detail below. The City concludes that Council \"had more than enough expert opinion and information\" to conclude that the Inquiry Provision would advance the asserted interest.

From these conclusions, Dr. Madden formulates her central observations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   Salary histories are tainted because applicants from the majority group have a higher proper salary, given their objective credentials, than do identically qualified applicants from groups subject to discriminatory treatment. Consideration of prior salary in the hiring process is comparable to hiring by using racially or gender-based requirements, not necessary to the job, to screen applicants differently by race or gender.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   If there were no wage discrimination in the labor market, then prior salary would correlate with performance and ability for both majority and minority workers. If there were any such discrimination in the labor market, however, the use of prior salary history in determining whom to hire or in setting salaries would lead to differential hiring and pay for applicants from groups subject to discrimination because of their race, gender, or ethnicity[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Finally, the City points to an article published quoting Dr. Victoria Budson, Executive Director of the Women and Public Policy Program at Harvard University's Kennedy School, in which Dr. Budson states that because research shows that women begin with a lower salary, it is \"empirically true\" that they will make less when employers base future salaries on that initial lower salary. Acknowledging that no researchers have yet evaluated this claim, Dr. Budson states that \"[w]e can't only move things forward once we've tested them,\" and \"[w]hat we know is when women-and particularly women and men of color-get hired, people are more likely to underpay them.

In\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   , that evidence (couched as \"legislative findings\") was substantial and included: recognition by major professional associations of mental health practitioners and researchers for nearly 40 years that being gay, lesbian, or bisexual is not a disorder; \"reports, articles, resolutions and proposition statements\" from mental health organizations opposing counseling designed to alter sexual orientation; and a report issued by the American Psychological Association finding that this type of counseling is ineffective and/or causes harm.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 221-22. As discussed in greater detail below, there was far less support before City Council when it concluded that the harm of discriminatory initial salaries was perpetuated in subsequent salaries thus contributing to the wage gap.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   With the above precedent in mind, my focus is on whether City Council relied upon sufficient evidence to conclude that the wage gap is a result of discrimination and whether curtailing inquiry into allegedly discriminatory wage history will alleviate this gap. The record relied upon by City Council consists of testimony from five professionals who primarily emphasized the wage gap in Pennsylvania. (Resp., Ex. 2 at 2-16.) Importantly, this conclusion is not disputed. These witnesses also opined that the Inquiry Provision of the Ordinance would help to narrow the wage gap. They referred to a purported bias built into a woman or minority person's very first wage and then took the very large step to conclude that the prohibition of questions regarding wage history will prevent this bias from carrying over to future wages. The critical problem for the City is, however, that these avowals are unsubstantiated conclusions. While the witnesses who presented to City Council are experienced in their respective fields, their observations are mostly conjectural in nature. Not one witness pointed to any study, data, statistics, report, or any other evidence to support the proposition that initially depressed wages reflect discrimination. And, none of the testimony addressed why asking about wage history necessarily results in the perpetuation of an initial discriminatory wage. Moreover, no witness cited to evidence that prior wage history inquiry contributes to a discriminatory wage gap.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   While the conclusion that a discriminatory wage gap could be affected by prohibiting wage history inquiries was characterized by respected professionals as a logical, common sense outcome, more is\n   needed. Like the\n   <em>\n    Rubin\n   </em>\n   case, the testimony in support of this theory is riddled with conclusory statements, amounting to \"various tidbits\" and \"educated guesses.\" Importantly, aside from Dr. Madden's affidavit, the information relied upon by the City does not address the possibility that disparate wages could also be based on factors having nothing to do with discrimination, such as qualifications, experience, or any number of other factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The two anecdotes provided by Jeni Wright and Melissa Beatriz Skolnick also do not provide sufficient evidence that the Inquiry Provision will directly advance the City's interest in narrowing the wage gap. Ms. Wright testified that she felt uncomfortable when she was asked to list her salaries at her last five jobs because she \"[did] not want her most recent salary to be the ceiling for what a prospective employer would pay [her].\" Ms. Skolnick testified that she had been asked about her wage history several times while applying for jobs, which made her feel uncomfortable because she believed the only relevant issue was whether she possessed the qualifications. She further testified that she was promised a certain wage at one job and then paid less, and at another job learned she was earning less than her colleagues who were male and white. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18.) While these anecdotes are perhaps demonstrative of the general wage gap, which again is not in dispute, they do not provide support for the conclusion that such gap is a result of discrimination or that allowing inquiry into wage history perpetuates discriminatory wages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   The article that quotes Dr. Budson also does not assist the City in filling the evidence void. There, she makes the conclusory statement that because studies show that women start with a lower salary than men, it is \"empirically true\" that they will make less money when employers base future salaries on that initial lower salary. But Dr. Budson does not tie her conclusion to discriminatory lower wages or the import of asking about wage history. She also acknowledges there is no research that has been done to demonstrate what she claims to be \"empirically true,\" and therefore further fails to provide evidence of the alleged harm. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Finally, Dr. Madden attempts to link numerous inferences that support the conclusion that the Inquiry Provision will reduce discriminatory wage disparities. These inferences are: (1) starting salaries differ by race and gender for employees of equivalent skills and abilities (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 5 at 8); (2) these salary differences are not explained by legitimate factors such as credentials or qualifications (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8, 10); (3) starting salaries are a primary source of subsequent salary differentials by race and gender (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10); and (4) salary history correlates with race and gender, resulting in lower salaries for women and members of minority racial and ethnic groups. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Dr. Madden's first inference is supported by ample data and is not contested. It is the second and third propositions that require further scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   As for her second inference, Dr. Madden supplies little support for the supposition that salary differences are not explained by legitimate factors such as credentials or qualifications. Indeed, Dr. Madden acknowledges that salary history can correlate with other factors such as \"past performance, abilities, experience, and skills.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Of the six studies to which she cites for the proposition that salary differences are not explained by legitimate factors (discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   in endnote 12), only two directly address this conclusion. According to Dr. Madden, the first study, authored by Valerie Wilson and William M. Rodgers\n   III, finds that \"the racial wage gap increas[es] when comparing workers with equivalent education, experience, and location.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8 n.3.) However, that study does not find that other legitimate factors are never relevant to explain the wage gap. In fact, Wilson and Rodgers observations seem to contradict Dr. Madden's premise: \"Differences in observable factors such as education and experience levels\n   <em>\n    can\n   </em>\n   explain more than a quarter of the black-white wage gap for men and over a third of the gap for women.\" Wilson and Rodgers,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   endnote 12, at 3 (emphasis added). While the study authored by Francine D. Blau and Lawrence Kahn finds that education and experience \"explain relatively little of the [ ] wage gap,\" it does acknowledge that other factors such as work force interruptions and shorter hours had \"salience for understanding the gender wage gap.\" Blau and Kahn,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   endnote 12, at 49. The four other studies relied upon by Dr. Madden only further point out that the wage gap persists, a fact that is not in dispute, and do not address other legitimate factors that could also be contributing to pay disparity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Dr. Madden's third inference is that starting salaries are a primary source of subsequent salary differentials. Dr. Madden relies upon two studies, but neither directly supports her conclusion. The first study, by Barry Gerhart, is cited for the proposition that \"women's disadvantage in starting salaries is greater than in current salaries.\" (Resp., Ex. 5 at 10 n.8.) But the Gerhart study seems to in fact suggest that initial salaries are not primary sources of subsequent salary differentials. Gerhart,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   endnote 11, at 419 (noting that \"lower starting salaries for women seem plausible. This disadvantage, however, seems likely to decline over time.\"). The second study relied upon by Dr. Madden, authored by Christina Quintana-Garcia and Marta M. Elvira, concludes that \"women hired externally [at high-tech firms] have lower relative salaries to comparable men than women and men spending their careers within the firm.\" But this study finds that women in executive roles at certain technology companies who rose internally through the ranks earned higher salaries than women who were hired externally. Quintana-Garcia and Elvira,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   endnote 11, at 132 (\"The results suggest that women who are external labor market hires are disadvantaged, in both base and variable compensation, compared with internal placements.\") The fact that women who were hired externally received lower salaries, however, does not directly support the conclusion that starting salaries influenced subsequent salaries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   I have carefully reviewed Dr. Madden's affidavit, her impressive credentials, and all of the studies she has referenced. There simply is not \"substantial\" evidence to support the key inferences needed to substantiate her fourth and final inference-that inquiry into salary history results in lower salaries for woman and minorities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   I recognize and respect the deference owed to City Council, but under First Amendment law this deference is not unlimited and must be carefully viewed in conjunction with whether City Council \" '[drew] reasonable inferences based on\n   <em>\n    substantial\n   </em>\n   evidence.' \"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203947\" index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/767/216/#p234\">\n    767 F.3d at 238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Turner II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651420\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/180/\">\n    520 U.S. at 195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651420\" index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/180/\">\n    117 S.Ct. 1174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) (emphasis added). Here, the professionals who appeared before City Council were able to provide only conclusory testimony regarding discrimination associated with initial salaries for women and minorities being perpetuated in subsequent salaries. Although the anecdotes provided by Jeni Wright and Melissa Beatriz Skolnick shed light on the effect of the wage gap, they do not make up for the dearth of evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   The expert opinions cited to by the City do not fill this void. Dr. Budson goes so far as to acknowledge the lack of evidence supporting what she believes to be \"empirically true,\" (Resp., Ex. 6), and the studies to which Dr. Madden cites do not provide direct support for her critical conclusions. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Florida Bar\n   </em>\n   , there are no comprehensive studies demonstrating the alleged harm-that the perpetuation of discriminatory salaries in subsequent salaries contributes to a discriminatory wage gap. Nor are there years of testimony and \"volumes of documentary evidence and studies\" illuminating the harm that supported the legislature's decision as in\n   <em>\n    Turner II\n   </em>\n   . Instead, City Council based its conclusion regarding the harm of \"baked in\" discriminatory wages on testimony that is more like the \"educated guesses\" in\n   <em>\n    Rubin\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Comparison to the facts in\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   amplifies the City's evidentiary deficiencies. In\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   , the record before the legislative body drew a direct connection between the speech (SOCE counseling) and the harm. In contrast, the record before City Council does not establish a clear connection between the speech (asking about wage history) and the harm (perpetuation of discriminatory salaries in subsequent salaries contributing to a wage gap).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   I conclude that there is insufficient evidence to establish the alleged harm of discriminatory wages being perpetuated in subsequent wages such that they contribute to a discriminatory wage gap.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Without such evidence, it is impossible to know whether the Inquiry Provision will directly advance the substantial interests of reducing discriminatory wage disparities and promoting wage equity. Consequently, I am compelled to find that the Inquiry Provision does not directly advance the substantial governmental interests of reducing discriminatory wage disparities and promoting wage equity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Because I find that the City has not met its burden as to the third prong of\n   <em>\n    Central Hudson\n   </em>\n   , I need not determine under\n   <em>\n    Central Hudson\n   </em>\n   's fourth prong whether the Inquiry Provision is no more extensive than necessary to further the City's interest. The Inquiry Provision is at odds with the First Amendment, and as such, the City has failed to meet its burden of demonstrating its constitutionality.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     The Reliance Provision\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   The Reliance Provision makes it unlawful for employers, employment agencies, or employees or agents thereof \"[t]o rely on the wage history of a prospective employee from any current or former employer of the individual in determining the wages for such individual at any stage in the employment process, including the negotiation or drafting of any employment contract.\" Phila.

Rather, more like the anti-discrimination provision in\n   <em>\n    Wollschlaeger\n   </em>\n   , the Reliance Provision does not \"on its face, implicate the spoken or written word.\" The Chamber reads the record-keeping, inquiry, and anti-harassment provisions to have prohibited reliance, but those provisions prohibited significantly more specific actions that implicated speech on their face.

In\n   <em>\n    Holder\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court rejected the argument that a statute prohibiting the provision of \"material support\" to designated terrorist organizations targeted only conduct.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455275,3644526\" index=\"257\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/1/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455275,3644526\" index=\"257\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/1/\">\n    at 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455275,3644526\" index=\"258\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/1/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

According to the Chamber, the provision of the Ordinance permitting employers to rely on wage history that is \"knowingly and willingly disclosed\" is unclear because it provides no guidance as to when this \"knowingly and willingly\" safe-harbor is satisfied. The Chamber cites again to the Eleventh Circuit's ruling in\n   <em>\n    Wollschlaeger\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   The City responds that no definition of \"knowingly and willingly\" is necessary, but to the extent it is, the PCHR's Regulation No. 7.3 provides one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Regulation No. 7.3 provides the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-159\">\n   As used in Section 1131(2)(b), an action taken voluntarily, with an understanding of the nature and quality of the act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-160\">\n   Thus, a Prospective Employee \"knowingly and willingly\" discloses the employee's salary history in the context of an employment interview if the Prospective Employee voluntarily, and not in response to a question from the interviewer, makes the disclosure while knowing or having been informed that such disclosure may be used in determining any offered salary.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   I agree with the City that in light of the definition provided in Regulation No. 7.3, the Ordinance is sufficiently clear as to when salary history has been disclosed \"knowingly and willingly.\"\n   <em>\n    Wollschlaeger\n   </em>\n   is inapposite because there the statute banned \"unnecessarily\" harassing patients about firearm ownership. As the City aptly states, \"[n]ecessity, as opposed to willfulness, is a subjective and highly contextual determination.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     Does the Ordinance's Extraterritorial Effect Violate the United States Constitution or the Pennsylvania Constitution?\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Finally, the Chamber asserts that because the Ordinance applies to any employer that \"does business\" or \"employs one or more employees\" in Philadelphia, it \"appears to govern all of the employer's hiring practices-no matter where it makes its hiring decisions or where the prospective employee will work.\" The Chamber contends that this \"reach\" violates Due Process, the Commerce Clause, and the Pennsylvania Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   The City responds that City Council did not intend for the Ordinance to extend to jobs without a tie to Philadelphia. Regulation No. 7.1 has since been adopted by the PCHR, defining \"Employer\" as \"any person who does business in the City of Philadelphia through employees\" and \"who engages in the process of interviewing a Prospective Employee with the intention of considering such Prospective Employee for a position located within the City.\" The City maintains this language makes it clear that the Ordinance does not apply to hiring for positions located outside Philadelphia. Further, to the extent an interview occurs outside of Philadelphia, for example through Skype, the job must still be located in Philadelphia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   As to the Chamber's Due Process argument, state and municipalities \"may not impose economic sanctions on violators of its laws with the intent of changing ... lawful conduct in other States.\"\n   <em>\n    BMW of N.

The City's Request for a Hearing and Discovery\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   The City requests a hearing on the Chamber's Motion for a Preliminary Injunction, contending it is entitled to present evidence that the Ordinance is constitutional. The City also argues a hearing is required because it contests factual matters contained in the Amended Complaint and relied upon in the present Motion. Specifically, the City points to the Chamber's contentions that the Ordinance will have a \"crippling effect\" on local business and hiring, will \"significantly disadvantage\" Philadelphia businesses by depriving them of wage histories, and will impact the Chamber's members because they need wage history information to make appropriate determinations about a candidate's experience and/or the competitive market rate for a salary. The City also presses for a hearing in light of the fact that \"this is a matter of extreme public importance.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   At oral argument on the Chamber's Motion, I provided the City with a full opportunity to set out exactly what evidence it would offer at the proposed hearing. The City proffered the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-185\">\n   - Dr. Madden would testify to the substance of her affidavit and \"react\" to some of the discovery, addressed below, that the City had requested. The City explained that Dr. Madden would also respond to criticisms of her affidavit raised by the Chamber.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-186\">\n   - Rue Landau would testify that wage histories are no longer being inquired about in Philadelphia. She would also address prong four of\n   <em>\n    Central Hudson\n   </em>\n   and explain why the alternatives proposed by the Chamber would not work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-187\">\n   - The City would call witnesses from several of the companies that filed declarations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-188\">\n   - The City also indicated it would present a human resources expert, but conceded that this witness had not yet been identified.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   (N.T. 2/1/2018 at 8-12, 49-50.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   The Chamber opposes the City's request for a hearing, advocating that the issues before me are purely legal. The Chamber represented at oral argument that if a hearing were granted, it would not call any witnesses. Taking a somewhat inconsistent position regarding the admissibility of Dr. Madden's affidavit (see endnote 9), the Chamber indicated that it did not object to my consideration of Dr. Madden's affidavit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12, 28, 50.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   The City relies on\n   <em>\n    Reilly\n   </em>\n   in asserting that a hearing is required. I do not read\n   <em>\n    Reilly\n   </em>\n   to require a hearing. There, the district court improperly placed the burden of demonstrating likelihood of success on the merits on the plaintiff, thus the Third Circuit remanded for the application of the appropriate standard.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276310\" index=\"288\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/173/#p178\">\n    858 F.3d at 180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although the court observed that it was possible the government could have requested a full hearing to present their case, it did not require the district court to hold such a hearing. Rather, the district court was instructed to allow the government the opportunity to meet their burden of showing the ordinance at issue was constitutional.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276310\" index=\"289\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/173/#p178\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   Here, I have provided the City with ample opportunity to meet its burden. The full record that was before City Council when it enacted the Ordinance has been incorporated for purposes of the Motion before me and carefully examined. The affidavit of Dr. Madden, as well as the article quoting Dr. Budson, have been accepted into evidence and carefully considered. Repetition of the same information and conclusions will not close the gap in the evidence regarding the Inquiry Provision. Additionally, as discussed below, the discovery that the City indicates Dr. Madden would analyze is not relevant to the City's present burden. Similarly, Rue Landau's proposed testimony would amount to mere recitation of what I have already reviewed and found to be insufficient. Her testimony regarding the fourth prong of\n   <em>\n    Central Hudson\n   </em>\n   would be unnecessary given the shortcomings under the third prong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   The City did not elaborate on what it would ask of the Chamber members that submitted declarations, thus it is impossible to determine whether such testimony would aid the City in meeting its burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   Regarding the City's contention that a hearing is required because this case presents a matter of public importance, the City has not provided any authority that suggests a hearing is required for this reason, nor has it explained how repetition of facts already before me advances the public interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   As to the City's contention that factual issues exist, the issues it raises pertain to whether the Chamber's declarants will actually be impacted by the Ordinance, which does not bear on the constitutionality of the Ordinance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bradley v.

But when asked what this witness would offer, the City inexplicably stated that it had not yet consulted such expert. (N.T. 2/1/2018 at 50.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   For the reasons discussed above, I will deny the City's request for a hearing primarily because the proposed testimony would amount to repetition of the record already before me or presentation of irrelevant evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   The City also requests leave to engage in discovery prior to a hearing. At oral argument, the City explained that the following discovery was needed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-199\">\n   - Job applications and/or interview questions from the last ten years used by the companies that submitted declarations in both their Philadelphia offices and offices in other jurisdictions. According to the City, some of these companies have offices in other jurisdictions where bans on wage history inquiries have taken effect and, according to the City, such discovery could reveal how those offices are faring in light of the Chamber's contention that it will be harmed by the Ordinance here;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-200\">\n   - Policies, factors, or matrices used by member companies illustrating how they set salaries. The City contended that this information would allow it to show that \"employers are relying on salary history to depress the salaries of new job applicants,\" thus helping the City prove the third prong of\n   <em>\n    Central Hudson\n   </em>\n   . According to the City, this information is necessary for Dr. Madden to render a complete opinion;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-201\">\n   - Internal analyses of pay equity performed by member companies because some of those companies contend they have completed such. The City explained that this request pertains to the fourth prong of\n   <em>\n    Central Hudson\n   </em>\n   because a self-evaluation is one of the alternatives proposed by the Chamber;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-202\">\n   - Organizational charts of the member companies;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-203\">\n   - Depositions of representatives of six of the member companies that submitted declarations. The City acknowledged that while it has the burden of proving the Ordinance constitutional, the Chamber \"injected their own practices into the lawsuit by filing ... declarations and ... making sweeping statements in the brief. And so ... we want to test some of those affirmants in the declarations.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16, 18-22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   In response to the City's request for discovery, the Chamber submitted at oral argument that the City's requests are not relevant to the constitutionality of the Ordinance.

Courts in this circuit increasingly apply a \"good cause\" standard to requests for expedited discovery, the application of which \"depends on the actual circumstances of each case, as well as consideration of certain factors such as a pending preliminary injunction hearing, the need for the discovery and the breadth of the requests.\"\n   <em>\n    Better Packages, Inc. v.

First, job applications and/or interview questions used by member companies that have offices in other jurisdictions where wage history inquiries are banned would not help the City meet its burden. If the discovery were to show that those companies are able to operate without asking about wage history, such information does not fill the evidence gap under the third prong of\n   <em>\n    Central Hudson\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   If the City were to obtain job applications and interview questions used by the member companies, as well as its second request-policies, factors, and matrices used by member companies-these materials could establish what member companies have already acknowledged: that they use wage history to some degree in formulating job offers. The City seems to simultaneously harbor the belief that the declarants are and are not using wage history inquiries in their hiring practices. To the extent the City believes it will discover that the declarants are not asking about wage history, this of course would not aid the City in demonstrating the third prong of\n   <em>\n    Central Hudson\n   </em>\n   . Rather, it would tend to show that the harm of discriminatory initial salaries being perpetuated in subsequent salaries through wage history inquiries is not in fact a harm. The City attempts to characterize this argument as raising a factual issue, however, the affidavit declarants clearly state that they use wage history in fashioning salaries and will be harmed if the Ordinance takes effect. Indeed, the Chamber conceded at oral argument that its members use wage history data in hiring. (N.T. 2/1/2018 at 25-26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   The City's request for internal analyses of pay equity is relevant to the fourth prong of\n   <em>\n    Central Hudson\n   </em>\n   and thus would not provide the necessary evidence to satisfy the third prong. As to the City's request for organizational charts, it is unclear how these charts are at all relevant to the City's burden to establish the Ordinance is constitutional. Finally, regarding the City's request to depose representatives of the member companies, the declarations plainly state that the companies use wage history in some fashion and that they will be harmed if the Inquiry Provision takes effect. For the same reasons discussed above, information gleaned from depositions about whether the member companies will actually be impacted by the Ordinance will not provide the necessary evidence for the City to meet its burden in proving that the Ordinance is constitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   Because these requests \"extend beyond the needs of the preliminary injunction,\" I will deny the City's request for leave to engage in discovery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Better Packages\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"297\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%201373055\">\n    2006 WL 1373055\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3.

Observing that restrictions on speech differ from those on economic activity and nonexpressive conduct, the Court stated that \"[i]t is also true that the First Amendment does not prevent restrictions directed at commerce or conduct from imposing incidental burdens on speech. That is why a ban on race-based hiring may require employers to remove 'White Applicants Only' signs, why 'an ordinance against outdoor fires' might forbid 'burning a flag,' and why antitrust laws can prohibit 'agreements in restraint of trade.' \"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450498,5923853\" index=\"315\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/552/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (citations omitted). After noting these distinctions, the Court found that the Vermont law imposed \"more than an incidental burden on protected expression,\" pointing out that it was aimed at certain speech based on its content and as spoken by particular speakers, rendering the provisions content- and speaker-based.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450498,5923853\" index=\"316\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/552/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-252\">\n    Even if this portion of the\n    <em>\n     Sorrell\n    </em>\n    opinion were about whether the Vermont law prohibited only conduct, it does not provide support for the Chamber's proposition that relying on wage history to fashion a salary amounts to expressive conduct. The provisions in\n    <em>\n     Sorrell\n    </em>\n    targeted the sale, dissemination, and use of information\n    <em>\n     through marketing\n    </em>\n    , which, as emphasized above, are wholly different from relying on wage history to create a salary. The Chamber's position that the Reliance Provision precludes employers from \"using wage history to express a particular message about the value of an applicant's labor in formulating and communication an appropriate salary proposal\" is unsupported by\n    <em>\n     Sorrell\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"19\">\n   <p id=\"p-253\">\n    The Chamber also argues that even if the provision targets conduct, it is content and speaker based and addresses conduct that is \"wholly derivative of expressive activity\" and thus implicates the First Amendment. First, the Chamber provides no authority that a provision that is content and speaker based but targets merely conduct requires First Amendment scrutiny. Second, that wage history\n    <em>\n     could\n    </em>\n    be obtained through communication with others does not render reliance on wage history to be \"wholly derivative\" of expressive conduct.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"20\">\n   <p id=\"p-254\">\n    In passing, the City also states that the Inquiry Provision only \"incidentally burdens speech\" because the \"effectiveness of the reliance provision depends upon preventing employers from asking for the information.\" The City does not expand upon this statement and I am thus left guessing how it should impact my analysis.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"21\">\n   <p id=\"p-255\">\n    The Chamber also cites to\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.
