(\"Defendant\"), a Florida corporation, has a few stores throughout Florida that \"sells parts, tools, equipment, and other products related to car care.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6. Plaintiff worked for Defendant for about 27 years until he was terminated on January 24, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 9-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff initially worked for Defendant in a counter sales position that consisted of \"taking orders over the phone, helping walk in clients,\" and managing clients' accounts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 10-11. Plaintiff worked in a counter sales position for 22 years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10. For the first twelve years, Plaintiff worked at Defendant's store in Oakland Park.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff thereafter worked at Defendant's store in Plantation, under manager Mario Acosta (\"Acosta\"), for ten years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At all times Plaintiff's work was satisfactory, and in 2012, Plaintiff was the\n   second highest sales writer of Defendant's store in Plantation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 10, 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Before 2012, Plaintiff suffered from rheumatoid arthritis for several years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13. In 2012, Plaintiff's arthritis worsened significantly, such that Plaintiff could not stand or sit for long periods of times or lift heavy weights.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As a result of this development, in May 2012, Plaintiff asked Acosta to provide a stool to avoid standing for a significant amount of time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14. Acosta asked for a doctor's letter confirming Plaintiff's medical condition.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff provided Acosta with a doctor's letter stating Plaintiff was unable to lift weights exceeding sixty pounds, and could not stand for extended periods of time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15. Acosta then provided Plaintiff a stool to accommodate his disability.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16. However, at the same time, Defendant instructed Plaintiff that \"since the store had already accommodated him by providing him with the stool,\" Plaintiff could no longer take the two fifteen minute breaks given each day to all other employees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant then transferred Plaintiff four times to three different stores over a twenty-one-month period.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17. Each time that Defendant transferred Plaintiff, Defendant's agents and employees encouraged Plaintiff to resign.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2014, Acosta and Anita Smith (\"Smith\"), who oversaw Defendant's Human Resources Department, notified Plaintiff about mistakes he made using the new MAM system that Defendant was implementing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19. Plaintiff did not receive proper training on how to use the MAM system.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Nevertheless, Acosta and Smith told Plaintiff that because of his mistakes using the system, Plaintiff had to be demoted to cashier, which was a lesser paid position.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19. However, right before starting the new position, Defendant informed Plaintiff that he had to be a warehouse driver if he wished to continue working with Defendant, as there were no cashier positions open.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20. Defendant's agents and employees again encouraged Plaintiff to resign.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23. The warehouse driver position entailed driving from warehouses to stores and loading and unloading the truck.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21. Plaintiff, because of his rheumatoid arthritis, could not sit for long periods of time or lift weights exceeding sixty pounds.\n   <em>\n    See Id.\n   </em>\n   Yet Plaintiff felt he had no choice, and took the warehouse driver job because he did not want lose his job at the place he had worked for about twenty-four years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22. Plaintiff struggled in the driver position, especially quickly loading and unloading the truck, because of his rheumatoid arthritis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24. As a result, Defendant complained about Plaintiff's job performance, stating that Plaintiff was not keeping on time with the delivery schedule.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After Plaintiff got into a truck accident on January 16, 2017, Defendant fired Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Defendant created a hostile work environment by altering the terms and conditions of his employment due to his disability.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26. Additionally, Plaintiff maintains that Defendant's stated reason for terminating Plaintiff was a pretext for unlawful discrimination.\n   <em>\n    See Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff alleges he suffered \"severe emotional distress, loss of wages, loss of bonuses, loss of health insurance, and loss of other employee benefits.\"\n   <em>\n    See Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On April 28, 2017, Plaintiff filed a charged with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") against Defendant for harassment and discrimination on the job and claiming Plaintiff's termination was due to discrimination.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28. On September 28, 2017, EEOC gave Plaintiff Notice of Right to Sue Defendant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29. On April 6,\n   2018, Plaintiff filed the Amended Complaint, alleging one Count of unlawful disability discrimination in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [23].

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant raises two arguments in support of dismissal. First, Defendant argues that Plaintiff's claim should be dismissed because the EEOC issued a notice of a right to sue before the 180-day administrative period expired.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [34], at 4-6. Second, Defendant maintains that Plaintiff does not state a cause of action.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-8. The Court addresses each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A. EEOC issued a notice of right to sue before 180-day administrative period.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant first argues that Plaintiff's claims should be dismissed because the EEOC did not follow its own regulations when it issued a notice of right to sue within 180 days. More specifically, Defendant contends that Plaintiff has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies by virtue of the EEOC's premature issuance of a notice of right to sue letter that failed to indicate that the EEOC was unable to complete its administrative processing of the charge within 180 days, as required by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201601.28\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1601.28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [34], at 5-6.

Mich. Aug. 5, 2002), an age discrimination case arising under Michigan's Civil Rights Act. In\n   <em>\n    Baur\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff first got into a minor accident and was placed on probation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1. The day after the plaintiff was off probation, the plaintiff got into a major accident.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. The court ultimately concluded that the plaintiff could not meet his burden on summary judgment to show that he was fired for any reason other than his collision with \"his truck into another vehicle on the day after he completed another safety-related probation period.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Here, the facts as alleged are inapposite. The Defendant demoted Plaintiff from a cashier position that he successfully held for twenty-four years, and assigned Plaintiff to be a warehouse driver even though Defendant knew that Plaintiff had rheumatoid arthritis and would struggle as a driver given that he could not sit for long periods of time or lift weights heavier than sixty pounds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [23], at 2-4. While Plaintiff indeed struggled, especially in \"quickly\" loading and unloading the truck due to his arthritis, Plaintiff nonetheless remained in the position, seemingly without incident, for three to four years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. Defendant then fired Plaintiff after crashing the company's vehicle once.\n   <em>\n    See Id.\n   </em>\n   Besides this one accident, Defendant could not point to any other facts that show Plaintiff was not a qualified individual driver. Thus, taking the allegations as true and viewing them in a light most favorable Plaintiff, the Court finds that Plaintiff is a qualified individual under the ADA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Discrimination based on a disability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Plaintiff has alleged that he was subject to a series of discriminatory and adverse employment actions, including termination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [23], at \u00b6\u00b6 14-17, 19-21, 23-25.
