COMP. STAT. \u00a7 105/1. (R. 39, Am. Compl.)

(R. 44, Def.'s Answer &amp; Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 16-23.) Defendant moves to dismiss Plaintiff's amended complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) or, alternatively, to strike Plaintiff's prayer for declaratory relief. (R. 41, Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss at 1.) Defendant separately moves to strike Plaintiff's affirmative defenses to Defendant's SCA counterclaim. (R. 48, Def.'s Mot. to Strike.) For the reasons stated below, the Court denies Defendant's motion to dismiss or to strike Plaintiff's request for declaratory relief, and grants Defendant's motion to strike Plaintiff's affirmative defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On or about September 19, 2016, Plaintiff was hired as a \"case aide\" by Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   (R. 39, Am. Compl. \u00b6 6.) Plaintiff contends that while working as a case aide, she was classified as exempt from overtime requirements, allegedly based upon the \"learned professional\" exemption. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.) Plaintiff claims that the duties she performed as a case aide did not satisfy the learned professional exemption. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) Plaintiff asserts that she was not paid overtime while employed by Defendant as a case aide despite working a \"substantial\" number of overtime hours. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On or about November 1, 2016, Plaintiff was promoted and began training for a new position as a \"case manager.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.) Plaintiff started working in this position on or about December 1, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13-15.) She claims that during this period, she again worked a \"substantial\" number of overtime hours without any additional pay. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.) Plaintiff claims that Defendant classified the case manager position as exempt from overtime requirements under the learned professional exemption, even though the duties of a case manager did not satisfy the test for the exemption. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17-18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Based on these allegations, Plaintiff brought this action on November 9, 2017, on behalf of herself and other similarly situated case aides and case managers. (R. 1, Compl.) On February 14, 2018, she filed an amended complaint asserting claims under the FLSA and IMWL. (R. 39, Am. Compl.) On February 26, 2018, Defendant answered Plaintiff's amended complaint and filed its counterclaim (R 44, Def.'s Answer &amp; Countercl.) On February 28, 2018, Plaintiff answered Defendant's counterclaim and asserted various affirmative defenses. (R. 45, Pl.'s Answer &amp; Affirm. Defenses.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant now moves to dismiss Plaintiff's amended complaint or, alternatively, to strike her prayer for declaratory relief. (R. 42, Def.'s Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss.) Defendant argues that Plaintiff fails to state a claim under either the FLSA or the IMWL because her amended complaint contains only conclusory allegations regarding the number of hours she worked and other matters. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.) Defendant further contends that even if Plaintiff states a claim, she cannot seek declaratory relief because there is no suggestion that she is in \"immediate danger of sustaining some direct injury.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In response, Plaintiff argues that she adequately asserted claims under both the FLSA and the IMWL, and that her request for declaratory relief is proper. (R. 52, Pl.'s Resp. to Mot. to Dismiss at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant separately moves to strike Plaintiff's affirmative defenses. (R. 48, Def.'s Mot. to Strike.) Defendant argues that Plaintiff's affirmative defenses are either legally invalid or not adequately pleaded. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2.) In response, Plaintiff contends that her affirmative defenses are legally viable and properly pleaded. (R. 57, Pl.'s Resp. to Mot. to Strike at 6.)

Plaintiff alleges that she was employed by Defendant as a case aide between September 2016 and November 2016, and during this period worked a substantial number of overtime hours without any overtime pay. (R. 39, Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-11.) She further alleges that between December 2016 and March 2017, she worked for Defendant as a case manager, and again worked a substantial number of overtime hours without any additional pay. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12-20.) She claims that during the entirety of her employment, Defendant applied a blanket overtime exclusion for case aides and case managers, based on Defendant's view that these positions qualified as \"learned professionals.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.) Plaintiff asserts that these positions do not meet the test for the learned professional exemption. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.)

As to the overtime claims, the court in\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   noted that the plaintiffs failed to identify \"a single instance of any named plaintiff working more than forty hours in a week without due compensation[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204179153\">\n    2016 WL 4179153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3.

(R 39, Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 8, 18.) Unlike the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   , she attaches nothing to the amended complaint that would undermine these allegations. The Court concludes that Plaintiff adequately states a claim for relief under the FLSA and IMWL. This aspect of the motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Plaintiff's Request for Declaratory Relief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendant alternatively argues that Plaintiff's request for declaratory relief should be stricken because it \"fails as a\n   matter of law.\" (R. 42, Def.'s Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss at 5.) In essence, Defendant takes issue with one line at the end of the amended complaint where Plaintiff seeks a \"[d]eclaration that Defendant's violation of the FLSA was willful, entitling the collective class to a three-year statute of limitations and liquidated damages.\" (R. 39, Am. Compl. at 12.) Defendant argues that \"[a]t best,\" this request is \"confusing and improper,\" because \"the statute of limitations applicable to the claims is not a matter for declaratory relief.\" (R. 56, Def.'s Reply in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss at 4-5.) The Court finds Defendant's argument unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Under the FLSA, if an overtime violation is determined to be willful, a three-year rather than a two-year statute of limitations applies, effectively extending the period for which a plaintiff can obtain damages.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20255\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Plaintiff has alleged that Defendant's FLSA violations were willful. (R. 39, Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 51, 61.) Plaintiff will ultimately bear the burden of proving that Defendant's conduct was willful, but that is a matter for the trier of fact to decide at a later stage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bankston v.

(R. 48, Def.'s Mot. to Strike.) The crux of Defendant's counterclaim is that Plaintiff violated the SCA by forwarding several of her work emails to her own personal account and to an attorney representing her in this case. (R. 44, Def.'s Answer &amp; Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 16-23.) In addition to denying the bulk of Defendant's allegations, Plaintiff asserts five separate affirmative defenses. (R. 45, Pl.'s Answer &amp; Affirm. Defenses at 3-4.) Defendant argues that all of the affirmative defenses should be stricken. (R. 48, Def.'s Mot. to Strike at 1-2.) The Court agrees with Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \"An affirmative defense is one that admits the allegations in the complaint, but avoids liability, in whole or in part, by new allegations of excuse, justification or other negating matters.\"\n   <em>\n    Riemer v.

Ill. 2011). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(c) specifically enumerates certain matters that must be pleaded as affirmative defenses, such as \"assumption of risk,\" \"duress,\" \"statute of limitations,\" \"waiver,\" and \"res judicata.\" FED. R. CIV. P. 8(c)(1). Additionally, the SCA itself contains specified defenses to liability: \"(1) a court warrant or order, a grand jury subpoena, a legislative authorization ..., (2) a request of an investigative or law enforcement under 2518(7) of the title; or (3) a good faith determination that section 2511(3) of this title permitted the conduct complained of[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   18 U.S.C \u00a7 2707(e). Plaintiff's affirmative defenses do not fall into any of these categories.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiff's first affirmative defense is stated as follows: \"Defendant's Counterclaims are asserted solely in retaliation for Plaintiff exercising her rights under federal and state law.\" (R. 45, Pl.'s Answer &amp; Affirm. Defenses \u00b6 1.) This is not an affirmative defense listed under Rule 8(c), nor is it a defense listed in the SCA. Plaintiff has cited no case law suggesting that retaliation presents a valid affirmative defense to an SCA claim. Instead, she argues generally that she pleaded this defense \"out of an abundance of caution\" so as not to \"face an argument that she waived such a claim\" at some later stage. (R. 57, Pl.'s Resp. to Mot. to Strike at 3.) Plaintiff's affirmative defense of \"retaliation\" is not a recognized defense to an SCA claim, and it is therefore stricken.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206624224\">\n    2016 WL 6624224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (granting plaintiff's motion to strike affirmative defenses where \"defendants have not provided any authority to show these are recognized affirmative defenses to plaintiff's claims\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiff's second affirmative defense is stated as follows: \"Defendant's Counterclaim fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\" (R. 45, Pl.'s Answer &amp; Affirm.

Likewise, her fourth affirmative defense states: \"Plaintiff denies that she acted without authorization to allegedly access any electronic communication or electronic communication facility through which an electronic communication service is provided.\" (R. 45, Pl.'s Answer &amp; Affirm. Defenses \u00b6 4.) These are simply denials of Defendant's allegations, whereas a true affirmative defense \"requires a responding party to\n   <em>\n    admit\n   </em>\n   a complaint's allegations but then permits the responding party to assert that for some legal reason it is nonetheless excused from liability[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Reis Robotics USA, Inc. v.
