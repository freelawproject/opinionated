KELLY, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs Michael Ellis, Robert McNeil, and Harold Stanley have embarked on a seemingly unending quest to stop the federal government from collecting unpaid income taxes. Courts in this Circuit have repeatedly dismissed Plaintiffs' cases for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. These rulings have not dissuaded Plaintiffs from tilting at windmills, however, and judges themselves have become targets for Plaintiffs' ill-advised jousting. Plaintiffs fare no better in these consolidated cases, the latest chapter in their saga.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Magistrate Judge G. Michael Harvey has issued a Report and Recommendation recommending, among other things, that the Court grant Defendants' First Amended Motion to Dismiss these cases for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Upon review of the Report and Recommendation and Plaintiffs' objections to it, the Court adopts the Report and Recommendation in its entirety and dismisses the cases on these grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   These consolidated cases-\n   <em>\n    Ellis v. Jackson\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-cv-2313 (\"\n   <em>\n    Ellis\n   </em>\n   \"), and\n   <em>\n    Stanley v. Lynch\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-cv-22 (\"\n   <em>\n    Stanley\n   </em>\n   \")-are the latest volley in Plaintiffs' war to enjoin the federal government's enforcement of the income tax against individuals who do not file their returns. At their core, the complaints allege that various U.S. government employees-including everyone from a former President to three federal judges-have concocted a \"scheme\" to \"enforce the income tax\" on those who do not pay it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   No. 16-cv-2313, ECF No. 3 (\"\n   <em>\n    Ellis\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl.\") \u00b6 12; No. 17-cv-22; ECF No. 3 (\"\n   <em>\n    Stanley\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 1, 3. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that certain Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") employees operate a \"records falsification\" program that they use to collect taxes from individuals who do not file a tax return, so-called \"non-filers.\"\n   <em>\n    See Ellis\n   </em>\n   Am.

To do so, IRS employees purportedly enter \"a certain sequence of numeric entries\" into\n   an IRS database which creates the \"appearance\" of two abbreviations in IRS's \"Individual Master File.\"\n   <em>\n    See Ellis\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 22-23;\n   <em>\n    see also Stanley\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 39, 42. These abbreviations purportedly denote falsified dates showing when the IRS \"received\" a tax return from the non-filer and when a \"substitute for return\" (\"SFR\") was executed, even though no tax return was filed and no SFR created.\n   <em>\n    Ellis\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 22;\n   <em>\n    see also Stanley\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 42. As Plaintiffs tell it, the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") relies on the information in this \"Individual Master File\" to pursue collection and enforcement proceedings against non-filers.\n   <em>\n    See Ellis\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 11, 24, 28, 32-35;\n   <em>\n    Stanley\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 43-47. This scheme is allegedly blessed by high-level government officials, including a former President and Attorney General.\n   <em>\n    Stanley\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 1. And in\n   <em>\n    Ellis\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs also name three federal judges as defendants.\n   <em>\n    Ellis\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. They allege that these judges, each of whom has agreed that federal courts lack subject-matter jurisdiction over similar lawsuits, have participated in the scheme against Plaintiffs by conspiring among themselves and with DOJ attorneys to dismiss those previous cases, including by misstating Plaintiffs' factual allegations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36-84.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs assert claims under the Administrative Procedure Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20551\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and the First, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution.\n   <em>\n    Ellis\n   </em>\n   Am.

They claim that Magistrate Judge Harvey \"refused to evaluate\" whether the AIA covers \"non-action\" (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the IRS's purported failure to prepare SFRs on the dates shown) and that he failed to determine whether the equitable exception to the AIA applies. Pls.' Objs. at 8-10. The Court overrules both of these objections. Plaintiffs' first objection is simply incorrect. Magistrate Judge Harvey did evaluate their argument, concluding that it is a \"distinction without a difference\" because, even if it is true that IRS employees merely make SFRs\n   <em>\n    appear\n   </em>\n   to exist, \"Plaintiffs still seek to enjoin the process by which that appearance is created and through which tax deficiencies are then assessed and collected.\" R &amp; R at 7.
