The Commission noted that the 2003 Order\"found that, based on the statutory definition of [ATDS], the TCPA's legislative history, and current industry practice and technology, a predictive dialer falls within the meaning and definition of autodialer and the intent of Congress.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20FCC%20Rcd%20559\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 566 \u00b6 13. Although a party to the 2008 proceeding urged the FCC to find that a \"predictive dialer meets the definition of autodialer\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   when it randomly or sequentially generates telephone numbers, not when it dials numbers from customer telephone lists,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20FCC%20Rcd%20559\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 566 \u00b6 12 (emphasis added), the Commission disagreed, stating that nothing presented\n   by the party \"warrant[ed] reconsideration of [the 2003] findings.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20FCC%20Rcd%20559\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 567 \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The FCC in 2015 again reaffirmed the 2003 Order's ruling \"that predictive dialers, as previously described by the Commission, satisfy the TCPA's definition of 'autodialer.' \"\n   <em>\n    In re Rules &amp; Regulations Implementing the Tel.

Pinkus's Allegations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Pinkus claims that Sirius violated the TCPA by, among other things, by causing over one hundred calls to be placed to his cell phone using an ATDS. Doc. 105 at \u00b6\u00b6 9-23. He alleges that the calls were placed \"using 'predictive dialing' technology, which automatically places calls without human intervention until the called party answers the call, at which time such automatic dialer attempts to connect the called party.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19 (alleging further that no customer service representative was on the line when he answered the calls, and that he would experience a delay after answering until a representative began speaking). As Pinkus acknowledged at the hearing on this motion, Doc. 125, this claim rests on the premise that, as the FCC ruled in the 2003 Order and reaffirmed in the 2008 and 2015 Declaratory Rulings, a predictive dialer qualifies as an ATDS under the TCPA even if it lacks the capacity to generate randomly or sequentially telephone numbers to be dialed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As discussed in detail below,\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   invalidated the 2015 Declaratory Ruling's interpretation of the statutory term ATDS. Sirius contends that, in so doing,\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   necessarily invalidated the FCC's materially identical interpretation of the term ATDS in the 2003 Order and the 2008 Declaratory Ruling, and therefore that this court must interpret the term as an original matter without regard to the Commission's findings in all three rulemakings that predictive dialers categorically qualify as ATDSs. Doc. 109 at 12-13. That exercise, Sirius submits, results in the conclusion that only a predictive dialer with the capacity to \"generate and [then] dial random or sequential telephone numbers,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15-and not the kind of predictive dialers that the complaint alleges were used to call Pinkus, which have only the more limited capacity to dial numbers from customer telephone lists-qualifies as an ATDS. Pinkus, by contrast, contends that\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   left undisturbed the 2003 Order and 2008 Declaratory Ruling, and\n   therefore that it remains the law that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   predictive dialers qualify as ATDSs.

Circuit overturned the FCC's decision in the 2015 Declaratory Ruling to \"reaffirm[ ] ... the notion that a device can be considered an autodialer even if it has no capacity itself to generate random or sequential numbers (and instead can only dial from an externally supplied set of numbers).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 702 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   2015 Declaratory Ruling,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n    30 FCC Rcd. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   7971-72 \u00b6 10 (\"We reaffirm our previous statements that dialing equipment generally has the capacity to store or produce, and dial random or sequential numbers (and thus meets the TCPA's definition of 'autodialer') even if it is not presently used for that purpose,\n   <em>\n    including when the caller is calling a set list of consumers\n   </em>\n   .\") (emphasis added).

In the 2003 Order,\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   explained, \"the Commission had made clear that, while some predictive dialers cannot be programmed to generate random or sequential phone numbers, they still satisfy the statutory definition of an ATDS.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, \"[b]y reaffirming that conclusion in its 2015 ruling, the Commission supported the notion that a device can be considered an autodialer even if it has no capacity itself to generate random or sequential numbers (and instead can only dial from an externally supplied set of numbers).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Given the 2015 Declaratory Ruling's dissonant understandings of ATDS-one providing that \"a device qualif[ies] as an ATDS only if it can generate random or sequential numbers to be dialed,\" and the other that \"it [can] so qualify even if it lacks that capacity\"-\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   held that the Commission's \"lack of clarity about which functions qualify a device as an autodialer\" rendered unreasonable its ruling that predictive dialers categorically qualify as ATDSs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 702-03. Although \"[i]t might be permissible for the Commission to adopt either interpretation\" of the term ATDS, the D.C.

As a formal matter,\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   addressed only the 2015 Declaratory Ruling, as the deadline for challenging the 2003 Order and 2008 Declaratory Ruling had long passed by the time the petition for review in\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   was filed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 702-03 (referencing only the \"2015 ruling\" in holding that the FCC had given \"no clear answer\" to the question whether \"a device [can] qualify as an ATDS only if it can generate random or sequential numbers to be dialed\").

Understanding why requires some explanation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Like \"produce,\" \"store\" is a transitive verb, and so requires an object.\n   <em>\n    See Merriam-Webster\n   </em>\n   (2018), https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/store;\n   <em>\n    Oxford English Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (2018), http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/190929?rskey=pdyROA&amp;result=2#eid. And the object of the verbs \"store\" and \"produce\" is \"telephone numbers to be called.\" As a result, despite the disjunctive \"or\" linking \"store\" and \"produce,\" \"store\" is not a grammatical orphan, rather, like \"produce,\" it is tied\n   to the object, \"telephone numbers to be called.\" The TCPA thus defines as an ATDS a device that has the capacity \"[1] to store or produce [2] telephone numbers to be called\" and then \"to dial such numbers.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   But what kinds of numbers?

Had Congress meant \"using a random or sequential number generator\" to modify the verbs \"store\" and \"produce,\" Congress would have placed the phrase immediately after those verbs and before \"telephone numbers to be called\"-with subsection (a)(1)(A) reading, \"to store or produce,\n   <em>\n    using a random or sequential number generator\n   </em>\n   , telephone numbers to be called.\" Indeed, it would be odd to read the phrase \"using a random or sequential number generator\" as modifying \"store\" and \"produce.\" The comma separating \"using a random or sequential number generator\" from the rest of subsection (a)(1)(A) makes it grammatically unlikely that the phrase modifies only \"produce\" and not \"store,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yang v.

True, the statute does not use the verb \"generate.\" But the phrase \"using a random or sequential number generator\" indicates that a number generator must be used to do\n   <em>\n    something\n   </em>\n   relevant to the \"telephone numbers to be called\"-most naturally, either to generate the numbers themselves, or to generate the order in which they will be called.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The latter possibility is highly unlikely for at least two reasons. For one, as\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   recognized, numbers must necessarily \"be called in\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   order-either in a random or some other sequence.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/\">\n    885 F.3d at 702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a result, were the phrase \"using a random or sequential number generator\" understood to refer to how numbers are called rather than to how they are generated, it would be superfluous, as it would simply encompass the universe of possible orders in which numbers could be dialed. For another, if \"using a random or sequential number generator\" referred to the order in which numbers are dialed and not the process of generating them, the phrase would have followed, rather than preceded, \"dial such numbers\" in section (a)(1)(B). That is, the statute would have read: \"to store or produce telephone numbers to be called; and to dial such numbers,\n   <em>\n    using a random or sequential number generator\n   </em>\n   \"-which it does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   So, the phrase \"using a random or sequential number generator\" necessarily conveys that an ATDS must have the capacity to generate telephone phone numbers, either randomly or sequentially, and then to dial those numbers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dominguez v.

The reason, he contends, is that a marketer using an ATDS could never know in advance whether any given number generated by the equipment and then dialed was linked to a cellphone user who had not given consent to receive calls.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517448\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/894/116/#p121\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Pinkus similarly contends that the TCPA provision allowing for treble damages in the event of a \"willful violation,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3), would be rendered inoperative if subsection (a)(1) excluded predictive dialers because prospective defendants relying on the whims of the ATDS's number-generating capacity could never know that they were undertaking prohibited conduct until they had actually done so. Doc. 114 at 25-26. But Pinkus's hypothetical is unnecessarily wooden, as it is possible to imagine a device that both has the capacity to generate numbers randomly or sequentially and can be programmed to avoid dialing certain numbers, including numbers that belong to customers who have not consented to receive calls from a particular marketer. Whether a marketer has violated the TCPA thus need not be a matter of coincidence; rather, violations would result from a marketer's failure (deliberate or otherwise) to program the device correctly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Pinkus next contends that the TCPA's exemption for calls made to collect government debt,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A)(iii), would be nonsensical if subsection (a)(1) excluded predictive dialers, because debt collectors target particular numbers they believe are likely to belong to debtors who owe the federal government, rather than generate and call phone numbers at random. Doc. 114 at 25. That may well be true. But it does not change the fact that the best reading of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) requires that an ATDS have the capacity to generate numbers randomly or sequentially and then to dial them, even if that capacity is not deployed for practical reasons. And that defining characteristic of an ATDS defeats Pinkus's claim, for he concedes that his complaint does not plausibly allege that he was called with a device that has the capacity to store or produce numbers that have been randomly or sequentially generated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dominguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517448\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/894/116/#p121\">\n    894 F.3d at 121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (granting summary judgment where\n   the plaintiff could not \"point to any evidence that ... [the device at issue] had the present capacity to function as an autodialer by generating random or sequential telephone numbers and then dialing those numbers\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Sirius's partial motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted. Pinkus's claim that Sirius caused him to be called with an ATDS is dismissed. Pinkus may proceed with his claim- which the motion does not address, Doc. 109 at 7 n.1-that Sirius violated the TCPA by causing him to be called using a prerecorded voice. Doc. 105 at \u00b6\u00b6 3, 10, 13, 23.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
