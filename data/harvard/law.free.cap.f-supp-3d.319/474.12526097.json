Similarly, he sent a form to BOP on February 9, 2011 requesting amendments to \"inaccurate/incorrect\" records. ECF 46-4 at 40. The plaintiff did not file the present lawsuit until September 28, 2016, ECF No. 1 at 14, well beyond the two-year statute of limitations period. The plaintiff appears to be arguing that he thought his records were amended by the Eleventh Circuit's reversing the district court's denial of his 2255 motion in 2011. However, the record reflects that on July 21, 2011, EOUSA sent the plaintiff a letter informing him that his request to amend his records was denied. ECF No. 46 at 4. Moreover, the plaintiff filed an administrative remedy request on July 16, 2013, to BOP, again asserting that his pre-sentence report was incorrect.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1699873,4330355,4331051,1699797\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/821/789/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    The plaintiff cannot credibly argue that he thought his records were amended in 2011.

The Privacy Act \"safeguards the public from unwarranted collection, maintenance, use and dissemination of personal information contained in agency records ... by allowing an individual to participate in ensuring that his records are accurate and properly used, and by imposing responsibilities on federal agencies to maintain their records accurately.\"\n    <em>\n     Bartel v.

He requested amendment of his pre-sentence report\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n    and his underlying criminal case files.\n    <em>\n     See e.g.\n    </em>\n    , ECF No. 46-2 at 12; ECF No.46-4 at 32. Because BOP and EOUSA have exempted those categories of records from access and amendment, the plaintiff's Privacy Act claims must be dismissed.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Martinez v.

As already discussed, the plaintiff's request for access under the Privacy Act pertain to the criminal investigations in his case. The Court agrees, therefore, that the documents were compiled for law enforcement purposes and are exempt from disclosure under the Privacy Act.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    The plaintiff also argues that the records in question are subject to amendment and access pursuant to the public domain exemption. ECF No. 50 at 2; ECF No. 64 at 5. The plaintiff appears to assert that because the government identified certain confidential informants in court filings, the government is obligated to release and amend the records relating to the \"false testimony\" at his trial.
