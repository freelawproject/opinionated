Plaintiff alleges that, upon learning that NFPHC had fired Edwards while on FMLA leave, he met with NFPHC's CEO, David Small, on June 8, 2015, \"to discuss the termination of Edwards and that [it runs] afoul of the FMLA, the D.C. FMLA &amp; [District of Columbia Human Rights Act (\"DCHRA\") ] laws.\" Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 48. Plaintiff apparently was persuasive, because Small \"admitted that [Edwards's] termination may have been unlawful and instructed Lott to contract HR to reinstate her and to promote her '\n   <em>\n    upward and outward.\n   </em>\n   ' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3547129,3662782\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/709/19/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The next day, Plaintiff asked Executive Vice President of Human Resources Jackie Johnson to \"rescind\" Edwards's termination, but Johnson refused, stating: \"Sonia is nasty and has to stay gone.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49. A little more than a month later, NFPHC installed a new CEO, Andrew Davis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58. Plaintiff alleges that, on July 20, 2015, he discussed Edwards's \"illegal termination\" with Davis and advised him that Edwards needed to be re-hired, but that Johnson was \"thwarting his efforts to reinstate [her].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 59-60. Ten days later, Davis would fire Plaintiff under circumstances that make a retaliatory motive plausible. On July 30, 2015, Plaintiff was directed to meet with Davis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69. Johnson was present for the meeting, and Plaintiff objected to her attendance, \"because he (Lott) is investigating [Executive Vice President Pamela] Lee for the unlawful termination of Edwards and that EVP Jackie Johnson has a direct conflict of interest on this matter.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to Plaintiff, his request to excuse Johnson was ignored and instead Davis announced Plaintiff's termination, telling Plaintiff that he is \"not a good fit\" and that his work is \"unsatisfactory,\" even though only days earlier Davis had commended Plaintiff for his performance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Taking these allegations to be true, and viewing them in the light most favorable to him, Plaintiff \"communicate[d] to [his] employer a belief that the employer ha[d] engaged in ... a form of employment discrimination.\"\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679384\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/271/#p276\">\n    555 U.S. at 276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679384\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/271/#p276\">\n    129 S.Ct. 846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, Plaintiff has sufficiently pleaded oppositional conduct for purposes of his FMLA retaliation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant points to this court's prior ruling in arguing that Plaintiff's revised pleading of protected activity still falls short. In particular, Defendant references\n   the portion of the court's decision in which the court stated that Plaintiff's \"single expression of a qualified opinion of potential liability is a far cry from the type of full-throated opposition\n   <em>\n    DeMasters\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    v. Carilion Clinic\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5768563\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/796/409/\">\n    796 F.3d 409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Cir. 2015) ] contemplated.\" Mem. Op. at 16;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 7 (citing Mem. Op. at 15-16). Though Defendant's reliance on the court's earlier decision is understandable, the reference to the \"full-throated opposition\n   <em>\n    DeMasters\n   </em>\n   contemplated\" was not meant to suggest that\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   such conduct qualifies as protected activity. Rather, the court used\n   <em>\n    DeMasters\n   </em>\n   -a case that Plaintiff had cited-as illustrating how Plaintiff's initial pleading of oppositional action was insufficient.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. Op. at 15 (noting that \"Plaintiff's claim fails under his own conduct-focused theory,\" which relied on\n   <em>\n    DeMasters\n   </em>\n   ). As\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   makes clear, \"full-throated opposition\" is not required to qualify for protection under Title VII's-and, by extension, the FMLA's-anti-retaliation provision. Rather, a good faith and reasonable expression of belief that the employee's employer has engaged in discrimination will do. Plaintiff's pleading overcomes that low bar.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Having found that Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged protected activity, the court must resolve the question left unaddressed in its prior decision: Whether the \"manager rule\" nevertheless precludes Plaintiff from asserting a retaliation claim because his alleged oppositional conduct was part of his regular job duties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 7 n.4. As the court described it before, \"some courts have held,\" under what is known as the \"manager rule,\" \"that an employee is not protected from retaliation for reporting concerns about an employer's potential violations of the law, if the employee is acting pursuant to her job duties.\" Mem. Op. at 14. Although this \"rule\" arose in the context of the Fair Labor Standards Act's anti-retaliation protections,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Littlejohn v. City of New York\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4287583\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/795/297/\">\n    795 F.3d 297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 317 n.16 (2d Cir. 2015), Defendant urges the court to apply it in the FMLA context.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 7 n. 4. The court declines to do so. The court is persuaded by the comprehensive rationale set forth by the Fourth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    DeMasters\n   </em>\n   for rejecting the manager rule's application in the Title VII context,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DeMasters\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5768563\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/796/409/\">\n    796 F.3d at 421-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and finds that the rationale applies with equal force to FMLA retaliation claims,\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gordon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052675,4355917\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/778/158/\">\n    778 F.3d at 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, the manager rule does not foreclose Plaintiff's retaliation claim under the FMLA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant separately moves to dismiss Plaintiff's DCHRA cause of action for failure to state a claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 10-12. Defendant contends that, because Plaintiff has not adequately alleged \"that he opposed conduct made unlawful by the DCHRA,\" Plaintiff's DCHRA claim must proceed under the separate theory that Defendant retaliated against him for \"aid[ing] or encourag[ing],\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202-1402.61\">\n    D.C.

Def.'s Mem. at 10. As the court already has ruled, however, Plaintiff has successfully alleged oppositional conduct that is prohibited by the DCHRA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202-1402.61\">\n    D.C.

Whistleblower Protection Act (\"DCWPA\"), Defendant moves to dismiss for two reasons: (1) because Plaintiff is not an \"employee\" for purposes of the DCWPA, Def.'s Mem. at 13;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201-615.52\">\n    D.C. Code \u00a7\u00a7 1-615.52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1-615.53 ; and (2) because NFPHC cannot be sued under the DCWPA, only the \"District\" can, Def.'s Mem. at 14;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201-615.54\">\n    D.C. Code \u00a7 1-615.54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Neither argument is persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As to whether Plaintiff is an \"employee\" for purposes of the DCWPA, the statute provides that \"[a]n employee aggrieved by a violation of \u00a7 1-615.53 may bring a civil action.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201-615.54\">\n    D.C. Code \u00a7 1-615.54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). The DCWPA defines \"employee\" to mean:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [A]ny person who is a former or current District employee, or an applicant for employment by the District government, including but not limited to employees of subordinate agencies, independent agencies, the District of Columbia Board of Education, the Board of Trustees of the University of the District of Columbia, the District of Columbia Housing Authority, and the Metropolitan Police Department, but excluding employees of the Council of the District of Columbia.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201-615.54\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1-615.52(3). This broad definition of \"employee\" easily reaches those employed by NFPHC. First, the DCWPA's protections extend to those persons employed not only by sub-agencies of the District of Columbia government, but also by \"independent agencies,\" such as the Board of Trustees of the University of the District of Columbia,\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201-615.54\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 38-1202.01; \"independent authorit[ies],\" such as D.C. Housing Authority,\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201-615.54\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6-202; and elected bodies, such as the D.C.

The plain text of the statute provides no reason why, as an \"instrumentality\" of the District government,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201-615.54\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 44-951.02, NFPHC should be treated any differently from the government entities listed in the statute. Moreover, the definition's use of the phrase \"including but not limited to\" makes clear that the D.C. Council did not intend to restrict the definition of \"employee\" to only those government-related entities identified in the statute.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201-615.54\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1-301.45 (defining \"include\" and \"including\" to mean \"includes, but not limited to\" and \"including, but not limited to\"). Thus, the fact that NFPHC is not expressly identified in the statute does not remove its employees from the DCWPA's protections. Finally, the D.C. Council clearly knew how to use words of exclusion-after all, it removed its own employees from the statute's purview-yet it did not do the same for NFPHC, either in the DCWPA itself or in the NFPHC's organic statute.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n    <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201-615.54\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 44-951.01\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   In view of the DCWPA's broad construct, a person employed by NFPHC-\"an instrumentality of the District government ...

Def.'s Mem. at 13;\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201-615.54\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 44-951.08. That limited exemption, however,\n   cannot carry the weight Defendant accords it. If the D.C. Council had meant to remove whistleblower protections for NFPHC employees, presumably it would have done so explicitly. Indeed, it would be odd for the Council to have denied Defendant's employees such substantial rights by implication through exemption from a completely different statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Newell-Brinkley v.

The court, of course, must read statutes to avoid absurd results.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mova Pharma. Corp. v. Shalala\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1318625,3712301\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/140/1060/\">\n    140 F.3d 1060\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1068 (D.C. Cir. 1998). Adopting Defendant's view would mean that the DCWPA confers whistleblower protection upon NFPHC employees, yet denies them the right to sue their employer. Moreover, Defendant's reading would lead to the nonsensical result that some of the most important remedies available to an aggrieved employee for violations-such as reinstatement, restoration of lost benefits, and back pay-would be denied employees of NFPHC. This would hold true not only for NFPHC employees, but also for employees of independent agencies and other government-related entities listed in the statutory definition of \"employer,\" but who are not directly employed by the District of Columbia government.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 14 (arguing that \"the statute does not provide a right of action against other employers aside from the District of Columbia\"). Defendant's reading therefore simply cannot be correct. Accordingly, the court concludes that, for purposes of the DCWPA, the \"District\" includes NFPHC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff thus may proceed with his DCWPA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Finally, the court turns to Plaintiff's breach of contract claim, which is premised on the allegation that Defendant promised Plaintiff that he would be employed for a period of at least six months, but terminated him before that period expired.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 116-19. Defendant maintains that Plaintiff's claim must be dismissed because it rests \"on the scant allegation that someone allegedly told [Plaintiff] that he would be employed for six months.\" Def.'s Mem. at 15. Plaintiff need not, however, \"identify by name which employee(s) made the agreement when pleading a breach of contract claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Nattah v.

Cir. 2010). At this stage, \"it is enough for the plaintiff to describe the terms of the alleged contract and the nature of the defendant's breach.\"\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Francis v.

Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint does just that. It outlines the essential terms of Plaintiff's agreement to join NFPHC as its Chief Compliance Officer, including salary, benefits, and job responsibilities. Second Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 13-15. The complaint also states that someone-Plaintiff does not specify who-told him that \"his start date would be on April 6, 2015, and that he was employed for a minimum period of 6 months.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. Plaintiff claims that Defendant breached its employment agreement by terminating him before the end of the six-month period.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 116-17. These allegations are more than sufficient to state a claim for breach of an employment contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the court concludes that Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint sufficiently pleads retaliation claims under the FMLA, DCHRA, D.C. FMLA, and the DCWPA. It also makes out a sufficient claim for breach of contract. Defendant's Motion to Dismiss is therefore denied.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    Previously, on November 8, 2017, the court dismissed Plaintiff's Amended Complaint for failure to state any federal claims and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over his District of Columbia law claims, but afforded Plaintiff an opportunity to amend his pleading.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Mem.
