Mennonite General Hospital, Inc. (\"Plaintiff\") sued Molina Healthcare of Puerto Rico, Inc. (\"Molina\"), MMM Healthcare, LLC (\"MMM\"), and MSO of Puerto Rico, Inc. (\"MSO\") (collectively \"Defendants\") in Puerto Rico state court, requesting injunctive and monetary relief for the denial of payment of invoiced medical services. (Docket No. 1-4 at 7-8). MMM and MSO removed to federal court on the basis of federal question jurisdiction, or in the alternative, on the basis of the federal officer removal statute, and Molina consented. (Docket Nos. 1; 7). Plaintiff moved to remand, arguing that their case only involved claims under state law. (Docket No. 13). MMM and MSO opposed the motion and Molina moved to join the opposition. (Docket Nos. 32; 33). For the reasons below, Plaintiff's motion to remand is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This action stems from alleged violations of Puerto Rico Law 5-2014 (\"Law 5\"), an amendment to the Puerto Rico Health Insurance Code. (Docket No. 1-4). Plaintiff provides healthcare and hospitalization services to institutions serving Medicaid patients throughout Puerto Rico and bills various insurance companies for those services. (Docket No. 1-4 \u00b6 5). One of the companies is Defendant MMM, a Puerto Rico managed care organization (\"MCO\") with the federal centers for Medicare and Medicaid services (\"CMS\"). (Docket Nos. 1 at 2 \u00b6 2; 1-4 \u00b6 13). Defendant MSO provides MMM with \"utilization management\" and quality assurance services, administers MMM's provider network, and reviews Plaintiff's determinations as to inpatient admission through a procedure known as \"utilization review.\" (Docket No. 1 at 2 \u00b6 5). Defendant Molina, an MCO that administers healthcare services for the Medicaid program in Puerto Rico, is another such insurance company. (Docket Nos. 1-4 \u00b6 7; 7 \u00b6 2). Plaintiff alleges that Defendants violated Law 5 because they denied payment for certain claims on the basis of clinical guidelines, even though those claims had medical recommendations based on medical need. (Docket No. 1-4 at 5-6 \u00b6\u00b6 22-26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

This is the case, Defendants aver, because Plaintiff's Law 5 claim turns on the question of whether utilization review consistent with clinical guidelines (and contrary to a determination of medical necessity) can be prohibited under Medicaid. (Docket No. 32 at 2). Defendants also contend that the issue is substantial because the ruling in this case will govern other cases where a plaintiff objects under Law 5 to an MCO's use of professional guidelines in making a reimbursement determination. (Docket No. 1 at 7 \u00b6 28). Finally, Defendants posit that the federal question is substantial here because \"the federal government has a strong national interest in ensuring that [MCOs] administering federal funds are able to review medical necessity decisions by providers using industry standard guidelines....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407443\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/251/#p258\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 6-7 \u00b626.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff counters that, unlike a true federal healthcare plan such as Medicare, the Medicaid program is a state healthcare plan that is partially funded by the federal government and as such, it gives states the authority to define the term \"medical necessity\" in relation to medical insurance coverage.

Here, the state's intent with respect to such determinations is explicitly laid out in Law 5's statement of purpose. Specifically, it notes that clinical guidelines are \"are merely support tools for making informed decisions based on medical need.\" (Docket No. 30-1 at 3).
