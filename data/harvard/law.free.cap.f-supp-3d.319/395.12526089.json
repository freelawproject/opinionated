INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Charles Horton is a former goalkeeper for Defendant D.C. United,\n   Washington, D.C.'s Major League Soccer (\"MLS\") team. Plaintiff alleges that his career came to an untimely end after a teammate, Fabian Espindola, assaulted him during a dispute that left him with a concussion and persistent, debilitating injuries. In this action, Plaintiff seeks to hold responsible D.C. United and his former head coach, Defendant Benjamin Olsen, for their negligence in supervising Espindola and for Espindola's tortious conduct under the theory of respondeat superior liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Now before the court is Defendants D.C. United and Olsen's Motion to Dismiss. Defendants advance two arguments. First, they assert that Plaintiff's claims are preempted by federal labor law because resolving Plaintiff's tort claims would require interpreting and applying the terms of a collective bargaining agreement (\"CBA\") between MLS and the players' union. Second, Defendants contend that Plaintiff's claims must be dismissed because the sole remedy available to him arises under the District of Columbia Workers' Compensation Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Because Defendants attach the CBA and other evidence to their Motion to Dismiss, the court converts their Motion into one for summary judgment and, for the reasons that follow, denies summary judgment at this early stage without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After a three-year stint with English soccer teams, Plaintiff Charles Horton, a goalkeeper, began his professional soccer career in the United States when he signed a contract with MLS in February 2016. First Am. Compl., ECF No. 14 [hereinafter Am. Compl.], \u00b6\u00b6 8-12. The District of Columbia's MLS team, Defendant D.C. United, acquired his rights.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. Defendant Benjamin Olsen is the head coach of D.C. United.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3, 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Six weeks after signing the contract, tragedy struck Plaintiff. On March 29, 2016, Plaintiff's teammate, Fabian Espindola, attacked Plaintiff in the team's training room.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13, 15-17. According to Plaintiff, following a video review session, Espindola began arguing with him about an \"on-field issue\" that had occurred two weeks earlier.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. Plaintiff told Espindola that he did not want to continue arguing and turned away, at which point Espindola \"viciously struck\" Plaintiff with his elbow, landing a blow on Plaintiff's left temple.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. Teammates and staff saw the incident and pulled Espindola away from Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Although Plaintiff immediately began experiencing symptoms associated with a concussion-including nausea, dizziness, shakiness, and sensitivity to light and sound-the team did not place him into MLS's concussion protocol, but instead allowed him to practice with the team that day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Later that same day, Plaintiff met with his coach, Defendant Benjamin Olsen, to talk about the incident.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. At that meeting, Olsen \"expressed to Mr. Horton\" that he knew \"Espindola had a history of violent conduct on and off the field.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. Olsen added that he had thought \"it was only a matter of time\" before Espindola acted violently toward a D.C. United teammate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Before attacking Plaintiff, Espindola had been repeatedly disciplined for violent acts, including a six-game suspension in 2014 for \"physically attacking a referee\" during a match, a two-game suspension in 2014 for \"violent conduct\" toward another player, and an ejection from a game in July 2015 for attempting to elbow an opposing player in the head.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. Plaintiff, however, knew nothing of Espindola's track record.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In the hours that followed the attack, Plaintiff's symptoms became more severe.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. He reported to practice the next day, on March 30, 2016, but he could not take the field.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   D.C. United's athletic trainer ordered Plaintiff not to train, and a team physician diagnosed Horton with a concussion, after which Horton entered the concussion protocol.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The concussion sidelined Plaintiff for weeks.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. During that time, he continued to grapple with symptoms ranging from memory loss to chronic headaches and lack of concentration, and he underwent a variety of neurological, neurophysiological, and ophthalmological exams and treatments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In May 2016, even though his concussion symptoms remained, Plaintiff was medically cleared to play.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. He was \"relegated temporarily to a lower-league team\" as he tried to recover, but, while training there, Plaintiff broke a finger-an injury that prevented him from continuing with D.C. United that season.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff never rejoined the team. He tried to reclaim his position in the 2017 season, but he \"was unable to regain\" the same level of play as before the attack by Espindola and the resulting concussion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27. At some point, Olsen and the D.C. United coaching staff told Plaintiff he \"would no longer be a member of the D.C. United club.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff then retired from professional soccer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff filed suit against Espindola, Olsen, D.C.

The First Amended Complaint alleged one count of negligent supervision against Olsen and D.C. United; negligent hiring and retention against MLS; and assault, battery, and intentional infliction of emotional distress against Espindola.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. Additionally, Plaintiff sought to hold MLS and D.C. United vicariously liable for Espindola's and Olsen's torts under the theory of respondeat superior liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20185\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20185\">\n    at 13-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In response to Plaintiff's amended pleading, Defendants Olsen, D.C. United, and MLS filed a joint Motion to Dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 17 [hereinafter Defs.' Mot.]. Defendants asserted two grounds for dismissal. First, they maintained that all of Plaintiff's claims are preempted by Section 301 of the LMRA, because his state law claims are \"substantially dependent upon analysis of the terms\" of the CBA between MLS and the MLS Players Union.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Allis-Chalmers Corp. v. Lueck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6199648\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/202/#p220\">\n    471 U.S. 202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 220,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6199648\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/202/#p220\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6199648\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/202/#p220\">\n    85 L.Ed.2d 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1985). Alternatively, Defendants insisted that Plaintiff's claims must be dismissed because the exclusive remedy for Plaintiff's injuries, which he \"sustained in the course of [his] employment,\" is under the District of Columbia Workers' Compensation Act (\"WCA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2032-1504\">\n    D.C. Code \u00a7 32-1504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mem. at 30-33. To support these arguments, Defendants attached to their Motion: (1) a copy of the current CBA; (2) a copy of the Standard Player Agreement (\"SPA\"), an exhibit to the CBA that outlines the terms of Plaintiff's employment with D.C. United; and (3) an Affidavit from William Ordower, the executive vice president and general counsel of MLS, attesting to the authenticity of the two agreements.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot., Attach. 2, Ex., ECF No. 17-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On the same day that Plaintiff filed his opposition to Defendants' Motion, he filed a Notice of Dismissal of his claims against Defendant MLS.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Notice of Dismissal, ECF No. 22. Thus, the instant motion now concerns only Defendants D.C. United and Olsen (\"Defendants\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Whether Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Should Be Converted into a Motion for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Although Defendants have styled their motion as a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, their motion attaches and relies heavily upon the CBA and SPA. The introduction of these records raises the threshold question of whether the court should evaluate Defendants' motion under Rule 8(a)'s pleading standard or Rule 56's summary judgment standard. Not surprisingly, Defendants wish to proceed under Rule 8(a), while Plaintiff insists the court apply Rule 56's more rigorous standard, particularly because he has not yet had the opportunity to take discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Rule 12(d) requires courts to treat a motion to dismiss brought under Rule 12(b)(6) as a motion for summary judgment when \"matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hurd v. District of Columbia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275847\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/864/671/#p686\">\n    864 F.3d 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 686-87 (D.C. Cir. 2017). Not all outside-the-pleadings evidence, however, requires conversion of a motion to dismiss. Under the incorporation-by-reference doctrine, a defendant can submit-and the court can consider-a document that \"is not attached by the plaintiff, but is referred to in the complaint and integral to the plaintiff's claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Banneker Ventures, LLC v. Graham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4332876,6772423\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/798/1119/\">\n    798 F.3d 1119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1133 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (cleaned up);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   5A Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller,\n   <em>\n    Federal Practice and Procedure\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1327 (3d ed. 2014). A document is \"integral\" to the complaint if it \"form[s] the basis for a claim or part of a claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Banneker Ventures\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4332876,6772423\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/798/1119/\">\n    798 F.3d at 1133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Carroll v. Yates\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9270163\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/362/984/#p986\">\n    362 F.3d 984\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 986 (7th Cir. 2004) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Here, Defendants offer two reasons to treat the CBA and SPA as incorporated into the complaint, but neither is convincing. First, they argue that the two contracts are incorporated because Plaintiff's Amended Complaint \"specifically mentions the SPA, and the CBA (of which it forms a part and incorporates by reference) is integral to Plaintiff's claims.\" Defs.' Mot., Mem. of Pts. &amp; Auths. in Supp., ECF No. 17-1 [hereinafter Defs.' Mem.], at 14 n.5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   But merely \"mention[ing]\" the SPA, and alluding to the CBA, does not make either contract an \"integral\" part of the pleading. The CBA or SPA must \"form\" the basis for one or more of Plaintiff's claims. Yet here neither agreement is relevant to any of Plaintiff's tort claims against Defendants D.C. United and Olsen. The SPA arguably might have formed the basis for Plaintiff's respondeat superior theory against MLS, but MLS is no longer a defendant. Thus, both the CBA and SPA are matters outside the pleading, requiring the court to convert Defendants' motion into one for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nakahata v. New York-Presbyterian Healthcare Sys., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064596\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/723/192/#p203\">\n    723 F.3d 192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 203 (2d Cir. 2013) (holding that the district court erred by failing to convert a motion to dismiss into one for summary judgment where the CBA was not attached to the plaintiff's complaint);\n   <em>\n    Freeman v.

Defs.' Mem. at 23-24. To illustrate the CBA's purported relevance, Defendants direct the court to Article 8 of that agreement, which describes the scope of an MLS player's obligations and duties, and Section 4 of the SPA, titled \"Player Obligations,\" which sets forth the mental and physical standards an MLS player is required to maintain.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23.

Defendants have offered no evidence to suggest how Espindola's conduct, as described by Plaintiff, could possibly fall outside his duties and responsibilities as a player. Indeed, it is hard to conceive why the fact question of Espindola's scope of employment will be \"substantially dependent\" on an analysis of the CBA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allis-Chalmers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6199648\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/202/#p220\">\n    471 U.S. at 220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6199648\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/202/#p220\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Defendants seem to concede as much, asserting, in the context of their WCA argument, that \"Plaintiff's claims arise out of injuries alleged to have been sustained\n   <em>\n    in the course of Plaintiff's employment\n   </em>\n   .\" Defs.' Mem. at 4 (emphasis added). Defendants do not attempt to reconcile the tension between their certainty that Plaintiff suffered his injuries \"in the course of [his] employment,\" with their position that resort to the CBA is necessary to determine whether Espindola was acting within the scope of his employment. Absent any reason to believe that the CBA will need to be consulted to determine whether Espindola was acting within the scope of his employment, the court cannot, at this stage, find Plaintiff's intentional tort claims to be preempted as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As to the negligent supervision claim, Defendants argue preemption on the ground that the court must look to the CBA to define the standard of care Defendants owed to Plaintiff and to determine whether that standard was breached.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-20. Both questions, Defendants maintain, implicate the CBA because that contract establishes rules as to the type of discipline available, when it may be imposed, and by whom (MLS or D.C. United).\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Defendants cite a host of non-binding authority to support their argument and so, too, does Plaintiff for the contrary position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Defendants' preemption defense regarding the negligent supervision claim presents a closer call, but ultimately fails for lack of factual support. Under District of Columbia law, when negligence is alleged to have occurred \"in a context which is within the realm of common knowledge and everyday experience,\" the plaintiff need not provide expert testimony to establish the applicable standard of care or prove the defendant's breach of it.\n   <em>\n    Beard v.

Here, it may be that the CBA provisions are essential to defining the standard of care and proving a breach. But, at this juncture, Defendants' assertion that the CBA is not merely relevant but controlling is a legal argument; it is not supported by any evidence, expert or otherwise. \"Because preemption cannot be readily discerned from the pleadings alone, it would be improper to resolve the question of preemption at this stage.\"\n   <em>\n    Freeman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4305814\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/87/249/#p259\">\n    87 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   259 ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nakahata\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064596\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/723/192/#p203\">\n    723 F.3d at 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"It is a defendant's responsibility to raise preemption by the CBA as a defense, but ... a motion addressed to the adequacy of the pleadings is\n   not necessarily the proper place for preemption to be decided.\").

First, although Defendants acknowledge that Plaintiff signed an employment agreement only with MLS, and not D.C. United, they contend that D.C. United is a \"joint\" employer because the CBA provides that: \"[f]or purposes of workers compensation\n   coverage, the parties\"-MLS and the players' union-\"acknowledge and agree that MLS and the Team that the Player has been assigned to are joint employers of that Player.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 28 (quoting the CBA). Phrased alternatively, Defendants would have this court conclude, as a matter of law, that D.C. United is Plaintiff's special employer, and thus enjoys the WCA's immunity, because the players' union and MLS entered into a contract stating as much. District of Columbia law is to the contrary, however. The D.C. Court of Appeals has stated that, \"[u]nder workers' compensation law, the companies' characterization of their temporary staffing arrangement cannot be allowed to override its reality.\"\n   <em>\n    Love\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8180307\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/954/1027/#p1032\">\n    954 A.2d at 1036\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In light of the court's denial of summary judgment to Defendants, there is no need\n   for the court to address Plaintiff's Rule 56(d) arguments as to his alleged need to conduct additional discovery.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    Citations are to the page numbers automatically generated by CM/ECF.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Plaintiff did not serve Espindola before the other three defendants removed the case to this court. Espindola is believed to be living outside the United States.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Joint LCvR 16.3 Report to the Court, ECF No. 11, at 1 n.1. In early March 2018, Plaintiff requested a summons for Espindola,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Request, ECF No. 27; Summons Issued Electronically, ECF No. 28, but service appears not to have been accomplished.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Defendants accurately characterize the complaint as only \"mentioning\" the CBA and SPA. The SPA is the only contract referenced in the Amended Complaint, and it appears in paragraph 14, which states in full:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n    The employment contract Mr. Horton signed with MLS expired on December 31, 2016. Under this employment contract, MLS had the unilateral discretion at the end of the contract period to extend Mr. Horton's playing services for an additional twelve months or conversely refuse Mr. Horton's future services. MLS had this discretion for the 2017, 2018, and 2019 seasons pursuant to their employment of Mr. Horton. MLS was at all relevant times solely responsible for paying Mr. Horton's compensation and benefits and negotiating any and all details of his employment.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    Am.
