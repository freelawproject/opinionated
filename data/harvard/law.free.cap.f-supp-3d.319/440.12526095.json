The Amended Complaint contains broad allegations of race-based discrimination, Am. Compl. 8-10, but the record is nearly devoid of supporting evidence. The manager with whom Mr. Muhammad most frequently clashed-Patrick Elam-is himself African American. ECF No. 16-2 at 9. Mr. Elam showed evidence of anti-immigrant bias, but not racial bias. And Jordan Worley,\n   another African-American, used a racial slur against Mr. Muhammad in a dispute that resulted in a suspension for Mr. Muhammad, but Mr. Worley was ultimately suspended (albeit for subsequent, related misconduct) and he was not Mr. Muhammad's supervisor. No other race-based allegations appear in the record. I conclude that no reasonable jury could find that WMATA or its employees intentionally discriminated against Mr. Muhammad on the basis of race.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Meanwhile, at least two genuine issues of material fact preclude summary judgment on the national origin discrimination claim. First, a reasonable jury could conclude that Mr. Elam harbored animus against people from other countries, ECF Nos. 15-2 at 9, 16-4 at 3, and that he therefore only told Mr. Muhammad about a promotion test four days before the relevant date, causing him to earn a score below eligibility levels.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, a reasonable jury could conclude that the suspension Mr. Muhammad received for his altercation with Mr. Worley was caused by Mr. Elam's national origin discrimination. Mr. Elam was the supervisor who observed the incident, and Mr. Muhammad received a three-day suspension, while Mr. Worley allegedly received no suspension at all for the altercation, and only a five-day suspension for gathering associates that evening to intimidate and threaten Mr. Muhammad as he left work.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 16-5 at 33 (testimony indicating that Mr. Worley's suspension was only for the second altercation)\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 16-12 (investigation report giving a five-day suspension for \"involvement in the workplace violence [rule] violation\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   It also violates Title VII for an employer to create a \"hostile work environment,\" subjecting an employee to \" 'discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult' that is 'sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment.' \"\n   <em>\n    Baloch v.

For Mr. Muhammad's hostile work environment claim, a reasonable jury could look to several parts of the record, or the whole record, to conclude that Mr. Muhammad met his burden. A reasonable jury could particularly rely on the evidence of Mr. Elam's offensive comments about foreigners, his refusal to give Mr. Muhammad a performance evaluation for an entire year, Mr. Muhammad's intimidation by Mr. Worley's gang in the parking lot, Mr. Elam's role in the resulting suspension decisions, and the allegation the Mr. Elam made it hard for Mr. Muhammad to be promoted, particularly in the April 2018 test date incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Finally, at least one genuine dispute over a material fact precludes summary judgment on the retaliation claim. \"To prove unlawful retaliation, a plaintiff must show: (1) that he opposed a practice made unlawful by Title VII; (2) that the employer took a materially adverse\n   action against him; and (3) that the employer took the action 'because' the employee opposed the practice.\"\n   <em>\n    McGrath\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6051474,3769301\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/666/1377/\">\n    666 F.3d at 1380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

A reasonable jury could conclude that Mr. Muhammad's May 12, 2016 letter to Mr. Williams-which alleged Title VII discrimination, ECF No. 16-10-was known to Mr. Elam shortly thereafter, since Mr. Williams testified that he responded to the letter by having \"a conversation with Mr. Elam.\" ECF No. 16-6 at 16-17.
