This case is before the court on the D.C. Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, ECF No. 11, and the Federal Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, ECF No. 22. The D.C. Defendants assert that no claim has been stated because they lack authority over such matters. The Federal Defendants assert several grounds for dismissal, including sovereign immunity.

BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff was on supervised release from a sentence imposed by the Superior Court of the District of Columbia when, on October 13, 2014, he was indicted in Maryland state court for armed carjacking and related crimes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1, at 1-3. Shortly thereafter, on October 22, 2014, the U.S. Parole Commission \"issued and lodged as a detainer a warrant against [Plaintiff] for violation of the release conditions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On August 21, 2015, Plaintiff pleaded guilty to robbery in the Circuit Court for Prince George's County, Maryland,\n   and was subsequently sentenced \"to a [prison] term of 10 years with all but 4 years to be suspended, with 5 years of probation to follow upon his release.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Fed.

Compl. at 2. In October 2015, Plaintiff allegedly requested \"that the U.S. Parole Commission conduct a revocation hearing for which the parole violator warrant was issued and lodged as a detainer,\" and in September 2016, he requested \"a dispositional interview\" with regard to the warrant.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff was released from Maryland's custody on June 19, 2017, and the Commission's warrant was executed on June 21, 2017, resulting in Plaintiff's transfer to the District of Columbia jail.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. at 3; Fed.

Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 14, at 2, where he received a parole revocation hearing on August 22, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. Defs.' Reply, ECF No. 29, Ex. 1 (Notice of Action), ECF No. 29-1. Following the hearing, the Commission, citing the Maryland conviction, revoked Plaintiff's D.C. supervised release term and ordered him to \"serve a new term of imprisonment of 9 month(s) from June 21 2017, the date the warrant was executed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Commission noted that with that new term and \"a credit of 32 month(s) ... for time served,\" Plaintiff would serve \"41 months toward [his] guidelines of 60-72 months.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Commission explained that it was imposing a sentence \"below the guidelines ... because the maximum authorized term of imprisonment limit[ed] the time [he] [would] serve to less than the bottom of the guideline range.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In other words, the remaining time left on Plaintiff's D.C. sentence, i.e., nine months, was less than the low end of the guideline range for the supervised release revocation, resulting in a less-than-guideline-range sentence. The Commission did not impose \"an additional term of supervised release as part of [the] revocation decision,\" but noted that once released from his D.C. sentence Plaintiff would have \"a new 5 year term of supervised release as imposed by the Circuit Court\" in Maryland.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The National Appeals Board affirmed the Commission's decision on November 13, 2017. Fed. Defs.' Reply, Ex. 2, ECF No. 29-2. On appeal, Plaintiff asserted, among other things, that the Commission had violated his due process rights by delaying his revocation hearing until after the end of his Maryland sentence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Board rejected that contention, explaining that the Commission \"is not required to begin the revocation procedure until [its] warrant has been executed,\" and that, in Plaintiff's case, the \"revocation hearing was held within 90 days of the warrant's execution as required by Commission rules.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
