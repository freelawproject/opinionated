YOUNG, JUDGE, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   This case stems from a warrantless search of an automobile. On June 13, 2017, law enforcement officers pulled over a vehicle in which Defendant was a passenger to arrest him on an outstanding warrant for violating his parole. The officers then searched the vehicle and found two firearms near where Defendant was seated. Because the government has not carried its burden of showing that an exception to the general warrant requirement applies, the search violated Defendant's Fourth Amendment rights. Accordingly, Defendant's motion to suppress will be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Facts\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On Friday, March 10, 2017, Katie Hawkins and Breea Galiher traveled from Illinois to Evansville, Indiana to meet up with Defendant and spend the evening gambling at a local casino. However, their luck ran out by the end of the night: Galiher got a flat tire that prevented them from returning home. They could not change the tire because the rim had a locking lug nut, and Galiher left the key back in Illinois. They ended up staying the rest of Friday and Saturday at Defendant's house, though Defendant apparently stayed elsewhere.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On Sunday, they returned to the casino with Defendant and gambled overnight. On Monday morning, Defendant and Galiher left the casino in a white Nissan Pathfinder to find a can of Fix-A-Flat, hoping to repair Galiher's flat tire. The Pathfinder was owned by Jessica Jackson, who was the mother of Defendant's child, but she frequently let Defendant use it. They first stopped at Defendant's residence, where he was confronted by Jackson, who was upset because he was with another woman. After the two had an argument, Defendant left with Galiher to resume their mission of finding a solution to the flat tire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   However, they did not get very far. Shortly after they left the house, officers with the Evansville Police Department (\"EPD\") pulled them over.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Before they came to a complete stop, Defendant attempted to hand Galiher a gun to hide. She rejected his request. Once stopped, Galiher and Defendant exited the vehicle. Galiher told the officers Defendant had attempted to hand her a gun, and it was still in the\n   vehicle. The officers searched the vehicle but did not find anything. They subsequently released Defendant and Galiher without making an arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Jackson arrived to the scene of the traffic stop to get her vehicle, and then drove Galiher back to the casino to pick up Hawkins. The three of them subsequently returned to Defendant's house. Meanwhile, an unidentified woman picked up Defendant from the traffic stop, and the two of them went to a nearby restaurant. At some point later in the morning, the unidentified woman dropped Defendant off at his house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   To briefly reset the scene: it is late Monday morning, and Defendant, Galiher, Hawkins, and Jackson are now at Defendant's house. Realizing that Hawkins and Galiher needed to get back to Illinois, Jackson permitted them to use her vehicle. Defendant also joined because he needed a ride to a nearby house, and Hawkins said she could drop him off on the way. The three of them exited the house and entered the Pathfinder: Hawkins as the driver, Galiher as the front-seat passenger, and Defendant as the rear-seat passenger. Hawkins then drove away from the residence. Unbeknownst to them, at this time, Task Force Officers from the United States Marshal's Fugitive Task Force were surveilling the residence because Defendant had an outstanding warrant based on a parole violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Hawkins only made it a few blocks before the officers conducted a traffic stop. Task Force Officer Brian Bishop initiated the stop. He was joined by Troopers Michael Finney and Justin Bean of the Indiana State Police, Detective Sergeant Kurt Althoff of the Vanderburgh County Sheriff's Office, Deputy U.S. Marshal Chris Baldelli, and Deputy U.S. Marshal Jon Albright. Trooper Finney testified that this stop was a felony stop, which is a tactical stop officers use when there is a higher potential of risk to officer safety. In such a scenario, the officers position their vehicles in a manner where, if needed, they can be used as cover. With their firearms drawn,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the officers ordered Hawkins, Galiher, and Defendant out of the vehicle. All three were detained without incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Trooper Finney and Officer Bishop began searching the vehicle immediately. Trooper Finney testified that he did not speak to any of the occupants of the vehicle before conducting the search, and he had not been briefed by any other officer. Ultimately, Trooper Finney found two firearms located in a compartment under the middle seat, in the rear of the vehicle. At that point, the officers contacted Task Force Officers Joshua Patterson, who is a narcotics detective for Vanderburgh County Sheriff's Office, and Douglas Francis, who is an Indiana State Trooper assigned to assist ATF, to come to the scene and further investigate. TFO Patterson arrived to the scene and began taking photographs and collecting evidence. TFO Francis arrived and interviewed Galiher and Hawkins. TFO Francis then drove to the Vanderburgh County Sheriff Department's Command Post, where Defendant had been transported, and interviewed Defendant. During the interview, Defendant admitted to possessing the two firearms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedure\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On June 29, 2017, Defendant was indicted on one count of unlawful possession of a firearm. (Filing No. 1). On August 23,\n   2017, he filed his first motion to suppress. (Filing No. 19). The government responded on August 31, 2017, and on October 17, 2017, the court conducted a suppression hearing. (Filing Nos. 20 and 25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At the suppression hearing, Sergeant Althoff testified for the government.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   With respect to the timing of the search of the vehicle, Sergeant Althoff testified that the officers talked to Hawkins and Galiher\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the officers searched the vehicle. (Suppression Hr'g Tr. at 20:9-13). The following exchange took place between the government and Sergeant Althoff:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Q: When you spoke to [Hawkins and Galiher], were they-were they willing to speak with you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   A: They were. They were cooperative.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Q: And what did you learn when you spoke to them?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   A: Well, we asked them what was going on during the stop because as I mentioned before, I was in the very back but we had radio contact with everybody, and they were saying that [Defendant] was moving all around in the back seat. So we kind of talked to them about that, what was going on; and as I mentioned, the girls were very cooperative. They said that during the stop, Mr. Reed was trying to have them stash items or hide items.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30:2-12). The \"items,\" Sergeant Althoff explained, were two methamphetamine pipes, a bag of marijuana, and a handgun. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30:16-25). Sergeant Althoff reiterated that the search occurred after the conversation with Hawkins and Galiher:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Q: When you learned this information from these two passengers, had a search of the vehicle been conducted yet?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   A: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31:7-9). Based on Sergeant Althoff's testimony, the court denied Defendant's motion to suppress. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Filing No. 28, Order Denying Motion to Suppress). The court found that the officers had probable cause to search the vehicle:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Officer Althoff testified that Defendant's parole agent advised officers, prior to the arrest, that Defendant was known to carry firearms. After talking with Hawkins and Galiher, the officers were aware that Defendant had attempted to conceal methamphetamine pipes and marijuana, both of which were found, and also a firearm, which had not yet been located. The officers were mindful too of Defendant's suspicious movements while the vehicle was being pulled over. Armed with all of this knowledge, the officers had enough information to believe that a firearm would be found in the vehicle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   With his motion to suppress denied and having failed to reach a plea agreement with the government, on March 12, 2018, Defendant proceeded to trial. After testimony from three of the government's witnesses (Hawkins, Jackson, and Galiher), Defendant renewed his motion to suppress. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Filing No. 57, Transcript of Jury Trial-Day 1 (\"Day 1 Tr.\") at 219-222). The court took the motion under advisement and proceeded with evidence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 222). For reasons not important here, the trial ultimately ended in a mistrial. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Filing No. 47).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On March 29, 2018, Defendant filed a second motion to suppress-the present\n   motion before the court. (Filing No. 52). On April 4, 2018, the government responded. (Filing No. 54).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Before going forward, the court must first address a procedural hurdle: the consideration of a second motion to suppress having already denied Defendant's first one. With this out of the way, the court then turns to the parties' arguments on the legality of the search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The court can consider the second motion to suppress\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Ordinarily, a court should not reconsider issues already decided earlier in the litigation.\n   <em>\n    In re Mathias\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275388\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/727/#p730\">\n    867 F.3d 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 730 (7th Cir. 2017) ;\n   <em>\n    Entek GRB, LLC v.

(\"Law of the case doctrine permits a court to decline the invitation to reconsider issues already resolved earlier in the life of a litigation.\"). However, an exception lies where there has been a change in circumstances-such as where the testimony at trial differs significantly from the testimony at a suppression hearing.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Montos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2156283\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/421/215/#p220\">\n    421 F.2d 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 220 (5th Cir. 1970) (citations omitted) (\"If new facts come to light at trial, the trial judge in the exercise of his discretion may consider anew the suppression issue.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The trial testimony casts doubt on Sergeant Althoff's testimony at the suppression hearing. While Sergeant Althoff testified that the search occurred after officers talked with Hawkins and Galiher, other witnesses testified that the search occurred immediately. Trooper Finney, the officer who searched the vehicle and found the firearms, testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Q: Once individuals were removed from the vehicle, was a search of the vehicle then conducted shortly thereafter?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   A: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Q: You approached the car-a group of officers approached the car, stopped it with guns drawn, ordered the passengers out?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   A: That's the short version.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Q: And then did you immediately start to search the car?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   A: After all the occupants were safely removed from the vehicle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   (Day 1 Tr. at 226:14-16; 230:16-19; 231:1-3). Trooper Bean's and Galiher's testimony also discredits Sergeant Althoff's version. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 244:5-7) (\"Q: [Trooper Bean] When did you learn that the firearms had been located? A: Pretty much immediately after all the subjects were out of the vehicle.\"); (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 215:2-9) (Galiher testifying that she thinks the car was searched right away).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Sergeant Althoff also testified that Galiher and Hawkins informed officers about items Defendant had sought to hide\n   <em>\n    prior to\n   </em>\n   the search of the vehicle. (Suppression Hr'g Tr. at 31:7-9; 33:10-12). He testified that an inventory search needed to be done prior to towing the vehicle because the registered owner was not there. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 33:19-21). However, Sergeant Althoff's testimony directly conflicts with Trooper Finney's testimony:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Q: And you didn't speak to either Breea Galiher or Katie Hawkins before you conducted your search?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   A: I didn't speak to any of the occupants of the vehicle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Q: Did anybody tell you anything that Breea Galiher had said or that Katie Hawkins had said before you started your search?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   A: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Q: Did this search have anything to do with an inventory preparatory to towing the vehicle?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   A: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   Q: Nobody told you anything anybody else had said or done that led you to conduct that search?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   A: We had information that this was-the subject may be armed and there was a higher potential of a gun present. And so when we had everybody out of the vehicle and there was no weapon found on anyone, that's what we had in our mind is we were looking for weapons.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   (Day 1 Tr. at 234:22-25; 235:1-5; 236:23-25; 237:1-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   That is not to say Sergeant Althoff was not telling the truth. However, in light of the testimony presented at trial, Sergeant Althoff's testimony is simply not credible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the court finds that the testimony elicited at trial constitutes a change in circumstances, and therefore, it is proper to reconsider the suppression issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arizona v.

Trooper Finney testified that he did not talk to either Galiher or Hawkins before searching the vehicle. (Day 1 Tr. at 234:22-24). Hawkins and Galiher both testified that they did not know anything about methamphetamine located in the vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 172:14-16; 214:3-7). Hawkins turned over the methamphetamine pipe and marijuana within 15 minutes of talking with officers-not immediately. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 173:8-15). Moreover, Galiher told law enforcement about Defendant handing her a firearm during\n   <em>\n    the first traffic stop\n   </em>\n   -when the vehicle was searched by EPD and nothing was located-not during\n   <em>\n    the second traffic stop\n   </em>\n   -when the firearms were actually found by the task force officers.

True, the list is not exhaustive, but the officers did not articulate another reason to tow the vehicle. Moreover, the Towing Policy requires officers to document the contents of the vehicle. There is no evidence of any completed forms or that an inventory was actually done.

First, the government's inevitable discovery argument is underdeveloped and conclusory, and so it is waived.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Puffer v. Allstate Ins.

It only argues that a lawful inventory search would have occurred, but for reasons already explained, the officers did not conduct a lawful inventory search. It might be hypothesized that the contraband produced by Hawkins within 15 minutes of the search was the missing ingredient to the officers' recipe of probable cause, but the government does not make that argument, and such an argument would require the court to infer that Trooper Bean would have talked with Trooper Finney, or that the search could be saved by the officers' collective knowledge. The court is not required to speculate as to what would have naturally followed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Accordingly, the government has failed to carry its burden of showing that the doctrine of inevitable discovery applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   One final housekeeping matter: the government asserted in response to the first motion to suppress that Defendant lacked standing\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   to challenge the search. However,\n   at the suppression hearing, the government retreated, stating that if the court found Defendant's testimony reliable-that Jackson permitted Defendant to use the vehicle-then he would have standing to pursue his claim. (Suppression Hrg. Tr. at 46:10-15). The court found Defendant credible as there was no competing evidence and accordingly, Defendant could assert a Fourth Amendment claim. (Filing No. 28, Entry on Motion to Suppress, at 4-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The testimony at trial showed Defendant was authorized to use the vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Day 1 Tr. at 183:18-19) (Jackson testifying she and Defendant primarily used the vehicle). The government has not argued standing in its response to Defendant's second motion to suppress, and so the court has not further considered the merits, if any, of such a challenge.

Virginia\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611993\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1663/#p1672\">\n    138 S.Ct. 1663\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1672-73,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611993\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1663/#p1672\">\n    201 L.Ed.2d 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018). Here, the search of the vehicle was conducted without a warrant, probable cause, or adherence to standardized inventory procedures. While the cost of suppressing evidence of guilt is great, the cost of permitting unreasonable searches is greater. Since the search was conducted in violation of Defendant's Fourth Amendment rights, the firearms must be suppressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Accordingly, Defendant's second motion to suppress (Filing No. 52) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   this 4th day of June 2018.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    The facts are taken from trial testimony.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    The motivation for the traffic stop is not quite clear, but Galiher testified that the police were investigating the earlier argument between Defendant and Jackson.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    Trooper Finney testified that during a felony stop, it is common for officers to have their guns drawn.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    Technically, Defendant called Sergeant Althoff, and he was listed as \"Defendant's witness.\" (Filing No. 59, Transcript of Suppression Hearing (\"Suppression Hr'g Tr.\") at 13:22-23; 14:1-2). However, \"a law enforcement officer is considered a government witness\" at a suppression hearing. Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(h).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    The court notes that Sergeant Althoff did not testify at trial, and thus, could not explain some of these inconsistencies.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    The government has not argued, and so, the court has not considered whether the \"collective knowledge\" doctrine applies.\n    <em>\n     Williams\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4072609\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/627/247/#p251\">\n     627 F.3d at 252-253\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The court does note that in order for the doctrine to apply, the officer providing the information-in this case, the parole officer-must have facts supporting the suspicion-in this case, that Defendant was carrying a firearm.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4072609\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/627/247/#p251\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4072609\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/627/247/#p251\">\n     at 252\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . There was no testimony by any parole officer, and the officers only testified that \"they had received information.\" (Day 1 Tr. at 236:25, 237:1-4; 238:21-23). Perhaps this is enough, or perhaps not. Since the government has not pressed the collective knowledge doctrine, the court does not need to decide this issue.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    This might prompt the question of whether Defendant can even assert that his Fourth Amendment rights were violated since he neither owned nor drove the vehicle.
