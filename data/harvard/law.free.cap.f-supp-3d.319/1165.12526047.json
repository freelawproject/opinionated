Communications to produce contact information when it was initially requested is not warranted. First, O.C. Communications could have reasonably believed that it was under no obligation to produce the potential collective members' contact information, given the numerous district court opinions that state that position as the law. Second, the fact that the plaintiffs' attorneys did not receive the potential collective members' contact information until August or September 2017 was at least partly their fault. Even though the lawsuit was filed in January 2017, the plaintiffs' attorneys waited until May 2017 to request this information from the defendants. And instead of pressing O.C. Communications to quickly produce the material and, once it became clear that O.C. Communications would not produce this material, promptly bringing the disagreement to the Court's attention, the plaintiffs' lawyers did not raise the matter with the Court until the conditional certification motion, which was calendared for August 31, 2017. (The conditional certification motion was granted on the same day as the hearing.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Dkt. Nos. 125, 127.) Further, the hearing on the\n     motion for conditional certification could have taken place much sooner, but the plaintiffs signed on to a joint request to continue it.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-15\">\n      Going forward, this Court will impose a process in FLSA cases which makes clear that defendants are almost always required to provide the contact information of potential collective members by the time the initial case management conference has taken place. This process is now set forth in this Court's standing order for civil cases. Therefore, at least in cases before this Court, refusal by a future FLSA defendant to promptly produce contact information (subject, of course, to an appropriate protective order) will indeed be a basis for equitable tolling. But because this has not been clear until now, and because the named plaintiffs did not diligently pursue an order compelling production of the contact information or conditional certification, the request for equitable tolling is denied.\n     </p>\n    </div>\n   </opinion>\n  </casebody>\n </body>\n</html>\n"
